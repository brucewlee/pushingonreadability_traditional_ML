"My dear mother--I have kept you posted as far as Tuesday week last, and, although my letter will not have reached you yet, I will begin another before my news accumulates too much. I am glad you show my letters round in the family, for I like them all to know what I am doing, and I can't write to every one, though I try to answer all reasonable expectations. But there are a great many unreasonable ones, as I suppose you know--not yours, dear mother, for I am bound to say that you never required of me more than was natural. You see you are reaping your reward: I write to you before I write to any one else. There is one thing, I hope--that you don't show any of my letters to William Platt. If he wants to see any of my letters, he knows the right way to go to work. ",0
"I told you in my last about my farewell to England, my crossing the Channel, and my first impressions of Paris. I have thought a great deal about that lovely England since I left it, and all the famous historic scenes I visited; but I have come to the conclusion that it is not a country in which I should care to reside. The position of woman does not seem to me at all satisfactory, and that is a point, you know, on which I feel very strongly. It seems to me that in England they play a very faded-out part, and those with whom I conversed had a kind of depressed and humiliated tone; a little dull, tame look, as if they were used to being snubbed and bullied, which made me want to give them a good shaking. There are a great many people--and a great many things, too--over here that I should like to perform that operation upon.",0
"I gave you my first impressions of Paris, which quite came up to my expectations, much as I had heard and read about it. The objects of interest are extremely numerous, and the climate is remarkably cheerful and sunny. I should say the position of woman here was considerably higher, though by no means coming up to the American standard. The manners of the people are in some respects extremely peculiar, and I feel at last that I am indeed in FOREIGN PARTS. It is, however, a truly elegant city (very superior to New York), and I have spent a great deal of time in visiting the various monuments and palaces. I won't give you an account of all my wanderings, though I have been most indefatigable; for I am keeping, as I told you before, a most EXHAUSTIVE journal, which I will allow you the PRIVILEGE of reading on my return to Bangor. ",0
"I have received a great deal of politeness--some of it really most pressing, and I have experienced no drawbacks whatever. I have made a great many pleasant acquaintances in travelling round (both ladies and gentlemen), and had a great many most interesting talks. I have collected a great deal of information, for which I refer you to my journal. I assure you my journal is going to be a splendid thing. I do just exactly as I do in Bangor, and I find I do perfectly right; and at any rate, I don't care if I don't. I didn't come to Europe to lead a merely conventional life; I could do that at Bangor. You know I never WOULD do it at Bangor, so it isn't likely I am going to make myself miserable over here. So long as I accomplish what I desire, and make my money hold out, I shall regard the thing as a success.",0
"You have heard me speak of my cousine de Maisonrouge, that grande belle femme, who, after having married, en secondes noces--there had been, to tell the truth, some irregularity about her first union--a venerable relic of the old noblesse of Poitou, was left, by the death of her husband, complicated by the indulgence of expensive tastes on an income of 17,000 francs, on the pavement of Paris, with two little demons of daughters to bring up in the path of virtue. She managed to bring them up; my little cousins are rigidly virtuous. If you ask me how she managed it, I can't tell you; it's no business of mine, and, a fortiori none of yours. She is now fifty years old (she confesses to thirty-seven), and her daughters, whom she has never been able to marry, are respectively twenty-seven and twenty-three (they confess to twenty and to seventeen).",0
"Without going into a deep, psychological discussion of the elements in men's souls that breed events, we may say with truth that the Lazy A ranch was as other ranches in the smooth tenor of its life until one day in June, when the finger of fate wrote bold and black across the face of it the word that blotted out prosperity, content, warm family ties,--all those things that go to make life worth while. Jean, sixteen and a range girl to the last fiber of her being, had gotten up early that morning and had washed the dishes and swept, and had shaken the rugs of the little living-room most vigorously. On her knees, with stiff brush and much soapy water, she had scrubbed the kitchen floor until the boards dried white as kitchen floors may be. ",0
"At noon the hens were hovering their chickens in the shade of the mower which Lite was overhauling during his spare time, getting it ready for the hay that was growing apace out there in the broad mouth of the coulee. The rooster was wallowing luxuriously in a dusty spot in the corral. The young colt lay stretched out on the fat of its side in the sun, sound asleep. The sorrel mare lay beside it, asleep also, with her head thrown up against her shoulder. Somewhere in a shed a calf was bawling in bored lonesomeness away from its mother feeding down the pasture. And over all the coulee and the buildings nestled against the bluff at its upper end was spread that atmosphere of homey comfort and sheltered calm which surrounds always a home that is happy. Lite Avery, riding toward home just when the shadows were beginning to grow long behind him, wondered if Jean would be back by the time he reached the ranch. ",0
"He was in no great hurry, after all; he had merely been bored with Jim's company and wanted to go on alone. And then he could get the fire started for Jean. Lite's life was running very smoothly indeed; so smoothly that his thoughts occupied themselves largely with little things, save when they concerned themselves with Jean, who had been away to school for a year and had graduated from high, as she called it, just a couple of weeks ago, and had come home to keep house for dad and Lite. The novelty of her presence on the ranch was still fresh enough to fill his thoughts with her slim attractiveness. Town hadn't spoiled her, he thought glowingly. She was the same good little pal,--only she was growing up pretty fast, now. She was a young lady already.",0
"He was not a nervous person,--you would have laughed at the idea of nerves in connection with Lite Avery. He felt that something was wrong, just the same. It was not altogether the hurried departure of Aleck Douglas, either, that made him feel so. He looked at the house setting back there close to the bluff just where it began to curve rudely out from the narrowest part of the coulee. It was still and quiet, with closed windows and doors to tell there was no one at home. And yet, to Lite its very silence seemed sinister. He reached back and loosened it in the holster before he started up the sandy path to the house; and if you knew the Lazy A ranch as well as Lite knew it, from six years of calling it home, you would wonder at that action of his, which was instinctive and wholly unconscious.",0
"Suicide it could scarcely be, for Crofty was the type of man who would cling to life; besides, his gun was in its holster, and a man would hardly have the strength or the desire to put away his gun after he has shot himself under one eye. Death had undoubtedly been immediate. Lite thought of these things while he stood there just inside the door. Then he turned slowly and went outside, and stood hesitating upon the porch. He did not quite know what he ought to do about it, and so he did not mean to be in too great a hurry to do anything; that was Lite's habit, and he had always found that it served him well. If the rider had been fleeing from his crime, as was likely, Lite had no mind to raise at once the hue and cry. ",0
"A new report published today by the Digital Citizens Alliance, a consumer watchdog group, details how Facebook pages, Instagram accounts and YouTube videos are promoting drug sales, in some instances to thousands of followers or viewers. The Digital Citizens Alliance, researchers and other advocacy groups have warned the tech companies of such sales for several years, and they say the persistent appearance of such posts raises questions about how serious tech companies are about cracking down on apparent criminal activity. If we can find it, they can find it. That begs the question how hard they're looking, Digital Citizens Alliance Executive Director Tom Galvin said in an interview. Law enforcement has said it would be fraudulent for individuals to sell vaccines, which are being distributed in authorized medical centers â€“ and the report's authors raised concerns that potentially fake vaccines or test kits could give people a false sense of security about their protection from the virus. Facebook, Twitter, Google and others have been particularly aggressive.",1
"Facebook invests in removing drug-related content. A recent company transparency report found that as of December, its A.I. systems proactively identified 96 percent of drug-related posts that people reported on the platform. That's up about two percentage points from the previous quarter, and could let the company more quickly remove or limit drug sales on the platform. Yet Feinberg also raised concerns about how social networks' algorithms pushed drug-related content directly to him. Once he began following and searching for hashtags related to opioids, Instagram began to recommend he follow accounts such as Oxycodone626 and Xanax Raw that were apparently selling drugs. Accounts selling drugs also began following him in large numbers. He told me he now has 160 accounts pushing drug sales on Instagram following him, including some with more than 1,000 followers. I'm not searching it, it's searching me, Feinberg said. The findings come as Washington lawmakers increasingly weigh how to rein in social media giants.",1
"Earlier this year, Democrats including Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) introduced the Safe Tech Act, which would make it easier for Web users to seek court orders and file lawsuits if posts, photos and videos â€” and the tech industryâ€™s failure to address them â€” threaten them personally with abuse, discrimination, harassment, the loss of life or harms, as my colleague Tony Romm has reported. There's a broader debate in Washington about whether it's time to overhaul Section 230, a decades-old legal shield that protects social networks from lawsuits over content on their site. Feinberg says he thinks the law needs to be updated so that companies face greater pressure to address illegal content. Galvin said for three years, the DCA has been calling the large tech companies to work together to root out accounts selling drugs online, because it's apparent that some of the actors are working across multiple platforms.",1
"A year after Italy became the first European country to impose a national lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus, the nation has fallen eerily quiet once again, with new restrictions imposed on Monday in an effort to stop a third wave of infections that is threatening to wash over Europe and overwhelm its halting mass inoculation program. As he explained the measures on Friday, Prime Minister Mario Draghi warned that Italy was facing a new wave of contagion, driven by more infectious variants of the coronavirus. Just as before, Italy was not alone. We have clear signs: The third wave in Germany has already begun, Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute for Infectious Diseases, said during a news conference on Friday. Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary predicted that this week would be the most difficult since the start of the pandemic in terms of allocating hospital beds and breathing machines, as well as mobilizing nurses and doctors.

"Across Europe, cases are spiking. Supply shortages and vaccine skepticism, as well as bureaucracy and logistical obstacles, have slowed the pace of inoculations. Governments are putting exhausted populations under lockdown. Street protests are turning violent. A year after the virus began spreading in Europe, things feel unnervingly the same. In Rome, the empty streets, closed schools, shuttered restaurants and canceled Easter holidays came as a relief to some residents after months of climbing infections, choked hospitals and deaths. Itâ€™s a liberation to return to lockdown, because for months, after everything that happened, people of every age were going out acting like there was no problem, said Annarita Santini, 57, as she rode her bike in front of the Trevi Fountain, a popular site that had no visitors except for three police officers. At least like this, she added, the air can be cleared and people will be scared again.",1
"The notion of Ms. Markleâ€™s interest in politics is not new. Last year, a friend of the Duchess told Vanity Fair magazine that one of the reasons she did not give up her American citizenship when she married into the Royal Family was to allow her to keep open the option of entering Washington politics, The Mail said. The Mail pointed out that the royal couple have not hidden their political beliefs and leveled a thinly veiled attack on Donald Trump by urging voters to reject hate speech during the 2020 presidential election. The news organization also cited an unnamed source claiming that The Blairite, internationalist and Democratic party networks are buzzing with talk about Meghanâ€˜s political ambitions and potential backers. Could the U.S. one day have a duchess for president? A report from a British news organization published Sunday suggests that Meghan Markle, wife of Prince Harry and Duchess of Sussex, is mulling a run for U.S. president. She may have launched her effort already.",1
"On January 15, in its last days, President Donald Trumpâ€™s State Department put out a statement with serious claims about the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. The statement said the U.S. intelligence community had evidence that several researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology laboratory were sick with Covid-like symptoms in autumn 2019â€”implying the Chinese government had hidden crucial information about the outbreak for monthsâ€”and that the WIV lab, despite presenting itself as a civilian institution, was conducting secret research projects with the Chinese military. The State Department alleged a Chinese government cover-up and asserted that Beijing continues today to withhold vital information that scientists need to protect the world from this deadly virus, and the next one. The exact origin of the new coronavirus remains a mystery to this day, but the search for answers is not just about assigning blame. ",1
"The original Chinese government story, that the pandemic spread from a seafood market in Wuhan, was the first and therefore most widely accepted theory. But cracks in that theory slowly emerged throughout the late winter and spring of 2020. The first known case of Covid-19 in Wuhan, it was revealed in February, had no connection to the market. The Chinese government closed the market in January and sanitized it before proper samples could be taken. It wouldnâ€™t be until May that the Chinese Centers for Disease Control disavowed the market theory, admitting it had no idea how the outbreak began, but by then it had become the story of record, in China and internationally. In the spring of 2020, inside the U.S. government, some officials began to see and collect evidence of a different, perhaps more troubling theoryâ€”that the outbreak had a connection to one of the laboratories in Wuhan, among them the WIV, a world leading center of research on bat coronaviruses.",1
"When I published the warnings from these cables in April 2020, they added fuel to a debate that had already gone from a scientific and forensic question to a hot-button political issue, as the previously internal U.S. government debate over the labâ€™s possible connection spilled into public view. The next day, Trump said he was investigating, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on Beijing to come clean about the origin of the outbreak. Two weeks later, Pompeo said there was enormous evidence pointing to the lab, but he didnâ€™t provide any of said evidence. As Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping's relationship unraveled and administration officials openly blamed the Wuhan lab, the U.S.-China relationship only went further downhill. As the pandemic set in worldwide, the origin story was largely set aside in the public coverage of the crisis. But the internal government debate continued, now over whether the United States should release more information about what it knew about the lab and its possible connection to the outbreak. ",1
"In late 2017, top health and science officials at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing attended a conference in the Chinese capital. There, they saw a presentation on a new study put out by a group of Chinese scientists, including several from the Wuhan lab, in conjunction with the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Since the 2002 outbreak of SARSâ€”the deadly disease caused by a coronavirus transmitted by bats in Chinaâ€”scientists around the world had been looking for ways to predict and limit future outbreaks of similar diseases. To aid the effort, the NIH had funded a number of projects that involved the WIV scientists, including much of the Wuhan labâ€™s work with bat coronaviruses. The new study was entitled Discovery of a Rich Gene Pool of Bat SARS-Related Coronaviruses Provides New Insights into the Origin of SARS Coronavirus. These researchers, the American officials learned, had found a population of bats",1
