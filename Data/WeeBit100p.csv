are good poems to use if you are talking about description.
When trying to answer a question like this, it is a good idea to look at the poems in turn and note down examples relevant to each criteria the examiner is looking for.
The following tables are an excellent example of how you might plan to tackle this question.
A description of one thing in terms of another - implicitly comparing the two, but without using 'as' or 'like'. 'Sea of troubles', and 'drowning in debt' are metaphors. Something that represents another thing.
Where a phrase or word is repeated several times to emphasise or make a particular point.
An explicit comparison of one thing to another, using the words 'like' or 'as'. 'Sleeping like a log' and 'bright as a button' are similes.
Something that is open to more than one interpretation.
To represent an idea or object as a person, by giving it the characteristics of a person.
The use of symbols - ie, of images or things that represent something else, usually something abstract.
Words strung together with repeated (often initial) consonants, eg Max made many men mad.

4963,"In May 1926 Britains' miners walked out and in a move of solidarity other industry workers joined them, creating the
general strike in Britain. Was Britain on the verge of a revolution? This Revision Bite will answer this question and more...
: A general strike is called by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) to support the miners in their quarrel with the mine owners, who want to reduce their wages by 13 per cent and increase their shifts from seven to eight hours. Huge numbers of road transport, bus, rail, docks, printing, gas and electricity, building, iron, steel, chemicals and coal workers stay off work. JH Thomas, a trade unionist and MP, says: 'God help us unless the government wins'.
: The government acts aggressively against the strike and tries to exert greater control over the media. It attempts to take control of the BBC and publishes a newspaper - 'The British Gazette'. The government also sends a warship to Newcastle, and recruits 226,000 special policemen.
: Middle-class volunteers get some buses and trains, and the electricity working. A few buses are set on fire, and there are fights between police and strikers in London, Glasgow and Edinburgh. Stanley Baldwin, the prime minister, declares the strike an attack on Britain's democracy.
: Police and strikers clash in Liverpool, Hull and London. The government calls the army to London. It also seizes all supplies of paper, which hinders publication of the TUC's paper, 'The British Worker'. The TUC is embarrassed when Russian trade unionists send a large donation and it is sent back.
: Police make baton-charges on rioting strikers in Glasgow, Hull, Middlesbrough, Newcastle and Preston. The number of volunteers increases. The army escorts food lorries from the London docks. Secretly, JH Thomas has talks with the mine owners.
: The Roman Catholic Church declares the strike 'a sin'.
: Some textile workers join the strike. Strikers in Northumberland derail the Flying Scotsman train. Baldwin declares that Britain is 'threatened with a revolution', and the government arrests 374 Communists.
: The TUC, led by JH Thomas, calls off the strike. The strikers are taken by surprise, but drift back to work.
The miners struggle on alone until November when they are forced to go back to work for less pay and longer hours.

5130,"Traditionally, most retail outlets were located in the CBD. The centre of town was a logical place for shops because it was the most accessible part of a town and transport links radiate out from this point.
In the late 20th century, traffic congestion reduced accessibility to inner cities. This led to out of town locations becoming favoured for the retail industry. They are close to the suburbs and are accessible for many people via ring roads and motorways. Land is also cheaper in this part of a settlement, making it attractive to retailers.
A Next store in Hemel Hempstead, Herts
The result of this is that more people shop out of town, rather than in a CBD. The reduction in profits in the CBD can cause smaller branches of chain stores to close down, eg Next in St. Albans has recently closed in favour of the larger out of town store at the nearby Colney Fields retail park. Colney Fields benefits from free parking and easy access to the M25, giving it a wider sphere of influence than the smaller town centre store. Can you think of an example in your local area?
If this becomes widespread, areas in the centre of town can become derelict and unattractive, further discouraging people from shopping there. Also, unless bus or rail links are adequate, people without cars have limited access to shopping facilities.

Student example: using an image in the 'Response' phase
This is a still-image of our work when we were
the abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison. We were trying to communicate that the prisoner was being intimidated by two US soldiers, and that this was a harrowing experience for the prisoner.
I feel we should have arranged the image better, so that the proxemics could more easily show what was happening. If the prisoner had been placed facing the audience it would have been easier to see his expression, and if the two soldiers had been placed a little upstage on each side of the prisoner, we could have shown the expressions of everyone - and the face of one soldier character would not have been hidden by their hair.
The prisoner should have looked more intimidated than is shown in the actor's body language - she looked too relaxed to communicate the terror the prisoner must have felt.
The candidate has written well about the image, and has included some evaluative remarks that point out the shortcomings of the group's work. It is clear that the candidate realizes how the work could have been improved, and this demonstrates understanding of the process.
Student example: using an image in the 'Development' phase
Students acting a scene set in Abu Ghraib prison
During the phase of the work when we were
scenes to show the abuse in Abu Ghraib prison, we were working to show how the soldiers were intimidated by their own superior officers, because of the abuse that they were investigating.
We wanted to show how by making the officer stand behind the soldier, with the soldier too scared to turn around, we were able to show the status of the officer.
We could also show the way in which he could signal his feelings to the audience, without the prisoner seeing any facial expressions.
This would also leave the soldier able to show his own anxiety in the situation, through his body language and facial expressions. The actor here was able to signal this well.
Here the image is commented on by the candidate, and it is clear that the proxemics are such that the candidates were able to heighten the sense of anxiety in the scene, and to show this to the audience. The candidate has explained well the reasons for their staging of this sequence.
Student example: using an image in the 'Evaluation' phase
Students acting out a scene set in a care home
This image shows our work at a point when we, the staff in the care home, were taking the old lady away from her room to clean her up after she had spilled her food.
We wanted to show that the staff can be harsh in their treatment of the elderly residents of the home and that they don't treat some of their residents as they state in their brochures.
As it is shown here, the staff members look as if they are not caring, and I think that this would be clear to an audience. I think we were able to show that the old woman looks scared and that the staff look uncaring about her fears.
The girl playing the old lady is showing through her facial expression and body language that she is scared and we planned that the audience would be shocked by this treatment of her.
The comment by the candidate has first been put into context, so that the situation is more understandable. The evaluation and reflection on his / her work illustrates some strong aspects, and others where the candidate feels that improvements could be made. This indicates that the candidate has a good level of knowledge and understanding.

A light-hearted drama that is played for laughs.
A type of drama in which characters undergo suffering or calamity, and which usually ends with a death. A sad or catastrophic event causing suffering or death.
. We see three sets of lovers get together and almost see a man murdered on stage. There is much deception and disguise. The ending is full of celebration for most but despair for Shylock. So, what happens to create so many dramatic contrasts? How is the drama maintained and the audience involved?
The sequence of events in a narrative; a story
are woven together in such a way that we are often left on a mini cliff-hanger, wondering what will happen next. It's just like in a soap opera: we jump from place to place, picking up the story each time. Here are just some examples:
We hear about the Prince of Morocco in Act 1, scene 2, are introduced to him in Act 2, scene 1, but do not see him choose a casket until Act 2, scene 7!
We are primed about the vulnerability of Antonio's ships from Salarino's comment about
the harm a wind too great might do at sea
which is reinforced when Shylock talks of
pirates - and then there is the peril of waters, winds and rocks
. From then on the bad news dribbles in at intervals: Salarino tells Solanio of the loss of
a vessel of our country richly fraught
in Act 2, scene 8 - but we do not yet know that this is one of Antonio's ships; by Act 3, scene 1 rumours of more wrecks are circulating - but it is not until Act 3, scene 2 that we know for certain that every one of Antonio's fleet has been lost.
Antonio takes the bond lightly; but Bassanio is suspicious of it from the start:
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind
. This sets the audience wondering about what its consequences might be.
In Act 2, scene 9, the Prince of Arragon follows the Prince of Morocco to choose a casket, but also fails. We now know that it must be the lead casket that contains the prize, so when we hear moments later that Basanio has arrived we are on the edge of our seats to see which casket he will pick.
Tension mounts as Shylock continues to demand his pound of flesh and it seems that the laws of Venice will let him have his way. This reaches its height in the trial scene: Shylock even sharpens his knife in anticipation. Will Antonio live or die?
""'Nearest his heart'. Those are the very words.""

'Marking out' means the transfer of shapes and lines onto the material, as guides for cutting, bending or shaping them. Accurate marking out is essential if the different parts of the product are to fit together properly.
The correct marking-out tools for different materials
Lines at right angles to an edge
Whenever you are cutting and shaping resistant materials, undertake the the following tasks in order:
Mark out where the material should be cut
Cut the material, leaving some spare material for finishing to a smooth surface
Smooth the material to the lines marked out
Shaping by wasting simply means cutting away material to leave the desired shape. It gets its name because the material which is removed, such as shavings or sawdust, is usually thrown away. Shaping by wasting can be done on any type of material.
Shaping by wasting which can be done by hand
Tenon saw (dovetail saw for fine work)
Coping saw (fret saw for fine work)

Deforming is a method of shaping materials by either bending in a straight line or by creating a bowl or dish shape. The key methods for deforming materials in a straight line or in two dimensions are described below:
. Thin metal may be bent whilst cold, while thicker metal may need heating or
heating a metal to toughen it, so it will not break when bent. Some metals like copper will go red when hot. With those that don't glow like aluminium, put soap on them first, it will be hot enough when the soap goes black.
. Larger pieces of metal may also need to be heated first.
The material is marked where it is to be bent, and clamped to the line in the vice or folding bars. To prevent damaging the material as you hit it with the mallet, place a piece of wood next to it and hit that instead.
. This is done by cutting thin strips of wood, putting glue on the strips and clamping them into a
a hollow form into which a softened material is placed. The material hardens and the mould is then removed to produce a product of the desired shape
Hollowing and press moulding are both ways of three-dimensional deforming it is important to remember that wood will not deform in three dimensions.
Hollowing is a way of deforming thin sheet metal to produce a bowl shape. The metal is first

Press moulding can be used to force sheet metal into 3D shapes. The metal is placed between two moulds which are then squeezed together until the metal takes on the shape of the moulds.
Thermoplastics cannot be bent when cold. They are bent using a
which will heat the plastic in a straight line, so it can be bent by hand, as shown below.
Sheet of thermoplastic held in a strip heater. Heater bars heat the thermoplastic in a straight line, prior to bending.
A mould is made in two halves - top and bottom. Sheet plastic is placed between the two halves, which are then heated and pressure applied. The heat from the mould causes a chemical reaction in the plastic which enables it to assume the new shape. Press moulding is used to make electrical fittings, handles, and many other products. It can only be used with
types of plastic that can only be melted once, and then become very hard
Blow moulding is used to shape plastics - mainly for making bottles, plastic buckets and similar shapes. A tube of softened plastic called a

Most metals can be cast, but in school usually only aluminium is used.
Create the required shape in a soft material - usually wood. This is called a pattern.
Make a mould by placing the pattern in special casting sand inside a moulding box or flask. The sand is made to stick together using water or oil.
The pattern is removed and metal poured into the cavity.
Die casting uses a metal mould which can be very detailed. The mould is made in two parts to allow the casting to be removed. Die casting is a very important industrial process used for many different types of products.
Die-cast aluminium engine parts  Injection-moulded plastic hardhat.
Extrusion is used to produce long, but fairly thin products such as pipes or curtain tracks. Both plastics and metal can be extruded. The material is forced through a die, which contains a hole which is the same shape as the required product.
Injection moulding is a similar process to die casting. A metal mould is used and softened or molten plastic is forced into the mould by pressure from a screw thread or pneumatic plunger. The mould is made in two parts to allow the moulding to be removed. Polythene, polystyrene, polypropylene and nylon are the plastics most often used in injection moulding, which is used extensively in industry.

""Thing's aren't what they seem, you know""
Well, yes, it is easy to understand but it is not something unusual or interesting, and it doesn't seem to be something a witch might want to say anyway. So instead, they say:
""Fair is foul, and foul is fair""
Suddenly it's not so obvious what Shakespeare is getting at. This is also a lot more complex and interesting - opposing ideas are put together and the actual meaning seems to be a paradox - how can something fair be foul, and something foul be fair? Let's have a look at this next.

This table looks at these contrasting ideas:
The old are set in their ways. They are utterly confident that they are right and they see the young as foolish.
The young are open to new ideas. This is first seen early in Act 1 when both Eric and Sheila express sympathy for the strikers - an idea which horrifies Birling, who can only think of production costs and ignores the human side of the issue.
The old will do anything to protect themselves: Mrs Birling lies to the Inspector when he first shows her the photograph; Mr Birling wants to cover up a potential scandal.
The young are honest and admit their faults. Eric refuses to try to cover his part up, saying,
""the fact remains that I did what I did.""
They have never been forced to examine their consciences before and find they cannot do it now - as the saying goes, 'you can't teach an old dog new tricks.'

Everything else might happen to us: we might get married, be rich, be happy, have children, open our own business or travel the world, but the only real certainty is that we will die.
It is not surprising that people have always asked questions about what, if anything, happens after they die.
Although some people claim to have had near-death experiences (NDEs), and others claim to be able to talk to the dead, or to have seen ghosts, there is no scientific proof that such experiences actually provide a glimpse into a possible afterlife. It is possible, therefore, that when people die, they simply stop living and that there is nothing beyond this life.
Ideas about what happens after death, and its connection with how life is lived on earth, is a fundamental part of all religions. The details may differ between religions, but belief in an afterlife almost always:
helps people to make sense of life, particularly when life seems unfair or at times of suffering (their own, and other peoples)
gives support and comfort at times of loss and bereavement
Christians believe there is an afterlife. Although the body dies and is buried or cremated, they believe that their unique soul lives on and is raised to new life by God.
Their belief that Jesus rose from the dead three days after his crucifixion (a Roman method of execution) gives Christians hope that if they follow Jesus teaching and accept him as their Lord and Saviour, then this new resurrection life awaits them. By being born as a human being (the incarnation), and then dying on the cross, Jesus made this new life after death possible for all.
Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies.
God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
Christians believe that God is just and fair, and so cannot let evil go unpunished. Most believe in the idea of judgement after death, and that God will treat people in the afterlife according to how they lived their life on earth.
Although heaven is often mentioned in the Bible, it is rarely described. Christians therefore have very different ideas about it. Some believe that heaven is a physical place, where their body goes after death. Others believe that it is their soul that lives on, and that heaven is a state of being united with God.
The Bible is even less specific about hell, and Christians have very different ideas about this too. Some Christians believe that hell is a
of suffering, and of separation from God. Others (perhaps most) believe that hell is a
state of being separated from God for eternity.
Some Christians, including Roman Catholics, believe in purgatory. This is an in-between state for the majority of people of waiting for heaven, a time of cleansing from sin and preparing for heaven.
Many Christians believe that there is a place in the Kingdom of God for members of other faiths, and for many who have not even believed in God on earth but have done the will of God in many ways without knowing it.
Some Christians believe in the Second Coming (
) - the anticipated return of Jesus Christ from heaven to earth. This will herald the general

Lichens are plants that grow in exposed places such as rocks or tree bark. They need to be very good at absorbing water and nutrients to grow there, and rainwater contains just enough nutrients to keep them alive. Air pollutants dissolved in rainwater, especially sulfur dioxide, can damage lichens, and prevent them from growing. This makes lichens natural indicators of air pollution. For example:
leafy lichens can survive a small amount of air pollution
crusty lichens can survive in more polluted air

The ozone layer reduces the amount of ultraviolet light from the Sun that reaches the Earths surface. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation can lead to sunburn and skin cancer, but sunblocks can reduce this damage.
Increased energy use and deforestation raise the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This leads to global warming.
The Earths crust and upper mantle are broken up into huge

Earthquakes cause damage to buildings, and often lead to loss of life. It is difficult to predict exactly when an earthquake might happen and how bad it will be, even in places that are known for having earthquakes.
Earthquakes produce shock waves. These travel through the Earth and can be detected using a device called a
There are two types of seismic wave.
P-waves are longitudinal waves like sound waves, and s-waves are transverse waves like light waves
Ultraviolet radiation is found naturally in sunlight. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation can cause:
We cannot see or feel ultraviolet radiation, but our skin responds to it by turning darker. This happens in an attempt to reduce the amount of ultraviolet radiation that reaches deeper skin tissues.
Darker skins absorb more ultraviolet light, so less ultraviolet radiation reaches the deeper tissues. This is important because ultraviolet radiation can cause normal cells to become cancerous.
Sunblocks can reduce the damage caused by ultraviolet radiation. They contain chemicals that absorb a lot of the radiation and prevent it from reaching our skin. They may also contain chemicals that reflect some of the radiation away from the skin.
Manufacturers of sunblocks make products with different sun protection
the higher the factor, the longer you can stay out in the sun without burning
high factor sunblocks reduce the risks from ultraviolet radiation more than low factor sunblocks
If, for example, you would get sunburnt after ten minutes in the sun, with Factor 5 applied you could stay in the sun for 50 minutes - or for 1500 minutes with Factor 150 applied. But the real time is usually lower, because some of the sunblock gets absorbed by the skin, and some gets rubbed off.
Dust from volcanoes reflects heat radiation from the Sun, leading to cooling. But dust from factories reflects heat radiation from cities, stopping it from escaping. This leads to warming in urban areas.

Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen at a higher rate since the 19th century
The temperature of the earth has risen over the years
Human activities leading to global warming include:
Most of the energy we use comes from burning fossil fuels. These release carbon dioxide when they burn. So the increasing use of energy is leading to increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
When land is cleared for timber and farms, there are fewer trees to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by photosynthesis. Also, if the fallen trees are burned or left to rot, additional carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere.
A knowledge of how seismic waves travel through the Earth provides us with evidence of the Earths structure. Remember that:
p-waves travel through solids and liquids, so they can travel through all of the Earths layers
s-waves cannot travel through liquid rock, so they cannot travel through the outer core
The speed of p-waves and s-waves increases as they travel deeper into the mantle. They travel through the Earth in curved paths, but they change direction suddenly when they pass through the boundary between substances in different states. The diagrams show what happens when p-waves and s-waves pass through the Earth:
S-waves cannot pass through the liquid outer core, but p-waves can. When p-waves pass from solid to liquid, then from liquid to solid, there are sudden changes in direction.

She was brought up in the African countryside and had a generally unhappy childhood. Her mother was very strict and her father very bitter - his farm was not a success and he had been badly injured in World War One.
Lessing was also unhappy away from home. The nuns at her convent school terrified her, and she dropped out school entirely when she was 13. Although she did not go back, Lessing continued to read widely.
She left home when she was just 15 and worked as a nursemaid, in addition to writing stories for magazines in South Africa. She married when she was 19 and had two children. She later left her family, married again and had a third child.
After World War Two, she left her second husband, moved to London with her third child, and became a full-time writer.

Wilfred Owen is one of the most famous war poets. He was born in 1893 and died in 1918, just one week from the end of World War One. His poetry is characterised by powerful descriptions of the conditions faced by soldiers in the trenches.

In the number 34.27, the value of the figure 2 is a tenth, and the value of the figure 7 is a hundredth.
When ordering numbers, we should always compare the digits on the left first.
For example, which is greater: 2.701 or 2.71?
Both numbers have two units and seven tenths, but 2.701 has no hundredths, whereas 2.71 has one hundredth. Therefore, 2.71 is greater than 2.701.
Another way to look at it is to write a zero at the end of 2.71 to make it 2.710 (this does not change its value, because it is after the decimal point).
The two numbers are now 2.710 and 2.701. It is quite easy to see that 2.710 is bigger (just as 2710 is bigger than 2701).

Costs the firm has to make ie its spending.
The firm's accountants monitor and record the actual financial performance of the firm against the budget, so that its likely financial performance can be forecast. When the two are compared there will usually be a difference. Adjustments will be made for the next budget or forecast.
Now look at both in detail and try to remember three ways of raising finance from each source.
The board of a public limited company may retain profits for a year rather than share it amongst the owners. The cash can be invested to earn interest.
Assets that are no longer required, like an outdated computer or an obsolete piece of machinery, can be sold.
Stock levels can be reduced and funds made available for other uses.
A sole trader or a small business may be able to borrow money from family or friends without paying interest.
Loans from a bank or a building society can be expensive. An agreed amount is borrowed and repaid over a fixed period of time with interest.
Grants from central or local government will cost the firm nothing.
Firms often lease equipment or machinery to avoid a large outlay of cash. This is useful if a firm needs to upgrade within the medium term as technology advances.

Wordsworth suggests that the view of the city is a rival for anything naturally occurring: 'Earth has not anything to show more fair' is the opening line.
The use of the word 'smokeless' in line 8 gives the reader a clue about why this scene is so powerful. Under normal circumstances, the smoke from homes and factories would have obscured the view of the city; it is as if the speaker is experiencing the true beauty of the city for the first time.

3131,"Look at the examiner. Eye contact is very important. It will help the examiner to help you.
Avoid making the conversation sound like a rehearsed set of questions with easy answers. One way to do this is to think of each question as a ""trigger"" to help you say as much good Spanish as you can. For example, if your examiner asks you to talk about your family, don't just name the members of your family and wait for the next question. Instead, develop your reply by taking one member of the family and describing their personality, as well as their physical appearance. You could then give your opinion of that person and say whether you get on well together, and why.
Don't panic if the examiner asks you a question you have not prepared. Short answers, as well as complete sentences are both acceptable. Try to be spontaneous and to respond quickly and confidently.
If you don't understand a question, ask the examiner (in Spanish) to repeat it '
' . If you still don't understand, say so '
' and let the examiner move on. Avoid long silences.
Don't worry if things get harder as the conversation develops. Remember, it's the examiner's job to 'push' you as far as you can go. If everything was too easy, the examiner would be letting you under-achieve.

5040,"Chinua Achebe was born in Nigeria in 1930 where his father worked for the Church Missionary Society. After university, he studied broadcasting at the BBC then worked in Lagos for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service.
Chinua Achebe is one of the most admired African novelists who write in English. His novels trace Africa's transition from traditional to modern ways. He writes with a mission, and he believes that any good work of art should have a purpose - an idea that stems from the oral tradition of storytelling in Africa. He is interested in speech and his novels present a wide range of language, from the English spoken by the Ibo to different levels of

A vault where dead bodies or bones are piled.
Bergen-Belsen was one of the most notorious concentration camps of the Second World War. It became a camp for those who were too weak or sick to work and many people died because of the terrible conditions. Anne Frank was interned there and died of typhus in 1945. The camp was liberated in 1945.
The poem begins with a graphic and unpleasant description of a pair of vultures who nestle lovingly together after feasting on a corpse. The poet remarks on the strangeness of love, existing in places one would not have thought possible. He goes on to consider the 'love' a concentration camp commander shows to his family - having spent his day burning human corpses, he buys them sweets on the way home.
. On one hand, Achebe praises providence that even the cruelest of beings can show sparks of love, yet on the other, he despairs - they show love solely for their family, and so allow themselves to commit atrocities towards others.
Poetry that has little or no rhyme scheme, regular pattern of rhythms, or line lengths.

Think about how the language the poet uses helps to convey his ideas. Here are some points to consider:

The description of the vultures is in the

, but the Belsen Commandant is described in the
The verb form we use when an action is continuous and happening now (not in the past or in the future).
, perhaps to remind us that evil is all around us now.
The concentration camp Commandant cannot escape the evil deeds he has spent the day performing - 'the fumes of human roast [cling] rebelliously to his hairy nostrils' (line 32). The word 'roast' makes us think of food, so it is doubly repulsive that he then buys 'chocolate' for his 'tender' child (or children) on the way home.
Which of the two conclusions in the fourth section of the poem is stronger? How do you feel Achebe wants us to leave the poem - with hope because love can exist in even the most evil creatures, or with despair because, despite that love, they cannot stop committing evil?
The opening lines of the poem are dark. The 'greyness' (line 1) is heightened by the heavy alliteration 'in drizzle of one despondent dawn' (line 2) and even the approaching 'sunbreak' (line 4) does not lift the atmosphere.
There are metaphors of horror and death: the 'dead tree' (line 6) branch on which the vultures are roosting is described as a 'broken bone' (line 5), while the male vulture's bashed-in head is a 'pebble on a stem' (line 9) and its body is a 'dump of gross feathers' (line 11).
In the second section, the vultures' affection leads the poet on to muse about the nature of love. Love is personified as a woman finding a place to sleep. She is 'in other ways so particular' (line 23) and hard to please, yet, strangely, she chooses to sleep with the vultures, 'that charnel house' (line 26). Yet why does love sleep with 'her face turned to the wall' (line 28)?
We see the 'Belsen Commandant' - a mass murderer - as Daddy. Why does Achebe use a child's name for him rather than 'father'?
In the fourth section, the poet again uses metaphors: the evil Commandant is 'an ogre' (line 43) with merely a spark of love - 'a tiny glow-worm tenderness' (line 44) in the 'icy caverns of a cruel heart' (line 46). These are fairly clichd images, perhaps because Achebe wanted to suggest that what he is describing is nothing new: there will always be love and evil in the world.
The 'germ' (line 48) of love does not seem to grow as a normal seed would because the 'perpetuity of evil' (line 50) is bound up with it and prevents it from developing. (Think of wheat germ rather than disease-carrying germs.)
There is some alliteration in the poem, but, otherwise, Achebe concentrates on visual images rather than sound effects to present his ideas.
Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses towards its subject matter. Attitude can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
To decide on the tone, you need to think about the ideas and attitudes in the poem, and then decide how you would read it aloud.
In a nightmarish tone, as in a horror film?
In a cold, dead tone, to emphasise all the horrors described?
In a warmer tone, to celebrate the love that does exist?
Choose a short quotation to justify your choice.
The ideas in this poem concern the relationship between evil and love. In the first part, the vultures are used as a
An image or thing (usually something physical, like a flag) that stands for or represents something else - usually something abstract, like a nation. A crucifix is a symbol of Christianity.
An apparently contradictory, or impossible proposition that is actually true.
that evil and love can co-exist; in the second part, Achebe uses the Belsen Commandant as an actual example of this. Have a look at the quotations below, and our suggestions about how they fit in to this theme.
Key phrases and how they fit into the theme
Strange is isolated in a single-word line. This makes us dwell on the word and prepares us for the image of love settled in an evil place. By the end of the poem, Achebe shows that even the most evil people experience kindred love, but that love is not powerful enough to halt the evil.
Achebe picks the most gruesome images he can find when describing the vultures to emphasise their evil. This prepares us for the human evil he goes on to explore.
for in the very germ... is lodged the perpetuity of evil.
It is poignant that Achebe concludes the poem with the idea of the predominance of evil. Evil is lodged within love - and evil is the haunting final word of the poem.

2728,"The lowland areas across Great Britain, where ancient glaciers have created plains and rolling landscapes and deposited fertile material transported from highland areas, provide an opportunity for different activities.
Lowland areas provide much more suitable locations than harsh highland areas for building villages, towns and cities. Edinburgh, for example, is situated on the site of an ancient glacier.
Towns displace vegetation and wildlife and transform landscapes. They also create problems such as pollution and water and power consumption.
The more fertile lowlands offer much better opportunities for arable and pastoral farming than the highlands.
This creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.
Intensive farming displaces vegetation and wildlife. It also damages the environment through the use of fertilisers, pesticides and weed killers, and may spread disease to animals and humans.
Lowland areas attract tourists who do recreational activities including horse riding, walking, fishing, boating and many others.
Fertile areas are also good for creating golf courses.
Badly-managed tourism can cause damage to the environment through soil erosion, pollution and over fishing.
It can also interfere with local livelihoods (eg those of farmers).
Golf courses take land out of agricultural use and remove variety from the landscape.

Very little, if any, will be left over to sell and most will feed the farmer and his family.
Rice growing is labour intensive and heavily dependent on high rainfall and hot temperatures.
The growing population means there is a high demand for food which puts pressure on the farmer to produce two or even three crops a year.
Crops can be affected by disease, which can reduce yields.
Children are often denied basic education because they are required to work on the farms. This has a long-term impact on the development of the country.

Two doctors, Frederick Banting and Charles Best, made an extract from the pancreas in 1921. The extract had anti-diabetic properties, and they tested it successfully on diabetic dogs. The first tests in humans were carried out in 1922, and were a success too. Some patients who were in a diabetic coma even recovered. The extract contained the hormone insulin.
There are two types of treatment for diabetes:
Careful monitoring of food intake, with particular care taken over carbohydrates - which are digested into glucose.
Injecting insulin into the blood before meals. The extra insulin causes glucose to be taken up by the liver and other tissues. Cells get the glucose they need for respiration, and the blood glucose concentration stays normal.

The ions produced when ionising radiation breaks up molecules can take part in other chemical reactions. If these chemical reactions are in cells of your body, the cells can die or become cancerous. This is the reason that ionising radiation can be damaging to health.
The intensity of electromagnetic radiation is the energy arriving each second. This depends on two things: the energy in each photon, and the number of photons arriving each second.
To have the same intensity, a beam of red light would need ten times as many photons as a beam of ultraviolet, and a beam of microwaves would need a million times as many.

Strong covalent bonds join atoms to each other in individual polymer molecules. Weak intermolecular forces attract polymer molecules towards each other. The properties of solid materials like polymers depend on:
the strength of the forces between these molecules
A polymer will melt when the intermolecular forces are overcome. The stronger the forces, the more energy is needed to break them, and the higher the materials melting point.
Many polymers, such as poly(ethene), contain long molecules that lie side by side. These can uncoil and slide past each other, making the material flexible. Long polymer chains have stronger forces of attraction than shorter ones: they make stronger materials.
Cross-linking is where the polymer chains are chemically joined together in places, by covalent bonds. The polymer molecules cannot slide over each other so easily. This makes materials tougher and less flexible, and they cannot be easily stretched. Cross-linking also gives materials high melting points.

Water is not the only solvent. Esters act as solvents, too.
Nail varnish does not dissolve in water - it is insoluble in water. But it does dissolve in nail varnish remover, which may contain ethyl ethanoate, an ester.
Whether or not a substance will dissolve in a particular solvent depends on the relative strengths of the attractive forces:
between the solute particles and solvent particles
The attraction between water and nail varnish particles is weaker than the attraction that joins water to water and the attraction that joins nail varnish to nail varnish. The attractive force between water and nail varnish particles is too weak to break those other bonds, so nail varnish will not dissolve in water.
Volatile liquids evaporate easily - change from a liquid to a gas. This is because there are only weak attractive forces between particles in the substance. These are overcome easily, so particles with enough energy can escape from the liquid.

Many electrical appliances, including cookers, washing machines and refrigerators, have metal cases. The earth wire creates a safe route for the current to flow through, if the live wire touches the casing.
You will get an electric shock if the live wire inside an appliance, such as a cooker, comes loose and touches the metal casing. However, the earth terminal is connected to the metal casing, so the current goes through the earth wire instead of causing an electric shock. A strong current surges through the earth wire because it has a very low resistance. This breaks the fuse and disconnects the appliance.
Some appliances, such as vacuum cleaners and electric drills, do not have an earth wire. This is because they have plastic casings, or they have been designed so that the live wire can not touch the casing. As a result, the casing cannot give an electric shock, even if the wires inside become loose. These appliances have double insulation and carry a symbol.

Teacher's notes: This question is worth 6 marks in the exam. Give yourself 7 - 8 minutes to answer it.
Mark Scheme: In History you are marked by levels. The higher the level the more marks you get and so the higher grade you will achieve.
The answer will be general providing some information related to the question but it will not adequately explain the reasons for O'Neill's resignation.
The answer will discuss some of the reasons for the downfall of O'Neill but lack sufficient depth.
The answer will show that the candidate is aware that O'Neill had lost the support of both nationalists and unionists and it will clearly outline the reasons for this.
Terence O'Neill was Prime Minister of Northern Ireland from 1963 to 1969. He led the Unionist Party during these years. He brought in many reforms which did not really satisfy nationalists who wanted major changes. There were protest marches and street violence during the years 1968 and 1969 and as a result O'Neill resigned in April 1969.
Paul would get a level 1 for this answer. The candidate's answer is too general. Some reasons for O'Neill's downfall have been included but these needed to be explained more fully.
Terence O'Neill was forced to resign in 1969. He had lost the support of nationalists and unionists over his government's handling of the Civil Rights Movement and the protest marches which they had organised. Although O'Neill had brought in a Five-Point Reform programme and had sought to improve relations with the Republic of Ireland, nationalists felt his reforms did not go far enough. Following some bomb explosions in 1969 he resigned.
Glenn would get a level 2 for this answer. The candidate has provided an answer of reasonable quality but it lacks balance. It provides some reasons to explain why nationalists were unhappy with O'Neill's leadership but fails to explain why many unionists were also dissatisfied.
Terence O'Neill resigned in April 1969 having lost the support of many nationalists and unionists. As early as 1965 Dr. Ian Paisley, following O'Neill's meetings with the Irish Taoiseach Sean Lemass, had started an ""O'Neill Must Go"" campaign. Many unionists had become increasingly unhappy with O'Neill's reforms which they saw as concessions to nationalists and they felt he was taking N. Ireland closer to a United Ireland. He had major critics, Faulkner, Craig and Chichester-Clark within his own Party, who disagreed with him over his reforms and resigned from his government.
O'Neill was also heavily criticized by nationalists for his reluctance to bring in reforms such as ""One Man, One Vote"" and for his Government's handling of the civil rights marches in October 1968 and January 1969 when marchers had been attacked.
His growing unpopularity was clearly revealed by the limited support shown for pro-O'Neill candidates in the February election of 1969. Following some UVF explosions at water pumping stations in the spring of 1969, O'Neill decided to resign.
Nuala would get a level 3 for this answer. The candidate has produced a high quality response. It clearly outlines how O'Neill had alienated many nationalists and unionists and reveals that the campaign to oust him had started as early as 1965. It also explains how the lack of support for O'Neill had become very evident in the early months of 1969.

So how can you tell what tone a piece of non-fiction text is written in?
Firstly, and most importantly, you need to assess the
in which it is written. If it seems quite light-hearted, then it is possible that the text has a humorous tone; whereas text with lots of facts about an important topic is probably quite serious in tone.
There are certain clues you can look out for to help determine the tone of a non-fiction text:
For example, an article from a broadsheet newspaper or a charity advertisement is likely to be quite serious in tone.
The use of exclamation marks can suggest that the writer is in disbelief about, or astounded by something.
Questions that are asked, but not expected to be answered, since the answer is usually obvious. They are used to emphasise a particular point.
An article that uses rhetorical questions is likely to be quite thought-provoking in tone.
The use of cartoons or caricatures could suggest that an article is not serious or aims to ridicule its subject matter.
Look at this British Red Cross advertisement that talks about the organisation's aims and work throughout the world. What is the

Arable farming is common in the south-east where the summers are warm and the land is low, flat and fertile. The south-east also has good transport links and farms are close to markets in towns and cities such as London.
Human factors such as finance and proximity to markets are important to market gardening. It is common in East Anglia where fruit, vegetables and flowers are grown.
Hill sheep farming takes place in the north and west of Britain in highland areas such as Snowdonia and the Lake District. There are cool summers and high rainfall. The climate and steep land make these areas unsuitable for growing crops.
Dairy farming is common in the south-west and the west of England where the climate is warm and wet. There are also good transport links and good access routes to markets in these areas. The land may be flat or hilly, but not too steep.
Mixed farming is found in areas where the climate and relief suit both crops and animals. It needs to be warm, but not too wet, and the soils need to be fertile and flat. Mixed farms need good transport links and accessibility to markets.

A description of all the differences between two things (in this case, two texts).
between the way Batman saw his separation with Robin, when he 'generously' let him free to explore the wild blue yonder (line 3), to Robin's more down to earth view of events - ditched me... in the gutter (line 5). We wonder what really happened between them...
Robin uses various cliched phrases as he tells us that he has scotched that... rumour, sacked it, blown the cover... let the cat out (lines 6-9), perhaps because he is boasting of the power that releasing these secrets has given him over Batman. The casual language makes it sound as if he is showing off to his mates. The casual use of motor for the Batmobile also suggests he is trying to impress us.
The word caper (line 9) is a pun, reminding us of the capes that Batman and Robin always wore.
Lines 12 and 13 are spoofs of tabloid headlines. Holy is an adjective that Robin used a lot when exclaiming, such as 'Holy smoke!' Here, Armitage has exaggerated it for comic effect. The 'new' Robin seems to be making fun of his 'old' self.
Robin becomes scornful when he uses the

(line 14). He's fed up of the 'game' and doesn't want to serve anyone any more.
He makes fun of his superhero outfit, again sounding scornful by describing it as a fashion writer might - that off-the-shoulder Sherwood-Forest-green and scarlet number (lines 15-16). He prefers the more ordinary jeans and jumper, now that he is an ordinary kid.
It is ironic that he calls Batman baby in the final line, because although it is a term of endearment, he uses it to belittle Batman. Robin the kid has grown up while Batman, the superhero, has diminished to a baby. The phrase boy wonder had a new meaning, because Robin has managed to break free of his idol.
You will have noticed that every line ends with -er (order, wander, yonder). Think about the famous Batman theme tune: Er er er er, er er er er, er er er er, er er er er, Batman! Armitage is mimicking the theme tune through his rhyme scheme.
This effect is intensified through the internal
In poetry, the use of words which have the same or a similar sound - eg 'flow' and 'bow' - to form a pattern of sound.
, as many words within the lines also end with -er or -our (gutter, rumour, elder)
The very last words of the poem, announcing that Robin now is the real boy wonder (line 24), create the climax of the rhyme scheme.
Armitage uses very long sentences: there are only 5 in the whole poem. This adds pace to the reading, as we are only allowed short pauses for breath, and helps to convey the energy that Robin has now he is free of Batman.

The themes interlock, but we'll start off by looking at them separately. As you go, think about the contribution Atticus makes to each one.
Prejudice permeates Maycomb society. Almost every character is either prejudiced against others, or the victim of prejudice. There is racial prejudice, class prejudice and prejudice against individuals who don't fit in.
The majority of the white population of Maycomb are racist. They see Blacks as second-class citizens (they do menial jobs for little money) and second-class humans.
The table below shows some examples of the racist views shared by most of the characters in the novel.
When he arrested Boo Radley (suspected of stabbing his father in the leg with a pair of scissors) he
""hadn't the heart to put him in the jail alongside Negroes""
""Your father's no better than the niggers and trash he works for!""
She doesn't like to talk about important matters
He's part of a mob of men who would have lynched Tom Robinson, had Atticus not been on guard outside the jail.
""You know what we want,"" a man said. ""Get aside from the door, Mr Finch.""
Only a few people in the book are open-minded enough to recognise racism for the evil it is. Here are some examples:
He hates the town's racist attitude and refers to it as
She is proud of ""those people in this town who say that fair play is not marked
He can't believe that the jury can convict an innocent man just because he is black.
She sees the hypocrisy of her teacher who opposes Hitler but supports the Tom's conviction.
""It's not right to persecute anybody, is it?""
As well as prejudice about people's colour, there is prejudice about people's social standing. There are strict divisions along class lines in Maycomb society. For example...
Aunt Alexandra is obsessed with the superiority of the Finch family, part of the local
. She doesn't allow Scout to play with Walter Cunningham because ...
- poor farmers, badly hit by the Depression. However they are a better class of people than....
- the lowest class of whites - uneducated and poor. But even they look down upon ...
The black community is automatically seen as at the bottom of the class system, yet since the abolition of slavery, the boundaries between them and the Ewells is less clear. This is one reason why Mr Ewell is so racist.
Finally, there is prejudice against anyone who doesn't fit in to Maycomb's fixed expectations of how people should behave. The most important victim of this type of prejudice is
Most of the town are prejudiced against Boo. Local gossip portrays him as a malevolent phantom. Children run past the Radley house out of fear and won't eat anything that came from Radley trees, believing them poisoned.
Yet a very few people accept him for what he is. Miss Maudie remembers him when he was a boy who always spoke nicely; and Atticus tries to make the children understand him and not torment him. By the end of the novel, the children respect him too.

The poem is set in a vast area of temporary accommodation called Dharavi on the outskirts of Mumbai, where millions of migrants have gathered from other parts of India and there is always a shortage of water because it is not an official living area.
But when a pipe bursts, when a water tanker goes past, there's always a little child running behind the water tanker getting the bits of drips and it's like money, it's like currency. In a hot country in that kind of climate, it's like a gift.

Both apologise for their past behaviour. Darcy admits he was proud, but says Elizabeth changed him. Elizabeth says she changed after reading his letter. Darcy admits he persuaded Bingley to see Jane again.
As Mrs Bennet wants Jane and Bingley to be alone, she sends Elizabeth out to walk with Darcy, apologising for doing so. In the evening, Darcy goes to get permission for the marriage from Mr Bennet.

Of course, Mrs Bennet's opinion of Darcy changes immediately when she finds out he wants to marry Elizabeth.

GCSE coursework. Some tasks are written and some are part of speaking and listening. However, the basic approach to the play, the skills you need and even the basic topics can be very similar.
There are two important points to remember:
Your teacher will decide your title. Perhaps you may be able to alter it or even agree a new topic, but the title that is finally chosen is the one you must answer. This is the one you will be marked on, so make sure it is the one you write or talk about.
Secondly, concentrate on what is relevant. You do not have to include lots of background or include details about the life of Shakespeare to write a brilliant essay. All you need to do is focus on the question and include information about the plot, characters, themes, dramatic effects and language. Let's have a look at a few typical
Typical questions ask you to show how a character develops during the play, or how a theme is presented in the play, or look closely at a scene in the play. So we might have tasks like:
How does Othello change during the course of the play?
How is the theme of jealousy dealt with in
How is drama created in Act 3, Scene 3?
What is the role of Iago in
Each of these tasks mentions one main topic - for example, the first is about Othello, so it's about character. However, you will also have to deal with a number of other topics in your answer. For instance, you should look at how he speaks, so you are looking at language. You could also look at his part in the plot, how he is used for dramatic effect and the themes he talks about. We could look at each question in the same way.
For instance, an answer to question 3 above should cover what Act 3, Scene 3 adds to the overall plot, the characters in the scene, the dramatic effects (that is the main part of the question!), the themes in the scene and the language the characters use.
In other words, try to look at a range of topics in your answer. Markers are always pleased to see answers which cover plot, character, dramatic effect, theme and language.
Once you have planned your answer, you can start writing the first draft. Remember, this is coursework so you might be able to write a number of drafts, making each one better as you develop your answer. However, many people worry about starting their answer - they aren't sure where they should start - and so they include a lot which is not asked for or needed. For instance, you might know a lot about the background to the play or about Shakespeare's life, but is it really relevant? Let's compare two ways of starting to answer the question 'What is the role of Iago in
Othello is a play by Shakespeare. It is set in Venice and Cyprus and is about how revenge drives a man towards destruction. The play was probably first performed in London around 1604. In Shakespeare's time the theatre was very different because no females were allowed to act so all the female roles, including Desdemona and Emilia, were played by males.
At first sight this looks okay. It is all correct and is about Othello. However, the person marking the essay already knows the play, and all the background details, and this introduction could be for any title. In fact, most markers would not give any marks so far because nothing about the question has been given. There is a much better way of starting your essay or talk, so let's look at version two.
The best way is to start answering your question straight away. It will help you focus on what is really important, and it will help you decide what extra ideas you need as you develop your answer to 'What is the role of Iago in
We meet Iago at the very start of the play and we quickly learn how angry he is at not being promoted. He is jealous of Cassio's appointment and asks whether he has any reason to 'love the Moor'. The answer is clear - he doesn't love him but will 'follow him' for his own purposes. However, we also learn that Iago's reason is not 'love or duty' but his 'peculiar end'. At this point in the play we cannot know how peculiar his motives are, but at the end of Act 1 his soliloquy tells us a lot more - he suspects his wife of having an affair with Othello and is determined to get his revenge.
This might be a first draft but already it has a good focus on the question. Working like this allows you to plan your answer around the question, which is far better than just writing everything you know about the play. Remember, there is nothing wrong with including extra detail but you only get marks for what is relevant.
The final thing to remember is there are lots of ways of answering the same question. You don't have to follow a set plan, or include things in a fixed order. It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters, dramatic effects, themes and language. Stick to what is relevant and don't be afraid to put a personal reaction in as well - it shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied ideas you have heard.
So imagine our task is 'How is the theme of jealousy dealt with in
? There are all sorts of ways of answering this - one answer might start with different aspects of jealousy, another answer with the language of jealousy and another with the dramatic effects created. However, try to plan the start of an answer using the character of Othello as the focus. Once you've done that, compare your ideas with the answer below.
'How is the theme of jealousy dealt with in
Perhaps the most obvious characteristic of Othello is his jealousy. He loves Desdemona, his wife, calling her 'his soul's joy' but is quickly manipulated by Iago into suspecting her. Iago simply asks a few leading questions, then tries to not answer Othello's questions, or answers them ambiguously. For instance, he is asked for his thoughts, but just says, 'Think, my Lord?' In not saying anything, he is sowing the seeds of doubt in Othello's mind. Someone else would probably ignore this, but I think it is important for Othello - he is a general, he expects his wife to be as obedient as his soldiers, and the idea that she isn't starts to torment him.
By this time the audience are well aware that Iago is plotting against Othello. His soliloquies have told us of his hatred of 'the Moor' yet Othello seems blind to this. Even when Iago actually tells the truth and uses personification to warn Othello of the 'green-eyed monster' of jealousy, and that it will 'mock the meat it feeds on', Othello is unaware of what is happening.
This is only the start of the task and there is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction because it keeps to the point as well as using a range of relevant details combined with personal thoughts.

Jewish attitudes to war and peace are based on the teachings of the Jewish Scriptures.
In the Jewish Scriptures there are examples of wars. Some of these were Holy Wars where the Jews were trying to maintain their religion when other people wanted to make them worship false gods. Others were perhaps Just Wars but it could be argued that some of them were wrong and unjustified.

4532,"The title of each poem shows the importance of the Field Mouse and the Perch: as we read, we realise that each is a symbol.
The field mouse is a symbol of all things vulnerable to outside attack, while the perch are a symbol of the few things that remain unchanged in today's world.
Clarke emphasises how weak the field mouse is in contrast to man, but Heaney sees the fish as independent and unaffected by man.
So, Field Mouse has a threatening tone, whereas Perch has a lighter, warmer tone.
Both poems celebrate a favourite waterside scene containing trees and wildlife. Clare writes entirely from his point of view, but Heaney manages to show things from his perspective and the perspective of the perch.
Both are written in rhyming couplets. Clare uses no punctuation at all and Heaney uses punctuation sparingly so as not to interrupt the flow of the poem.
The scene in Sonnet is very relaxed, with gentle descriptions of the Moor Hen and insects that sport, but Heaney suggests the strength of the perch too, all muscle and slur.
Again, the title shows the focus of the poems. Tennyson is more precise: he is writing about The Eagle, rather than Perch in general.
Both poets show us the creature's point of view. The Eagle, from his high crag, sees the wrinkled sea beneath him, while the perch see the water-roof above them.
Both creatures are utterly at home in their sphere. This is shown humorously by Heaney - carpets of Bann stream - and majestically by Tennyson - Ring'd with the azure world, he stands.
Both show the power of the creature: Heaney uses military imagery, bluntly holding the pass, while for Tennyson the eagle is like a thunderbolt.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

Well, the poem celebrates both these things - fluidity

An important idea in this poem (apart from the detailed, powerful description of the perch in the river) is the relationship between permanence and change. Heaney uses the flowing river-water and the stationary fish as a

Heaney seems fond of the perch. Although he recognises their strength, he also describes them with gentle humour. Adoze suggests they are sleeping as they swim, while Guzzling is an affectionate word, sometimes used to describe babies drinking.

The world is described in terms of water, flowing on. This suggests that Heaney sees things as always moving and changing.

7340,"is often described as a novel of 'manners'. Put simply, it's about how people interact, and how the feelings you show in public can often be very different to your true feelings.
Jane Austen originally called the novel '
'. This is because the two main characters, Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, form very strong opinions of each other based on their first impressions, and these affect the way they act.
The Bennet family (Mr and Mrs Bennet and their five daughters: Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia) live in Longbourn, Hertfordshire. They discuss the expected arrival of Charles Bingley, a rich young man who'll soon be living at a nearby estate called Netherfield. Mrs Bennet wants her husband to go to meet him, as he might make a good husband for one of her daughters. Marrying them off is her main concern in life.
Mr Bennet visits Bingley, but doesn't let his wife know and teases her about it. She becomes annoyed, before being pleased when he reveals he's spoken to him.
Bingley brings some friends from London to attend a ball at his house. Fitzwilliam Darcy is a close friend and impressive figure, especially as he's even wealthier than Bingley. Darcy will only dance with Bingley's sisters (Mrs Hurst and Miss Bingley).
Bingley, who's been dancing with Jane Bennet, tries to get Darcy to dance with others, and points out Elizabeth. Darcy coldly and arrogantly rejects the idea, saying Elizabeth isn't good looking enough for him. She overhears this but laughs it off with her friends.
Elizabeth and Jane talk about the ball and the Bingleys. Jane likes everyone, but Elizabeth is suspicious of the Bingley sisters. Bingley likes his new neighbours - Darcy doesn't.
We meet the Lucas family. Elizabeth is close friends with the daughter, Charlotte. Mrs Bennet is still very happy about Bingley liking Jane, though still angry about Mr Darcy's rudeness.
The Bingley sisters are nice to Jane, but not genuine. Jane meanwhile doesn't want to show her true feelings for their brother. Charlotte thinks it will help if she does, but Elizabeth explains that she isn't like that.
The Lucases have a party and Sir William Lucas tries to get Darcy to dance with Elizabeth. Darcy is put on the spot and agrees, but Elizabeth coldly refuses. This surprises Darcy - and he becomes attracted to her.
We learn that the Bennets' property is '
', meaning that because there's no male child in the family it will be handed down to a distant relative on the event of Mr Bennet's death.
Lydia and Kitty have been socialising with soldiers in nearby Meryton. The Bingley sisters invite Jane to dinner. Mrs Bennet makes her go by horse, which means if it rains she'll have to stay overnight. Jane gets soaked, catches a bad cold and has to stay. A worried Elizabeth walks three miles to visit her. Darcy is impressed. Elizabeth agrees to stay with Jane.
Miss Caroline Bingley and Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy
Elizabeth can tell the Bingley sisters don't really care about Jane. When Elizabeth leaves the room, Miss Bingley criticises her. But Mr Bingley defends both Elizabeth and Jane.
Darcy briefly says the walk made Elizabeth's eyes look nice. However, he also says that because of her relatively lowly status she and her sisters will find it difficult to marry well.
Mrs Bennet visits Jane and makes obvious

s about her daughter and Bingley. A discussion about 'character' takes place, with Elizabeth explaining that she studies people. Darcy makes a point that she can't have much opportunity to do this in the country. Mrs Bennet loudly disagrees and embarrasses herself - and Elizabeth.
Elizabeth and Darcy engage in a heated discussion. He watches her closely as Miss Bingley plays the piano. Elizabeth thinks he's finding fault with her, but because she doesn't like him she doesn't care. He asks her to dance but she again refuses, thinking it's a trick. Miss Bingley (who likes Darcy) is becoming jealous of Elizabeth and makes comments about her and her family to try to put him off.
Miss Bingley tries to get Darcy's attention, although he isn't really bothered. She even walks around in front of him and, when this doesn't work, asks Elizabeth to join her. Darcy then becomes interested. He and Elizabeth engage in some more verbal sparring, and discuss each other's faults. She feels he hates everyone; he feels she deliberately misunderstands people.
Jane and Elizabeth return home, much to their mother's disappointment. Darcy is relieved, as he's starting to like Elizabeth more than he feels he should. He's also realised that Miss Bingley likes him, so resolves to put her off by not having much to do with her.
Mr Bennet tells his family to expect a visit from his cousin, Mr Collins - the relative who'll own the house after he passes away. Collins wrote him a
letter a month ago, mentioning a proposal. From his letter, Elizabeth believes he must be a strange man, and her father even hopes he will be. Collins arrives and acts very formally.
Collins gradually reveals himself to be a strange sort of social climber - very humble with regards to his patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, but full of himself. He's a ridiculous figure, although he tries to be nice.
Collins' character is developed further: he lacks common sense, and his education hasn't helped. He liked Jane at first, but switches to Elizabeth, which shows he lacks real feelings.
The girls walk to Meryton with Collins, and on the way they meet a soldier, George Wickham. Darcy and Bingley pass them and it's apparent that Darcy knows Wickham but they aren't friends.
Elizabeth meets Wickham at her aunt's house and he mentions Darcy, saying they were boyhood friends but Darcy cheated him out of a career in the Church. Elizabeth willingly believes the tale, especially as Wickham is attractive and well mannered. He confirms Darcy is a proud man. We also learn that Collins' patron, the very wealthy and upper-class Lady Catherine, is Darcy's aunt. She wants Darcy to marry her daughter.
Jane doesn't believe Wickham's story. She's invited to a Netherfield ball and asks Collins to go with her, not expecting him to agree. He does, and asks her for the first two dances; she wanted to dance with Wickham. Collins is interested in Elizabeth.
Wickham doesn't turn up and Elizabeth blames Darcy. She's annoyed further by Collins' poor dancing. Darcy asks her to dance and she is so surprised she agrees. But she's

against him, so mentions Wickham. Jane and Bingley are getting on well, but her family embarrass her in various ways.
Collins, encouraged by Mrs Bennet, proposes to Elizabeth. She refuses. Collins is surprised but not totally downcast, because he believes it's all part of the 'game'.
Mrs Bennet is angry with Elizabeth for refusing Collins, but Mr Bennet is pleased. Charlotte Lucas arrives and spends time with Collins.
Collins hardly speaks to Elizabeth, who then goes to Meryton, where she meets Wickham. He tells her he didn't go to the ball because of Darcy.
Jane receives a letter from Miss Bingley saying her family are moving away and not coming back, hinting that Bingley will marry Darcy's sister. Elizabeth believes these are Miss Bingley's wishes rather than her brother's, and tells Jane he loves her.
Collins proposes to Charlotte, who accepts, not out of love or even respect, but because he can look after her financially. Elizabeth is shocked.
Mrs Bennet is upset by the news. And we discover that Charlotte and Elizabeth aren't as close as they were. Meanwhile, Bingley's continued absence starts to worry Elizabeth.
Jane receives another letter from Miss Bingley that's similar to the last one. Jane's devastated, but still tries to be positive and speaks kindly of Bingley. Darcy's supposed treatment of Wickham is now widely known in the area; only Jane defends him.
The Gardiners visit the Bennets. Mr Gardiner is Mrs Bennet's brother. He's more sensible and intelligent, though. Mrs Gardiner is a friend to Jane and Elizabeth.
Mrs Gardiner tries to persuade Elizabeth not to fall in love with Wickham, as he has little money. Wickham turns his attention to Miss King, a wealthy heiress. Charlotte marries Collins. Jane, at Mrs Gardiner's invitation, goes to London, and sees Miss Bingley isn't really her friend.
Elizabeth sets out to visit Charlotte in Kent, and visits her aunt in London on the way. Her aunt criticises Wickham's behaviour with Miss King; Elizabeth defends him.
Elizabeth arrives at the Collins' home. He shows off, as if to make Elizabeth see what she missed out on. She just feels sorry for Charlotte. Miss de Bourgh passes by to deliver an invitation to dinner, but won't come in and is rude, making Charlotte stand out in the cold. Elizabeth notices Miss de Bourgh looks weak and thinks she'll make a good wife for Darcy.
They all dine at Rosings, the De Bourgh's residence. Lady Catherine is very arrogant and opinionated. However, Elizabeth, unlike others, isn't overawed. Lady Catherine is surprised at her independence.
Elizabeth discovers Lady Catherine rules the parish. Darcy arrives with his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam.
Colonel Fitzwilliam enjoys talking to Elizabeth, but Lady Catherine butts in to make herself the centre of attention again. Elizabeth sings and impresses. She criticises Darcy for not dancing at the first ball they went to. Although he defends himself, he's more polite than before, not that Elizabeth notices. He praises her singing. Elizabeth notices he isn't really bothered about Miss de Bourgh.

when Darcy calls. She asks him about Bingley. Darcy says only that he might not return. He then makes a bold statement, saying Elizabeth can't always have been at Longbourn, meaning he thinks she's better than her relatives and neighbours. Charlotte comes in and he goes quiet. Elizabeth and Charlotte try to understand Darcy's motives. The reader can see (though not Elizabeth) that Darcy is falling in love with her.
Elizabeth keeps 'bumping into' Darcy. Fitzwilliam, although attracted to Elizabeth, tells her he must marry into money. He also says that Darcy recently saved someone from an unwise marriage. Elizabeth believes he means Bingley and Jane. Elizabeth becomes upset when alone. She hates Darcy for ruining her sister's hopes, which she feels is all because of his sense of pride.
Elizabeth is on her own and reads sad letters from Jane, which make her even more angry and upset. Darcy comes in and seems nervous. He says he's struggled against his feelings but can't help himself - he loves her. He expects to be accepted and goes further, saying he's had to overcome the thought of her socially
family. Elizabeth replies harshly, and doesn't even thank him. Enraged, he asks what he's done to deserve such harshness. She blames him for Jane's unhappiness and Wickham's poverty. They argue in a heated but formal way, then he leaves.
Darcy takes a letter to Elizabeth. He explains he didn't think Jane loved Bingley, and again mentions the embarrassing relatives - not including Jane or Elizabeth. He apologises. As for Wickham, he'd asked Darcy for money instead of going into the Church and Darcy had given him it. When he'd spent it all, he came back to ask for the Church job and Darcy had refused, as he knew Wickham was immoral. Also, last summer, Wickham had tried to run off with Darcy's sister, Georgiana, who was only 15. He signs off
After reading the letter several times, Elizabeth realises she's been prejudiced against Darcy. She feels ashamed.
Elizabeth thinks more favourably of Darcy, but less so of her family, whom she starts to resent for their behaviour.
Elizabeth leaves Charlotte, and feels sorry for her. Elizabeth meets Jane again in London.
Elizabeth and Jane return to Longbourn to news that Wickham's regiment is moving to Brighton. Lydia behaves in a foolish manner, and even suggests going to Brighton.
Elizabeth tells Jane about Darcy's proposal and the truth about Wickham. As he's leaving anyway, they decide not to tell anyone. Jane still misses Bingley.
Mrs Bennet and the younger daughters want to go to Brighton, but Mr Bennet says 'no'. Lydia is invited by a friend. Mr Bennet allows it, saying no one will be interested in her because she has no money. Elizabeth pleads for the family to be seen with dignity. She sees Wickham and tells him she now appreciates Darcy more after seeing him recently. Wickham says Darcy is still proud.
We find out about the Bennets' own marriage. Mr Bennet fell for his wife's looks, although his feelings for her soon wore off after marriage. This, along with the Collins marriage, teaches Elizabeth a lesson.
She was going to the Lake District with the Gardiners, but the plans change and they only go as far north as Derbyshire. Mrs Gardiner suggests a visit to Darcy's estate, Pemberley, and Elizabeth agrees, as Darcy is away.
Lyme Park in Cheshire, the setting for Pemberley
The housekeeper shows them around Pemberley. Elizabeth thinks how nice it would've been to live there. Then again, her family wouldn't have been allowed to visit, due to Darcy's pride.
The housekeeper praises Darcy in every regard, saying how kind and generous he is to everyone, even servants, although he's naturally quiet. This makes Elizabeth feel even more warmly towards him. On leaving, they meet Darcy and the atmosphere is very uneasy. He's very polite and Elizabeth is affected by this. Darcy meets them in the park later and is very gracious. He invites Elizabeth to meet his sister.
Georgiana Darcy is shy. Bingley appears. Elizabeth sees that Miss Bingley was lying when she said her brother was in love with Darcy's sister. She sees that Bingley regrets leaving Netherfield. Darcy's kindness extends to inviting Elizabeth's family to Pemberley. Elizabeth feels grateful that Darcy doesn't resent her.
Mrs Gardiner and Elizabeth visit Georgiana. Things are awkward because she's very quiet. The Bingley sisters are there, and rude. Miss Bingley jealously tries to stop any relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy by mentioning Wickham. She doesn't know about Wickham and Georgiana; Darcy and his sister are embarrassed. When Elizabeth leaves, Miss Bingley criticises her, but Darcy says he thinks the opposite.
Elizabeth receives letters from Jane telling her Wickham has ran away with Lydia, and Mr Bennet is going to London to look for them. Elizabeth is very upset and tells Darcy she should have realised Wickham was bad. Darcy is silent; Elizabeth believes he now thinks less of her. Elizabeth and the Gardiners set off home.
The Gardiners try to persuade Elizabeth that Wickham might intend to marry Lydia. Elizabeth knows this isn't the case and tells them the truth about him. Elizabeth arrives home to find her mother depressed, and reads a letter Lydia has written to Mrs Forster that simply reflects how foolish she is.
Everyone now has a bad opinion of Wickham. Collins writes and says it would have been better if Lydia had died, adding that the girls' marriage prospects were now poor. We learn that Wickham owes a lot of money in Brighton. Mr Bennet returns, but his wife stupidly wants him to fight Wickham.
Mr Gardiner reports that Wickham and Lydia have been found unmarried, but a marriage settlement has been agreed. Elizabeth and her father realise Wickham has been offered a lot of money. They believe it must have been Mr Gardiner. Mrs Bennet's mood changes instantly and she believes it to be a good marriage. Elizabeth is completely fed up with her mother's stupidity.
Elizabeth believes Darcy wouldn't want to marry a Bennet because Wickham has. Wickham is to be sent to another regiment in the north of England.
Lydia and Wickham visit Longbourn; neither are sorry. Lydia is completely unaware of how much trouble she's caused everyone. She even says to Jane that she's now below her in status, as Lydia is married. Elizabeth is furious and knows Wickham has only married Lydia for money.
In telling all about her wedding day, Lydia lets it slip that Darcy was present (this was supposed to be a secret). Elizabeth writes to Mrs Gardiner asking about Darcy and the wedding.
Mrs Gardiner explains Darcy's involvement. Darcy found Wickham and arranged to pay his debts and give him cash if he married Lydia. Lydia had refused to leave Wickham. Darcy and Mr Gardiner arranged the wedding. Darcy said he did it because it was his fault for not exposing Wickham earlier. Mrs Gardiner says he did it for Elizabeth.
Elizabeth is overcome by the news, but still can't be sure if Darcy did this for her. She feels worse about how she treated him in the past. Elizabeth and Wickham have a conversation and he realises she knows all about him.
Mrs Bennet is sorry to see Lydia leave. She cheers up when she hears Bingley is returning.
Bingley and Darcy visit the Bennets. Jane and Elizabeth are uncomfortable. Darcy is mainly silent and avoids eye contact. Elizabeth is ashamed of her mother, and again letdown by her stupidity when she talks and talks about Lydia's marriage. Bingley accepts an invitation to dine at Longbourn.
At dinner, Bingley sits by Jane and they renew their friendship. Darcy sits far from Elizabeth. Instead, he sits next to her mother, who can't hide her dislike of him.
Jane Bennet and Bingley leaving Longbourn in a horse-drawn carriage after their wedding
Mrs Bennet is very obvious when trying to arrange for Jane and Bingley to be alone. Darcy has gone to London; Bingley goes shooting with Mr Bennet. Elizabeth mistakenly interrupts an intimate moment between Bingley and Jane. Bingley goes to get permission to marry Jane from her father. Mrs Bennet then spreads the good news.
Lady Catherine astonishes the Bennets by visiting them and speaks to Elizabeth alone. She accuses Elizabeth of spreading rumours that her nephew, Darcy, is to marry her (Elizabeth). Elizabeth doesn't reply. Lady Catherine then informs her Darcy is engaged to her own daughter, because this has been the family plan for years. Elizabeth tells her it's up to individuals to make their own choices.
Lady Catherine makes it clear Elizabeth is a social nobody and orders her not to get engaged to Darcy. Elizabeth refuses, and says her life has nothing to do with her. Lady Catherine leaves in a foul temper.
Elizabeth is unsettled by the argument and believes Lady Catherine will persuade Darcy not to marry her. Mr Bennet reads her a letter he's received from Mr Collins, congratulating him on his daughter's proposed marriage to Darcy but trying to persuade him against agreeing, as Lady Catherine would be displeased. Mr Bennet laughs at the ridiculous idea of the marriage. Elizabeth joins in, but is hurt inside.
Darcy and Bingley again visit Longbourn and go for a walk with Elizabeth, Jane and Kitty. Elizabeth is left alone with Darcy and thanks him for all his efforts with Lydia and Wickham. He says it was meant to be a secret and that he did it for her. He says his feelings and wishes are still the same. Elizabeth says her feelings have changed, and that she accepts his proposal. Both apologise for their past behaviour. Darcy admits he was proud, but says Elizabeth changed him. Elizabeth says she changed after reading his letter. Darcy admits he persuaded Bingley to see Jane again.
As Mrs Bennet wants Jane and Bingley to be alone, she sends Elizabeth out to walk with Darcy, apologising for doing so. In the evening, Darcy goes to get permission for the marriage from Mr Bennet. Mr Bennet talks with Elizabeth as, not knowing the truth, he still believes Darcy to be proud. His daughter soon clears things up. Of course, Mrs Bennet's opinion of Darcy changes immediately when she finds out he wants to marry Elizabeth.
Darcy explains the reasons for his love for Elizabeth and says he was quiet earlier because he didn't know how to deal with his strong feelings. Lady Catherine's actions simply encouraged him to ask again.
Bingley and Jane leave Netherfield after a year and move to live 30 miles from Pemberley. Lydia receives money from Elizabeth; Darcy helps Wickham in his career. Georgiana grows close to her sister-in-law. Mr Bennet and the Gardiners visit Pemberley often, and even Lady Catherine goes there too.

Funeral rites are very important for two reasons:
They show respect for the dead and, in some religions, include various ceremonies which people believe are necessary to ensure that people go on to whatever their next life will be.
Perhaps more importantly, they give the relatives and friends of the deceased time to mourn and show their grief in a certain way. People often say that showing their grief formally helps them to get over their loss.

In 1838, the Anti-Corn Law League was set up by Manchester factory owners
The main aim of this new league was to get rid of the Corn Laws. Many factory owners wanted the Corn Laws to end because they were forced to pay workers higher wages and many countries were refusing to buy British goods because Britain would not buy their food. The Anti-Corn Law League was more successful than Chartism because it was more organised and as the movement grew in Britain, Parliament was forced to listen to them.
These were the tactics that the Anti-Corn Law League used:
who paid 500 to join the league.
to travel around the country giving talks about the problems associated with the Corn Laws.
Two things eventually led Parliament to repeal the Corn Laws. The first was the fact that the prime minister, Robert Peel, was the son of a factory owner. The second was the effects of the Irish famine on Britain.

The bubbles of gas collect in the top of the gas jar and push the water out of the bottom. If enough gas is produced it completely replaces the water in the gas jar. A glass lid is then slid under the gas jar, which is then removed from the trough of water and turned the right way up.
This works well for insoluble gases such as hydrogen, or gases that do not dissolve easily in water, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. Ammonia and chlorine are readily soluble in water and are not collected this way.

Varro blamed creatures too tiny to be seen.
Columella blamed poisonous vapours in the swamps.
All these ideas survived until the 19th century.
Galen based most of his information about anatomy on what he saw when he dissected the bodies of animals. This led him to make mistakes. Some of his errors were:
He thought that muscles attach to the bone in the same way in humans and in dogs.
He thought that blood was created in the liver. He realised that it flowed round the body, but said it was burned up as fuel for the muscles.
He thought he saw holes through the septum, which allowed the blood to flow from one side of the heart to the other.
He made mistakes about the blood vessels in the brain.
He thought the human jaw-bone was made up of two bones, like a dog's.

Both contain conflict, but in Cold Knap Lake it is between the rescued girl and her parents, rather than between Clarke and her mother.
Clarke portrays her mother as a heroine in Cold Knap Lake. We are not told Catrin's feelings for her mother when she forbids her to go skating, but she is unlikely to see her in such glowing terms!
Yeats: The Song of the Old Mother
Both poems deal with the conflict between generations
...but in Yeats's poem there is no love. (Do you think that the struggles that Catrin and Clarke have experienced together actually increased their love?)
Both are written from the mother's point of view.
Catrin has a looser structure, while The Song is tightly structured. What could this suggest?
Both poems are from the mother's point of view and show that motherhood can be painful.
Yet while Margaret laments because she does not know what has happened to her beloved Son; Clarke suffers because of the tension between her and Catrin.
Both compare the child they knew (Margaret's the Young One) with the grown child; both show their pride in their offspring. Margaret's son was among the prime in worth, Catrin has a rosy, Defiant glare.
There is a sense of mystery in Wordsworth's poem, as no one knows the fate of the son; we pity Margaret. We sense the warmth in Clarke's relationship with Catrin, however.

You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison.

The Austrians were determined on war and the Germans made no effort to stop them. Russian mobilisation (July 30) was followed by German mobilisation. Germany declared war on Russia (August 1) and on France (August 3). The German ultimatum to Belgium, demanding free passage for German troops through Belgium, brought in Britain on August 4, 1914.

The cartoon shows what the nations were committed to each other by their treaty alliances in July 1914. However, it does not describe the actual events accurately. Although in the event Austria did attack Serbia, Russia did mobilise against Austria, and Germany did attack Russia, the cartoon is incorrect to show France and Britain then attacking Germany France came into the war because Germany declared war on it, and Britain came into the war to defend Belgium, not Russia.

He found that when he bred red-flowered plants with white-flowered plants, all the offspring produced red flowers. If he bred these plants with each other, most of the offspring had red flowers, but some had white. This was because the allele for red flowers is dominant, and the allele for white flowers is recessive. Genetic diagrams help to show how this works.
In a genetic diagram, you show all of the possible alleles for a particular characteristic. There will be two alleles from one parent, and two from the other parent, making four altogether. You then draw lines to show all the possible ways that these alleles could be paired in the offspring. There will be four possible ways, but some or all of them could be repeated.

Questions included in the survey must be relevant. A few well worded questions are a lot more useful than a long list of poorly-worded questions.
Here are some tips on writing questions:
Questions must be easy to understand. If people don't understand your questions, you'll find that they will not give the answers you want.
Think carefully about the wording of each question. This will ensure the respondents interpret the questions the way you intend.
Always test your questions on a friend or family member first. This will help identify questions that are poorly written.

White face powder was popular in the 16th-18th centuries, partly to cover up bad skin caused by lack of washing.
Today, a lot of women (and some men) wear make-up every day, but it's often quite discreet. If your drama is set in modern times, it's unlikely you'll want to go over the top with make-up. Think about your character and their personality before you decide how heavily you want to apply it.

East Germany was the Soviet zone of Germany. In 1949, they set up a Communist-controlled state called the German Democratic Republic.
In the 1945 elections, a Communist-led coalition was elected to power. The Communists gradually took over and in 1947 they abolished the monarchy.
Stalin had promised to set up a joint Communist/non-Communist government at Yalta, but then he invited 16 non-Communist leaders to Moscow and arrested them. Thousands of non-Communists were arrested, and the Communists won the 1947 election.
The non-communists won the 1945 elections with Zoltan Tildy as president. However, the Communists' leader, Rakosi, took control of the secret police (the AVO), and executed and arrested his opponents. Tildy was forced to resign and Cardinal Mindzenty, head of the Catholic Church, was imprisoned. By 1948, Rakosi had complete control of Hungary.
A coalition government was set up and led by the non-Communist Benes. However, the Communists' leader Gottwald made sure they controlled the radio, the army and the police. Gottwald became prime minister and set up a secret police force. Non-Communists were arrested. In 1948, Communist workers went on strike, the non-Communist minister Masaryk committed suicide and Gottwald took over the government.

A tree diagram which represent a coin being tossed three times looks like this :
From the tree diagram, we can see that there are eight possible outcomes. To find out the probability of a particular outcome, we need to look at all the available paths (set of branches).
The sum of the probabilities for any set of branches is always 1.

Picture courtesy of Mary Evans Picture Library
For Blake, buildings, especially church buildings, often symbolised confinement, restriction and failure. In this poem, the lines
""the Chimney-sweeper's cry / Every blackening church appals""
provide an association which reveals the speaker's attitude. Money is spent on church buildings while children live in poverty, forced to clean chimneys - the soot from which blackens the church walls. To Blake, this makes a mockery of the love and care that should characterise the Christian religion.
church walls are also linked to the running of

The poem as a whole suggests Blake sees the rapid urbanisation in Britain at the time as a dangerous force. Children are no longer free to enjoy childhood; instead working in dangerous conditions. Charters restrict freedoms, ultimately resulting in the restriction of thinking.
The poem is pessimistic. It is without hope for the future.

In the UK about 300,000 people have a heart attack every year.
Smoking can increase the risk of heart disease
Heart disease is not usually caused by micro-organisms. It is caused by:
genetic factors, which show as a family history of heart disease
Heart disease is more common in the UK than in non-industrialised countries, and many other industrialised nations. This is due to
stress leading to a fast heart rate
from 2006 about research showing that people with heart disease have arteries which are, biologically, up to 40 years older than they are.
A lack of exercise and a diet that is high in salt and saturated fat cause people to:
have high levels of cholesterol in their blood
These factors contribute to an increased risk of heart disease.
Epidemiology is the study of factors affecting the health and illness of populations. Doctors and scientists carry out epidemiological studies to try to determine the lifestyle factors that could increase the chances of getting heart disease and other illnesses. When carrying out a study, it would be morally wrong to get people to smoke to find out if smoking causes lung cancer. However, there are people who already smoke and their health can be compared with that of non-smokers.
from 2005 about a study from Norway. It showed that smoking just one to four cigarettes a day almost triples the risk of dying from heart disease.
, researchers examine two groups of people: those with an illness, and those without. They can do this by:
following the cohorts progress over several months or years
For example, the health of smokers and non-smokers was followed for many years. It was found that, on average, smokers die ten years earlier.
Using the example of how lifestyle factors can affect the risk of heart disease, you need to be able to:
Give an example of a correlation between a factor and an outcome. For example, wealthier nations have higher levels of heart disease.
Suggest factors that might increase the chances of an outcome, but not necessarily determine an outcome. For example, the more cigarettes a person smokes, the more likely they are to develop heart disease. However, some people who smoke never go on to develop heart disease.
Explain that individual cases do not provide convincing evidence for or against a correlation. For instance, we might hear someone say, ""Old George smoked 60 cigarettes every day of his life and lived to be 90."" However, we know that Old George was just lucky, because smoking 60 cigarettes a day seriously reduces your chances of living into old age. A correlation exists between life expectancy and the number of cigarettes smoked each day.
Evaluate how a study is designed by commenting on the sample size and how well the sample is matched. For example, to show that eating fatty foods increases the chances of developing heart disease, we need to compare a large sample size of people who eat fatty food with an equally large sample size of people who do not. The two samples also need to be chosen at random, or matched as closely as possible for other factors such as age, sex, and so on.
Using the example of how lifestyle factors can affect the risk of heart disease, you need to be able to:
Explain why a correlation between a factor and an outcome does not necessarily mean that one causes the other. For example, wealthier nations have higher levels of heart disease. However, this does not mean that wealth is a cause of heart disease, even though a correlation between the two exists. To find the cause, we need to have more scientific data.
Use data to show that a factor does, or does not, increase the chances of an outcome. In the examination, this data may be presented in the form of tables or charts.
Identify a mechanism that could be a
between a factor and an outcome. For instance, cigarette smoke contains chemicals that, when breathed in, can increase blood pressure and lead to heart damage. The chemicals in the smoke are the mechanism of the causal link.
When scientific data has been collected, it is important that this data and any conclusions are reviewed by other scientists. This is called 'peer review'.
Using the example of how lifestyle factors can affect the risk of heart disease, you need to be able to:
Describe the peer review process. For instance, state that other scientists repeat the experiment to see if they get similar results and conclusions.
Understand that new scientific claims are less reliable if they have not yet been evaluated by peer review. For example, remarkable claims are being made for 'superfoods', such as that they prevent heart disease and increase longevity. However, many of the claims have not yet been peer reviewed, so they should not be treated as totally reliable.
Understand that if the results of an investigation have not been replicated by other scientists, they should be treated with suspicion.
Using the example of how lifestyle factors can affect the risk of heart disease, you need to be able to explain why scientists think it is important that a claim by one scientist should be replicated by other scientists. This is because the first set of results may contain errors. When scientific research is being paid for by a company with a vested interest, such a food company producing a food that is claimed to lower cholesterol, the results that support the claim need to be examined and replicated to make sure that they are correct.

Vaccination involves putting a small amount of an inactive form of a pathogen into the body. Vaccines can contain:
live pathogens treated to make them harmless
a type of natural poison produced by an organism, often as a form of protection
Foreign organisms that get into the body, and trigger an immune response.
. When injected into the body, they stimulate white blood cells to produce antibodies to fight the pathogen.
The vaccine contains only a weakened or harmless version of a pathogen, which means that the vaccinated person is in no danger of developing the disease. Some people, however, may suffer a mild reaction. If the person later becomes infected with the pathogen, the required

Vaccinations in early childhood can offer protection against many serious diseases. Sometimes more than one vaccine is given at a time, like the MMR triple vaccine against mumps, measles and rubella.
Sometimes vaccine boosters are required because the immune response memory weakens over time. Anti-tetanus injections may need to be repeated every ten years, for example.
There is often a conflict between a persons right to decide what is best for themselves and their family, and what is best for society as a whole. For example, some people used to think the MMR vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella could cause autism in children. They decided not to risk letting their child have the vaccine and just hope they would not catch measles, mumps or rubella. But this meant that, as less and less children were vaccinated, the three diseases began to spread more easily and the number of cases began to increase. Therefore, a decision originally taken by a single individual had big implications for society as a whole.
Vaccinations can never be completely safe because side-effect levels vary. So, when making a decision, these are some of the factors that should be considered:
When fewer people are vaccinated, the number of cases of the disease increases.
The chance of falling seriously ill or dying from the disease may be far greater than the chance of experiencing a serious side-effect.
Using a vaccine may be much cheaper than treating a very ill person.

The play opens as three witches plan a meeting with the Scottish nobleman Macbeth, who at that moment is fighting in a great battle. When the battle is over, Macbeth and his friend Banquo come across the witches who offer them three predictions: that Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor and King of Scotland, and that Banquo's descendants will become kings.
Banquo laughs at the prophecies but Macbeth is excited, especially as soon after their meeting with the witches Macbeth is made Thane of Cawdor by King Duncan, in return for his bravery in the battle. He writes to his wife, Lady Macbeth, who is as excited as he is. A messenger tells Lady Macbeth that King Duncan is on his way to their castle and she invokes evil spirits to help her slay him. Macbeth is talked into killing Duncan by his wife and stabs him to death. No-one is quite sure who committed this murder and no-one feels safe, but Macbeth is crowned king.
Now that Macbeth is king he knows the second prediction from the witches has come true, but he starts to fear the third prediction (that Banquo's descendants will also be kings). Macbeth therefore decides to kill Banquo and his son, but the plan goes wrong - Banquo is killed but his son escapes. Macbeth then thinks he is going mad because he sees Banquo's ghost and receives more predictions from the witches. He starts to become ruthless and kills the family of Macduff, an important lord. Macbeth still thinks he is safe but one by one the witches' prophecies come true, Lady Macbeth cannot stop thinking about Duncan, becomes deranged and dies. A large army marches on Macbeth's castle and Macbeth is killed by Macduff.

It's not so easy to reply to this question! But each of us can act on a small scale by using less water, by sorting waste in order to recycle as much as possible, by saving energy, by buying products whose manufacture pollutes little or not at all.
Moi, je prends une douche plutt qu'un bain et je ne laisse pas couler l'eau du robinet quand je me brosse les dents. Chez nous, on trie les dchets et on jette les sachets en plastique, les bouteilles vides et le papier journal dans les bacs de collecte slective. Ce n'est pas difficile. Tout le monde en est capable.

It all depends on us. It is up to us to protect the Earth and the environment. We are going to end up polluting everything if we don't pay attention. If we want to avoid the total disappearance of all organisms, we must respect nature and change our attitude.

Rap uses the spoken word as a rhythmic instrument. Rap DJs often use scratching and back spinning on vinyl discs to create the sound style for the vocalist to rap over.
Its roots are in the toasting of Jamaican DJs who spoke over rhythm and blues records, and in New York black street culture - where it went together with graffiti art,Hip-Hop and Break Dancing (so called because of the break-beats or short rhythmic phrases mixed together by 1970s DJs).

Techno was a specific form of dance music - influenced by both Disco music and Dub - developed by DJs in the dance clubs of Detroit. It featured samples or cuts from tracks, loops and digital effects produced on synthesisers and computers - together with driving, repetitive drum-and-bass lines.
House music (named from the Warehouse club in Chicago) was developed by DJs out of Disco and Dub in the early 1980s. UK House hits of the late 1980s included 'Love Can't Turn Around' and 'Jack Your Body'. Records like this made stars of the DJs and engineers who produced and played the music.
A later spin-off was Acid House, which featured a wobbly baseline and trance-like sound and was very influential in the UK Rave scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
From the 1990s onwards electronic dance music spawned numerous variants including Techno Trance, Goa Trance, Dub, Hardcore and Gabba.

- Only certain file types are allowed. Make sure you plan in time to check that the software you are working with produces graphics of an acceptable format.
- With graphics software it's quite easy to come up with different solutions to a given problem. Try to set aside time to come up with different versions of a particular graphic - you can then use user feedback to select the best. Plan in time for all these things.
- Sometimes graphics can look different in different browsers (eg Internet Explorer, Netscape, Firefox), so plan to test your graphics in different browsers. This can be difficult, as your school may only have one browser installed.
- Make sure you are aware what each graphic is being produced for. You will need different approaches according to whether they are for being seen on screen or printed out.
- Good quality graphics would normally be printed out on specialist paper on specialist printers, not the sort of printers you get in most schools. See if you can arrange a visit to a professional print shop to find out about the different options for printing out graphics. Include this visit in your plan.
Dont start work on the project until you are quite confident with the software. If you don't know the features available to you, you will not be able to make effective plans.

). Pneumatic logic circuits work in a similar way to logic circuits in electronics, with pneumatic valves instead of electronic switches.
Logic circuits are often used to make pneumatic systems safe. For example some pneumatic drills will not work unless a guard is in place. The drill requires two switches to be operated in order to work: the first by putting the guard in place, the second by pressing start.
. In the diagram below, both three-port valve A and three-port valve B have to be pressed before the piston in the single-acting cylinder will outstroke. Valve B will have no air supply unless valve A is open. Valve B controls the air supply to the single-acting cylinder.
AND circuit - two valves in series
. The single acting cylinder will go positive if valve A OR valve B OR both of them are pressed. The shuttle valve provides the OR control. A T-piece may appear to do a similar job, but a T-piece would allow air to escape out of the exhaust port of the 3/2 that was not pressed.
OR circuit - two valves in parallel
It helps to think of valves as switches (as in electronics). Valves may be operated by different actuators (controls), for example push button, lever or roller trip, but they do the same thing: simply switch the output air on or off.

Historians have looked at the Cold War in many different ways over the years. Here are some statements about the Cold War in the 1950s and 1960s from modern school textbooks:
""Between 1949 and 1963, the Cold War developed with a series of major crises.""
""When Stalin died in 1953, there was a slight improvement in relations between East and West, although problems still existed.""
"" Khrushchev's blustering vigour, his love of travel and of argument and his willingness to take risks left their mark on these years.""
""The wall not only divided Berlin. Over the following years, it became a symbol of division - the division of Germany, the division of Europe, the division of communist East and democratic West. The Communists presented the wall as being a protective shell. The West presented it as a prison wall.""
""The Americans believed that it was their duty, and necessary to US security, to resist the expansion of communism wherever it occurred. During the 1960s, this led them to the brink of nuclear war.""
"" It soon became clear to the capitalist states that, despite co-existence, Khrushchev was determined to show that communism could compete with, and beat, the West.""
""The Cold War was a mixture of a religious crusade in favour of one ideology or the other and the most ruthless power politics.""

You can save and edit ideas, which makes it easier and cheaper to modify your design as you go along.
You can choose pre-drawn circuits or system blocks, which speeds up the process even further.
The software itself can be expensive so initial costs are high. There are free software packages though.
Staff need to be trained how to use the software, which also adds to costs.

In human beings, each gamete contains 23 chromosomes, half the number found in the other cells of the body. When the male and female gamete fuse, they become a zygote, which in turn becomes a new embryo containing the full 46 chromosomes  half from the father and half from the mother.

2958,"When we are talking about dramatic effect, we are basically talking about how we experience the play in a theatre.
The first thing to bear in mind is that the play is not meant to be real, or even look real. In Shakespeare's time all the actors would have been men. Even Hero and Beatrice were men dressed up as women. There were also very few props or scenery. This meant people in the audience had to use their imagination. It is almost like watching a pantomime nowadays: we know it is not real, but that is part of its charm.
Secondly, it is important to remember how people watch a play in the theatre. We cannot stop the actors to make a cup of tea, and there is no book to put down or DVD to pause. This seems obvious, but it is easy to forget.
For instance, in Act 4, Scene 1 we witness the build up to Hero and Claudio's wedding. Hero and her friends know nothing of Don John's plot and what has happened beforehand. However, the audience knows Claudio plan to reject her publicly. She will be alone and when this happens - even her father wishes she was dead. A theatre audience naturally feels sympathy for her. This is exactly what dramatic effect is all about - how feelings are created.

Walt Whitman, 1819 - 1892. Getty Images / Hulton Archive
Walt Whitman was born into a large family in New York in 1819 and brought up in Brooklyn. He had little schooling, beginning work as an office boy when young. He later became a writer and contributed to newspapers and magazines throughout America, including the frontier. He published
, his first and best known book of poems, in 1855.
He was active in politics as a Democrat. Through his writing, he hoped to stir up national feeling and encourage Americans to free themselves from their colonial past. During the Civil War (1861 - 1865) he volunteered to work in a hospital amongst the wounded and contracted an infection as a result. He was very moved by the suffering he saw.
He suffered a stroke in 1873 and moved to Camden, New Jersey, just inland from Barnegat. Barnegat is on the Atlantic coast in what is now called Ocean County and is a popular sailing base. It is possible that this poem was actually written in 1880 (not 1856, as stated in the

In the 5th century AD, waves of
such as the Goths, Vandals, Saxons and Vikings invaded western Europe. Europe disintegrated into a huge number of small fiefdoms, each governed by a local lord, who protected his peasants - owned by him as 'serfs'. These tiny states could not afford universities for study, or public health systems.
. During the Dark Ages, the monasteries alone managed to hang onto learning and knowledge, and even the ability to read and write. Many of the medical ideas of the Greeks and Romans were

Similarly, technology was limited, and much of the advanced technical knowledge of the Romans was lost.
Medieval Europeans believed in the Christian God, so politics and everyday life, as well as medicine, were dominated by the

After 1066, civilisation began to recover. Universities were established (eg in Paris in 1110, Oxford in 1167). Kings grew more powerful, and established courts as centres of culture and wealth. Trade and communications, especially, by sea, developed. Towns grew up, which created public health problems.

Groups with the same or similar needs and wants often divided by age, gender, income, lifestyle, and culture.
and why segments are important in marketing.
Just as you can divide an orange up into segments you can divide the population as a whole into different groups of people or
Groups with the same or similar needs and wants often divided by age, gender, income, lifestyle, and culture.
that have something in common. Segmenting the market makes it easier to identify groups of people with the same consumer needs and wants. Marketers therefore look for categories they can use to divide up the population.
Different products are targeted at children and the over 60s
The population can be divided by age in years (eg 0-16, 17-25) or by the stage of life reached (eg schoolchild, teenager). For example, a pensioner will have similar needs to those of other pensioners but different needs from those of a teenager.
Products can be targeted at men or women
Products may be targeted at a specific gender group. For instance, cosmetics have been traditionally targeted at women while DIY has been targeted at men.
Products can be targeted at different cultural groups
People's needs and wants as consumers will vary according to their religion, language, social customs, dietary habits and ethnic background. In the UK businesses provide for a wide range of different cultures. For example, there are magazines and newspapers in many different languages and Halal butchers in areas with large Muslim populations.
The market can be divided into socio-economic groups
The population can be segmented according to annual salary (eg 15,000, 30,000 etc.), or type of job and social class. Establishing a group's
Money left after essentials are paid for.
is important so that products can be targeted to the relevant income group. This is called a
Generalised group by job, class and income.
. The socio-economic groups A, B, C1, C2, D and E describe how much the head of the household earns.
Products can be aimed at a lifestyle group
People are grouped according to the way they lead their lives and the attitudes they share. For example, young professionals may drive a sports car because of the image they want to project. Married parents might want the same things, but have to provide for their children, which is a large extra cost. They will need a family car to suit their lifestyle.
Marketing departments use segmentation so they can target their products more accurately. It affects each of the 4Ps in their marketing mix:
If the product is effectively segmented a company will be able to promote the right product, at the right price and use the right distribution to reach the place where the consumers are.
Now look at the way the 4Ps are used in market segmentation.
Car manufacturers often produce a range of models to suit different markets
Firms have a range of products that will be targeted at different groups or segments. For example, a car manufacturer will often have a range that includes a family model, an
model and a sports model. Lifestyle segmentation will be used to develop their product line and to target their products.
Price and quality are obviously linked but not everyone can afford to buy the most expensive goods. There is a large range of televisions on the market, for example, each with slightly different features. Within this range of products, there will also be a range of prices to cater for varying disposable incomes.
Studying how a product is advertised can reveal its
the end-user or consumer group to whom the manufacturer aims to sell
. A mobile phone company recently used advertising campaigns that varied for men and women. The male phone was pictured in black and white, and all its features and business applications described. The female phone was in bright colours, and was pictured as a matching accessory to go with a woman's lipstick and handbag. You may not agree with this stereotyping, but it is a good example of gender segmentation.
A firm needs to know where its target market is. For example, a producer of Kosher food needs to identify areas where Jewish people live. The firm would have to consider how best to get its product to these areas. This is an example of cultural segmentation.

Exam questions are usually based on case studies. Look carefully at your case study to see if there is any information on market segmentation. The examiner will want to see that you understand the principles of market segmentation.

Mandy's answer was very basic. She has shown some understanding of the subject, but should have given far more detailed reasons. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade.
Planet Airlines would want to sell their First Class seats to rich people, because they can afford to spend more money. Business Class would probably be sold to business people, because they need more space to work on the plane. Economy Class would probably be aimed at people who cannot afford expensive tickets, for example, a family.
Jamie's answer showed he understood the subject, and his explanations were good. He could have included more detail and used business terms. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade.
Planet Airlines would want to sell their First Class seats to people in the highest socio-economic groups. Many of these will be in high managerial jobs with a large disposable income, and can afford to spend more money on luxuries. Business Class would probably be targeted at business people, because they need space to work on the plane, as well as being fresh for meetings on arrival. Economy Class would probably be aimed at tourists and people who cannot afford expensive seats, for example, an average family, belonging to soci-economic groups C1 or C2, white collar (office) and blue collar (factory) workers. These are examples of income and lifestyle segmentation.
Craig's answer was very detailed, and he used the correct business terms like 'disposable income' and 'lifestyle segmentation'. He showed that he understood the subject very well indeed. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.

There are currently 12 national parks across England and Wales, including Dartmoor, the New Forest, the Lake District, the Peak District, the Yorkshire Dales and Snowdonia.
The Lake District National Park was created in 1951. Covering 880 square miles, it is the UK's largest national park and receives 12 million visitors a year.

The protection of the park's environment, wildlife and natural features - things that can be harmed by excessive tourism. This is not only the Authority's job, but is also powerfully lobbied for by conservation and wildlife groups.
Tourists who come to enjoy the park need roads, parking, accommodation, shops and restaurants which are not necessarily going to be good for the countryside.
Local businesses may want to encourage more and more visitors.
Farmers, who may be concerned about damage to fences and livestock by walkers and their dogs.
Local residents, who may be worried about congestion, littering, noise pollution and the erosion of footpaths.
If these different interests are not carefully balanced, the result could be damage to the environment, local people becoming upset or even hostile, and tourists being put off visiting the park.

The successor to the League of Nations, the UN was established in 1945 as an international organisation designed to keep peace, keep international law and set standards in human rights.
, which made 2002 the ""International Year of Ecotourism"".
Ecotourism sets out guidelines for how tourists should behave when visiting fragile environments. These include:
Protect the environment - keep to footpaths, don't leave litter or start fires.
Don't interfer with wildlife - don't scare or feed the animals.
Protect resources - don't take too many showers or use air conditioning.
Support local communities - stay in locally owned accommodation and buy produce from local people.
Eat local food and drink - avoid products that have been imported from MEDCs.
Respect local customs and traditions - some communities are offended when tourists wear inappropriate clothes in religious places, strip off on the beach or behave in a rowdy manner. Locals appreciate tourists who try to learn the language and show an interest in their culture.
Ecotourism is increasingly popular and many people appreciate remote locations, small numbers of tourists and less sophisticated facilities. If a resort becomes over-developed then they will choose alternative destinations.
Uluru (formerly known as Ayers Rock) in Australia is one of the largest rocks (or monoliths) in the world. Until recently large numbers of tourists visited the rock and climbed it using a rope-and-pole path drilled into the side of the rock. As a result the rock was becoming eroded.
In 1985 the Australian government handed the land on which Uluru stands back to the Aboriginal inhabitants, the Anangu.The rock has spiritual significance for the Anangu and they do not climb it. The Anangu now ask tourists to respect the rock by not climbing it, and most tourists comply.

If two quantities are in direct proportion, as one increases, the other increases by the same percentage.
If y is directly proportional to x, this can be written as y  x
A simple example of two things that are in the same proportion is the amount of apples you might buy and the amount you pay for them. If you buy twice as many apples as your friend, you pay twice as much.
We can write the connection between the cost and the amount as an equation:
Cost of apples = price per apple  number of apples bought.

This means that, for some constant k, y = kx for all values of x and k is called the
If y is directly proportional to x.
When x = 12 then y = 3
Find the constant of proportionality and the value of x when y = 8.
We know that y is proportional to x so y = kx
We also know that when x = 12 then y = 3
substitute the values y = 3 and x = 12 into y = kx
To find the value of x , when y = 8 substitute y = 8 and k= 3 into y = kx
So x = 32 when y = 8
y can be directly proportional to x

The difficult aspect of this text is that someone telling a story and therefore using a
A present tense sentence - such as
- is the simplest tense, and one that should not be a problem.
Some sentences will be in the past tense, for example:
Ich habe das Pferd gekauft / Ich habe geheiratet.
You just need to remember that there are two parts of the past tense, and if you don't recognise the past participle (the ge- or ver- word), then you need to break it down. Take, for example,
. Just take off the ge- at the beginning, and replace the -t at the end with an -n. This leaves you with
(= to marry), which is the infinitive of this verb.
Some sentences will be in the imperfect tense. Usually you can recognise a verb in the imperfect tense, because it ends with -te. Verbs like this are known as weak verbs, and examples are
(= I tried). There are other verbs, known as strong verbs, where the imperfect is formed by changing the vowel in the stem, as in
(= to sleep: I slept) - so you need to be able to recognise these. When in doubt, always do as you did with the past tense verbs - break down the word and find the infinitive.

The squat pen rests: snug as a gun.

When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:
Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds
Bends low, comes up twenty years away
The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft
Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep

My grandfather cut more turf in a day
Than any other man on Toner's bog.
Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
To drink it, then fell to right away
Over his shoulder, going down and down

Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head.
But I've no spade to follow men like them.

the pole between the handle and the blade

In this poem Heaney sees his father, an old man, digging the flowerbeds. He remembers how his younger, stronger father used to dig in the potato fields when Heaney was a child - and how his grandfather, before that, was an expert turf digger. Heaney knows that he has no spade to follow men like them - he is a writer, not a farmer - so will dig with his pen. He will 'dig' into his past.

The title is blunt. It is only when we have read the poem carefully that we realise that all three generation are involved in digging: his grandfather dug turf, his father dug up potatoes, Heaney is digging up his memories and his past.
The verb formation which describes the time at which the action occurred, eg past, present or future.
as Heaney describes seeing his elderly father straining among the flowerbeds, then goes into the past tense when he remembers his father and grandfather at work. The last two stanzas return to the present, when Heaney realises that his work is to write. The final line, however, is in the future tense, to emphasise Heaney's determination -
Heaney remembers his own role in the digging: he and other children would gather the new potatoes that his father dug up, and he was responsible for taking milk to his grandfather on Toner's bog. It was this involvement that enabled him to watch his father and grandfather at work and describe their movements so precisely.
His father was clearly skilled at his work. Heaney remembers him
(line 8) and his boot and his knee fitted the spade perfectly (lines 10/11). He uses technical terms (lug, shaft) to stress that the spade is a precise tool.
""By God, the old man could handle a spade""
(line 15) is a simple, loving exclamation of pride.
He was also proud of his grandfather, who was so keen to work that he hardly stopped when Heaney brought him some milk. His work was precise -

Heaney does not explain exactly why he has

of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
in a regretful tone, because Heaney is not outside digging too, and feels he somehow ought to be?
in a proud tone, as Heaney is displaying the skills of his father and grandfather for everyone to appreciate?
in a loving tone, as if the poem is a gift to his father and grandfather?
Well, Heaney's description of his father and grandfather is very loving. He values his sense of connection with them, and he is clearly very proud of the work they did, even though he has
them. Far from regretting his break with the family's traditional work on the land, Heaney asserts that he is continuing their work, by digging with his pen.
The ideas in this poem concern our relationship to our forebears, and to work. Heaney describes his relationship to his father and grandfather purely in terms of their work on the land. He takes the idea of digging, the commonest form of work in any rural community, and uses it as a

Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
There is a sense of Heaney's love of the earth throughout the poem. His father and grandfather seem to be in harmony with the earth; he himself, as a child, loved picking up the potatoes that the earth produced.
By God, the old man could handle a spade.
This reminds us that Heaney's father is now an old man, but also shows his fondness for him: old man is a common term of affection. Heaney is clearly proud of him too.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day / than any other man on Toner's bog.
Heaney boasts about his grandfather's skill - he presents him as a champion digger. Perhaps the young Heaney boasted as a child to his friends about his grandfather's ability.

These roots are both actual roots the grandfather's spade cuts through, and Heaney's metaphorical roots in the land and in his family. Even though he doesn't dig with a spade like his father and grandfather, these roots are still alive in his mind.
In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems deal with the bonds between the generations - in Clarke's poem a mother addresses her child, while in Heaney's a son talks about his father and grandfather.
Both poems make us think about the relationship between parents (especially fathers) and their children
But in Heaney's poem the relationship is very specific and particular, while in Blake's poem it is not so much a real father, as a symbolic one...
Both poems deal with the relationship between generations, and both describe hard, physical work
But the Old Mother is bitter about the drudgery which she must do; while Heaney's poem celebrates the work as creative.
In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other. The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas, and attitudes and tone
Compare Digging with two other post-1914 poems and one pre-1914 poem of your choice that present the relationship between a parent and child. How do the poets show the nature of the relationships?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Gillian Clark's Catrin, Seamus Heaney's Follower, and William Blake's Little Boy Lost/Little Boy Found.
What would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing Digging with each of these three poems.
Catrin is from mother to a child, while Digging is from a child to a father (and grandfather).
Catrin suggests that relationships between parents and their children are not always harmonious, but Digging shows no conflict.
Catrin explores how a mother and child are bound together through the actual birth; Digging suggests that different generations are bound by sharing the same occupation - Heaney, his father and grandfather all 'dig'.
Both of Heaney's poems show the contrast between his father as an old man and his younger self.
Both describe his expertise in farm work as a means of illustrating Heaney's admiration for is father.
In both poems, the young Heaney is present in the fields, but in Digging he was helpful, gathering in the potatoes, while he was a nuisance in Follower.
There is a determination at the end of Digging to work and explore the past, but there is a hint of frustration in Follower - today It is my father who keeps stumbling Behind me, and will not go away.
Heaney gives us a detailed description of his father and grandfather at work, but we are given no visual impression of the father in Blake's poem.
Blake's boy becomes lost as no father was there, which suggests he was irresponsible, but Heaney shows that his father worked hard to provide food for his family.
Digging suggests a close family relationship. Blake, though, shows the love of the boy's weeping mother and the ever nigh love of God.
Blake's poem implies praise of God ' the father' of us all, while Heaney's poem shows his personal love and respect of his father and grandfather.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

Don't panic! You are not expected to understand every word of the text.
Take a positive approach to your reading. Concentrate on what you do understand, not on the difficult words and phrases.
Have a good look at the title of the text as well as any illustrations. They may give you some important clues.
Read the whole text before attempting to answer any questions. It is usually better to read the text twice at a brisk pace, than to struggle along once, slowly.
Be clear as to exactly what each question wants. For example, should you be picking out precise details (for example, the date of someone's birthday) or should you be reading the whole passage in order to draw some broad conclusions (for example, a comparison of two people's attitudes to television)?
Be aware of different ways of finding out the meaning of words. For example:
Can you guess the meaning of a difficult word in a sentence if you understand what all the other words mean?
Can you find similarities between Spanish and English words? (eg
Can you find links with other Spanish words? (eg
Are you aware of language patterns? (eg 're' in front of a word often means again:
Use your knowledge of grammar. For example, if you can identify a plural, a verb tense, an adjective, an adverb or a preposition, you will be in a better position to make an intelligent guess at a meaning.
Use your knowledge of Spain and Spanish-speaking countries. For example, knowing about the Spanish educational system could be very useful if you are working on a text about school.
If you have to write answers in Spanish, be as clear as possible; but remember you will

Radio waves have lower frequencies and longer wavelengths than microwaves. They are used to transmit television and radio programmes. Television uses higher frequencies than radio.
A radio programme receiver does not need to be directly in view of the transmitter to receive programme signals. For low frequency radio waves diffraction can allow them to be received behind hills, although repeater stations are often used to improve the quality of the signals.
The lowest frequency radio waves are also reflected from an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere, called the Ionosphere. This means that they can reach receivers that are not in the line of sight because of the curvature of the Earth's surface.

You will not be asked to calculate any concentrations of solutions in GCSE Additional Science, but you need to know certain things about concentration.
The concentration of a solution is measured in
. The greater the concentration, the more dissolved particles there are in the solution:
Equal volumes of different solutions that have the same concentration contain the same number of particles of dissolved solute. For example, a solution at 2 mol/dm
is twice as concentrated as a solution at 1 mol/dm
You will not be asked to calculate any volumes of gases in GCSE Additional Science, but you need to know certain things about them.
Equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules. For example:
of hydrogen contains twice as many molecules as 25cm
of oxygen at the same temperature and pressure.
One mole of any gas at room temperature and normal pressure occupies about 24 dm
You can use information about reacting masses to calculate the formula of a
A compound is a substance formed by the chemical union (involving bond formation) of two or more elements.
Suppose 3.2g of sulfur reacts with oxygen to produce 6.4g of sulfur oxide. What is the formula of the oxide?
of sulfur is 32 and the A
Find the mass of each element. Conservation of mass tells us that the mass of oxygen = the mass of sulfur oxide - the mass of sulfur.
The mass of oxygen reacted = 6.4 - 3.2 = 3.2g
So we have 3.2g of sulfur and 3.2g of oxygen.
Now divide the mass of each element by its A
Finally, find the ratio of the elements.
You can do this by dividing the results by the smallest of the numbers to give you the number of atoms of each element in the compound.
In this case the smallest value is 0.1, so divide both results by that.
S = 0.1  0.1 = 1
O = 0.2  0.1 = 2
(If one of the numbers ends in 0.5, multiply all the numbers by 2 - this is because you cannot have half-atoms in a compound.)
So the ratio of sulfur to oxygen is 1:2
The number of atoms tells you that the formula for sulfur oxide is SO
Here is the calculation again in tabular form to help you remember the steps:
Steps to calculation the formula of a compound
Result: the formula for the oxide = SO
If you have a balanced equation for a reaction, you can calculate the masses of
substances present at the start of a chemical reaction
A product is a substance formed in a chemical reaction.
(s)    CaO(s) + CO
, how much CaO can we make?
is 40 + 12 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 100
of CaO is 40 + 16 = 56
would yield 56g of CaO in this reaction. In the question we are told we have only half of that amount of CaCO
, 50g. So we will get half the amount of CaO, 28g.
mass of CaO we can make = 28g
Notice in this that 22g of CO
would also be produced, as 50 - 28 = 22
In practice, it is not always possible to get the calculated amount of product in a reaction:
reversible reactions may not go to completion
some product may be lost when it is removed from the reaction mixture
some of the reactants may react in an unexpected way
of a reaction is the actual mass of product obtained. The
For example, the maximum theoretical mass of product in a certain reaction is 20g, but only 15g is actually obtained.
The maximum theoretical mass of product itself can be calculated using a reacting mass calculation, such as the one on the previous page.
The atom economy of a chemical reaction is a measure of the amount of starting materials that become useful products. Inefficient, wasteful processes have low atom economies. Efficient processes have high atom economies, and are important for sustainable development, as they use fewer natural resources and create less waste.
The atom economy of a reaction can be calculated:
total mass of products equals the total mass of reactants
, you can put that into the bottom of the fraction in the calculation like this:
For example, what is the atom economy for making hydrogen by reacting coal with steam?
12  2  18  44  2  2
total mass of products = 44 + 4 = 48g (note that this is the same as the reactants: 12 + 36 = 48g)
This process has a low atom economy and is therefore an inefficient way to make hydrogen. It also uses a non-renewable resource: coal.

Nanotubes like this could be used to make tiny mechanical devices, molecular computers or extremely strong materials
Nanoparticles range in size from about 100 nm down to about 1 nm. They are typically the size of small molecules and are far too small to see with a microscope.
Nanoparticles are so small that they have different properties than the same substance in normal-sized pieces. For example, pieces of gold are, fairly obviously, gold-coloured. But gold nanoparticles are deep red or even black when mixed with water. Such different properties are very useful.
Titanium dioxide is a white solid used in house paint and certain candy-coated chocolates. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles are so small that they do not reflect visible light, so they cannot be seen. They are used in sunblock creams because they block harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun without appearing white on the skin.
Some cosmetics contain 'liposomes', which are fatty nanoparticles. Liposomes also have great potential in the pharmaceutical industry, as they can deliver tiny doses of medicines direct to cells.
Since the properties of a given nanoparticle are not easily predicted by studying the substance from which it is made, there are worries that nanoparticles may have undiscovered side-effects.
Nanoparticles have a very large surface area compared to their volume, so they are often able to react very quickly. This makes them useful as catalysts to speed up reactions. For example, they can be used in self-cleaning ovens and windows. However, there is also the possibility that they might speed up reactions in living things in unpredictable ways, perhaps causing illness or death.

Gamma radiation is used, among other things, for the following purposes.

X-rays have a lower frequency than gamma radiation. Like gamma rays, they cannot be seen or felt. X-rays mostly pass through skin and soft tissue, but they do not easily pass through bone or metal.
X-rays are used to produce photographs of bones to check for damage such as fractures. They are also used in industry to check metal components and welds for cracks or other damage.
Lower doses of X-rays can cause cells to become cancerous, so precautions are taken in hospitals to limit the dose received by patients and staff when X-ray photographs are taken.

Practise not writing when the tape is playing, because it is hard to write and listen at the same time. Learn to trust your short-term memory!
If you are entered for the higher tier, make sure you have the opportunity to listen to longer passages. These often require you to understand the feelings, opinions and attitudes of the speakers.

, plus various other roles. However, you do not need to refer to many of these and, depending on your task, you might just focus on one or two characters. The starting point is to sort out who they are, how they develop and how they relate to each other.
We know that Macbeth is a brave and valiant soldier, ready to die for his king, Duncan. However, the prophecies of the witches have a powerful effect on him, especially when he learns the first has come true, and he becomes the
. He thinks more and more about being king, and he is easily persuaded to agree to murder Duncan. However, he often appears weak - he starts to have visions, he asks lots of questions, he cannot make a decision and never really seems sure of himself. For instance, he panics just after the murder and has to rely on his wife to find an alibi.
Later in the play he appears to be more in control and less reliant on his wife. For instance, he plans to murder Banquo without even telling his wife. He also ignores his visions and makes decisions quickly, giving orders rather than asking questions. At times he is full of confidence but he is also distant and seems to ignore the death of his wife. When he realises he will also die, he 'will not yield' and fights to the very end.
Knowing the facts about a character is only the start - we need to be able to use these effectively. One way to do this is to have details or quotes from the play to support our ideas. For instance:
""Is this a dagger which I see before me""
He becomes more confident and quick to act
""I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd""
Lady Macbeth is another central figure in the play and we can make the same sort of notes about her character as we did for
""screw your courage to the sticking place""
She does not panic and orders him around
She tries to wash imaginary blood from her hands and we are told she commits suicide
There are a number of other characters you might want to look at and the following section gives a brief outline of their characters and relationships.
is Macbeth's close friend and ally. He knows about the witches and their predictions but doesn't take them seriously at first. Later he thinks more about it, but he is never tempted in the way Macbeth is. However, he starts to realise how interested Macbeth is and then gets suspicious of him. Banquo is also presented as a very brave and completely loyal soldier - even when Macbeth tempts him Banquo makes it clear he wants to keep his 'allegiance clear' to the king.
is the king at the start of the play. He is presented as a strong ruler. For instance, when he finds out the first Thane of Cawdor is a traitor, he immediately executes him and puts Macbeth in his place. He is also perceptive, and knows that you can't always tell who is a traitor. He is respected by everyone. However, he perhaps leads Macbeth into thinking about murder - Duncan announces that his son, Malcolm, will become the next king, and this starts Macbeth thinking of ways he might become king himself.

is the lord who first finds Duncan's body and who eventually kills Macbeth. He is seen as completely loyal to Duncan and his country. He is brave, swearing to investigate the murder and he doesn't go to see Macbeth crowned. This implies Macduff is already suspicious. He then goes to England to raise an army and his family are murdered on Macbeth's orders. He convinces Malcolm to join his attack against Macbeth. He kills Macbeth in the final battle because he is not 'of woman born' (he was born by caesarean section) - it's as if he has some magical power because only he can kill Macbeth.
- there are two of these (but a third, unknown murderer joins them when they attack Banquo). They are men who have nothing to lose and will set their 'life on any chance'. In other words, they are desperate and ready for anything.

Lawrence Ferlinghetti: Two Scavengers in a Truck...
The garbagemen are riding 'a bright yellow garbage truck' (line 3) and wear 'red plastic blazers' (line 4); later on we find one of them has 'grey iron hair' (line 19). These are strong colours. The couple in the Mercedes, though, are almost colourless: he wears a 'linen suit' (line 11) - natural linen is a cream colour - and they both have blond hair. Is the poet suggesting that the garbagemen have more colour in their lives? Are the young couple actually colourless and boring?
The older garbageman has a hunched back and looks 'like some gargoyle Quasimodo' (line 22). This simile is striking: Quasimodo is the Hunchback of Notre Dame in Victor Hugo's novel. He is a tragic figure: kind and loving despite his ugliness, he finally dies of a broken heart. Quasimodo means almost finished or half made. Do you think Ferlinghetti compares the dustman to Quasimodo simply to help us imagine his appearance, or for other reasons?
The garbagemen stare at the young couple 'as from a great distance' (line 27). They are actually close together, stuck at the red light. Does the image suggest the 'distance' between the lives each pair lead?
For the dustmen, looking at the couple is the same as 'watching some odourless TV ad' (line 29) - the ways of life portrayed seem impossibly perfect. To the garbagemen, the couple are almost unreal and their lifestyle is out of reach.

The closing lines of the poem involve a metaphor about the sea. If America is the high seas, the distance between the two vehicles is a 'small gulf' (line 35) or narrow mouth that should be easy to cross. Yet we also think of the other meaning of gulf - a deep chasm or abyss. It may look possible to cross, but really it is impossible. The lives of the two pairs may cross 'for an instant' (line 31), but they will never be genuinely close together.
Ferlinghetti uses repetition in his poem. Individual words are repeated, for instance, 'elegant' (lines 8 and 9) and 'scavengers' (lines 16 and 26), as well as phrases such as 'as if' (29 and 33). What is the effect of this?

Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.

4800,"Food chains show the feeding relationships in a habitat. Pyramids of biomass are charts that show the mass of living organisms at each step in a food chain. Energy is lost moving up in a food chain, and this limits the length of the chain - so it's more efficient to feed people with plants than with meat.
Organisms usually compete with each other for resources. The populations of predators and prey are interrelated.
A food chain shows who eats what in a particular habitat. For example, grass seed is eaten by a vole, which is eaten by a barn owl. The arrows between each item in the chain always point from the food to the feeder. This is the direction in which energy flows in the food chain.
, which are almost always green plants. The other organisms in the food chain are
 they all get their energy and biomass by consuming (eating) other organisms.
Most food chains are quite short, and they rarely consist of more than four steps. This is because a lot of energy is lost at each step. After about three steps, very little energy is still available for use by living organisms. This also explains why there are few organisms at the top of food chains, compared with those lower down.

New techniques for building a ladder system of locks
to transport canal boats over hills were developed.
If a system of ladder locks could not be built then
""contouring"" was used to take a canal around a hill
Canal owners also had to build reservoirs
alongside canals because canals kept losing water during hot weather.
because farmers were annoyed about the canals going through their land.
Between 1871 and 1875, dozens of canals were built in Britain and some people believed canal mania had taken hold.

Inter-quartile range, cumulative frequency, box and whisker plots - Higher
The cumulative frequency is obtained by adding up the frequencies as you go along, to give a 'running total'.
The table shows the lengths (in cm) of 32 cucumbers.
Before drawing the cumulative frequency diagram, we need to work out the cumulative frequencies. This is done by adding the frequencies in turn.
22 (= 3 + 7 + 12)
28 (= 3 + 7 + 12 + 6)
32 (= 3 + 7 + 12 + 6 + 4)
The points are plotted at the upper class boundary. In this example, the upper class boundaries are 24.5, 28.5, 32.5, 36.5 and 40.5. Cumulative frequency is plotted on the vertical axis.
Cumulative frequency graphs are always plotted using the highest value in each group of data, and the cumulative frequency is always plotted up a graph, never across.
Cumulative frequency diagrams usually have this characteristic S-shape.
When looking at a cumulative frequency curve, you will need to know how to find its median, lower and upper quartiles, and the interquartile range.
of the total frequency, we can read estimates of the lower quartile, median and upper quartile from the horizontal axis.
Quartiles are associated with quarters. The interquartile range is the difference between the lower and upper quartile.
From these values, we can also estimate the interquartile range: 34 - 28 = 6
Remember to use the total frequency, not the maximum value, on the vertical axis. The values are always read from the horizontal axis.

Baking powder contains sodium hydrogencarbonate. This breaks down when heated, releasing carbon dioxide that helps cake mixtures to rise during baking.
Some food can be eaten raw, such as carrots and apples. But some food is usually cooked before it is eaten, such as meat and fish.
There are many ways to cook food, including by:
Notice that all of these methods involve heating the food to a

For example, bread turns brown as it is toasted. Sugars in the bread break down to form carbon:
This change needs heat energy from the toaster, and it cannot be reversed.
Eggs and meat are good sources of protein. The protein molecules change shape as a result of the heat energy they absorb. This causes changes in the appearance and texture of the eggs and meat when they are cooked. For example:
Egg white solidifies and becomes white instead of transparent.
Meat becomes firmer and turns from red to brown.
Potatoes are a good source of carbohydrate, mainly as a complex carbohydrate called starch. Raw potato is hard and has an unpleasant taste. Potato becomes softer when is cooked, the starch is converted into simple sugars, and the potato becomes sweeter.
Baking powder is used for baking cakes. It contains sodium hydrogencarbonate, which breaks down when heated to form carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide helps to make the cake mixture rise, so that the cakes are light and fluffy.
Here is the word equation for the reaction:
Carbon dioxide can be detected using a simple laboratory test.

. We say that proteins become denatured when heated. For example, the proteins in eggs and meat are denatured by cooking.
When potato is cooked, changes happen in the cell wall of potato cells. Cell walls are made of a tough substance called cellulose. During cooking, this substance breaks down and becomes soluble. This makes the potato easier to digest.

The half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time taken for half its radioactive atoms to decay.
There are three main types of radiation, called
radiation, which all have different properties. Radiation can damage cells and make them cancerous. Very high doses of radiation can kill cells. It can be detected using photographic film or a Geiger-Muller tube. Radiation badges are used to monitor the level of radiation that people who work with radioactive sources are exposed to.
Radiation has many practical uses. It can be used in medicine to trace where certain chemicals collect in the body, indicating disease, and also in industry, where it can be used to control measuring equipment.
. The protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus at the centre of the atom, and the electrons are arranged in energy levels or shells around the nucleus.
All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons and electrons. However, the number of neutrons can vary. Atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons are called
of that element. The diagram shows three hydrogen isotopes.
The different isotopes of an element have identical chemical properties. Some isotopes, however, are radioactive. This means that they give out radiation from their nuclei. This happens all the time, whatever is done to the substance. For example, the radiation is still given out if the substance is cooled down in a freezer, or takes part in a chemical reaction.

At present the world's population is growing quickly, though this has not always been the case.
Until the 1800s the world's population grew slowly for thousands of years.
In 1820 the world's population reached one billion.
In the early 1970s, the world's population reached three billion.
In 1999, less than 30 years later, the population doubled to six billion.
The global rate of population growth is now one billion every 15 years.
The graph shows this pattern of accelerating growth:
The three main causes of population change are:

- usually measured using the death rate (number of deaths per 1000 of the population) .
- the movement of people in and out of an area.
of population change. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate of a country or place is called the

natural increase = birth rate - death rate
The rate of natural increase is given as a percentage, calculated by dividing the natural increase by 10.
For example if the birth rate is 14 per 1000 population, and the death rate is 8 per 1000 population, then the growth rate = 14 - 8 = 6
Rates of population growth vary across the world. Although the world's total population is rising rapidly, not all countries are experiencing this growth. In the UK, for example, population growth is slowing, while in Germany the population has started to decline.

The demographic transition measures population change over time, by studying birth rate and death rate. In stage one the high birth rate balances (matches) the high death rate. In stage two, the total population starts to rise as death rates start to fall, but birth rates remain quite high. In stage three, the population is still growing, but the gap between the birth rate and death rate narrows. In stage four, the total population is high, but it is balanced due to a low birth rate and a low death rate.

Total population rises as death rates fall due to improvements in health care and sanitation. Birth rates remain high.
Total population is still rising rapidly. The gap between birth and death rates narrows due to the availability of contraception and fewer children being needed to work - due to the mechanisation of farming. The
Natural increase is the natural growth of a population due to the number of births exceeding deaths. The rate of this increase can be calculated by subtracting the birth rate from the death rate.
Total population is high, but it is balanced by a low birth rate and a low death rate. Birth control is widely available and there is a desire for smaller families.
Total population is high but going into decline due to an ageing population. There is a continued desire for smaller families, with people opting to have children later in life.

Notice how in the UK 2000 pyramid there is a bulge in the area of the 30-34 and 35-39 age groups, with the numbers thereafter reducing fairly steadily as the ages increase. This matches stage 4 of the demographic transition model.
Projected population pyramid for the UK 2025

Often they need to be printed as well, using either block-printing or screen-printing techniques. Garments are assembled using various joining techniques including sewing, fusing and heat-sealing. Finishing is a process which improves the appearance, handle and performance of fabrics; while pressing is used to shape and stabilise fabrics.

Before dyeing and printing the fabric is prepared by washing, bleaching and
treating cotton yarn with an alkali to improve its strength, lustre and receptivity to dye.
In industrial production fabric is dyed by continuous or batch dyeing:
, the fabric passes through a dye bath. The fabric is then squeezed between rollers to spread the dye evenly and remove excess dye. Continuous dyeing is used for colours that do not need to change too quickly with fashion.
, fabrics are produced without dye. They are then dyed to order in large batches according to the colours required. Batch dyeing is used for colours that need to change frequently with fashion.
Fabrics are printed by block or screen printing:

6023,"A Just War is one which has to be fought but is conducted according to certain conditions. These were developed by Thomas Aquinas (c1225-74) and Francisco de Vitoria (c1483-1546) and are still referred to by Christians today.
The theory is not intended to justify all wars but to prevent them by showing that going to war - except in certain limited circumstances - is wrong. The intention was to motivate states to find other ways of resolving conflicts, prevent war and to limit its effects.
The conditions of a Just War are:
it must be fought by a legal recognised authority, eg, a government
the cause of the war must be just
the war must be fought with the intention to establish good or correct evil
there must be a reasonable chance of success
the war must be the last resort (after all diplomatic negotiations have been tried and failed)
only sufficient force must be used and civilians must not be involved
Some wars can appear to meet all of these conditions. For example, World War Two (1939-1945) would appear to have been a Just War:
it was fought by Germany and the Allied countries who were legal authorities
Germany was being attacked for invading other countries
the intention was to correct the evil which Germany was doing
the Allies felt that they had a reasonable chance of success and they did win
all forms of negotiation with Hitler and the Third Reich had failed
most of the fighting was limited to the armies concerned and to harbours and munitions sites
This looks as though it was a properly constituted Just War, but actions like the Allied bombing of Dresden, a two-day raid by almost 2,400 bombers that destroyed the city and killed perhaps 135,000 civilians to virtually no military purpose, certainly broke the final condition.

The worlds human population has passed 6 billion and continues to increase. The growth in the human population and the increase in the standard of living are putting strains on the global environment. Here are some of the ways in which this is happening:
non-renewable energy resources, such as coal, oil and natural gas, are being used up rapidly
raw materials are being used up rapidly

Ranching first started in Texas, with ranches mostly manned by Mexican cowboys called
In 1836 Texan ranchers drove many Mexicans out, and claimed the cattle left behind.

1865-1870: The 'long drives' - first 'open range' ranch
Realising that there was a great demand for beef in the north of the USA, the Texans drove their cattle north on a
to Sedalia in Missouri, where they were loaded onto trains for Chicago.
Two Texas ranchers, Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving, pioneered a second trail, to Denver in Colorado, where they sold their cattle to gold miners.
In 1868, a rancher named John Iliff (the 'cattle-king of the northern plains') won the contract to supply beef to the Sioux, who had been forced onto a reservation in the Black Hills.
A safer drive (the Chisholm Trail) was established to Abilene. This was set up by Joseph McCoy as a 'cow-town', with railroad stockyards (and numerous saloons where the cowboys could spend their wages).
John Iliff was the first rancher to set up an 'open range' ranch - in Wyoming in 1867.
A Cowboy looks out onto the Plains
There were huge areas of 'open range' - unfenced land which was free for anyone to use.
Charles Goodnight is reputed to have invented the
A system, used by cattle ranchers, of picking a number of choice pieces of land to buy within a larger area - which eventually means the buyer controls the whole area.

In spring 1886 there was a drought, followed by a scorching hot summer (up to 43C). This was followed by a winter storm in January 1887, in which the temperature dropped to -43C. Half the cattle on the plains died in a single year.
More and more homesteaders were coming onto the plains, and fencing off their farms with barbed wire (patented in 1874).

the same as mass. Mass is a measure of how much stuff is in an object. Weight is a force acting on that stuff.
You have to be careful. In physics, the term weight has a specific meaning, and is measured in newtons. Mass is measured in kilograms. The mass of a given object is the same everywhere, but its weight can change.
Weight is the result of gravity. The gravitational field strength of the Earth is 10 N/kg (ten newtons per kilogram). This means an object with a mass of 1kg would be attracted towards the centre of the Earth by a force of 10N. We feel forces like this as weight.
You would weigh less on the Moon because the gravitational field strength of the Moon is one-sixth of that of the Earth. But note that your mass would stay the same.
On Earth, if you drop an object it accelerates towards the centre of the planet. You can calculate the weight of an object using this equation:
weight (N) = mass (kg)  gravitational field strength (N/kg)
A person has a mass of 60kg. How much do they weigh on Earth, if the gravitational field strength is 10N/kg?
weight = mass  gravitational field strength
How much would the same person weigh on the Moon, if the gravitational field strength is 1.6N/kg?
weight = mass  gravitational field strength

3430,"Website designs vary from basic ones set up by users as a hobby to sophisticated designs that represent large international companies. Before designing a website, you should take a look at other websites to help you decide how your webpages should look.
You should also read the project brief carefully. Make sure you do exactly what the examiners want. There is no point in doing any more - if they say five pages, only do five pages.
Normally, on a website there is a title bar at the top, a menu on the left and then the main information appears in the big space on the right.
Stick to a simple, clear page layout
Try to avoid flashy things like sound, scrolling banners and animated text/graphics. These might look 'cool' to you, but, unless they are really suitable for the purpose and audience, they are more likely to lose you marks than earn you marks.
The examiners will be looking for a consistent house style throughout each publication you produce.
A good example of this can be seen on the BBC GCSE Bitesize website. GCSE Bitesize uses the same font, sizes and layout throughout the site. This gives a much more professional impression than constantly chopping and changing between different pages.
Ideally, you should come up with a few ideas for fonts, layouts and colour schemes and then test them on members of your target audience. Remember to include details of this testing when writing your reviews and evaluations. Always remember the publication has to appeal to your target audience!
Have consistent left-hand navigation on each page.
Don't have too much text on one page - people don't like scrolling down pages.
Break text up using bullet points, short paragraphs and tables. It's more difficult to read text on screen than it is on paper.
Keep graphics to a minimum. Graphics increase the page weight and increase the time pages take to download.
Take a look at the image below. It's a classic example of a badly designed website! Make sure you avoid using garish colours and patterned backgrounds.
Bright colours and poor quality photographs are not very attractive
Here are some important rules to stick to when writing text for a website:
Stick to a single font colour and size on your website. Try to stick to black text on a white or light-coloured background.
Arial size 12 is easy to read on websites. Try not to use a smaller sized font.
Remember the intended audience. Always test your website on users.
Do not use underlining on webpages. Users will think it is a hyperlink and get confused when it doesn't link to another website.
Keep it simple. Be consistent across the whole website.
Webpages need file names. This allows you and visitors to your website to identify each webpage.
There are several rules you need to stick to when naming webpage files.
Use correct file extension names, eg .htm .html or .shtml.
Do not use symbols, eg + & % in file names.
Do no put spaces in your file or folder name. Use either dashes (-) or underscores (_)
Name your files sensibly. Video_intro.shtml, video_movie.shtm are easier to identify than page1.shtml, page2.shtml etc.
Webpage file names should mean something to you and the user
Keep html, image, flash and other media files in separate folders.
Put images in a folder called images, put audio files in a folder called audio.
There should be an index.shtml file in the site folder.
Do not create folders that contain too many or too few files.
All screen-based publications are likely to need some images. The things to keep in mind when selecting images are:
For the current eportfolio, you are only allowed to use jpg, png, gif and tif. You may need to use a graphics package to convert the graphic to a suitable format.
If they are copyright images, you will actually lose marks for putting them in (you could email the person who holds the copyright, but this can take months to sort out).
If not, use a graphics package to re-size or crop them. Editing inside Powerpoint or a website package is likely to spoil the way the graphic appears.
Have you updated your list of sources?
Each time you add a graphic to a publication, you should update your list of sources.
Can you use some of your own graphics?
It's a good idea to create some graphics. This could be with a digital camera or by doing some original artwork on the computer.
How much memory do the graphics take up?
Remember your eportfolio has a maximum size so keep an eye on individual graphics to make sure they are not too big.
At all times, make sure the graphic is suitable for the intended audience and purpose.
Before creating a website, make sure you know the difference between relative and absolute links.
These point to where the file you want to link to is saved. For example, Jeff is saving his files on his school network. He has a file called intro.html for which the absolute link is:
Look at the image below to see the folders in which intro.html sits.
The problem with absolute links is that the examiner will not have access to your schools server. When your folder and files are copied across to the exam boards server, any absolute links will not work.
For example, Jeff hands in his folder called
to the examiner. In this folder is another folder called
. The examiner, therefore, has access to everything stored within the jeffd201 folder. Now look at the absolute link again - everything that has been handed into the examiner is in bold:
The part that is not in bold represents the school's server, which the examiner
Therefore, you must use relative hyperlinks (the part in bold) when linking your webpages together.
As you have read above, an example of a relative link in Jeff's folder is:
This hyperlink just describes where the file (intro.html) is relative to the current file  in this case, in a subfolder called webpages.
Relative links make it easier to type hyperlinks  youre less likely to make errors. Files can be moved from a local system (your school server) to another server (the examination board).
Remember that the examiner will not have access to your school server. Never refer to the server, or absolute address when you use hyperlinks.
Now look at the image below taken from the examiner's computer. Notice how Jeff's files and folders have been copied on to the exam board's server.
The absolute link for Jeff's file has now changed to:
But notice how the relative link is still the same:
It is crucial to thoroughly test your presentations and websites, as well as all the publications you produce.
First, check that all the links work. It is best to copy the website or presentation onto another device (like a memory stick or CD) and try it out away from the school network - this will show if you have used absolute hyperlinks by mistake. All the links must work before you submit your work for marking and moderation.
Secondly, test your publication with members of the target audience.
Listen carefully and improve your publication accordingly.
One good way of doing this is to prepare a checklist for the reviewer to fill in. Include questions like:
Was the information at the right level?
Finally, write the results of your tests in the review section of your eportfolio. Remember to say how well your publication meets the needs of the audience and include ideas on how it can be improved.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a computer language. HTML is used to make webpages. Many software packages such as Dreamweaver and Homesite allow you to build webpages and save them as html files.
The websites listed below offer HTML tutorials and advice for building your first website.
Practise your HTML in this online text editor with examples and tutorials.
This site is a bit patronising but is a good source of basic information
Images on websites can improve the look and style of the page. However, you must be careful to save images in the correct format.
The two main formats for web images are gif and jpg.
These are used for images that have only a few colours, such as line drawings, text and logos.
Images with few colours should be saved as a gif file
These are used for images or photographs that include details and more colours.
If you save a photo or graphic in the incorrect format, how the image looks will be affected. Look at the images below. When the fish photo is saved in a gif format, colours and details are lost.
When the bitesize graphic is saved incorrectly as a jpg, unwanted colours appear and the looks less sharp. Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Cropping allows you to select the part of the image you want to show. It's likely that you may take a photograph or find an image that is too big and you only want to use one part of the image.
To crop an image, you can use image editing software such as Word, Photoshop or Paintshop.
1. Crop this image to include only the penguin.

Pip is both the hero and narrator of the story, looking back reflectively on the lessons life has taught him. He is critical of the mistakes made by his younger self.
Dickens starts with Pip weeping for his dead family in the churchyard, establishing him as an orphan for whom we feel sorry and protective.
Pip is a good person. He steals a file and food for the convict, but feels guilty about it. He helps Herbert Pocket to get a job. He helps Magwitch, even though it means the end of his dreams of being a gentleman.
Pip's efforts to be a gentleman almost destroy him - he says horrible things to Biddy and is ashamed of Joe. But he maintains our sympathy because he hates himself for it.
Pip's 'training' to be a gentleman was merely learning to eat properly and wear the 'right' clothes - showing that at the time he mistakenly thought that being a 'gentleman' was about surface wealth and manners (when really it was about inner character and worth).
Two things 'save' Pip. Firstly, luck dashes his dreams. Secondly, those who love him stick by him.
In the end, Pip finds happiness in hard work, 'sufficient' income, and doing the decent thing. Pip is an autobiographical projection of Dickens himself. By 1860, Dickens' marriage had failed, and he had worries about his children, and his business. In
he tells us the conclusions of an older, wiser man with experience of setbacks - that happiness is not about being successful, but being good.

2796,"Factorising an expression simplifies it in some way. Factorising is the reverse of expanding brackets.
If you cannot remember what factors are, or how to find them, have another look at:
When multiplying out 3(4x - 7), the rule was to multiply everything in the brackets by 3.
This gives 3(4x - 7) = 12x - 21
So, when asked to factorise 12x - 21 look for the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of 12 and 21 (in this case 3) and
12x - 21 = 3(4x - 7)
24a + 16 = 8(3a + 2)
Therefore, the HCF of 24 and 16 is 8.
You can also factorise quadratic expressions. Eg x
+x can be factorised to x (x+1)
means 3 x p x p, and 6p means 6 x p.
The HCF of 3 and 6 is 3, and the HCF of p
and p is p, so we divide both terms by 3p:

He wrote An Inspector Calls after the First World War and like much of his work contains controversial, politically charged messages. Keen to pioneer a new 'morality' in politics, Priestley's chief concerns involved social inequality in Britain and the need for nuclear disarmament.

2916,"Electricity is a convenient source of energy and can be generated in a number of different ways. You will need to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of other ways of producing energy, such as the use of nuclear power stations.
Coal, oil and natural gas are primary energy sources. Electricity is a secondary energy source because we use primary energy sources to produce it. These primary sources can be non-renewable or renewable. Electricity itself is neither non-renewable nor renewable.
it is transmitted easily over distance, through electricity cables
it can be used in many ways, for example electric lamps, heaters, motors etc
Generators can be turned directly, for example, by:
When electricity is generated using wave, wind, tidal or hydroelectric power (HEP) there are two steps:
Generators can be turned indirectly using fossil or nuclear fuels. The heat from the fuel boils water to make steam, which expands and pushes against the blades of a
. The spinning turbine then turns the generator.
These are the steps by which electricity is generated from fossil fuels:
Heat is released from fuel and boils the water to make steam.
The turbine turns a generator and electricity is produced.
The electricity goes to the transformers to produce the correct voltage.
Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transferred from one form to another, or moved. Energy that is ""wasted"", like the heat energy from an electric lamp, does not disappear. Instead, it is transferred to its surroundings and spreads out so much that it becomes difficult to do anything useful with it.
Ordinary electric lamps contain a thin metal filament that glows when electricity passes through it. However, most of the electrical energy is transferred as heat rather than light energy. This is the Sankey diagram for a typical filament lamp.
Modern energy-saving lamps work in a different way. They transfer a greater proportion of electrical energy as light energy. This is the Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp.
Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp
From the diagram, you can see that much less electrical energy is transferred, or ""wasted"", as heat energy.
The efficiency of a device such as a lamp can be calculated using this equation:
efficiency = (useful energy transferred  energy supplied)  100
The efficiency of the filament lamp is 10  100  100 = 10%. This means that 10% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy. 90% is transferred as heat energy.
The efficiency of the energy-saving lamp is 75  100  100 = 75%. This means that 75% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy. 25% is transferred as heat energy.
Note that the efficiency of a device will always be less than 100%.
The energy produced by burning fuel is transferred as heat and stored in water as
. The energy in steam is transferred to movement in a turbine, then to electrical energy in the turbine. Energy is lost to the environment at each stage. Here is a Sankey diagram to show these losses.
Note that only about a third of the energy stored in the fuel was transferred as electrical energy to customers.
Our renewable energy resources will never run out. Their supply is not limited. There are no fuel costs either. And they typically generate far less pollution than fossil fuels.
water energy, such as wave machines, tidal barrages and hydroelectric power
biomass energy, for example energy released from wood
Wind farms are noisy and may spoil the view of people who live near them. The amount of electricity generated depends on the strength of the wind. If there is no wind, there is no electricity.
There is a limited supply of non-renewable energy resources, which will eventually run out. They include:
fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas
Fossil fuels release carbon dioxide when they burn, which adds to the
and increases global warming. Of the three fossil fuels, coal produces the most carbon dioxide, for a given amount of energy released, while natural gas generates the least.
The fuel for nuclear power stations is relatively cheap. But the power stations themselves are expensive to build. It is also very expensive to dismantle old nuclear power stations or store radioactive waste, which is a dangerous health hazard.
The main nuclear fuels are uranium and plutonium, both of which are radioactive metals. Nuclear fuels are not burned to release energy. Instead, heat is released from changes in the
Just as with power stations burning fossil fuels, the heat energy is used to boil water. The

Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear fuels do not produce carbon dioxide.
Like fossil fuels, nuclear fuels are non-renewable energy resources. And if there is an accident, large amounts of radioactive material could be released into the environment. In addition, nuclear waste remains radioactive and is hazardous to health for thousands of years. It must be stored safely.
They are put in drums and surrounded by concrete, and put into clay lined landfill sites.

from 2006 about the arguments for and against nuclear power.
Nuclear power stations use the heat released by nuclear reactions to boil water to make steam
The type of nuclear reaction used is called
A neutron collides with a uranium nucleus. A uranium nucleus is large and unstable.
The uranium nucleus splits into two similar-sized smaller nuclei.
These neutrons can then collide with more uranium nuclei.
These processes are repeated continuously, forming a
A nuclear chain reaction occurs when a neutron splits a nucleus, releasing more neutrons, which in turn go on to split even more nuclei.
In a nuclear reactor, the reaction is controlled so that energy is released at a steady rate.
The energy released in nuclear fission is far greater than the energy released in a chemical reaction, such as burning fuel. This means that the power output of a nuclear power station is large. The lifetime of a nuclear power station is about 20 years.
In considering the subject of nuclear power, it is important to weigh up the advantages and the disadvantages. These are some of the advantages:
no carbon dioxide is produced when the station is operating, as stated earlier
a small amount of fuel is needed, when compared with coal or gas
hazardous radioactive waste is produced, as stated earlier
building the power stations is quite expensive
decommissioning, ie taking apart, the power stations at the end of their lifetime is very costly
The nuclear fuel, usually uranium oxide, is held in metal containers called
. These are lowered into the reactor core. A coolant, usually water or carbon dioxide, is circulated through the reactor core to remove the heat. Control rods are also lowered into the core. These absorb neutrons and control the rate of the
. They are raised to speed it up, or lowered to slow it down.
Scientific applications give people things that they value, but may have undesirable impacts on the environment.
Our society uses more and more energy every year, but the carbon dioxide produced by most power stations is believed to be causing serious damage to the climate.
Natural resources should be used in a sustainable way.
The use of renewable energy sources would guarantee energy for the future. At the moment, renewable energy sources cannot provide enough energy.
There are official regulations and laws which control scientific research and applications.
The nuclear industry is regularly inspected to ensure that standards of safety are maintained.
Some applications of science have ethical implications. One point of view is that the right decision is the one which gives the best outcome for most people. Another point of view is that certain actions are never justified because they are wrong.
Disposal of nuclear waste raises ethical problems:
Some people say that we must have nuclear power, or we will not be able to combat global warming and still produce enough energy.
Others say that it is unethical to produce waste that will still be dangerous in many thousands of years time.
Weighing up the arguments - higher only
Before deciding on a course of action, it is important to ask if it is
. Can it be done? Then it is possible to consider if it
If nuclear waste could be sent down into the Earths mantle, it would take millions of years to resurface. Unfortunately, there doesnt seem to be any way to do this. It is not feasible.
Nuclear waste could be sent into space in rockets so that it falls harmlessly into the Sun. Unfortunately, this would be far too expensive, and any accident on take-off would spread dangerous waste over a large area. It ought not to be done.
In different social and economic contexts, different decisions might be taken.
Many developing countries insist that they need to burn fossil fuels in their power stations, even if it produces global warming. They need this to allow them to catch up with the standard of living that we enjoy.

6270,"The Data Protection Act (DPA) is a law designed to protect personal
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
stored on computers or in an organised paper filing system.
For the GCSE ICT exam, you need to know about the 1998 Act.
The need for the Data Protection Act
During the second half of the 20th century, businesses, organisations and the government began using computers to store information about their customers, clients and staff in databases. For example:
Databases are easily accessed, searched and edited. Its also far easier to cross reference information stored in two or more databases than if the records were paper-based. The computers on which databases resided were often networked. This allowed for organisation-wide access to databases and offered an easy way to share information with other organisations.
With more and more organisations using computers to store and process personal information there was a danger the information could be misused or get into the wrong hands. A number of concerns arose:
Was it possible to store information about a person without the individuals knowledge or permission?
Was a record kept of any changes made to information?
The purpose of the Data Protection Act
was passed by Parliament to control the way information is handled and to give legal rights to people who have information stored about them.
Other European Union countries have passed similar laws as often information is held in more than one country.
legislation passed by parliament that governs the protection of personal data in the UK
was developed to give protection and lay down rules about how
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
or data stored on a computer or an organised paper filing system about living people.
The basic way it works is by:
setting up rules that people have to follow
having an Information Commissioner to enforce the rules
It does not stop companies storing information about people. It just makes them follow rules.
is the person (and his/her office) who has powers to enforce the Act.
is a person or company that collects and keeps data about people.
is someone who has data about them stored somewhere, outside of their direct control. For example, a bank stores its customers' names, addresses and phone numbers. This makes us all data subjects as there can be few people in the UK who do not feature in computer records somewhere.
Any organisation or person who needs to store personal
the individual responsible for enforcing the Data Protection Act
a company or an individual that collects and stores data about people
must declare what information will be stored and how it will be used in advance. This is recorded in the register.
A description of the information to be stored.
What they are going to use the information for.

Whether the data controller will transfer the information outside the UK.

When you read about these, you may find them called
. You may be asked about these in the exam.
Remember: a data controller is the nominated person in a company who applies to the data commissioner for permission to store and use personal data.
For the personal data that controllers store and process:
It must be collected and used fairly and inside the law.
It must only be held and used for the reasons given to the
the individual responsible for enforcing the Data Protection Act
It can only be used for those registered purposes and only be disclosed to those people mentioned in the register entry. You cannot give it away or sell it unless you said you would to begin with.
held must be adequate, relevant and not excessive when compared with the purpose stated in the register. So you must have enough detail but not too much for the job that you are doing with the
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
It must be accurate and be kept up to date. There is a duty to keep it up to date, for example to change an address when people move.
It must not be kept longer than is necessary for the registered purpose. It is alright to keep information for certain lengths of time but not indefinitely. This rule means that it would be wrong to keep information about past customers longer than a few years at most.
The information must be kept safe and secure. This includes keeping the information backed up and away from any unauthorised access. It would be wrong to leave personal data open to be viewed by just anyone.
The files may not be transferred outside of the European Economic Area (that's the EU plus some small European countries) unless the country that the data is being sent to has a suitable data protection law. This part of the
legislation passed by parliament that governs the protection of personal data in the UK
has led to some countries passing similar laws to allow computer data centres to be located in their area.

anyone who has data stored about them that's outside their direct control
legislation passed by parliament that governs the protection of personal data in the UK
for people who have data kept about them. You need to know these rights for the exam. They are:
A data subject has a right to be supplied by a
a company or an individual that collects and stores data about people
with the personal data held about him or her. The data controller can charge for this (usually around 10 pounds).
A data subject may force a data controller to correct any mistakes in the data held about them.
A data subject may prevent the use of
if it would be likely to cause them distress.
A data subject may stop their data being used in attempts to sell them things (eg by junk mail or cold calling.)
A data subject may specify that they do not want a data user to make ""automated"" decisions about them where, through points scoring, a computer decides on, for example, a loan application.
A Right of Complaint to the Information Commissioner
A data subject can ask for the use of their personal data to be reviewed by the
the individual responsible for enforcing the Data Protection Act
who can enforce a ruling using the DPA. The Commissioner may inspect a controller's computers to help in the investigation.
The data subject is entitled to use the law to get compensation for damage caused (""damages"") if personal data about them is inaccurate, lost, or disclosed.
These rights only practically exist if you know who has data stored about you.
Some data controllers are exempt from the Act.

is not covered by the 1998 Act. These mean that the people storing data (the data controllers) do not need to keep to the rules. You may be asked about these.
Any personal data that is held for a
reason is not covered. So MI5 and MI6 don't have to follow the rules. They do need to get a Government Minister to sign a certificate saying that they are exempt.
only at home, eg a list of your friends' names, birthdays and addresses does not have to keep to the rules.
Some personal data has partial exemption from the rules of the
legislation passed by parliament that governs the protection of personal data in the UK
. The main examples of this are:
The taxman or police do not have to disclose

anyone who has data stored about them that's outside their direct control
has no right to see information stored about him if it is to do with his/her health. This allows doctors to keep information from patients if they think it is in their best interests.
A school pupil has no right of access to personal files, or to exam results before publication.
A data controller can keep data for any length of time if it is being used for statistical, historical or research purposes.
Some research by journalists and academics is exempt if it is in the public interest or does not identify individuals.
Employment references written by a previous employer are exempt.
Planning information about staff in a company is exempt, as it may damage the business to disclose it.

There's a small amount of radioactive carbon-14 in all living organisms. When they die no new carbon-14 is taken in by the dead organism. The carbon-14 it contained at the time of death decays over a long period of time. By measuring the amount of carbon-14 left in dead organic material the approximate time since it died can be worked out.

If you are going to include text from a website, do not just copy and paste. You should be using your own words to express your ideas and experiences. Read through the text on the website that you are looking at and
make some notes of the most important points
. Then you can write these main points in your work journal, in any way you like.
Don't forget that if you just copy and paste from a website, you are not selecting the information you really need. On top of that, the examiner who looks at your work journal will want to see your work and notes. Copied text from websites is very easy to spot.
You can also find vast collections of images on the web that you can include in your work journal. You can save these images by moving the cursor over the image you are interested in, clicking on the right button of the mouse and then scrolling down the menu to 'Save image as'.

If you are photocopying images from a book, cutting out images from a magazine or using an image you have found online, think about whether you need the whole image or just one or more of the details in it.
If you only want a few details, then you should crop the picture by cutting out those sections you want to include in your work journal.
You can photocopy or print the image out and then cut out the details you want. If it's an online image you could use the cropping tool on any image-editing software, or print it out and then cut it up.
For instance, in the photograph above there's a llama on a mountain over-looking Machu Picchu in Peru. You could crop this image to cut out the backdrop so you have the llama only, as shown.

In this student's work journal Sharmin has used secondary images of models to model the clothes and patterns she has designed. Remember that the images you create (primary) or use (secondary) can be manipulated, overlaid, annotated and built upon.
Don't use secondary images too much - it might look as though you are just trying to fill space. There must always be a reason why you have included something in your work journal.
When making use of a secondary image don't forget to
read the text that goes with the picture
because it will certainly contain information that you can include in your work journal. If you are taking images from a newspaper, then read the news item that goes with the picture and make a note of the important points.
Artists and writers own the copyright for anything they have created. They are protected by copyright law - this prevents other people from copying it without their permission.
Copyright law protects anything you can copy - whether it is images or text from books, magazines or the internet. You are allowed to copy images and text for your own
as long as you do not plan to use it in your own artwork or make any money from it.
If you are including secondary sources in your work journal then that's fine - but do acknowledge where you got them from whereever possible.
If you are planning to use somebody else's work in your artwork, then you must get permission from whoever owns the copyright. The copyright details are usually included in books and magazines on the front page. For TV programmes you may need to contact the production company. Websites usually have copyright information at the bottom of the webpage. For example if you look at the bottom of the BBC Schools website there is a link that says Schools Copyright (
Even if you do not need copyright permission, it is always good practice to acknowledge where your images or text come from. It shows the range of sources you have used.

3620,"Quarrying is a primary industry and involves the extraction of rocks such as limestone and slate.
Quarrying was used by early settlers in Britain for building stone and extracting metals for weapons.
Quarrying creates jobs in areas where there are limited opportunities.
There is a huge demand for the products of quarrying such as building stone and cement. This is linked to the demand for new homes in the UK.
It provides income to local councils through taxation.
Good communications are needed for transporting the products of quarrying. As a result many remote rural areas benefit from improved access.
It is an important part of the UK economy. Over 30000 people are employed in quarrying itself and related industries.
It creates pollution from noise and dust.
Heavy traffic causes pollution and congestion on narrow country roads, The vibrations from heavy traffic can cause damage to buildings.
Quarries create visual pollution and tourists may be deterred by the scars on the landscape.
Landfill sites and waste tips need to be monitored to check for a build up of gases such as methane.
Limestone is a non-renewable resource. Therefore it can be argued that quarrying is unsustainable.
How can the impacts of quarrying be reduced?
In order to reduce the lasting visual pollution, landscaping and tree planting could take place when the quarry is exhausted. Screens could also be set up around working quarries.
Restrictions on the size of quarries and working hours could cut down on visual and noise pollution.
Rail could be used to transport the quarried rock where possible.
Disused quarries could be used as car parks.
Flooded quarries can be used for water sports for the benefit of tourists and the local economy.

Your reader will be motivated to read your writing if your characters are interesting and believable. If you imagine how characters

Readers like to 'hear' what characters say to each other. Good written dialogue is the same as taking part in a

their accent and how each word sounds
Remember that slang and the use of accents or dialect is fine in dialogue, but be sparing. Make sure your readers can still understand what your character says.

Ask yourself the following questions when you think about and write dialogue:
Will the reader learn something important about the character's feelings or personality?
Will the reader learn something important about another character?
Will the reader learn something important about events in the story?
Will the character's speech prompt something important to happen in the story?
If you can't answer yes to any of the questions, then don't include the piece of dialogue: if it's unnecessary it will only slow down your story.

Stars do not remain the same, but change as they age. The Universe contains extremely dense objects called black holes, and may consist mostly of dark matter that cannot be seen.
You should know how stars are formed.
Stars form from massive clouds of dust and gas in space.
Gravity pulls the dust and gas together.
As the gas falls together, it gets hot. A star forms when it is hot enough for nuclear reactions to start. This releases energy, and keeps the star hot. The outward pressure from the expanding hot gases is balanced by the force of the star's gravity. Our sun is at this stable phase in its life. Gravity pulls smaller amounts of dust and gas together, which form planets in orbit around the star.

A pump pushes cold water from the storage tank through pipes in the solar panel. The water is heated by energy from the Sun and returns to the tank. In some systems, a conventional boiler is used to increase the temperature of the water.

of three lines, each of roughly the same length.
Think about how the language the poet uses helps to convey her ideas. Here are some points to consider:
Think about the title. We may often hear adults saying 'I remember my childhood well', so it is significant that Duffy has deliberately twisted this to 'We Remember Your Childhood Well'. The grown-ups definitely present themselves as in control.
The poem is written mainly in the past
The verb formation which describes the time at which the action occurred, eg past, present or future.
however, reminding us that it is dealing with memories. As readers, we cannot be sure whose memory is more accurate - the parents' or the child's. Is the child exaggerating about the horrors that appear to have taken place? Or are the parents guiltily trying to convince themselves that they didn't happen?
We don't know if it is a mother or a father talking. The pronoun 'We' is used frequently, so whoever is speaking seems to be conveying the thoughts of them both. They could even be talking together (try reading the poem imagining that the mother and father speak alternate stanzas). We also don't know whether they are speaking to a son or a daughter: there is nothing to indicate the gender. Perhaps the vagueness is deliberate, to suggest that any parent/child relationship may end up with such tensions like this at some point.
We never hear the voice of the person being spoken to, the 'You' of the poem. We only know their viewpoint through what the parent says. Imagine the reaction of the grown-up child to such vehement denials. How do you think they would feel?
A group of lines of poetry that make up a unit - like a paragraph in a piece of prose; a verse.
begins with a statement that denies what the child believes to have happened - 'Nobody hurt you' (line 1), 'Nobody sent you away' (line 13), as if trying to crush the child's view of events. There is an apparent contrast between the parent's view and the child's. 'Nobody forced you. You wanted to go' (line 7) suggests the parents saw things in one way while the child saw things completely differently. However, sometimes the parent seems to change tack mid-stream, 'You couldn't sing anyway, cared less' (line 5), which could hint that their position is less clear than the child's.
A feeling of potential conflict between a group of people. In an audience or reader, a sense of potential conflict, or a feeling of anxiety due to what may be about to happen.
between the speaker and listener. We get the impression that the listener is not given much chance to speak - or, if they do, that it is ignored. The parents' repeated denials are so dominant that the child doesn't get a word in edgeways.
To some extent, the poem raises more questions than it answers. It is
A text written by a person of unknown name or identity.
and so we know little about the speaker (or speakers) or the child they are addressing. The events being denied are left deliberately vague. We wonder what 'didn't occur' (line 4); where did the family 'go that day' (line 7)? The lack of detail both pulls us into the poem - we really want to know what happened! - and shuts us out. Since the parent doesn't need to spell out what they are talking about to their child, the closeness of the family - and the fact that we are outsiders - is emphasised.
The parent-child relationship has obviously broken down. Whichever version of events is right, any love and trust between the parents and child has been destroyed. Have the parents 'won'? The last sentence, a repeat of the title, 'We remember your childhood well', is their final, decisive word.

A balanced equation can tell us the theoretical yield for a reaction, by using the relative formula masses of reactants and products involved.
For example the formula for the neutralisation of sulfuric acid with sodium hydroxide is:
sulfuric acid + sodium hydroxide  sodium sulfate + water
By using the relative formula masses it can be calculated that 6.9g of sulfuric acid theoretically produces 10g of sodium sulfate.
If this neutralisation reaction is carried out, the actual yield is found by measuring the mass of product - sodium sulfate - that has been made. The

Sulfuric acid is neutralised by sodium hydroxide, to make sodium sulfate and water, according to the following equation:
Step 2: work out the relative formula mass
The relative formula masses of the reactants and products can be worked out using relative atomic masses obtained from the periodic table.
relative formula mass = (2 x 1) + 32 + (4 x 16) = 98
NaOH relative formula mass = 23 + 16 + 1 = 40
relative formula mass = (2 x 23) + 32 + (4 x 16) = 142
O relative formula mass = (2 x 1) + 16 = 18
Step 3: work out the masses of reactants and products
The masses of reactants and products can now be worked out from the equation:

Originating in Vienna, during the 19th Century the waltz became popular all over Europe. A father and son, both called Johann Strauss, composed a huge number of waltzes. Johann Strauss (the son) was called The Waltz King.
The Waltz always has three beats in the bar and has a bass note on the first beat. Waltzes can be identified by the 'um cha cha, um cha cha' that forms the backbone of the music.
They commonly feature a low pitched accompaniment and a higher series of elegant melodies.
The speed of the waltz is usually fairly quick and lively.
Waltzes usually contain a string of seven or eight different melodies with an introduction and a coda (ending passage).
Waltzes were written for string orchestras, full orchestras including woodwind and brass, and for solo instruments such as the piano or guitar.

, plus various other roles. However, you do not need to refer to many of them. Depending on your task, you might just focus on one or two. The starting point is to sort out who they are, how they develop, and how they relate to each other.
Beatrice is unmarried and, because she is Hero's cousin, lives in Leonato's household. Right from the start, we see that she is clever, lively, and makes fun of lots of things. In particular, she makes fun of Benedick. She hints that she has already been in love with him, but spends a lot of the time publicly mocking him.
She says she does not want to marry. This makes her seem very unusual, because in Shakespeare's day women were expected to. They were also expected to be quiet and polite, like Hero. Beatrice is not like this at all. She even turns down Don Pedro's proposal of marriage. He is a rich, powerful man, and this shows how unusual Beatrice is. She is independent and determined to stay that way.
Beatrice is very loyal to Hero, and very strong and determined. Surprisingly, she is quick to believe Benedick is in love with her, and falls in love with him just as quickly. At the end of the play she seems truly happy - dancing with her husband to be.
Those are the basic details of her character. We can now look at how to use these in your work.
Knowing the facts about a character is only the start - we need to be able to use these effectively. One way to do this is to have details or quotations from the play to support our ideas. For instance:
She can twist people's words around very easily
She talks openly and refuses to be silent
She 'cannot endure to hear tell of a husband'
She never doubts Hero's word or honour
She believes Benedick loves her almost instantly
She agrees to marry and appears to be in love

6640,"Halloween is a very important festival in the USA, but it is also becoming more popular in France. This exercise tells you a little about how Halloween is celebrated in both countries and will test your reading skills.
Then read this typical exam question about Halloween and choose the right words from the list to fill the gaps in the sentences. In an exam you would have about 15 minutes to finish this question.
Voici un petit article sur Halloween aux tats-Unis et en France.
Halloween est une des ftes les plus populaires d'Amrique du Nord. Chaque anne le 31 octobre on trouve partout des citrouilles, le symbole d'Halloween, et on dpense des milliards de euros en costumes, en bonbons et en dcorations.
Depuis cinq ans, la France adopte, elle aussi, peu  peu, la fte d'Halloween.
Vous allez lire comment quelques jeunes Franais et Amricains passent la soire du 31 octobre...
Tony, 13 ans, Dallas: En fin de journe, tout le monde rcolte des bonbons dans chaque maison. J'obtiens de grands sacs pleins et je les mange sur plusieurs jours.
Nabila, 14 ans, Marseille: J'ai command un masque dans un catalogue. Il est trs raliste et fait terriblement peur.
Christina, 17 ans, Boston: Dans mon quartier, une famille a transform son jardin en cimetire, avec des tombes, des cris, de la fume. La mre, dguise en sorcire, a distribu des bonbons.
Pierre, 15 ans, Lens: Mon cole fte Halloween. On organise un dfil de dguisements et on prpare des gteaux orange en forme de citrouille.
Carlos, 16 ans, Los Angeles: A l'intrieur de toutes les maisons, on dcore les murs avec des silhouettes de papier. Des sorcires, des fantmes, et  l'extrieur, on met des lanternes autour de la porte.

2. La ( ______ ) du 31 octobre est le moment o on fte Halloween.
3. On trouve des tombes dans un ( ______ ).
4. A l'cole, les lves se dguisent pour participer  un ( ______ ).
5. Les ( ______ ) de chaque maison sont dcors de silhouettes.
Have a look at the correctly completed sentences:
Exemple: Les gteaux en forme de citrouille sont
The cakes in the shape of a pumpkin are orange.
The pumpkin is the symbol of Halloween.
Make sure you know the meaning of all the words in the box.
Adjectives describing colour like 'orange', 'framboise' or 'marron' that are also the name of a fruit never agree with the noun they relate to so here 'orange' does not take an s. If it was 'vert' though, it would agree.
du 31 octobre est le moment o on fte Halloween.
Halloween is celebrated during the evening of October 31st.
3. On trouve des tombes dans un
Tombs can be found in a cemetery.
4. A l'cole, les lves se dguisent pour participer  un
At school, the pu pils wear fancy dress to take part in a procession.
Read the beginning of the question and the five statements by the young people carefully. You will need to refer to the whole text when looking for your answers.
de chaque maison sont dcors de silhouettes.
The walls of every house are decorated with silhouettes.
The text in your exam may be quite long, like this one, so make sure to read it at least twice.
When you are required to fill in word gaps in your exam, remember to begin by filling in the easiest of the gaps, so that when you get to the harder ones you have fewer words to choose from.
Read the sentences with the gaps very carefully, word by word, so you know exactly what they mean.

6886,"Once you have understood how to use the plot and the characters, you should move onto the themes, which are the basic ideas in
. The subject of love dominates the play, but there are many others, such as death, time, fate and loyalty.
Perhaps the most obvious subject or theme in
. However, Shakespeare presents love in different ways. There is Romeo's early love for Rosaline. This is like a puppy love, which the Friar calls 'doting' and not 'loving', because it was only really Romeo who believed he was in love.
Paris' love for Juliet is quite similar. He wants to marry her, but approaches her father rather than Juliet (as was the tradition). He does not really show any deep feelings for her, and even says he has 'little talked of love"". This seems to indicate he wants a good marriage and has chosen her, rather than the two of them falling in love.
There is another view of love - as something spiritual and between friends. This is shown with the love Juliet shares with her Nurse, the Friar and Romeo, and the friendships between Mercutio, Benvolio and Romeo. Each of these shows a close understanding. They might make fun of each other and criticise one another's choices, but they respect and care for each other. They will also take great risks for one another: Mercutio dies to protect Romeo's honour.
The love between Romeo and Juliet is our classic idea of romantic love - they will do anything for each other and their language and behaviour reflect this.
Finally, Shakespeare deals with yet another view of love - as something purely sexual. A number of characters, especially Mercutio and the Nurse, make repeated references to sex. This is very different to the idealistic love shown by Romeo and Juliet.
: the belief that an individual's life has been decided for them and there is nothing they can do to change it. This is used right from the start. Romeo and Juliet's ill-fated lives are described as 'death-marked', and they are a 'pair of star-crossed lovers'. The idea of fate works on several levels. Shakespeare sets the two families against each other, and there is nothing Romeo and Juliet can do about this.
The couple have a feeling that things will go badly for them. Romeo thinks something is 'hanging in the stars', while Juliet says a 'faint cold fear thrills through my veins'. This is far more mysterious for us. In Shakespeare's time, fate was taken very seriously. An audience would have appreciated what he meant by all these references.
is also mentioned a lot, in lots of different ways, such as 'we were born to die' or 'cold death', and 'death-darting eye'. Mercutio, Tybalt, Paris, Romeo and Juliet all die during the play. Death even becomes a person, one who has married Juliet (with 'Death is my son-in-law'). In Shakespeare's time people generally died much younger than they do now. The subject of death was familiar to everyone. Nowadays, we often shy away from talking about it - but it's a major topic of
is another major topic. Even the Chorus at the start tells us the play will last for two hours. There are many other references to time, too, such as in Act 3, Scene 2 with Juliet is waiting for the night and the arrival of Romeo. Plus, the whole play covers just a few days, and the pace changes frequently.
Time is also crucial to the plot: the plans for Juliet's marriage are brought forward, the sleeping potion only lasts a certain time, and Romeo kills himself just before Juliet wakes up. Even her death is related to time - she says she will 'be brief'. The audience might well feel the two lovers are racing to their deaths and there is nothing anyone can do to stop this.
There may be other topics you can spot - for instance, the play deals with families and the subjects of loyalty and hatred. It is good to include something about the basic ideas in Romeo and Juliet in your work. This will help you to understand what the play is about, how it all fits together, and how Shakespeare used ideas to amuse, entertain and interest his audience.

3423,"Cartoon titled 'The Illegal Act' - caption reads: 'I'm sorry, but the Supreme Court says I must chuck you back again'
Does Source A criticise or support the New Deal?
At first glance, the cartoon could be mistaken for criticising Roosevelt and the New Deal. It looks like Roosevelt is rescuing another person from the sea of Depression and pulling him into his National Recovery boat. Many New Deal critics were opposed to the cost of the New Deal to the American taxpayer.
However, the cartoon is actually criticising the US Supreme Court - the caption gives it away - Roosevelt is saying: ""I'm sorry but the Supreme Court says I must chuck you back again"", and he is shown to be pushing the man's head down. This is because the Supreme Court did not agree with many of Roosevelt's New Deal proposals and, therefore, did not pass them.
This cartoon sympathises with Roosevelt as it shows him unwillingly pushing away the man who needs saving.
If you are given an image source to study in your exam, make sure that you read the captions and look at the details very closely. As demonstrated with Source A, it is very easy to misinterpret a source at initial glance.

The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. 'My lords,' he said, 'Please turn aside to your servants house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.' 'No,' they answered.

The amount of sunlight reaching the Earths surface has decreased by about 2 per cent every ten years, because more sunlight is being reflected back into space. The particles from burning fuels reflect sunlight, and they also cause more water droplets to form in the clouds. This makes the clouds better at reflecting sunlight back into space.
It is likely that global dimming has hidden some of the effects of global warming, by stopping some of the Suns energy reaching the Earths surface in the first place. Governments around the world are introducing controls on pollution. There is the possibility that as the air becomes less polluted by smoke and soot, global dimming will decrease, causing the effects of global warming to become more obvious.

The CBD in an LEDC looks very similar to a CBD in an MEDC. However, there is likely to be a more dramatic difference between the height of the buildings in the CBD and the height of the buildings in other zones.
The CBD contains facilities such as department stores, hotels, offices, schools, theatres and cinemas.
High-class housing can be found around the edge of the CBD and in a spine radiating out towards the edge of the urban area. This is likely to be a main transport route and a desirable street, possibly a former colonial area. People living here will need easy access to the CBD. Transport networks in LEDCs are not as well developed as MEDCs so the journey to work is a major consideration when deciding where to live.
The high class housing will be a mixture of old colonial houses and large apartments, both of which will have space for servants.
The fact that cities in LEDCs are growing rapidly means that conditions can be poor. There are often great inequalities within LEDC urban areas and they are even more pronounced in LEDCs.
Some of the worst conditions are found in the shanty towns on the edge of the city, near the CBD or along main transport routes. They tend to be unplanned and are often illegal. Houses are self-built using basic materials and shanty towns have few services.

Some polymers are not made from alkene monomers. These are called condensation polymers. Nylon and polyesters are like this. They can be drawn into very fine fibres and woven into cloth for clothing. Often, natural fibres such as cotton are mixed with nylon or polyester fibres to make a soft but hard-wearing cloth.
One of the useful properties of polymers is that they are unreactive, so they are suitable for storing food and chemicals safely. Unfortunately, this property makes it difficult to dispose of polymers. They are often buried in landfill sites or incinerated - burned.
Waste polymers are disposed of in landfill sites. This uses up valuable land, and suitable sites often fill up quickly.
Polymers release a lot of heat energy when they burn. This energy can be used to heat homes or generate electricity. But there are problems with incineration. Carbon dioxide is produced, which adds to global warming. Toxic gases are also produced, unless the polymers are incinerated at high temperatures.
Polymers have recycling symbols like this one for PVC to show what they are
Many polymers can be recycled. This reduces disposal problems and the amount of crude oil used. But first the different polymers must be separated from each other. This can be difficult and expensive.
Most polymers, including poly(ethene) and poly(propene), are not biodegradable. This means microorganisms cannot break them down, so they may last for many years in rubbish dumps. However, it is possible to include chemicals that cause the polymer to break down more quickly. Carrier bags and refuse bags made from degradable polymers are already available.
Nylon has some desirable properties. It does not let ultraviolet light pass through it, and it is:
Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.
Gore-Tex has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.
Teflon is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.
Gore-Tex fabric is a sandwich of materials
Structure and properties of polymers - higher
Strong covalent bonds join atoms to each other in individual polymer molecules. Weak intermolecular forces attract polymer molecules towards each other. The properties of solid materials like polymers depend on:
the strength of the forces between these molecules
A polymer will melt when the intermolecular forces are overcome. The stronger the forces, the more energy is needed to break them, and the higher the materials melting point.
Many polymers, such as poly(ethene), contain long molecules that lie side by side. These can uncoil and slide past each other, making the material flexible. Long polymer chains have stronger forces of attraction than shorter ones: they make stronger materials.
Cross-linking is where the polymer chains are chemically joined together in places, by covalent bonds. The polymer molecules cannot slide over each other so easily. This makes materials tougher and less flexible, and they cannot be easily stretched. Cross-linking also gives materials high melting points.
Vulcanised rubber has cross-links. Its polymer molecules are cross-linked by sulfur atoms. It is tough but flexible, and used for making tyres.

6787,"The increasing global population creates a demand for more food and greater efficiency in farming. Attempts to address this rise in demand including the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) by the EU and the Green Revolution in LEDCs.
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was set up in 1962 to secure food supplies at a fair price and to improve the standard of living of farmers in Europe.
The demand for more and cheaper food meant that farmers received
for the food that they produced. This led to overproduction and the creation of large
known as grain and butter mountains and wine lakes.
of its borders in 2004, the EU could no longer afford to keep paying subsidies. The CAP changed in 2005 to give farmers a single subsidy rather than several different payments. This is known as the

, ie not used for crops or animals, ito qualify for payment. Set aside land encourages local
and can be put to other uses such as campsites.
Since the changes to the CAP, overproduction in the EU is no longer the problem it once was.
In times of famine, food mountains can be used as aid. In the past, the EU has given its surpluses of food to Africa. In the long term, this reduces the incomes of African farmers and increases unemployment. Countries can also become reliant on aid - therefore it is unsustainable and does not encourage self reliance.
This is a problem in parts of the UK that are very flat, such as East Anglia. When the soil is left bare after ploughing, the wind can pick up speed due to the flat land and
have been removed from farmland to allow machinery to be used more easily and farm the land more intensively. Hedgerows help to hold the soil together and act as valuable windbreaks.
If the topsoil (the most productive layer of the soil) is removed, then crop yields can decline.
Loss of biodiversity (a diverse range of wildlife) in rivers  fish species find it difficult to breed because they lay their eggs in the gravel at the bottom of rivers and deposition of sediment smothers the gravel. Eggs that are smothered in sediment do not receive sufficient oxygen to survive.
Roads and footpaths can become slippery, causing a hazard to walkers, motorists and cyclists.
Drains can become blocked with eroded soil causing localised flooding.
Sediment can find its way into water storage reservoirs, reducing storage capacity for water supplies and increasing flood risks.
Phosphates (chemicals from fertilisers) in the soil can cause excessive algal growth in rivers, lakes and reservoirs. If the sediment finds its way to an estuary or is dredged and dumped out at sea it can also cause algal growth in marine water. Algal growth causes damage to ecosystems and can be toxic.
Water quality can be reduced - it may require treatment before it becomes fit for human consumption.
The navigability of water courses can be reduced because of deposition of sediment.
Soil erosion is also a problem in
A Less Economically Developed Country [LEDC] has low levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the southern hemisphere (eg countries in southern Africa, southern Asia and South America) are LEDCs, while more of the countries in the northern hemisphere are More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs].
The soil is exposed and vulnerable to erosion as a result of the removal of vegetation and overgrazing.

in the manufacture, therefore creating jobs and providing valuable skills for future development. Examples of appropriate technology include using
to pump the water and using renewable energy such as solar power. An example of innappropriate technology would include using fossil fuels, which pollute the atmosphere and are a non renewable energy source.
This solution to soil erosion involves the local community building low stone walls along the contours in the land. This has been done in parts of Burkina Faso. The stones trap both soil and water, which increases yields and prevents soil erosion. It is cheap and sustainable and gives the local community a sense of ownership of the project.
In the 1960s plans were made to increase crop yields in LEDCs by introducing new hybrid strains of plants with
. These plans became known as 'The Green Revolution'.
Ultimately, it was not a success as the crops concerned needed lots of
and farmers' profits fell. However, by crossbreeding traditional and new varieties of crops, there has been some success in improving the yields of rice and millet.
Environmental stewardship in agriculture is where farmers take responsibility for environmental quality. This involves recognising that their actions can affect the environment in both positive and negative ways.
An example of environmental stewardship would be organic farming. Organic farming methods do not involve the use of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides, thereby avoiding any possible negative effects on habitats and food chains. In addition, organic products widen the consumer choice of products available.
Green Yard is one of China's first organic dairies. The cows graze on grass free from pesticides, organic hay from Inner Mongolia and sweetcorn grown on the farm itself.
As a regular dairy farmer, Wang Zhanli faced strong competition from larger dairies. He changed to organic farming in 2004 as he found he was able to charge higher prices for his better quality, organic products. In doing so he persuaded 50 of his neighbours to invest in his business.
China still has a small organic market and most of Green Yard's products are sold overseas. More publicity and marketing are needed to raise awareness in China. However, marketing is costly and many Chinese people cannot afford to buy the more expensive organic products.

1064,". When it is heated, it breaks down to form calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. Calcium oxide reacts with water to produce calcium hydroxide.
Limestone and its products have many uses, including being used to make mortar, cement, concrete and glass.
Metal carbonates such as calcium carbonate break down when heated strongly. This is called thermal decomposition. Here are the equations for the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate:
Other metal carbonates decompose in the same way. Here are the equations for the thermal decomposition of copper carbonate:
Notice that in both examples the products are a metal oxide and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide gas can be detected using limewater. Limewater turns cloudy white when carbon dioxide is bubbled through it.
Metals high up in the reactivity series - such as calcium - have carbonates that need a lot of energy to decompose them. Metals low down in the reactivity series - such as copper - have carbonates that are easily decomposed. This is why copper carbonate is often used at school to show these reactions. It is easily decomposed, and its colour change, from green copper carbonate to black copper oxide, is easy to see
For your exam, you need to know how quicklime and slaked lime are obtained from limestone.
If limestone is heated strongly, it breaks down to form calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. Calcium oxide is also called quicklime. It is yellow when hot, but white when cold.
Here are the equations for this reaction:
Calcium oxide reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide, also called slaked lime.
Here are the equations for this reaction:
calcium oxide + water  calcium hydroxide
A lot of heat is produced in the reaction, which may even cause the water to boil.
Using common names instead of chemical names, this is what happens:
Limestone, quicklime and slaked lime are all used to neutralise excess acidity - which may be caused by acid rain - in lakes and in soils.
Limestone is used as a building material, and to purify iron in blast furnaces. It's also used in the manufacture of glass, and of cement (one of the components of concrete).
The main uses of limestone and its products
- heated with sand and soda (sodium carbonate).
- heated with clay in a kiln.
Concrete - mixed with sand, water and crushed rock
Mortar - mixed with sand and water
Glass is made by melting sand and then cooling it. Flat sheets of glass for windows are made by floating molten glass on a layer of molten tin.
Glass manufacturers add sodium carbonate to sand during the manufacturing process, to reduce the melting temperature of the sand and so save energy. The sodium carbonate decomposes in the heat to form sodium oxide and carbon dioxide, but this makes the glass soluble in water. Calcium carbonate (limestone) is therefore also added, to stop the glass dissolving in water. The calcium carbonate decomposes in the heat to form calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. About 90 per cent of glass is soda-lime glass, or bottle glass.
You need to be able to evaluate some of the effects of the limestone industry.
The main advantages and disadvantages of the limestone industry
Limestone is a valuable natural resource, used to make things such as glass and concrete.
Limestone quarries are visible from long distances and may permanently disfigure the local environment.
Limestone quarrying provides employment opportunities that support the local economy in towns around the quarry.
Quarrying is a heavy industry that creates noise and heavy traffic, which damages people's quality of life.
from 2006 about a public inquiry into a limestone quarry in the Peak District National Park. Consider the arguments for and against quarrying limestone in a national park.
Advantages and disadvantages of various building materials
, cement and mortar slowly react with carbon dioxide dissolved in rainwater, and wear away. This damages walls made from limestone, and it leaves gaps between bricks in buildings. These gaps must be filled in or ""pointed"". Pollution from burning fossil fuels makes the rain more acidic than it should be, and this acid rain makes these problems worse.

The basic function of packaging has always been to protect and contain a product. In a competitive market, branding and packaging are important and have become an integral part of the product. We instantly recognise products by the size, shape and colour of packaging.
The marketing department give a product a unique look and decide on the package design. This will incorporate the

The unique thing about the product that makes consumers buy it. This can be branding, packaging or a feature of the product.
The shape, size and colour are important factors when packaging a product. The marketing department will want to make the packaging attractive and distinctive. Coke's packaging is dominated by red. This helps consumers to recognise a product instantly, when they are in a shop. The same applies to the shape of the packaging. Deodorants and shampoos, for example, come in all shapes and sizes. Remember that the actual product is inside the container, so the packaging and advertising are all that will attract us to try a product in the first place.
Large manufacturers understand the importance of their brand name. Kellogg's, Adidas and Microsoft are all household names which we associate with quality. As a result, we are likely to buy one of their products when we go shopping rather than an untried or unknown one even if it is say, a supermarket's

is to give a product a distinctive image which will differentiate it from similar products. An expensive perfume or aftershave might be sold in an elegantly designed bottle. This sort of packaging suggests quality and would be targeted at a person with taste. Even if the product itself was not very good, the packaging alone could give the impression that it was.
The success of a product through branding can lead to
Choosing and continuing to buy your favourite brand.
. A positive buying experience results in repeat sales. Consumers tend to stick to a product if we like it. This in turn can lead to a trust in other products under the same brand name.
There are so many products on the market, many of them similar to each other, that the decision to make a first time purchase can be a difficult process. If we don't know about the product already, we take advice from people who do or we read the magazine reports about it. Without personal recommendation, we rely on advertising and the product's packaging to help us make a buying decision.
In a highly competitive market, the marketing department try to make their products stand out against the rest. A supermarket is a good example of this, with shelves full of almost identical products to choose from. The challenge facing the package designer is how to grab our attention so we make an

Fizz should make sure their name is clearly shown on the packaging. Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one. As they want to sell to schoolchildren it would be a good idea to use bright colours on the packaging.

Fizz should make sure their name is clearly shown on the packaging to make sure their product stands out. Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one as opposed to another similar product. As they want to sell to schoolchildren it could also be a good idea to use bright colours on their packaging as this has been a very successful way of attracting children in the past.
Saf's answer shows that she understands packaging quite well as she gives good reasons. She could, however, have been a little more detailed and used business terms. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade.
Fizz should make sure their brand name and logo are clearly shown on the packaging to help the consumer recognise their brand and to differentiate the product. This would allow Fizz to take advantage of brand loyalty. Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one as opposed to another similar product. As their target market is schoolchildren it could also be a good idea to use bright colours on their packaging and perhaps even a cartoon character, as these have been very successful ways of attracting children in the past.
Marlon's answer is very thorough. He gives good reasons for his suggestions and uses the correct business terms, like 'brand loyalty' and 'differentiate the product'. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.

They begin life on the island full of excitement, but gradually the order they tried to create breaks down. The civilised schoolboys become savages.
Chapter 1 - Sound of the Shell
Ralph and Piggy meet on the beach, having survived the crash. They introduce themselves, then enjoy swimming in a lagoon. The island seems a magical place.
Piggy finds a large conch. Ralph blows it like a trumpet, and all the other boys who survived flock around. One group arrives in choir uniforms, led by Jack. The boys elect Ralph as their chief, so Ralph asks Jack to be leader of the choir, who will take the job of hunters. Piggy takes names.
Jack, Ralph and Simon explore the island to see if it is inhabited. They push a huge rock off the top of a hill, shouting with delight as it crashes down.
As they scramble back to the others, they see a wild pig. Jack gets out a knife to kill it, but can't quite bring himself to draw blood and the pig scurries away.

K2 is the second highest mountain in the world at 8611m. Mountain climbers say it is even harder to climb than Mount Everest, which was climbed one year before the first successful attempt on K2.
. Hypothermia and frostbite occur as the nose, fingers and toes begin to freeze. Winds can reach over 90 miles per hour and the dry air and physical exertion means that climbers can soon become dehydrated and need to drink up to six litres of water each day.
Also the amount of oxygen available to breathe drops with increasing altitude. At sea level the amount of oxygen in the air is about 21% with a pressure of 760 mmHg. As altitude increases the percentage remains the same but the pressure drops. At 3000m the pressure is 540 mmHg, at 5000m it is 420 mmHg and at the top of K2 can be as low as 253 mmHg. This means there are fewer oxygen molecules per breath so the breathing rate increases to try to get more oxygen into the blood.
Another problem experienced by many climbers is
. Low air pressure can cause fluid to leak from the capillaries in both the lungs and the brain. This results in a build-up of fluid. As the pressure drops and the fluid build up increases, the life-threatening condition of altitude sickness occurs.

. This means that knowledge of hormones can be used to decide to increase, or reduce, the chances of fertilisation and pregnancy.
The oral contraceptive ('the pill'), greatly reduces the chances of a woman producing mature eggs, and therefore her chances of becoming pregnant. The pill contains oestrogen, or oestrogen and progesterone. These hormones inhibit the production of
Follicle Stimulating Hormone, which stimulates oestrogen production and the growth of follicles (egg-sacs) in the ovary. It is secreted by the pituitary gland.
, which in turn stops eggs maturing in the ovaries.
Although the pill is useful in helping avoid unwanted pregnancy, some women who take it may suffer from changes in weight, mood and blood pressure, as a result of the hormones in it. There is also a chance of an increased risk of developing blood clots. On the other hand, there is evidence of a decreased risk of developing cancer of the uterus or ovaries.
Some women have difficulty becoming pregnant because they don't produce enough FSH to allow their eggs to mature. 'Fertility drugs' contain FSH, which stimulates eggs to mature in the ovary.
Fertility treatments increase a woman's chance of becoming pregnant, although the treatment may not always work. On the other hand, because the treatment boosts the production of mature eggs, multiple conceptions sometimes occur, with twins or triplets being expected. This increases the risk of complications in pregnancy and childbirth, and may lead to premature or underweight babies.
If a couple are having difficulty conceiving a child, because the quantity or quality of the man's sperm is poor, in vitro fertilisation - or IVF - can be used. This is where the egg is fertilised outside the woman's body and then implanted back into her uterus. As FSH can also be used to encourage the production of several mature eggs at once, it is used as part of IVF to increase the number of eggs available for fertilisation.
Some people worry about the ethical implications of IVF, and are concerned that couples may only want fertilised eggs with 'desirable' qualities. For example, they may want a girl if they have lots of boys in the family, or they may wish to avoid producing a baby with an inherited defect.

Thus the Greeks began to find out in a systematic way about the

Then, derived from his study of mathematics, the Greek philosopher Pythagoras came up with the idea of the
. This gave Greek doctors their idea of the underlying cause of disease. We can read about this in the 70 books ascribed to the Greek doctor Hippocrates, who thought that disease occurred when the humours of the body fell out of balance.
Greek doctors made careful studies of the different kinds of illness - in particular they noted the
Man's body has blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. These make up his body and through them he feels illness or enjoys health. When all the humours are properly balanced and mingled, he feels the most perfect health. Illness occurs when one of the humours is in excess, or is reduced in amount, or is entirely missing from the body.
Hippocrates, 'On the Constitution of Man' (c.500BC)
Hippocrates was a real doctor, but most of the books ascribed to him were written by his disciples. (To help you remember the four humours, along with blood and phlegm, think of yellow bile as vomit, and black bile as diarrhoea.)
I shall describe what the plague was like ... At the beginning the doctors were unable to treat the disease because of their ignorance of the right methods. Equally useless were prayers in the temples, consulting the oracles and suchlike.
Thucydides, 'History of the Peloponnesian War' (c.500BC)
Silenus had become overtired from drinking and exercising at the wrong time and had caught a fever. He began with pains in the stomach, heavy head and a stiff neck.
1st day: he vomited, his urine was black, he was thirsty, tongue dry, no sleep at night.

Once you have read the sources about Greek physiology, look for evidence that the Greeks:

believed that an imbalance of the humours caused disease
studied the 'natural history' of different diseases
wrote down what they knew in order to pass on their knowledge

Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.' So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.'
For this reason it would be wrong to take life:
Elsewhere in the Bible it's clear that human beings are not meant to choose when they die:
For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted.

of 9 lines each. The lines are of varying lengths, perhaps to reflect the freedom of the natural world - or the lack of order in the war-torn world.
Each stanza tells a different part of the story - the first gives the background about the hay making and the war, the second is about the death of the mouse, the third about Clarke's nightmare vision.
Think about how the language the poet uses helps to convey her ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is deceptively simple. We think that we are going to read a poem about the countryside: only when we get into the poem do we realise that it is also about war and conflict. The field mouse is obviously important, though. What does it symbolise?
The verb formation which describes the time at which the action occurred, eg past, present or future.
. This helps to make the events seem more vivid to us. Perhaps it also suggests the poem could be true of any war, anywhere in the world.
There are contrasts throughout between the idealised rural scene and the horrors of war. It is
(line 16), the time of hay making for all farmers; yet in Wales they are hay making while in Bosnia they are fighting.
However, the poem also reminds us that even a peaceful activity like hay making contains violence. Clarke acknowledges her guilt as she looks at the mouse
(line 18). Is she emphasising that violence can be unintentional? Or does this mean that we are all guilty for war, too?
Implied parallels between hay making and war run throughout the poem. For instance, in Wales the dusk garden is
(line 20) - the animals that escaped the tractor. This makes us think of the human refugees who fled over the border to escape the Bosnian conflict. Think too about the word
(lines 8 and 27): it refers both to the farmer's land where the hay is grown, and to land in the sense of a person's country, their 'fatherland' - the territory they fight over in a war.
The poem ends with a nightmare vision - Clarke dreams of the children dancing in the hay field, yet she sees them as vulnerable as the mouse,
(line 25), as if they were in a war situation with gunfire (line 26) all around. The neighbour who gave their land sweetness in the first stanza has become their enemy, ruining and wounding the land with stones (line 27) . In the Bosnian conflict, neighbours of different religions who had lived in peacefully together for generations turned against and murdered each other.

The author was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1850. His family included engineers, scientists, a professor of philosophy, and a religious minister. We can see the scientific and religious sides of Stevenson's family reflected in both his life and
Stevenson was a sickly child (he had serious lung problems) who read a great deal about travel and adventure. A combination of his love of adventure and ill health led him to spend many years as a writer travelling the world in search of a climate that was healthier than Britain's.
In 1890, he went to live in the remote Samoan Islands in the South Pacific. He died there in 1894 at the age of 44.
Religion and science in the 19th century
In 1859, when Stevenson was nine years old, Charles Darwin published

Darwin put forward the theory that all life, including humans, has evolved from more

The book's release came at a time when many people saw science and a belief in religion and the supernatural as being at odds with each another. A lot felt they had to choose between the two. And many believed that science had become dangerous and was meddling in matters which only God had control over. This is what Jekyll does in the novel.
Closely linked to the Victorians' increasing sense of the conflict between science and religion was the idea that humans have a dual nature. On the one hand, they saw the calm, rational, everyday normality of family life and employment; on the other, fantasies, nightmares, anger and violence. It was the explainable versus the inexplicable; the natural versus the

of 24 lines. The lines are pentameters (they have 10 syllables each).
Think about how the language the poet uses helps to convey his ideas. Here are some points to consider:
Think about the title. It does not tell us anything about Batman and Robin - it's only when we begin to read the poem that the identity of the 'kid' becomes clear. However, if we go back to the title having read the poem, it may remind us of other young people who are caught up in the shadow (line 20) of someone they admire, and their need to forge their own identity.
Batman is at first presented as a real superhero: he is described at the start in the alliterative phrase Batman, big shot, as someone who gives orders to Robin. Yet as we read on, his status is diminished. We hear that he
(line 4) Robin and had an affair with a married woman (line 10). We see him at the end all alone, cooking an unappealing meal for himself (
(line 21), with next to nothing (line 22) in the house to eat. Can it be that he cannot manage by himself, without Robin around? He is shown as anxious to get going,

This poem contains various examples of slang, for example naval slang -
(line 2), British slang - the ordinary word motor (line 11) for the amazing Batmobile, and American slang -
(line 24). The mixture of styles adds humour and perhaps helps to illustrate the growing-up process: Robin is trying out a mixture of things.
There is a serious message behind the comedy - we are encouraged to consider whether heroes and hero-worship can really sustain young people growing up. However marvellous the admired person may be, a young person has to learn to be independent -

This is a good use of thought-tracking, to inform the audience of the character's private feelings, contrasting with what she is pretending to feel.

This is echoed in the structure of the play. For instance, as soon as Romeo is alone with Juliet in the orchard, we are reminded several times of the danger he is in. Love seems to be linked to hatred throughout.
Elsewhere, the play mixes the two aspects for dramatic effect. In Act 2, Scene 4, Romeo is described as 'dead' and 'stabbed', but due to love, not hatred.

It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters, dramatic effects, themes and language. Stick to what is relevant and don't be afraid to put a personal reaction in as well - it shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied ideas you have heard.
So, imagine our task is 'How is the theme of ambition dealt with in
?'. There are all sorts of ways of answering this - one answer might start with different aspects of ambition, another answer with the language of ambition and another with the dramatic effects created. However, try to plan the start of an answer using the character of Macbeth as the focus. Once you've done that, compare your ideas with the answer below.
'How is the theme of ambition dealt with in
One of the main themes in Macbeth is ambition and from the start we can see just how tempted Macbeth is at the thought of becoming king. He recognises his 'black and deep desires' but writes to tell his wife at length and is increasingly torn by a 'suggestion' that killing Duncan will make the witches' predictions come true.
Macbeth recognises where ambition can lead and the contrast between what he thinks he should do, and his inner thoughts. His language reflects this, using antithesis such as 'heaven or to hell'. In fact, his very first words are 'So fair and foul a day'. This repeats what the witches have been saying and it would be obvious to an audience in Shakespeare's day that Macbeth is already associated with the evil the witches represent.
There are many approaches you can take to the same question. This is only the start of the task and there is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction because it keeps to the point as well as using a range of relevant details combined with personal thoughts.

Whenever you use words straight from a text, you should put quotation marks around them, and give a reference to show where the text came from.
You can use copyright-free images like Clipart, and some material on the internet is also copyright-free. You must make sure that the images you use are suitable. Many Clipart and free images are a bit tacky and not suitable for some of the tasks you will have been set.
Try to avoid using common Clipart images

Thousands of students are studying for DiDA, and they are all likely to have found the same good image on the internet. If the marker keeps seeing the same image, they will know it came from the internet and may check to see if you have checked that you can use it.
Dont rely on getting material from the internet - it is much better to find ways of generating your own resources. Try to get hold of a digital camera to take suitable photographs, use a scanner to capture your own drawings and plans, use a digital video camera to film an interview, record sounds using a microphone or get hold of a software package such as Fruity Loops to produce music.
If you create resources, the exam board will be much more impressed, you will learn a lot more, and will not be in danger of infringing anyones copyright.
A bibliography is a list of all the sources that you used to make your eportfolio, this includes all books, magazines, newspapers, websites, interviews, and TV programmes. Writing a bibliography is an important part of collecting information in all the DiDA projects.
There is a standard way of laying them out that you MUST follow. This is:
Author  put the last name first.
Title  this should be underlined and in quotation marks.
Publisher - in a book this is usually located on one of the first few pages.
Date - the date/year the book/article was published.
Put each source on a single line, with a comma between each and a full stop at the end. You should arrange them in alphabetical order of the authors surname.
You should also make sure that the list is double spaced.
Sometimes you may need to change the format around a bit, but always try to stick to the basic rules above. Use the examples below as a guideline:
Fleming, Ian, Diamonds are Forever, Penguin Books, 1957.
Dancer, Dave, How to Dance, Smash Hits, September 2003, page 34.
http://www.bbc.co.uk/dida, Dangers of the Internet, June 2005
An example of a completed DiDA bilbiography
It is best to keep your bibliography up to date as you go through each project. You'll find it is very hard to go back and try to write the bibliography once you have completed the project.
Follow these general tips to build an accurate bibliography:
Keep a word processor file called bibliography open whenever you are working on your project. Add to it whenever you do some research.
Remember to list authors and sources in alphabetical order.
Remember it is fine to use secondary sources to gather information for your project, but you cannot just reproduce them. It would be
copy a piece of work and passing it off as your own

You dont need to have several pages of references, just put in the things you used. Dont add things just for the sake of it.
You will probably need between 10 and 20 references for most projects.
Dont put search engines down in your bibliography. It is the information that you found that is the important thing to include. This is also the case for images you find using search engines such as Google Images.

The following summer, Dill returns for the vacation. Jem accidentally pushes Scout in an old car tyre right into the Radleys' yard, which terrifies her. The three children act out spooky stories about Boo and Jem tries to deliver a note to Boo on the end of a fishing pole. Atticus stops them and tries to make them more considerate by thinking of things from another person's point of view.
However, on the last day of the holidays, the three sneak onto the Radleys' property at night. Nathen, Boo's older brother, shoots at them; as they make their escape, Jem loses his trousers. When he goes back for them, he finds them neatly mended and hung over the fence, as if waiting for him.

7428,"Between now and the exam you need a clear idea of how to practise and improve.
Build up your personal vocabulary by learning a small number of new words every day.
Make sure you are familiar with the different types of task you may be asked to do, and the relevant 'rubric' or instruction in French, for example: choosing, filling in a grid or a form, matching, gap filling, putting things in order, making decisions and giving reasons.
Ask your teacher for recordings to take home. Listen to them as many times as you want. You won't be allowed this luxury in the exams, but it will build up your confidence and train your ear. Listening to any French will also help attune your ear, even if you don't understand everything, for instance French radio (on MW or LW, or on the internet), French-speaking channels on satellite TV, or videos of French-speaking films.
It is sometimes helpful to work on the transcript that goes with a recording. For example, if you study the transcript before you listen to the tape, it could help your confidence when you realise how much you understand.
Practise not writing when the tape is playing, because it is hard to write and listen at the same time. Learn to trust your short term memory!
If you are entered for higher tier, make sure you have the opportunity to listen to longer passages. These often require you to understand the feelings, opinions and attitudes of the speakers.
Before you go into the exam ask your teacher to offer the class a 'warm up' listening session of about 20 minutes. If this is not possible, listen to a tape of your own.
You must come to the exam with a clear idea of the strategies that will help you work well under pressure. Here are some suggestions.
Before the tape starts have a close look at the question. Be clear as to exactly what is wanted. Should you be listening for precise pieces of information (for example, train arrival and departure times) or should you be listening to the whole passage in order to draw a conclusion (for example, name the girl who has the best relationship with her parents)?
As you read the question you should try to predict the sort of information that may be in the passage. It will help focus your mind.
Have a good look at the title of the question as well as any illustrations. They may give you some important clues as to what is coming.
When the tape begins, don't panic! You are not expected to understand every word. If the passage is long or if people are speaking quickly, there is probably a lot of ""redundant"" language that you do not need. Be positive. Concentrate on what you
understand. Remember - the passage may be difficult but the questions may be easy.
Use your knowledge of grammar. For example, it may be important to know whether someone is talking about the past or the future.
Use your knowledge of France and French-speaking countries. For example, if you hear people mentioning the N7 and the D255 you should be aware that they are talking about roads.
Don't just listen to the words. The tone of someone's voice may also be helpful in showing their mood. The intonation of someone's voice may tell you if they are making a statement or asking a question
If you have to write answers in French, be as clear as possible; but remember you will not be penalised for small mistakes.
Now decide which strategies will work best for you and practise using them as much as you can between now and the day of the exam. The more you practise them, the more you are likely to remember to use them during the exam itself.

We cannot see or feel ultraviolet radiation, but our skin responds to it by turning darker. This happens in an attempt to reduce the amount of ultraviolet radiation that reaches deeper skin tissues.
Darker skins absorb more ultraviolet light, so less ultraviolet radiation reaches the deeper tissues. This is important because ultraviolet radiation can cause normal cells to become cancerous.
Sunblocks can reduce the damage caused by ultraviolet radiation. They contain chemicals that absorb a lot of the radiation and prevent it from reaching our skin. They may also contain chemicals that reflect some of the radiation away from the skin.
Manufacturers of sunblocks make products with different sun protection
the higher the factor, the longer you can stay out in the sun without burning
high factor sunblocks reduce the risks from ultraviolet radiation more than low factor sunblocks
If, for example, you would get sunburnt after ten minutes in the sun, with Factor 5 applied you could stay in the sun for 50 minutes - or for 1500 minutes with Factor 150 applied. But the real time is usually lower, because some of the sunblock gets absorbed by the skin, and some gets rubbed off.

Solar cells are devices that convert light energy directly into electrical energy. You may have seen small solar cells in calculators. Larger arrays of solar cells are used to power road signs in remote areas, and even larger arrays are used to power satellites in orbit around Earth.
Solar panels do not generate electricity, but rather they heat up water. They are often located on the roofs of buildings where they can receive heat energy from the sun. The diagram outlines how they work.
Cold water is pumped up to the solar panel, there it heats up and is transferred to a storage tank.
A pump pushes cold water from the storage tank through pipes in the solar panel. The water is heated by heat energy from the sun and returns to the tank. In some systems, a conventional boiler may be used to increase the temperature of the water.
and there are no fuel costs. No harmful polluting gases are produced.
, so the cost of their electricity is high.
Solar panels may only produce very hot water in very sunny climates, and in cooler areas may need to be supplemented with a conventional boiler.
Although warm water can be produced even on cloudy days, neither solar cells nor solar panels work at night.

Below is a David Low cartoon from September 1939 satirising the Nazi-Soviet Pact.
What are the key features of the cartoon and what do they mean?
Hitler and Stalin pretending to like each other.
A figure (representing Poland) lying dead on the floor between Stalin and Hitler.
Both wear guns and military uniforms, and Germany's weapons (on the left) are in the background.
The world was amazed by this alliance of opposites, but, at the time:
Stalin needed time to re-arm for when Hitler did invade Russia.
Stalin would have to go to war if he allied with Britain and France, but could have half of Poland without a war if he allied with Hitler - it was an easy choice to make.
It was a marriage of convenience, until Hitler broke his promise and invaded Russia in 1940.
Think about this by reading Source B below - a passage written by an American journalist who lived in Europe at the time.
For sheer cynicism, the Nazi dictator had met his match in the Soviet despot ... the sordid, secret deal ... The Soviet despot for years had cried out at the 'fascist beasts' and called for peace-loving states to band together to halt the Nazi aggression.
William Shirer, ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" (1959)
Can you see any similarities between Source A and Source B?
Shirer echoes the idea represented in the cartoon that Russia and Germany had hated each other for years, and the cartoon's other idea that they were just pretending to like each other for their ""sordid"" deal.
Read Source C below written by two modern historians
The pact left Britain and France to fight Germany alone. Hitler did not really believe they would go to war over Poland, but almost had second thoughts when Britain's reaction to the Pact was the signing of a formal alliance with Poland on 25 August 1939. This time Britain and France would not be able to back down ... But the Anglo-Polish alliance did not change anything. It only took a few days for Hitler to recover his nerve and order that Poland be invaded on 1 September.
Nigel Kelly and Greg Lacey, Modern World History (2001)
ways Source C suggests the Nazi-Soviet Pact brought war nearer.
It left Britain and France to fight Germany alone, and Hitler did not really believe they would go to war over Poland.
It led Britain to sign an alliance with Poland on 25 August 1939, so they could not back down.
It encouraged Hitler to recover his nerve.

Sometimes a question will ask you to work backwards and find the original price of something after the price has increased. If you are given a quantity after a percentage increase or decrease, and you need to find the original amount, use this method:
A radio sells for 63, after a 40% increase in the cost price. Find the cost price.
Start with the original amount as 100%.
We are told the selling price is a 40% in the cost price.
So the selling price is 100% + 40% = 140% of the cost price.
We know that the selling price is 63, so 140% = 63.
The cost price is 100%, so multiply 0.45 by 100.
Cost price = 0.45  100 = 45.
A new car falls in value by 30% in a year. After a year, it is worth 8,400.
Find the price of the car when it was new.
Remember that the original price of the car is 100%.
Second-hand price = 100% - 30% = 70%.
So 8,400 = 70% of the original price.
So 1% of original price = 8,400  70
Original price = 100% = 100 x 1% = 100 x (8,400  70)

Little Boy Lost / Little Boy Found
Blake narrates the boy's story while Yeats' poem is told entirely in the Mother's words.
The mother is only a shadowy figure in Blake's poem, rather than the main character as in The Song.

Both poems use the voice of the Mother, but...
Yeats has imagined a fictional person, while in Catrin it is Clarke's own voice describing a real relationship with her child.
Both poems deal with feelings of conflict between the generations, which in Catrin is seen as normal and joyous:
""From the heart's pool that old rope .. trailing love and conflict""
The Clarke poem is much freer in form than The Song.Does this difference suggest anything about how the two poems see motherhood?
The 'I' or 'we' used by a narrator who is a participant in a narrative, in contrast to the third person 'he', 'she' or 'they' of a narrator who is not directly involved.
Heaney writes about his own father, while Yeats writes about an imaginary Mother.
Like Yeats, Heaney emphasises the hard working life of that generation: his father is digging, straining and heaving.
Heaney's poem is very affectionate, showing his love for his father. The Mother in contrast is resentful of the young.
Both poems deal with the relationship between the generations, but ...
But Duffy writes as a (grown-up) child addressing her mother, while Yeats' Mother is addressing the young.

2393,"Abortion is the artificial ending of the life of a foetus in the womb (uterus). A natural abortion is called a miscarriage. Abortion has been legal in England, Scotland and Wales since 1967 when The Abortion Act was passed. A new upper time limit of 24 weeks was introduced in 1990 under The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.
An abortion may be carried out if one of the following conditions applies:
the life or physical health of the mother is at risk
the mental health of the mother is at risk
there is a reasonable chance that the child will be born seriously disabled
Where the mental health of the mother is at risk, or her family will suffer if the pregnancy continues, the latest termination date is 24 weeks. There is no upper limit if the life or physical health of the mother is at risk, or if there is a reasonable chance of a seriously disabled child being born.
In 1974 119,000 legal abortions were carried out in England and Wales, by 2006 this figure had risen to 193,700.
The Christian Church teaches that life is a sacred gift from God:
Then God said, Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
Christian teaching on abortion is complex. An early Christian document, the Didache, condemns it:
You shall not kill by abortion the fruit of the womb.
The Bible appears to say that life begins when the baby is in the mothers womb:
For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mothers womb.
Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.
opposes abortion in every instance. However, if life saving treatment given to a pregnant woman results in the unavoidable loss of a foetus, but saves the mother, then this is accepted and known as 'double effect'.
Roman Catholic teaching is that the foetus is a human being. This is clearly expressed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) which states:
From the first moment of his(her) existence, a human being must be recognised as having the rights of a person  among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life
When Elizabeth heard Marys greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
(Quakers) believe that although abortion should not be encouraged, the life of the unborn child cannot be seen as more important than that of the mother.
movement generally argues that life becomes human life at the point of conception. It says that abortion should not be allowed, but most would allow an abortion if the mothers life was at risk or if pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.
movement generally argues that human life begins much later in pregnancy, or at birth. There are many points of view among pro-choicers, but fundamentally they think that the woman should have full control over what happens to her body.

Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transferred from one form to another, or moved. Energy that is wasted, like the light energy from a glowing electric fire, does not disappear. Instead, it is transferred into the surroundings and spreads out so much that it becomes very difficult to do anything useful with it.

Everything else might happen to us: we might get married, be rich, be happy, have children, open our own business or travel the world, but the only real certainty is that we will die.
It is not surprising that people have always asked questions about what, if anything, happens after they die.
Although some people claim to have had near-death experiences (NDEs), and others claim to be able to talk to the dead, or to have seen ghosts, there is no scientific proof that such experiences actually provide a glimpse into a possible afterlife. It is possible, therefore, that when people die, they simply stop living and that there is nothing beyond this life.
Ideas about what happens after death, and its connection with how life is lived on earth, is a fundamental part of all religions. The details may differ between religions, but belief in an afterlife almost always:
helps people to make sense of life, particularly when life seems unfair or at times of suffering (their own, and others peoples)
gives support and comfort at times of loss and bereavement
Sikhs believe in reincarnation. This means that a persons soul may be reborn many times as a human or an animal. Therefore, for Sikhs, death is not the end. The Sikh sacred text, the

Sikhs believe that everything that happens is
There is a divine spark which is part of Waheguru in each person and this spark or soul is taken back to join Waheguru when a person is finally released from the cycle of rebirth. Sikhs believe that there are 8,400,000 forms of life and that many souls have to travel though a number of these before they can reach Waheguru. When something dies their soul is reborn. Only humans know the difference between right and wrong and so it is only when the soul is in a human being that there is a chance of the cycle being broken.
. This belief says that actions and the consequences of these actions decide whether a soul can be set loose from the cycle. Freedom from the cycle of rebirth is called
These things can stop a soul reaching
- being self-centred instead of God-centred which is
- illusion - looking at the world and ignoring Waheguru
 being too attached to the world

- selfless service to others. To avoid these dangers Sikhs try to follow rules of conduct:
there is only one God  Waheguru
worship and pray to Waheguru alone, and remember Waheguru at all times
always work hard, and share with others
remember that men and women are equal in the eyes of Waheguru
the whole human race is one - distinctions of caste, colour and class are wrong
idols, magic, omens, fasts, marks on the face and sacred threads are banned

These written materials are examples for revision practice only. They are not from any exam papers.
New X-ray scanners at British airports could be exposing passengers to potentially dangerous levels of radiation, according to one senior radiologist.
The machines are designed to 'strip-search' passengers by using low-level X-rays which produce an image of their bodies and reveal whether they are secretly carrying weapons or explosives. More X-rays bounce back from metal than from the human body, so you can easily see if someone has a gun hidden under their clothes.
But the scanners may not be safe for certain people, particularly children and women in the early stages of pregnancy, according to one doctor.
""The risks of the baby developing abnormalities are highest when they are growing more rapidly. That is because the body cells are multiplying more rapidly, and exposure to ionising radiation can damage the DNA in those cells,"" said the doctor. ""It is illegal to expose people to any level of radiation without medical justification. The machines are referred to as 'low-dose', but many people say that there is no 'safe' radiation dose.""
""I know that passengers are exposed to 'cosmic' radiation within the aircraft, but there's nothing they can do about that. It can't be avoided. We should always avoid deliberately exposing people to radiation.""
According to the company making the scanner, it gives a radiation dose of only 0.03 microsieverts, compared with 100 microsieverts in a medical X-ray. The company claims that this is no higher than the amount the body is normally exposed to every five minutes from natural radiation in the atmosphere. The company also says that frequent flyers would need to have at least 5000 scans a year before there would be any health threat.

English is a language that is constantly changing and evolving. If it didn't, we'd still be speaking like Shakespeare!
- each generation provides words known as 'slang' - often many of these words become accepted into mainstream English eg 'ok' and 'cool'. However, many slang terms lose popularity as a new generation emerges with their own slang words and phrases - making words such as 'phat' and 'groovy' history.
- the multi-cultural society we live in often provides new or adapted words. You might be familiar with the term 'avatar' in online communities but did you know the word is actually Hindi in origin? Has anyone ever said 'gesundheit' after you've sneezed? This is actually a German word, which has become popular in English.
- these are words or phrases that you only hear in a particular geographical area eg do you eat your sausage in a roll, bap or bun? Depending on where you live, it could be any of these. If you're Cornish, you might hear someone from Birmingham or Scotland using different words and grammar to you, even though you're all still speaking English.

Ariel tells Prospero what has happened to the ship and its passengers and crew. He tells how he appeared on the ship as a flame (he is after all a magic spirit), and frightened the passengers so much that they had jumped in to the sea. Only the crew remained on the ship.
Prospero wants to be sure that the crew and the passengers are safe. Ariel tells him how he saw to it that the passengers were washed up on the island in separate groups. He made sure the ship was safe, and that the crew were sleeping peacefully. He had sent the rest of the fleet back to Naples, with everyone believing that their king's ship had been sunk, and its passengers drowned.
Ariel now changes the subject, and says he's getting impatient. He reminds Prospero there is a time limit on how long he had to be Prospero's servant, after his release from Sycorax's spell. Ariel wants his freedom, and reminds Prospero that he's been a good servant.

Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts
A salt is always made when an acid is neutralised by a base. But the exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used.
The name of a salt has two parts:
the first part comes from the metal in the base used
the second part comes from the acid that was used
Where does the name potassium nitrate come from?
These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt:
How can we make copper sulfate? The first part of the name is 'copper', so we need a base containing copper. We could use copper oxide or copper carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'sulfate', so we need to use sulfuric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
copper sulfate + water + carbon dioixde
How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
sodium chloride + water + carbon dioxide
It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced.

If you were to compare the scores in the two subjects, English and Maths, which measure of average would you use and why?
The range of scores in English (37) is far greater than that in the Maths (4).
The mean score in each subject is 78 which implies that the scores of the students are more-or-less identical in English and Maths. But looking at the actual scores, you can see that this is not the case.
If you compare the medians (71 and 78), you might assume that the students generally scored less in English, (which is partly true, but there are also some much higher scores there too).
If you just state the modal score for each subject (101 and 78), you have no information about the scores of the other students.
So, which is best? It seems that to give maximum information,
a combination of the median and the range would be best.
So, in summary, English has a median score of 71 and a range of 37, and Maths has a median score of 78 and a range of 4.

A complex sentence is used to put across more
ideas. A complex sentence contains one main clause that can make sense on its own, and one or more minor clauses that are linked to it.
The main clause is the 'big dog barked' because it has a subject and a verb and makes sense by itself.
The minor clause is 'When I arrived'. Although it is a clause with a subject and a verb, it doesn't make sense on its own, it needs a main clause.
We can add more minor clauses to make a more complex sentence.
We can even split the main clause with a minor clause and still have a complex sentence.

Using laboratory techniques scientists can alter the genetic code within the DNA of a living organism. They can add genes from a different species to an organism's DNA
For example, GM can be used to alter the DNA in a bacterium so that it produces insulin. This is a human hormone and valuable to people with diabetes. Bacteria reproduce quickly, so a lot of insulin can be made quickly and used to help people suffering from diabetes.
Some people are concerned that there may be negative aspects to GM.
For example, there are people that believe GM is unethical and should be banned.
Other people are concerned that there may be unexpected long term problems of using GM, producing changes that could not be reversed. Such changes could create new pathogens or ""superweeds"" by the GM organisms breeding with other species. This could cause the natural balance of living organisms in the environment to be upset.

He tried to reach up and tear the band away, but there were sharp bands round his wrists as well. He tried to move his feet, but there were more cold, sharp bands around his ankles.
Westall refers to the bands around Ralph's body four times. This isn't because he couldn't think of another phrase.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - Language
Think about how language is used in the two Key Extracts - for example, where it seems the same in both, and where it seems different.
When Montague talks about how Romeo is in a bad mood and avoiding sunlight, he uses lots of imagery to do with darkness.
When Romeo describes Juliet he uses lots of words and imagery to do with light. Even the night imagery involves brightness with stars and the moon.
The metaphors and similes used by the characters in the first extract (especially Romeo) are quite complicated. Benvolio and Romeo enjoy using puns to make jokes together. Language is used in clever ways.
Romeo still uses language skillfully, but Juliet wants honesty rather than clever poetry. When Romeo starts to swear by the moon, she won't let him finish his clever metaphor. Juliet uses imagery to make her thoughts clear, eg Romeo is like a rose; Juliet's love is as deep as the sea.
Much of the first extract is in rhyme. In the scene between Romeo and Benvolio, this helps to bring out the humour in their banter.
Romeo and Juliet both speak in blank verse: they are talking about love in a much more sensitive way than Romeo did when he was talking to Benvolio. Juliet's final line in the scene finishes Romeo's to make one line of blank verse. (Blank verse is unrhymed and has lines that have 10 syllables each). This shows how close they have become.
If you get a question about language in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with your answer:
How is love described in the two extracts?
Love is described in many different ways in the two extracts. By the second extract, love is described in a more positive light.
In the first extract, Romeo uses oxymorons because he is confused about his feelings for Rosaline. Romeo compares love to poison and madness.
In the second extract, Romeo uses words to do with light and heaven when describing his feelings for Juliet. Juliet talks about love in terms of truth and promises.
In the first extract, love means many different things to Romeo. Love is confusing to Romeo and seems to have a dark side that he has no control over. Love is ruining his life. By the end of the first extract, you might think that Romeo has confused his feelings of lust for love. In the second extract, love is related to light and heaven for Romeo. Perhaps when he meets Juliet, he realizes what true love is. For Juliet, love is about truth and honesty. She is almost overwhelmed by her feelings for Romeo. For both characters, love is a powerful and wonderful force.

Prospero is a controlling character who seems to be obsessed with power and status. Ferdinand is a prince, but he has no status on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero pretends not to believe that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne of Naples and insists on taking him prisoner. He calls him a ""spy"", a ""traitor"", and an ""impostor"". He accuses him of lying. He threatens to ""manacle"" him and starve him. He uses his magic powers to prevent Ferdinand from defending himself. He also has control over Ariel and even talks about how his daughter will have ""control"" over Ferdinand when he falls in love with her.
Prospero is only pretending to be cruel and unwelcoming to Ferdinand as part of his plan, but it seems as though he is enjoying himself in the process. Even Miranda is alarmed at his behaviour.

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
When you are persuading people, you usually use a different style. You don't need to show both sides - all you have to do is present your ideas. For instance, imagine you had to persuade people to buy a certain toothpaste. You could write about the great taste, or how clean your teeth feel or how white they are. It doesn't really matter what you find to write about as long as you get them to buy it.
But you wouldn't write about other makes of toothpaste. You don't persuade like this, because it sounds like you aren't sure. So the first thing to remember is:
- if you are writing about how great chips are, keep repeating the idea. Convince yourself how good they are - they might even be a healthy option, because lots of doctors are bound to like them and chips wouldn't be so popular if they weren't really great, would they? Once you have convinced yourself, it's much easier to convince others. So next you need to remember to...
- it's always better to hear how good your idea is rather than how bad other people's are. So write about the things that show your ideas in the best light. For instance, aren't chips just great for a quick snack? Why were chips voted the most popular option in our school at lunchtime? And finally don't be frightened to...
- If you don't seem too sure, or if you can't make your ideas stand out, then you aren't really persuading as much as you can. And if that is the case, you need The Persuaders' Toolkit.
- don't worry about saying the same thing again and again - people forget, so repeat yourself and they will remember. Even when you think they might remember, you can always repeat yourself another time.
- using words such as ""we"" or ""I"" always sounds a lot more convincing. We all know that, don't we?
- why would you use questions? Well, they make people think. They also get your readers involved in what you are writing. So will you use them when you persuade? If not, why not?
- words are your ammunition. In seconds, they can make your friends laugh, or your teacher angry, so why not use them properly to persuade your readers?
For instance, don't just write ""the pressure of doing school work"", because there is no real feeling there. Instead, how about: ""the endless trauma, the desperation and the mindless suffering that school work inflicts on students"".

Don't use 'Well' or 'You know' or 'Anyway' or 'Like I just said' or any phrase that sounds like you are having a friendly chat.
Avoid using: 'And', 'But', 'Because' or 'So' at the beginning of a sentence.
Words like 'nice' and 'a lot' have no power. Try to think of more descriptive words eg 'delicious' or 'endless'.
Clichs are colourful phrases that people use all the time in speech. So often, in fact, that they seem worn out and boring in writing. Avoid phrases such as 'pretty as a picture', 'big as a house', 'skinny as a rake'.

368,"A debate is an organised argument. You might think you've never taken part in a debate before but you probably have without realising it! When you discuss topics in class or at home, and put forward different points of view - this is debating. Debating allows you to discuss your ideas and find out what other people think about a particular topic.
If you're asked to take part in an organised debate at school, this is likely to be a more formal discussion and follow a set of rules.
Here are some simple rules for formal debates:
First of all, you need two teams: the proposition team and the opposition team.
Then you need something to argue about. This is called a motion.
The proposition team starts. Their first speaker has to tell everyone what the motion is all about.
The opposition team goes next. Then the teams take it in turns until everyone has had their say.
The last speaker on each team has to sum up their team's main argument.
Your team will need to do plenty of preparation - writing out the main points of your argument. During the debate, your team is allowed to pass notes to each other so that you can add or change things as you go along. The most convincing team wins the debate. Try to guess in advance what your opposing team might argue to avoid being caught out.
Use these tips to make your arguments as convincing as you can:
Use facts - it's hard to argue against a fact so use as much evidence and as many statistics as possible.
Use opinion too - debating is all about getting your opinion across and persuading others to agree with you, so use a good balance of fact and opinion.
Listen to the other team and comment on what they have said. You then have a chance to convince the audience of the other side of the argument.
Structure your argument - as if you were writing an essay, you need a clear introduction, a middle and a conclusion.
Arguing isn't about shouting the loudest - present your arguments in a clear controlled voice. Don't lose your temper or get too emotional about the arguments.
Improve your public speaking and maybe you'll be TV Presenter one day. But it's not all bad!

 But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
Be not her maid, since she is envious:
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
 It is my lady!  O, it is my love!
She speaks  yet she says nothing. What of that?
Her eye discourses. I will answer it.
 I am too bold. Tis not to me she speaks.
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night!
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
O speak again, bright angel!  For thou art
As glorious to this night, being oer my head,
As is a wingd messenger of heaven
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name 
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love
And Ill no longer be a Capulet.
(Aside)Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
Whats Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
Whats in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet.
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name 
And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Call me but love, and Ill be new-baptized.
What man art thou, that thus bescreened in night
I know not how to tell thee who I am.
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of thy tongues uttering, yet I know the sound.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
How camst thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb 
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls,
For stony limits cannot hold love out 
And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet
And I am proof against their enmity.
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
I have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes.
And but thou love me, let them find me here.
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogud, wanting of thy love.
By whose direction foundst thou out this place?
By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot, yet wert thou as far
As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Fain would I dwell on form  fain, fain deny
What I have spoke.  But farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay 
And I will take thy word. Yet if thou swearst
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers perjuries
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
Or if thou think I am too quickly won,
Ill frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo  but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light.
But trust me, gentleman, Ill prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheardst, ere I was ware,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discoverd.
Lady, by yonder blessd moon I vow,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops 
O swear not by the moon, th inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract tonight.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden 
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.
This bud of love, by summers ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Th exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it 
And yet I would it were to give again.
Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
But to be frank and give it thee again:
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.

O blessd, blessd night! I am afeard,
Being in night, all this but a dream,
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow
By one that Ill procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite 
And all my fortunes at thy foot Ill lay,
And follow thee, my lord, throughout the world.
I come! Anon!  But if thou meanst not well,
 To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief.

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to argue
The key thing about writing an argument is that you present both sides and come to a clear conclusion. It's not like arguing with one of your friends, when you just say what you think. Instead, when you write an argument you have to show you are reasonable and can consider the different sides.
The following article has appeared in your local paper:
Ashfield Park is threatened with closure next month as a local business has applied for planning permission to turn the area into a car park. Local residents have begun a fierce campaign to save the park, which is a popular walking spot for young children and the elderly, as well as home to the War Memorial and many wildlife species.
Write to your local paper, arguing that the park should be preserved.
It would not be enough to write that you want the park to be saved - it might be how you feel, but it wouldn't be an argument..
It wouldn't even be enough if you wrote about all the good things in the park. That would be
as you haven't thought about any other views.
A good argument presents both the good and bad aspects of keeping the park. For instance, the park might protect nature, but cost a lot to keep clean. It might be a good place to walk, but few people actually go there. An argument depends on bringing these ideas together. Use connectives, like ""because"" or ""however"" or ""although"". These words give your argument a logical structure and help make the contrasts clear.
Once you have worked through these ideas, you come to your conclusion - saying whether they should keep the park or not.

Humans have instincts, but it is possible for us to overcome natural urges to follow a certain behaviour. For example, a hungry person might want to start eating immediately when they sit down at the dinner table, but they have learned that good manners mean they should wait until everyone is seated and ready to eat.
Most people start smoking before they are adults
People often imitate each other. This can help them learn something new and useful, such as new skill in lessons, sport or at work. It can also lead them to show less useful behaviour.

Conditioning can be used to change the behaviour of people. Advertisers are very skilled at this. They use pictures of their products which make the them look glamorous or exciting, often by using famous actors or sports people.

Food chains - Getting carbon dioxide, light and water
Remember that the equation for photosynthesis is:
carbon dioxide + water (+ light energy)
Let's see how plants get the carbon dioxide and water they need for this process.
Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves. The carbon dioxide
through small holes in the underside of the leaf called stomata. (One of these holes is called a stoma. The plural is stomata.)
The lower part of the leaf has loose-fitting cells, to allow carbon dioxide to reach the other cells in the leaf. This also allow the oxygen produced in photosynthesis to leave the leaf easily.
A leaf usually has a large surface area, so that it can absorb a lot of light. Its top surface is protected from water loss, disease and weather damage by a waxy layer.
The upper part of the leaf is where the light falls, and it contains a type of cell called a
. This is adapted to absorb a lot of light. It has lots of chloroplasts and is shaped like a tall box.
Turgid plant that's watered regularly and a flacid plant without enough water.
Plants get the water they need for photosynthesis through their roots.
The roots have a type of cell called a root hair cell - these project out from the root into the soil. Roots have a big surface area and thin walls, which allow water to pass into them easily.
Note that root cells do not contain chloroplasts, as they are normally in the dark and cannot photosynthesise.
The water absorbed by the root hair cells passes through the plant in
tubes, and eventually reachers the leaves. If a plant does not absorb enough water, it will wilt or go floppy. Without water it may also not photosynthesise quickly enough, and it may die.

The English and Maths results of ten classmates are shown in the table below:
To see whether there is a correlation between the Maths and English marks, you could plot a scatter diagram.
The Maths mark is on the horizontal scale and the corresponding English mark on the vertical scale.
Bill's Maths mark was 60 and his English mark was 65, so his results are represented by the orange point at coordinates (60, 65).
In the scatter diagram above, whose mark does the small red cross represent?
The co-ordinates of the cross are (80, 70).
Therefore, the Maths mark is 80 and the English mark 70.
You can see that all the points representing Maths marks and English marks lie approximately along a straight line. This shows that there is a correlation between these two variables.
The table below shows the correlations that you can deduce from different patterns of scatter.
The points lie close to a straight line, which has a positive gradient.
This shows that as one variable increases the other increases.
The points lie close to a straight line, which has a negative gradient.
This shows that as one variable increases, the other decreases.
There is no pattern to the points.
This shows that there is no connection between the two variables.
Would you expect there to be positive correlation, negative correlation, or no correlation between the following pairs of variables:
a) As temperature increases, the sales of ice-cream are also likely to increase. Therefore, there is likely to be positive correlation.
b) It is unlikely that there is a connection between height and intelligence. Therefore, there is no correlation.

Make your characters and plot realistic. How do people really speak and act? Remember, most writers base some of their characters on people they actually know, so who can you use to improve your story? Would your granny make a good secret agent or your uncle a confident contract killer?
Get straight to the point. Don't worry about long openings or lots of detail. Instead, launch right in, hopefully in the middle of some action, like in the example below.
Steve held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - he was too shocked to speak. One moment he had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next he was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
You will also have to decide whether to write in the first person (using ""I""), or in the third person (typically, using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they""). Using ""I"" makes it easier to write about thoughts and feelings, but using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they"" lets you move from person to person, or from place to place. You can choose whichever you feel happiest with. For instance, we can swap the opening of the story into the first person, like this:
I held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - I was too shocked to speak. One moment I had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next I was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?

A simple sentence generally has one main verb and communicates one idea. For example:
There can be several words in the verb, so
- has two words in the verb.
- has three words in the verb.
However, in each example there is just one main verb and idea. This is the simplest type of sentence and usually it's very easy to understand.
A compound sentence generally joins two simple sentences together. We typically use words like 'and', 'or' and 'but' to join the ideas. For example:
It was cold but we still went to town.
It was raining and we stayed indoors.
This makes the two ideas equal in the sentence - if we take away one part of it, we are left with a simple sentence again. These are very common when we are speaking and they are not difficult to understand.
A complex sentence communicates more than one idea, so it's like a compound sentence in a way. However, the ideas are not equal. This is because one part is like a simple sentence, so it can stand on its own. The other part can't - it needs something else to support it. For instance, look at this sentence:
You can't persuade me to go to town, no matter how hard you try.
We can take away the first part, but then we are left with:
Now this is not a simple sentence and it doesn't stand on its own - it needs something else to make sense.
We use complex sentences a lot when we speak, but it's important to use them in our writing too. In fact, these are the most difficult sentences to get right.

499,"> Drama - Drama from your imagination
Taking part in drama doesn't always involve learning lines from scripts - often you'll be asked to improvise. Usually you will work in groups or pairs to devise a piece of drama from your own imagination. You'll need to be able to think on your feet and become a different character.
This might sound difficult, but you've probably improvised before without realising it - in games you used to play as a child. If you've ever played pirates, nurses or superheroes when you were younger, you were improvising - although don't think running around your classroom with a tablecloth for a cape pretending to be Superman will impress your drama teacher - it probably won't!
As with any English work, you need to think about your audience when you devise drama. Your drama needs to entertain them and keep their attention. Your drama also needs to be believable - your audience is likely to become disconnected if your story or characters are too far fetched.
The story of your drama begins with your character. Ask yourself: what does my character feel, think and react?
Here are two ideas for a character:
You are a journalist who has uncovered a story that will have big consequences and you're about to tell the world. Would your character be confident or scared?
You are a global superstar - singer, actor and producer - and paparazzi follow your every move. You live a glamorous and privileged life, but what are the secrets behind the smiles?
When you have decided on your character, you need to create a scene.
Here are some ideas for a scene based on the characters above. Can you think of any more?
You're about to appear on the most popular morning TV programme and expose your discovery when you suddenly receive a startling phone call. Who is on the phone? What do they say? How do they make you feel?
You've landed a part in a popular soap but you don't get on with the other actors. Should you tell the press the truth or pretend that you all get along?
You've been working late in the library just double checking a few facts for your article when you notice a menacing looking man watching you. Does your character panic or keep calm? Do they run or confront the man? Maybe they are being paranoid?
The press have published some false rumours about you and you're really upset. Your agent has secured a slot on a popular chat show to give your side of the story. Do you accept the offer or decide to lie low? How do you feel?
Your article has been published and has been a massive hit. You're receiving job offers from high profile newspapers and magazines and your life is about to change for the better. How do your family react? What do you decide to do?
You've found out that one of the other band members is planning to leave the group and go solo. You confront them - can you persuade them to stay, or would it be better for everyone if they left?
When you have a rough idea of your character and scene, you can think about what your character might say. If you're given time to prepare you should write a short script. If working in pairs or a group, you could improvise the scene first to get more ideas.
You may be allowed to use props to make your scene more realistic and interesting. Only use a prop if it is relevant, otherwise it could end up distracting you and your audience. If you decide to use props and costumes, always practice with them first.

The two extracts deal with some deep issues. You will need to discuss how these are brought out. Some of the 'big' themes are:
If the question asks you to comment on how the theme of power is explored, consider these points:
In the first extract, Ariel's songs calm the storm and make Ferdinand believe that his father is dead. This puts Ferdinand in a weak position which makes it easier for Prospero to manipulate him. Ariel's magic powers are responsible for much of what happens in the play.
Ariel only performs his magic so that he can win his freedom. Prospero has power over Ariel because Ariel owes him a debt of gratitude.
It could be argued that Prospero's assertion of power and authority over Ferdinand is unnecessarily harsh.
Prospero is obsessed with power and authority having had his title taken from him by his brother Antonio.
As a prince, Ferdinand's royal power becomes redundant on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero sees Miranda and Ferdinand's love as a power that he can use to manipulate Ferdinand.
Miranda seems powerless under her father's control on the island. She rebels against him, but even her rebellion was part of Prospero's plan.
Miranda and Ferdinand's love is a power that exists independently of magic.

The different substances in mixtures are usually easily separated from one another. The method you use depends upon the type of mixture you have.

Sand, for example, can be separated from a mixture of sand and water using filtration. That's because sand does not dissolve in water.

For example copper sulfate crystals can be separated from copper sulfate solution using evaporation. Remember that it is the water that evaporates away, not the solution.

The extract below is from a leaflet about passive smoking.
. Passive smoking is breathing in other people's tobacco smoke. Other people's tobacco smoke is sometimes called environmental tobacco smoke.
. Only 15% of the smoke from a cigarette is inhaled by the smoker - the rest goes into the surrounding air and other people can breathe it in. Breathing air which contains tobacco smoke can be bad for your health. This is because the tiny particles and gases in tobacco smoke contain over 4000 chemicals, many of which are harmful - at least 60 are known to cause cancer. The gases also contain carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas that comes out of car exhausts.
Q. What is the effect on my health?
. Breathing other people's smoke is uncomfortable and can cause:
nose, throat and chest irritation and breathing difficulties

The following questions will draw on all the skills you have revised so far. Note down your answers then compare them with ours.
Q1. What, according to the leaflet, is ""passive smoking""?
Q2. How much of the smoke from one cigarette is inhaled by the smoker?

Q4. Who do you think is the target audience for the leaflet?
Q5. Give one reason why you think this.
Q6. Look at the second answer that the writer has given in the leaflet: the one beginning ""Only 15% of the smoke..."". Explain two ways in which the writer has used language to persuade the reader that passive smoking is dangerous.
Q7. Why has the writer phrased each heading as a question?
Q8. Explain two ways in which the writer has used layout to make the text more effective.
A1. Passive smoking is 'breathing in other people's tobacco smoke'.
A2. 15% is inhaled by the smoker.
A3. Coughing. (You could name any of the effects listed in the bullet points.)
A4. The target audience could be teenagers, or a broad audience. It is the reason that you give in the next answer that is more important.
A5. Reasons are: the language used is quite simple; sentences are mainly quite short and simple, many only contain one or two ideas; the information is broken up into short sections; the headings make the information easy to follow. All these would make the text accessible for many readers, including young people.
A6. There are three main ways: the simple statement that it is 'bad for your health'; the fact that tobacco smoke contains 'over 4000 chemicals', many of which are harmful; the mention of carbon monoxide which is 'poisonous'.
A7. The headings are phrased as questions to draw the reader into the text.
A8. Layout has been used in several different ways: the 'Q' and 'A' format is eyecatching; the short paragraphs are easy to follow; the bullet points at the end of the extract make the facts easy to read.

Human behaviour is affected by many variables. It can be more difficult to study than the behaviour of other animals.
Fieldwork does not always mean you have to work in a field. It means investigations that take place outside the laboratory.
Some scientists spend many hours watching and studying the behaviour of animals. They may be interested in how the animals live alone, group into families or form large groups such as herds.
Scientists can tag sharks to study their behaviour.
Animals can signal to each other. For example, they may call to each other to warn of danger. Some scientists are interested in such signals. They record and study them to try to work out what the signals mean.
Some animals migrate over large distances to find food or nesting sites.
Animals can be tagged by attaching tracking devices to them. Tagging lets scientists follow the journeys the animals make.
The work of Lorentz and Pavlov has been mentioned in this Revision Bite. These scientists studied animal behaviour under controlled conditions.
The behaviour of woodlice is often studied in schools. Several woodlice are put into a choice chamber with four different conditions:
The woodlice are left on their own for a while, and then the number of animals in each quarter is counted. Woodlice prefer dark and damp conditions. The quarter of the choice chamber with these conditions contains most or all of the woodlice.

This is a natural response to a stimulus - food makes a dog's mouth water. The saliva produced is needed to start digesting food and to make swallowing food easier.
Pavlov noticed that they also did this when the person who fed them came into the room, even if the person had not brought any food. Pavlov went on to ring a bell at the start of feeding time, and eventually the dogs produced extra saliva when they heard the bell, before any food was brought in.
A dog salivating when it hears a bell is not a natural response. They would not do this without being conditioned to do so. The behaviour has been learned. It's called a

The simplest complete circuit is a piece of wire from one end of a battery to the other. An electric current can flow in the wire from one end of the battery to the other, but nothing useful happens. The wire just gets hot and the battery goes flat.

Some people argue that it is a relatively safe, disciplined, highly skilled and technical sport that brings enjoyment and employment to a great many people. Others claim that it is a dangerous and barbaric spectacle that has no place in the civilised world. This article will explore each side's claim in more detail.
Why is this an effective opening for the text?
It is totally in keeping with the title.
It uses a formal, impersonal tone, which is appropriate for an argument text.
It gives a summary of both sides of the argument.
Let's consider some alternative beginnings and see if they are suitable. Decide what you think of each one and then read our comments below.
This article will talk about the damage that can be inflicted when two men stand face-to-face with the sole intention of knocking each other out with their fists. It will go on to argue that boxing, or legitimate assault, has no place in the twenty first century.
This extract certainly gets straight to the point. Although this beginning is quite formal, it is certainly not impersonal as the writer lets the reader know exactly what they think about boxing. The reader can be sure about what the answer to the question in the title will be from the first sentence.
The bell goes and the two warriors approach each other. They are quick. They are strong. They are hard. They are ready to hurt and be hurt.
A left fist launches and connects with a nose. The crowd are on their feet. Cheering. Wanting more. Wanting blood.
This is prose rather than a non-fictional argument. It uses descriptive and figurative language. It could be the opening of a short story or a novel.

Diet, drugs and health - Digestion and enzymes
Our teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. Enzymes are needed so that this break-down happens quickly enough to be useful.
Take care - enzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients:
. Carbohydrase enzymes break down starch into sugars.
The saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough, the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet.
. Protease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. Digestion of proteins in the stomach is helped by

Being able to recognise changes in mood and emotion in a script is important as you need to convey this to your audience.
Using these methods, decide how you would express the emotion of anger.
What happens to your face, body and voice when you feel angry? How do you walk when you're in a bad mood? Which gestures do you use to show someone you're angry with them?
Frown, tightly clenched jaw, a tight mouth or even bared teeth.
Tense shoulders, a swift and purposeful walk almost like a march.
Strong and forceful gestures. Perhaps even clenched fists.
Either very loud and out of control or very quiet and menacing.
Maybe if you're very angry you won't pause often, you'll talk very quickly without giving the other person a chance to talk. Or the pauses might be long - a deafening silence!
Now try this with other emotions, eg surprise, excitement, happiness, sadness. See how your body, face and voice change with each emotion.
Another way to practise emotions is to do mood walks - put all the elements together to develop a walk that represents each emotion, then greet (or growl at) people with the appropriate tone of voice.

Take a look at the final paragraph of the article about boxing.
In conclusion, both sides of the debate have solid foundations. As has been shown, the arguments for and against have been put forward since boxing began. And, it would seem, the argument will continue for at least the foreseeable future, as compromise seems unlikely. Both sides do agree, however, that the debate is better held whilst boxing is licensed and controlled rather than unlicensed and uncontrolled. The latter would make it, in my opinion, neither sport nor spectacle.
As you can see, the writer clearly signals that the end is approaching by using the connecting phrase ""In conclusion"". It maintains the impersonal approach it set out with by stating that the argument will continue and that ""compromise seems unlikely"". The last sentence is a statement of the writer's own opinion, but this doesn't alter the fact that it is, or has been, a discursive text.
So, when answering how effective the beginning or ending of a text is, here's a quick checklist you might find helpful:

Romeo and his friends have left the Capulets' party. Romeo has run away from his friends. Mercutio has been shouting rude jokes because he thinks that Romeo has gone off with Rosaline. Mercutio and Benvolio finally give up looking for him and go home.
The second set extract begins with Romeo hiding from Mercutio and Benvolio in Juliet's garden. Romeo thinks to himself that Mercutio can never understand how he feels because he has never been in love.
""He jests at scars that never felt a wound""
He watches Juliet as she stands on her balcony thinking out loud. He thinks that she is like the sun
Romeo uses lots of words and images that relate to light when he describes Juliet.: 'sun', 'stars' 'brightness'.
and that the moon is jealous of her because she is so beautiful. He says that her eyes are like two stars that are so bright that they would stop night-time from being dark if they were in heaven, and the birds would sing because they would think that night was day.
Romeo uses more words and images to do with light to describe Juliet.
He idolises her and compares her to an angel.
When Romeo says that Juliet is like an angel from heaven, on the one hand, he is saying how lovely she is. On the other hand, you could say that he doesn't really see her as a flesh and blood person. He idolises her. Do you believe that he can really love her when he doesn't actually know anything about her? Or do you believe in love at first sight?
Juliet, not realising that Romeo is hiding in her garden, imagines what she would say to Romeo if he were there. She says out loud that she wishes he wasn't a Montague, but says that it doesn't really matter because she loves him anyway, and hopes that he loves her. After all, a name is just a word; it doesn't really mean that much.
If we used another word for a rose instead of the word 'rose', eg 'poo', the rose would still be a rose, it wouldn't smell like poo just because we used that word. In the same way, Romeo is still lovely even though his name is Montague.
When Juliet is thinking these things aloud on her balcony, she doesn't know that anyone else is watching. Have you ever practiced saying something to someone, even though you know that you would never be brave enough to say it?
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet
When Romeo replies, Juliet nearly jumps out of her skin.
""My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself""
When Romeo calls her 'dear saint', Juliet realizes who he is. Romeo called her 'dear saint' at the party.
Juliet is very worried for Romeo's safety; he is a Montague on Capulet property. Romeo uses very poetic and exaggerated language to describe how he managed to climb over the walls.
Romeo has been quite brave and perhaps foolish to break into Juliet's garden. He likes to takes risks and doesn't think clearly about the seriousness of his actions. He uses poetic language to exaggerate his bravery.
He declares that he'd rather die than live never having the opportunity to love Juliet.
Juliet admits that she is embarrassed that Romeo heard the things that she was saying about him. She asks him if he loves her too, but she doesn't give him the chance to answer.
Juliet is worried that she has shown herself to be too keen on Romeo. In Shakespeare's day, nice girls weren't supposed to show that they were interested in boys.
Juliet's speech is very long! Is she nervous or embarrassed? Is she a chatterbox? Is she so excited about her new love that she can't stop talking about it?
Romeo begins to use poetic language about the moon to describe how much he loves her, but Juliet won't let him finish.
Time - Juliet won't let Romeo finish his sentences! Poor Romeo! We already know how much he loves to speak! Juliet's mind is working very quickly. She is excited, but also worried about how suddenly they have fallen in love.
She says that if he swears by the moon, he might turn out to be just as changeable as the moon (the moon changes its shape throughout the month).
She worries that they have fallen in love so quickly.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.
She tries to say goodnight, but she is excited and passionate about her feelings for Romeo and can't seem to stop talking about it.
""My bounty is as boundless as the sea.
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite""
Juliet's use of imagery seems more heartfelt than Romeo's: her love is as deep as the sea, and the sea never runs out. That's passion!
Juliet's Nurse shouts to her from inside the house. Juliet asks Romeo to wait. As she goes into her bedroom, Romeo thinks to himself that their love seems like a dream.
Love - Is this true love? How could it have happened so quickly? Do you believe in 'love at first sight'? Remember, that same evening that he met and fell in love with Juliet, Romeo was moping about saying that he would never love anyone as much as he loved Rosaline! Romeo might argue though that he didn't really know what true love was until he met Juliet.
Juliet comes back out onto the balcony and tells Romeo that if he is serious about her, she will send a messenger out to him tomorrow to find out where and what time they will get married!
Time - events happen very quickly in this play. In less than a week, Romeo and Juliet fall in love, get married and die.
She says goodnight to him as her Nurse impatiently tells her to come inside.
Romeo finds it hard to say goodnight to her.
Romeo said that he was in love with Rosaline in the first extract. Less than a day later, he claims to be in love with Juliet. Has he really thought about the consequences of marrying Juliet. Perhaps, when you are in love, nothing else matters. What do you think?

Two of Capulet's servants pick a fight in the market place with one of Montague's servants. Benvolio tries to stop the fight. Tybalt attacks Benvolio. A riot starts. Prince Escalus stops the riot and warns that if the Montagues and the Capulets are involved in any more violence the punishment will be death.

Sometimes an equation will have multiples of an unknown, eg, 5y = 20. To solve this you need to get the unknown on its own. To do this, divide both sides by 5.
5y  5 = 20  5
Sometimes an equation will have multiples of an unkown and other numbers, eg, 3x + 2 = 8
In equations of this type, your aim is to get all the 'x's (or unknowns) on one side and all the numbers on the other.
Let's solve the equation 3x + 2 = 8. We can show this in a picture like this, where each bag is an 'x'.
We want to get the 'x' on it's own. Start by subtracting 2 from both sides:

Romeo and Juliet first key extract - Characters
If you get a question about characters in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE (see page 2) to help with the middle part of your answer:
Do you think Romeo knows what love is?
Romeo is obviously a very sensitive young man. He seems to be exploring the idea of love. He may well long to be in love. Some of his ideas about love are confused and confusing.
Romeo does not join in with the street brawl and is sad that the violence takes place. He says that he understands that the violence is more to do with love and loyalty towards family than it is to do with hatred. He has been unhappy for some time and his family is worried. When Romeo talks to Benvolio, he finds it difficult to make himself clear. He is more interested in using language cleverly. When he uses oxymorons like 'heavy lightness' it is as though he isn't really sure what love is. When he talks about Rosaline, he focuses on her beauty. He says he loves her, but he is annoyed by her virtuous personality.
Romeo lives amongst people who will kill others and risk their own lives for the sake of their own family, so he knows about passion. The fact that he won't talk to his father about why he is unhappy isn't very loving. Romeo talks about love in an abstract way. He likes the idea of love, and he might have been influenced by what poets have said about love. It could be argued that if Romeo really loved Rosaline, then he would respect her wishes to remain a virgin. Towards the end of the extract, Romeo seems more interested in sex than true love.

Are you tired of the daily grind? Sick of working all hours of the day for little reward? Tired of never having enough money to really enjoy yourself?
Here's how to spot this type of text:
It tries to convince you to do or agree with something.
It contains a mix of fact and opinion.
It may use repetition, ""soundbites"" and persuasive or emotive language.

Argument texts should be balanced and fair, and give all sides of an argument before coming to a conclusion.
Here's an extract from an argument text:
Foxhunting is a subject that provokes very strong feelings. Many people believe that it is cruel to hunt a fox with dogs, and totally agree with its ban.
Many farmers, and even conservationists, however, have always argued that the fox is a pest, which attacks livestock and must be controlled.

The whole point is to make it easier to see what is connected to what. Here you can see how the symbols for a cell (not a battery!) and a lamp look in a circuit diagram.
If you have to draw a circuit diagram from scratch, it is usually easier to draw the circuit symbols first, and then add all the wires. If you have to draw wires to join circuit symbols that are already shown, use a ruler and don't let the wires cross each other.

a shadow came sweeping up after me
into the darkness overhead. I came along the landing and stopped there for a moment, listening to a rustling sound that I fancied I heard; then, satisfied of the absolute silence, I pushed open the baize-covered door and stood in the corridor.
What sort of atmosphere is Wells trying to create and how does he use figurative language to do this?
The writer is trying to create an atmosphere of fear and tension in the extract. He describes the passage as being ""draughty"" and mentions that it is underground. This makes it seem creepy and ghostly. The fact that the character only has a candle to light his way makes the story seem old-fashioned, and also creates drama because we know that the draught could blow it out! The way the echoes ""rang up and down"" and the fact that the man stops because he thinks he hears a sound, adds to the ghostly effects.
The shadows also help to create a sinister atmosphere as they flicker around and make it even harder for the man to see what's ahead. The writer uses figurative language such as personification to describe them. He says that they ""cower and quiver"", come ""sweeping up"" and that they ""fled"". All of this makes them sound alive, or perhaps like ghosts. The words used are all linked with fear, so that even the shadows seem to be afraid of what's in the corridor. This is very eerie and helps to create a very tense atmosphere.

The population of each organism in a food chain can be shown in a sort of bar chart called a pyramid of numbers. The more organisms there are, the wider the bar. The producer in the food chain always goes at the bottom of the pyramid of numbers.
Clover is a plant and it is the producer in this food chain. Its bar goes at the bottom of the pyramid:
Energy is lost to the surroundings as we go from one level to the next, so there are fewer organisms at each level in this food chain. A lot of clover is needed to support the snail population. A thrush eats lots of snails, and a hawk eats lots of thrushes, so the population of hawks is very small.
Sometimes the pyramid of numbers doesn't look like a pyramid at all. This could happen if the producer is a large plant such as a tree, or if one of the animals is very small. Remember, though, that whatever the situation, the producer still goes at the bottom of the pyramid.
An oak tree is very large so many insects can feed on it

Decimals - Multiplying a decimal by a whole number
Multiplying a decimal by a whole number is the same as multiplying two whole numbers. Remember:
If there is one digit after the decimal point in the question, there will be one digit after the decimal point in the answer.
If there are two digits after the decimal point in the question, there will be two digits after the decimal point in the answer.
a) There were two digits after the decimal point in the question (4 and 3), so you must have two digits after the decimal point in the answer.
b) There was one digit after the decimal point in the question, so you must have one digit after the decimal point in the answer. The answer is therefore 12.0, but this can then be given as 12.
Check that you have a sensible answer by finding an approximate solution.
In the above example you were asked to calculate 2.4  5.
2  5 = 10, so you are looking for an answer which is slightly bigger than 10. So an answer of 12 seems sensible.

One way to solve them is using the

You can check your answer in the other equation (in this case,
This is right, so the values are correct.
The solution of the equations is therefore
Use the substitution method to solve the following simultaneous equations:
Substitute the value of y from equation (1) into equation (2)

To find y use this x value in equation (1): y = x + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5
Check in equation (2): (2  3) + 5 = 11 (which is correct)

We can show photosynthesis in a word equation, where light energy is shown in brackets because it is not a substance:

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - Issues and ideas
The two extracts deal with some deep issues. You will need to discuss how these are brought out. Some of the 'big' themes are:
If the question asks you to comment on how the theme of time is explored, consider these points:
Montague and Benvolio discuss the ""ancient quarrel"" and how it escalated so swiftly because of the quick tempers of servants from each opposing family along with Tybalt's ""fiery"" reaction.
Time passes slowly for Romeo whilst he is in a bad mood. He hides himself away during the daytime.
Romeo is impatient to have a physical relationship and does not want to wait for Rosaline.
Romeo gets over Rosaline quickly and falls for Juliet suddenly. Juliet falls in love just as quickly with Romeo.
Having spent one evening together they are planning their wedding for the next day.
Can love happen so quickly? Maybe Romeo and Juliet have not considered the consequences of their relationship so it was bound to go wrong from the start. Or maybe this a classic example of love at first sight: sudden, powerful, and beyond the control.

447,"The extract comes from a book called 'Face' by Benjamin Zephaniah. Natalie is a Year 9 student and lives in East London. She is out with her boyfriend and his friends. They have stopped to chat with some boys from school. Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. You can use the bullet points to help you.
After a couple of minutes she realised that her every move was being watched by a group of three girls and she couldn't help noticing how tough they looked. All three were wearing dark blue baggy jeans. She was pretty sure they were Londoners born and bred but thought they could find a job working for the Jamaican tourist board, not simply because of their dark skin but also because of their clothing. One had a T-shirt saying 'I love Jamaica'. Another wore a T-shirt that was a Jamaican flag and the third just had a West Ham football shirt on, but she, like the others, was adorned with yellow, black and green bangles, badges and necklaces. Natalie thought they looked good, but dangerous.
Natalie shifted nervously. She didn't know quite where to look but she had to put on a front. The other three girls made no attempt to hide the fact that they were on Natalie's case. They began to whisper to each other and smile as they stared at her. Natalie felt illuminated in her green satins and began to wish she had chosen clothes which weren't so loud. What are they grinning at? she wondered. Is it my clothes? My shoes? My hair? Do I look too innocent? Suddenly the three girls began to walk toward Natalie. Her heart began to race, the palms of her hands began to sweat. She felt like falling apart but she held herself together.
'You from round here, den?' said the big girl wearing the Jamaican flag.
'Yeah, I wanid to go there but they wouldn't let me, said I had ta go ta Lonsdale Park, said it was nearer. What ya doing here?'
The other two girls continued to look her up and down. Natalie expected trouble and in her mind she cursed the boys for bringing her there and for the way they had got lost in their silly conversation about football and cars.
'I'm just hanging around with my boyfriend and his mates.'
At this point the girl wearing the West Ham shirt reached into her back pocket. Natalie swallowed hard as the girl pulled out a couple of leaflets. After separating one from the other she handed one to Natalie. 'Dat's the place to be, check it out, good vibes, good music. Ya like rap?'
Natalie wanted to kick herself. She had completely misread the situation. They weren't out for a fight, they wanted to find out if she liked clubbing. They wanted to find out if she was one of them, an Eastender.
'Yeah,' Natalie replied, feeling a sense of relief. 'Yeah, rap's cool...' She began to wonder if she sometimes looked threatening and if she herself had been misjudged in the past. For people to be friendly, did they have to have permanent smiles on their faces?
How does the writer show Natalie's thoughts and feelings changing during the extract?
her first reactions to the girls she sees
the way she acts just before, and when, they speak to her
her thoughts at the end of the passage.
Just before the girls speak to her, Natalie seems even more anxious. She is used to being out on the streets of London and feels she needs to 'put on a front' and look tough. She is afraid they may be laughing at her clothes or hair, which makes her seem insecure about herself. However, when the girls come up to speak to her she hides her nerves and answers their questions. The way she uses short answers like 'Yeah' suggests she does not want to give too much away about herself or get into a fight.
When she realises the girls are actually being friendly and want to give her a flyer for a club, Natalie's feelings change completely. She is ashamed of being suspicious and feels like 'kicking herself'. She realises the girls are Eastenders just like her. The writer shows how this makes her think about her own image. She wonders if people think she looks threatening, too. At this point she comes across as an intelligent, thoughtful girl who wants to learn how to judge people fairly in the future.

When you explain, you don't just write information - you also need to give
. In very basic terms you can think of the difference between informing and explaining in terms of answering a slightly different set of questions:
Explain = What? When? Who? Where? How? Why?
This difference is reflected in the question you will be asked, so our question about the leaflet might look a little different now:
Write a leaflet for both the pupils and their parents, outlining some of the main features of school life in Year 7 and beyond. In particular, explain why pupils have several teachers each day and why the detention system is used.
This is a little harder than the earlier version, but it's still about your school. Therefore, you still need lots of information about the classes, the organisation and the timetable. So you could still use our two basic approaches, timelines and topic centres, like this:
However, you can also put these together, like this:
Now, we can see a number of topics, so perhaps the three big circles represent registration, lesson times and detentions. They occur in that order each day, but the reasons for them are very different. So the smaller circles answer how and why as well as what, when and who. For instance, what are detentions? When do they take place? Who is in charge of them? How do pupils get put in detention? Why does the school use detentions?
This approach gives your answer a very clear structure. The writing deals with a number of subjects in turn and each subject should be in its own paragraph. You can add details and explanations as you write out each paragraph. It makes it easier for you to write and easier for your audience to read or listen to.

Writing is informal when it reads as though someone is chatting to the reader. In the right situation, it makes your writing seem more friendly and natural.
Which of the following would you NOT write using informal language?
b) An essay about a Shakespeare play
c) A talk aimed at students your own age or younger
e) A story written from the point of view of a character (in the first person)
b) An essay should always be written using formal language. All of the other situations would suit a more informal style.

2. It's okay sometimes to use the kind of words that are more usual in speech than writing:
""You don't have to put up with bullying. We'll stick together and make it stop.""
3. Contractions sound more natural in certain types of writing eg a talk to fellow students:
""It's good to know that we're all going to work together on this.""
Don't baffle your reader with too much slang.
Think carefully about structure - informal writing is different to speech and needs carefully planned paragraphs to keep it clear and easy to read.
Sometimes there is opportunity to break the rules of Standard English and use English in unexpected ways. Two good examples of writers who achieve this are poet Benjamin Zephaniah and writer Andrea Levy in her book Small Island.

So, the smallest possible number of children in the school is 750, and the largest possible number of children is 849.
Note: 850 is exactly halfway between 800 and 900, but 850 rounds up to give 900, so we use 849.

The largest number that rounds to 80 is 84.99.

The idea of presenting a speech might make you nervous but some people make speeches every day as part of their jobs. Think about your teachers - they regularly stand up before you and present to the class.
You might notice that some teachers are more interesting to listen to than others. It is not necessarily what they say that keeps you interested, but often how they say it. What do your teachers do to keep your attention? Make a list then compare it with the tips below.
Your listeners will switch off if they can't hear you. Use a loud and clear voice, and if you're unsure if your audience can hear you at the back - just ask ""Can you hear me at the back?""
If you speak too quickly, you won't be clear. If you speak too slowly, your audience is likely to go to sleep. Vary your pace for effect and use dramatic pauses where appropriate.
If you speak like a robot, in the same boring tone, your audience will quickly drift off. Speak naturally and use the pitch of your voice to show your emotions.
You don't have to gurn at your audience! But if you don't look like you're interested in what you have to say, your audience won't be either.
Again, keep it natural, but if you stand like a statue, you won't be very interesting to watch or listen to. On the other hand, too much arm flapping and leg hopping will distract your audience from the point you're trying to make.
Use them, but use them effectively. They need to be big enough to see, interesting to look at and relevant to what you are talking about. Don't be tempted to make a big poster to hide behind!
Choose words that are interesting, descriptive and appropriate to your audience. Don't baffle your audience with jargon or slang or lots of big words that are too difficult for anyone else to understand.
If it's appropriate to your audience and task, try to use Standard English. You don't have to be too formal or put on a silly accent, just speak in a way that is easy for everyone to understand.
Most people feel nervous about speaking formally in front of other people. Here are some tips to help you conquer your nerves:
Write your speech out in full and read it several times - this will help you gain confidence in the content.
Prepare small cards with key points of your speech. By now you should be familiar with your speech so these points will help you keep to your structure. Avoid the temptation to read your speech in full - the idea is to test your speaking skills, not your reading skills!
Practice your performance before the real thing. Try practicing at home on your own, and then in front of family or friends. If you have visual aids, be sure to practice using them.
On the day, take a deep breath, smile and try to enjoy it.
Improve your public speaking and maybe you'll be TV Presenter one day. But it's not all bad!

1. This is an extract from the Anthony Shea Community School newsletter:
During the past three years, mobile phones have become more and more popular. Growing numbers of our students bring them to school, and parents encourage this as they can stay in touch with their children and know they are safe. However, many of our students keep their phone on during the day which can disturb lessons. A number of phone thefts have also occurred recently, both in and out of school. I would like to call a meeting to discuss this issue with staff, parents and students. I don't want to ban them, but we must agree on how they can be used sensibly and safely.
Write a speech to be given at this meeting analysing the advantages and disadvantages of allowing mobiles in school and suggest how they can be used sensibly and safely.
2. Read this extract, which considers the issue of horror movies:
As a parent, I have constant battles over TV and films. My children feel they should be allowed to watch whatever they want, no matter how violent, gory or creepy. They say it's just entertainment, and that it has no effect on them. I don't agree! Many of the films are rated 18, and my oldest is 14. I'm afraid my kids will become more aggressive and uncaring towards people, or that they might end up seeing something which really disturbs them.

Remember, you get marks for noticing the intended effect on the reader. Even if something doesn't interest, horrify, amuse or persuade you, you need to spot what the writer meant to do. It's usually better not to mention your personal opinion unless you are asked to.

When you write about performance, mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:
haracters and how you respond to them
anguage used - the detail about love, for example
ssues and ideas - like time, love and hate
Once you understand how the audience should feel, you can decide how you might direct a particular scene. Remember, there are lots of different ways to perform the same scene. A good answer depends on how well you explain yourself.
Here is an example of an answer to a question about performance. Think about how you might answer the same question.
How should an actor playing Benvolio behave?
Benvolio's replies to Romeo could either show that he is a good listener who wants to understand his friend's problems, or that he is amused by what Romeo has to say because he knows that his friend is not serious about this girl.
When Benvolio speaks to Montague, the mood is serious. When Romeo arrives, he has to ask lots of questions because Romeo is evasive. Some of Benvolio's comments could be said in a sarcastic or sympathetic way. The jokes that the two characters share show that they are good friends. Benvolio gives advice at the end of the scene that shows that he doesn't believe Romeo's love for Rosaline is serious.
The way Benvolio behaves towards Romeo shapes the way the audience perceives Romeo. This is important because Romeo is the main character. The audience has to like him and worry about him for the tragedy to work. If the actor playing Benvolio speaks his lines in a patient and sympathetic way, it makes Romeo seem like a young man who finds the world confusing. If Benvolio's lines are spoken humorously, the comedy in Romeo's speeches will be brought to life.

This is one version of the speech. You will find comments beneath each paragraph, explaining what the writer has done well.
I'm sure you've all heard the saying ""we are what we eat"". Have you been into the school canteen recently? The selection is similar to that in many schools: a main meal which is usually meat-based, a variety of burgers and pizzas, a dessert and, for the health-conscious, jacket potatoes with one or two cold fillings. The question we are here to consider today is whether this is a reasonable selection, or whether changes could be made in Grange High School's canteen.
The speech begins dealing with the problem straight away. It starts with a short, familiar phrase and a rhetorical question, to involve the audience and make them listen to the speech. The current selection of food is outlined to set the scene, followed by the main question to be tackled. The opening is very friendly and easy to follow. This is a great start.
A survey conducted recently by Year 9 students suggested that many students are happy with the food on offer. They stated that the burgers and pizzas were their favourite food and that they were ""tasty, filling, cheap and quick"". These choices, sometimes called ""junk food"", are the best sellers and the canteen staff say the profit from these makes it possible to offer some of the less popular options.
The writer now looks at the evidence for keeping junk food. They've imagined a survey and comments from the canteen staff - this is fine as it's relevant and makes sense.
Some students admit that the junk food in the canteen is the only reason they stay in school at lunchtimes. Although we are not allowed off site during school times, it is well known that some students do sneak out to local chip shops and other takeaways. A substantial number of students who took part in the canteen's survey said they would be more likely to do this if the canteen offered more healthy food.
The final argument for junk food is explained. The writer introduces a rather controversial point, but softens it with the phrase 'it is well known...' so that no one is blamed. Again this keeps things formal and balanced.
So far, the writing looks really good, but it seems like the conclusion will be in favour of junk food. Is there any way of balancing the argument? Go to the next page to see how this is done.

Here are some examples of inherited variation in humans:
Gender is inherited variation too, because whether you are male or female is a result of the genes you inherited from your parents.
Characteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle. For example, if you eat too much you will become heavier, and if you eat too little you will become lighter. A plant in the shade of a big tree will will grow taller as it tries to reach more light.
Variation caused by the surroundings is called

Some features vary because of a mixture of inherited causes and environmental causes. For example, identical twins inherit exactly the same features from their parents. But if you take a pair of twins, and twin 'A' is given more to eat than twin 'B', twin 'A' is likely to end up heavier.

Rubbish does not vanish when it is thrown away. A lot of it is buried in
sites. These may be disused quarries or rough ground that cannot be used for farming or housing. When landfill sites are full of rubbish, they are covered in soil and planted with trees and bushes.
rubbish is important because fewer landfill sites are needed, and the materials in the rubbish are re-used.
Fertilisers are chemicals used by farmers to help their crops grow well. Rain can wash fertilizers off the fields and into rivers. This causes water plants to overgrow and block out the light. Other plants die as a result. They use up oxygen as they rot away, and fish and other animals suffocate. This process is called eutrophication.
Smoke from burning fuels makes buildings turn black. With other waste chemicals in the air, it can form smog. This makes the air hazy, especially over large towns and cities. The polluted air can make it difficult to breathe.
are produced when fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas burn. Sulfur dioxide dissolves in the clouds and causes acid rain. This damages buildings, trees and harms life in rivers and lakes. It also causes chemical weathering of rocks to happen much faster than normal.

31,"> Inequalities and Simultaneous Equations - Algebra
You can solve simultaneous equations by adding or subtracting the two equations from each other.
Add the two equations together and you will find that the y disappears:
3x + 2x + y - y = 9 + 1
6 - 5 = 1 (which is correct)
To make the 3x's disappear we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
3x - 3x + 2y - (-y) = 8 - 5
6 - 1 = 5 (which is correct)
So the solution is x = 2, y = 1

The other problem some writers have is ending the story. It doesn't matter if it's a happy ending or not, but it has to make sense. There are lots of ways of ending, such as:
, where we have to wait until the final moment until we know. For instance, the spy who manages to stop the bomb two seconds before it explodes.
, where we are fairly sure about something, but in the final part everything changes. For example, we then learn that this is a fake bomb, and the real one is hidden somewhere else and will explode in five minutes.
, where the story stops, but we aren't sure what has actually happened at the end. For instance, the bomb is defused and everyone is safe. But then an army commander reports the theft of another bomb... only this time twice as powerful.
However, there are two endings to avoid:
, where a bomb will inevitably explode and as it does, the narrator wakes up - it was all a dream. Some English teachers don't mind this sort of thing, but others hate it. You have been warned.
, where the secret agent suddenly stops worrying about the bomb, retires, and goes off to play golf. This is even worse, and no-one likes it because the ending has nothing to do with the story.
Whatever kind of story you write, decide on your ending and include it in your plan.

Decimals - Place value and ordering decimals
We use a decimal point to separate units from parts of a whole (like tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc).
0.1 is a tenth, 1/10 of a unit
0.01 is a hundredth, 1/100 of a unit
0.001 is a thousandth. 1/1000 of a unit
In 52.13, the value of the figure 1 is 1/10 , and the value of the figure 3 is 3/100.
When ordering numbers, always compare the left digits first.
Eg Which is greater, 2.301 or 2.32?
Both numbers have two units and three tenths, but 2.301 has no hundredths, whereas 2.32 has two hundredths. Therefore, 2.32 is greater than 2.301.
Another way to look at it is to add a zero to the end of 2.32 (this doesn't change its value as it's after the decimal point).
The two numbers are now 2.320 and 2.301 and it is quite easy to see that 2.320 is bigger (just as 2 320 is bigger than 2 301).
Q1. In the number 3.546, what is the value of the figure 4?

A1. The value of the figure 4 is 4/100.
A2. Did you get 3.02, 3.19, 3.197, 3.2?
All the numbers have three units, so start by comparing the tenths. 3.02 has no tenths, 3.197 and 3.19 have one tenth, and 3.2 has two tenths. Therefore, 3.02 is the smallest and 3.2 is the largest.
You could also write the numbers as 3.020, 3.190, 3.197 and 3.200 and compare them.

The Tempest first key extract - Performance
When you talk about the performance of a play, you should think about how people in the audience feel as they watch it. For instance, the beginning of the first extract is magical and romantic. The tone changes in the middle to one of conflict.
Prospero has lots of asides (thoughts spoken aloud) in the first extract. His role in this scene is made more complex because his character is pretending to be something he is not. The director has to decide whether he wants us to see Prospero as a good father who wants the best for his daughter or a manipulative control freak.
Prospero also speaks to Ariel who is invisible to the other characters on the stage.
When Ariel appears, the director must decide how to present the 'illusion'. Ariel is invisible to the other characters. But it does not necessarily follow that he must be invisible to the audience, too. Try to imagine as many interesting and unusual ways to present Ariel - the 'invisible' sprite - as you can.
When you write about performance, you need to mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:
The characters and how you respond to them
The language used - the detail about freedom and slavery, for example
The issues and ideas - like love, magic and power
The performance instructions, such as stage directions

(Other spirit voices in the air) Bow-wow!
Where should this music be? I'the air or the earth?
It sounds no more; and, sure, it waits upon
Some god o'the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the King my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air. Thence I have followed it 
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
(Song) Full fathom five thy father lies 
Those are pearls that were his eyes.
(Chorus of spirit voices) Ding dong 
(ARIEL and spirit voices) Ding dong bell.
The ditty does remember my drowned father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.
(To MIRANDA) The fringd curtains of thine eye advance,
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
No, wench: it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wreck  and, but hes something stained
With grief (thats beautys canker), thou mightst call him
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,
As my soul prompts it. (To ARIEL) Spirit, fine spirit! Ill free thee
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island 
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here. My prime request,
Which I do last pronounce, is  O, you wonder! 
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me 
And that he does I weep. Myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes, neer since at ebb, beheld
And his more braver daughter could control thee,
If now twere fit to dot. At the first sight
Ill set thee free for this. (To FERDINAND) A word, good sir.
I fear you have done yourself some wrong. A word.
Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Is the third man that eer I saw  the first
That eer I sighed for. Pity move my father
(Aside) They are both in eithers powers. But this swift business
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light. (To FERDINAND) One word more: I charge thee
That thou attend me. Thou dost here usurp
The name thou owst not  and hast put thyself
Upon this island as a spy, to win it
Theres nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
Good things will strive to dwell witht.
(To MIRANDA) Speak not you for him; hes a traitor. (To FERDINAND) Come!
Ill manacle thy neck and feet together.
Sea-water shalt thou drink: thy food shall be
The fresh-brook mussels, withered roots, and husks
He draws his sword but is prevented from moving by
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
My foot my tutor? (To FERDINAND) Put thy sword up, traitor 
Who makst a show, but darst not strike, thy conscience
Is so possessed with guilt. Come from thy ward 
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
Thou thinkst there is no more such shapes as he,
Having seen but him and Caliban. Foolish wench!
To the most of men this is a Caliban,
Are then most humble. I have no ambition
Thy nerves are in their infancy again,
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
My fathers loss, the weakness which I feel,
The wreck of all my friends, nor this mans threats,
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
Might I but through my prison once a day
Behold this maid. All corners else othe earth
Let liberty make use of: space enough
(Aside) It works. (To FERDINAND) Come on.
(To ARIEL) Thou hast done well, fine Ariel! (To FERDINAND) Follow me.
(To ARIEL, whispering more instructions) Hark what thou else shalt do me.
My fathers of a better nature, sir,
Than he appears by speech. This is unwonted

As mountain winds. But then exactly do

Analyse, review and comment - Writing to analyse
The second half of the writing focuses on the points in favour of the healthier options. Again, if you want any further information, click the check ideas button to see our comments.
However, this evidence does not show the whole picture. Many students say they would prefer to see more choice in the canteen. They point out that eating jacket potatoes every day is boring, and that the cold fillings are inadequate in winter. It has been suggested that more sandwiches, salads and a bigger range of hot main meals would be much more appealing. Many of these students currently bring their own food to school simply because they feel there is so little choice. These numbers include Grange High's many vegetarians.
Now the writer moves on to the views in favour of healthy food. The impersonal tone is maintained in the first sentence. The formal connective 'However' is used to signal a change in the argument. The writer returns to the facts - jacket potatoes are the only healthy option - and suggests some alternatives. She builds on the evidence mentioned earlier. She is building up towards her conclusion now.
Nevertheless, it remains true that junk food is popular and easy to produce. If students start going off site they may get injured or into trouble, and the school could be held responsible. Therefore, it seems impractical to ban junk food altogether. But is there another answer? I believe there is: the canteen could offer a wider selection, including healthier options, for one term, and see whether it is successful. If it is, and we see more students using the canteen and eating the healthy options, the canteen could make this change permanent.
This detailed paragraph begins to suggest the solution. Formal connectives are used ('nevertheless' and 'therefore') to signal that the argument is coming to an end. She returns to a personal expression, 'I believe there is...' because she is summing up her findings.
In conclusion, the solution seems clear: if a good selection of food is provided then everyone will be happy - and the canteen will almost certainly gain more customers. Thank you for your time.
The final paragraph is short and direct. It sums up the main conclusion of the speech in a positive way: 'everyone will be happy' and 'the canteen will almost certainly gain...' which leaves the audience with a clear picture of her final point of view. Rather than trying to persuade people one way or the other, the speech has tried to suggest a solution where everyone gains. This isn't always possible, but it can be a helpful way of concluding without sitting on the fence and telling the audience to make up their own minds. As you can probably guess, this is an excellent answer.

Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.
For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.
By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.
You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:
Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:
In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:
To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:
Divide both sides by 2, to give:
a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7
b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7
When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers.
For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7.
7 + 5 does equal 12, so your answer is correct.

Ariel brings Ferdinand (the King's son) to Prospero's cave. Ferdinand thinks he's the only survivor from the shipwreck. Miranda, who has seen no other man but her father during her time on the island, sees Ferdinand and thinks he must be a spirit - while Ferdinand thinks Miranda is a goddess. The two young people fall in love, but Prospero is not pleased, and makes Ferdinand his prisoner.
On another part of the island we discover one of the groups of shipwreck survivors. They begin to wake up. They're surprised that their clothes seem fresh and new.
Ariel's magical song puts them to sleep again - all except Sebastian (the King's brother) and Antonio (Prospero's brother). Antonio convinces Sebastian that they should kill the King (Alonso) so that Sebastian can take his place. Fortunately everyone else wakes up again, before they can carry out their plan.
Elsewhere on the island, Trinculo, a jester who was on board the ship, comes across Caliban. Trinculo's drunken friend Stephano turns up, and gives Caliban strong alcohol. This makes Caliban believe that Stephano is more powerful than Prospero (who Caliban hates).
Meanwhile, Ariel, who has made himself invisible, watches the three drunken clowns. He causes havoc by whispering the accusation ""thou liest"" in Caliban's ear, then Stephano's. They become confused and fight.
Caliban reveals his plans to destroy Prospero and take over the island. Stephano drunkenly agrees. Caliban is delighted that Stephano has agreed to his plan and they sing to celebrate. Ariel plays a tune to accompany their singing which frightens both Trinculo and Stephano.
Caliban tells them not to be afraid in a moving speech that describes the beauty and magic of the island. Stephano, Trinculo and Caliban follow the sound of the music.

Each substance is easily separated from the mixture.
It can only be separated into its elements using chemical reactions.
Water, carbon dioxide, magnesium oxide, sodium chloride.
An example - iron, sulfur and iron sulfide
Remember that iron and sulfur react together when they are heated to make a compound called iron sulfide. What are the differences between a mixture of iron and sulfur, and iron sulfide? Here are some of them:
The mixture can contain more or less iron, but iron sulfide always contains equal amounts of iron and sulfur.
The iron and sulfur atoms are not joined together in the mixture, but they are joined together in iron sulfide.
The iron and sulfur still behave like iron and sulfur in the mixture, but iron sulfide has different properties from both iron and sulfur.
You can separate the iron from the mixture using a magnet but this does not work for iron sulfide.

Behaviour of matter - Pressure in gases
If you ride your bike over a bump in the road, you will be pleased that gases exert
on the walls of their container. A pumped-up tyre cushions the rider against bumps, but a flat tyre does not. The pressure of the air inside a flat tyre is just too low to do this.
The particles in a gas move quickly in all directions, but they don't get far before they bump into each other or the walls of their container. When gas particles hit the walls of their container they cause pressure. The more particles that hit the walls, the higher the pressure.
This is why the pressure in a tyre or balloon goes up when more air is pumped in.
Gas particles hit the walls of their container and cause pressure
. They hit the walls of their container harder and more often. This increases the pressure. Sometimes the pressure gets so great that the container bursts.
This is why balloons and tyyres burst if you blow them up too much. It's also why deodorant spray cans carry warning signs to tell you not to leave them in the sunshine. If they get too hot they explode.

For example, pedigree dogs come in lots of different varieties, called breeds of dog. They may be different colours and sizes, but they are all still dogs. They are all still the same species. Different varieties of dog have been produced by selective breeding.
Suppose you wanted a variety of cow that produced a lot of milk. This is what you could do:
choose or select the cows in your herd that produce the most milk
select the offspring that produce the most milk
keep repeating the process of selection and breeding until you achieve your goal.
The key here is to identify the feature you want, and only breed from the individuals that have that feature. Here are some examples of what selective breeding can produce:
hens that lay big eggs of a particular colour
tomato plants that produce lots of tomatoes

Writers like to draw you into their text and get you involved. It's up to you to make your mind up about a character, just as it is when you meet someone in real life.
The clues you need to make up your mind about a character are all in the text. Look for the following:
Take another look at one of the extracts from 'Holes'. Stanley has just arrived at the prison camp. What can you tell about the character of Mr Sir, the man in the cowboy hat, from reading between the lines? Some important phrases have been put in bold to give you a few clues.
A man was sitting with his feet up on a desk.
He turned his head when Stanley and the guard entered, but otherwise didn't move. Even though he was inside,
he wore sunglasses and a cowboy hat
. He also held a can of cream soda, and the sight of it made Stanley even more aware of his own thirst.
He waited while the bus guard gave the man some papers to sign.
""That's a lot of sunflower seeds,"" the bus guard said.
Stanley noticed a burlap sack filled with sunflower seeds on the floor next to the desk.
,"" said the man in the cowboy hat. He had
a tattoo of a rattlesnake on his arm
, and as he signed his name, the snake's rattle seemed to wiggle. ""I used to smoke a pack a day. Now I eat a sack of these every week.""
On the surface, this extract doesn't tell us much about Mr Sir, but you've probably begun to
about him. If we read between the lines, we can tell that he likes to make an impression and wants to be seen to be in charge. He is sitting ""with his feet up on a desk"" and has made his appearance even more striking by wearing sunglasses and a cowboy hat indoors.
Sometimes people who act like this can like power a bit too much, and can be bullies. Could Mr Sir be a bully?
When we consider the can of cream soda, we can say that the fact that Mr Sir fails to offer either Stanley or the bus driver anything to drink after their nine-hour, cross-desert journey suggests that he is a
man. That he keeps his own drink in full view of Stanley and the bus driver further suggests that he is cruel and likes to see other people's discomfort.
We learn that Mr Sir stopped smoking recently. We could then expect him to be bad- and short-tempered. The tattoo of a rattlesnake, a dangerous reptile that is supposed to have a bad temper, adds to this impression. The sunflower seeds are, we are led to believe, there to help him as an alternative to cigarettes, but we don't get the feeling of optimism that they'll be successful.
So there we have it; Mr Sir is a bad-tempered, selfish bully!

Ducklings will follow the first moving object they meet after hatching. They become socially attached to this object and treat it as their mother.
Imprinting lets young animals recognise their mother from a young age. They can follow her for food and protection.
Imprinting is useful if the first moving object they see really is their mother. But ducklings will imprint on people, balls and even cardboard boxes if these happen to be the first things they see.
Geese, chicks, and other baby birds that can walk around shortly after hatching, also show imprinting behaviour. Konrad Lorenz (1903 to 1989) was an Austrian scientist who studied animal behaviour.
He discovered that if he reared geese from when they hatched, they became imprinted on him. They followed him around and preferred to be near him even when they had grown into adult geese. Lorenz won the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine because of his experiments on animal behaviour.

Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew. Were you by when it began?
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
I drew to part them. In the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
O where is Romeo? Saw you him today?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun
Peered forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad 
That westward rooteth from this city side,
So early walking did I see your son.
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood.
I, measuring his affections by my own,
Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Being one too many by my weary self,
And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
I neither know it, nor can learn of him.
Have you importuned him by any means?
Both by myself and many other friends:
Is to himself  I will not say how true 
But to himself so secret and so close,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.
See where he comes. So please you, step aside.
Ill know his grievance or be much denied.
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, lets away.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeos hours?
Not having that which, having, makes them short.
Out of her favour where I am in love.
Alas, that Love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Alas, that Love, whose view is muffled still,
Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Heres much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,

Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers eyes;
Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.

A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.

A right good mark-man! And shes fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Well, in that hit you miss. Shell not be hit
With Cupids arrow. She hath Dians wit,
And in strong proof of chastity well-armed,
From Loves weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide th encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
O, she is rich in beauty  only poor
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
Be ruled by me: forget to think of her.
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
To call hers  exquisite  in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing fair:
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who passed that passing fair?
Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.

""The eyes were the worst. It was not my imagination. They were in truth like the eyes of a dead man, not blind, but staring, unfocused, unseeing. The whole face, for that matter, was bad enough. It was vacant, as if there was nothing behind it. It seemed not only expressionless, but incapable of expression. I had seen so much previously in Haiti that was outside the ordinary normal experience that for the flash of a second I had a sickening, almost panicky lapse in which I thought, or rather felt, ""Great God, maybe this stuff really is true..."".
This is how William Seabrook described his encounter with one of the most horrifying creatures ever to step from the realms of the supernatural. For Seabrook was face-to-face with a zombie - a walking corpse. And in that moment he was prepared to believe all that he had heard about zombies since he first arrived on the island of Haiti.
The zombie's fate is even worse than that of a vampire or werewolf. The vampire returns to his loved ones. He may be recognised and laid to rest. The werewolf may be wounded and regain human form. But the zombie is a mindless automaton (robot), doomed to live out a twilight existence of brutish toil (animal-like labour). A zombie can eat, move, hear, even speak, but he has no memory of his past or knowledge of his present condition. He may pass by his own home or gaze into the eyes of his loved ones without a glimmer of recognition.
Neither ghost nor person, the zombie is said to be trapped, possibly forever, in that ""misty zone that divides life from death"". For while the vampire is the living dead, the zombie is merely the walking dead - a body without soul or mind raised from the grave and given a semblance (appearance) of life through sorcery. He is the creature of the sorcerer, who uses him as a slave or hires him out - usually to walk on the land.
From 'The Book of Great Mysteries' edited by Colin Wilson and Christopher Evans.

A6. The writer uses the phrase 'one of the most horrifying creatures ever to step from the realms of the supernatural'. You might also have picked out the phrase 'walking corpse'.
A7. Zombies are compared to vampires and werewolves.

271,"> Preparing, planning and checking - Punctuation
The most important thing with punctuation is to make sure your sentences are correctly marked at the start and end:
The starts are easy; they should all have capital letters.
The endings have full stops (or the equivalent, such as question marks). However, endings cannot have commas. Commas are only used inside sentences, never right at the end of one.
One quick way to check is to read your work to yourself (it doesn't have to be aloud). If you 'run out of breath' or need to pause in your reading to add emphasis, ask yourself whether a comma or a full stop is needed. If so, put one in.
Other areas which often cause problems are:
If you have included the actual words that somebody speaks, make sure you put them inside speech marks. Remember to close the speech marks as well as open them!
Always use question marks when writing a question whether it is direct or rhetorical. Look out for rhetorical questions in persuasive texts eg ""How long will it be until all our countryside is destroyed?"". Writers use rhetorical questions to emphasise a point and they do not expect the reader to genuinely answer the question.
Be careful when using exclamation marks as overusing them can spoil a text. They should be used only to show excitement, surprise, shock or humour eg ""Stop the car!"" she yelled.
To show when a letter has been missed out:

Magnets and electric current - Bar magnets
Before we look at electromagnets let's recap
magnets. This means that their magnetism is there all the time and cannot be turned on or off. They have two poles:
The north pole is normally shown as
Magnets are made from magnetic materials. These are metals that can be magnetised or will be attracted to a magnet. Most materials are not magnetic, but
is mostly iron, so steel is magnetic too.
If you bring two bar magnets together, there are two things that can happen:
if you bring a north pole and a south pole together, they
if you bring two north poles together, or two south poles together, they
and the magnets push each other away.
We say that unlike poles attract, and like poles repel.
How can you test if a piece of metal is a magnet. Seeing if it sticks to a magnet is not a good test, because unmagnetised iron, steel, cobalt and nickel objects will be attracted to either pole of a magnet.
So you can't test for what it is attracted to. But you can test what it repels:
You can only show that an object is a magnet if it repels a known magnet.

Tobacco smoke contains many harmful substances. These include:
A normal lung and a lung from a smoker:

Cells in the lining of the breathing tubes produce sticky mucus to trap dirt and microbes. Cells with tiny hair-like parts, called

Hot smoke and tar from smoking damages the cilia. So smokers cough to move the mucus and are more likely to get

Carbon monoxide is a gas that takes the place of oxygen in red blood cells. This reduces the amount of oxygen that the blood can carry. This means that the circulatory system has to work harder, causing heart disease.

The Tempest second key extract - Characters
If you get a question about characters in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with the answer.
Question: What do we learn about Miranda in the two extracts?
In the two Key Extracts we learn that Miranda is young and inexperienced, but not necessarily weak. She has a pure heart and sees the best in Ferdinand and even defends Prospero. In the First Key Extract she must do what her father says, even though his behaviour is questionable. In the Second Key Extract, she knows her own mind and goes behind her father's back (or thinks she has) to ask Ferdinand to be her husband.
Miranda can be read as a strong female character. Even though Prospero is a controlling father, Miranda shows from the beginning of the extract that she is beginning to test his power over her.
She relies on her own judgement and questions her father's actions. She stands up for Ferdinand against her father and is on the receiving end of Prospero's ugly temper. She replies with dignity and even tries to excuse her father's bad behaviour to Ferdinand. However, throughout the first extract, she is being unwittingly manipulated by Prospero.
In the second extract she openly defies her father (although it is part of Prospero's plan that she does this). She demonstrates that she is Ferdinand's equal by offering to share his workload. She claims that she is not worthy of him, but then shows her independence by proposing marriage.
Miranda pleads with Prospero to see the best in Ferdinand, but perhaps her father, who is more experienced, is wise to test Ferdinand's love for his daughter. Miranda is open about her feelings for Ferdinand, but in doing so believes that she is betraying her father's wishes. Miranda is sometimes weak and sometimes strong. She is a complex character.
Throughout the two extracts we see Miranda's growing independence. The truth is, however, that although she thinks she is rebelling against her father by following her own heart, her actions are part of Prospero's plans.

People often confuse mass and weight. Remember that weight is a force, and is measured in newtons. Mass is measured in kilograms (kg).

A 100 kg object has a greater mass than a 5 kg object. Remember an object's mass stays the same wherever it is.
All objects have a force that attracts them towards each other. This is called
. Even you attract other objects to you because of gravity, but you have too little mass for the force to be very strong.
Gravity only becomes noticeable when there is a really massive object like a moon, planet or star. We are pulled down towards the ground because of gravity. The gravitational force pulls in the direction towards the centre of the Earth.
""Down"" is towards the centre of the Earth, wherever you are on the planet
Weight is a force caused by gravity. The weight of an object is the
between the object and the Earth. The more mass the object has the greater its weight will be.
Weight is a force, so it's measured in
. On the surface of the Earth an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 10 N.
The mass of an object stays the same wherever it is, but its weight can change. This happens if the object goes somewhere where gravity is stronger, or weaker, such as the Moon.
The Moon has less mass than the Earth, so its gravity is less than the Earth's gravity. This means that objects weigh less on the Moon than they do on the Earth.
The Moon's gravity is one sixth of the Earth's gravity. A 120 kg astronaut weighs 1200 N on Earth. On the Moon they would weigh only 200 N. The astronaut's

is the chemical reaction used to release energy from glucose. It is called aerobic because oxygen from the air is also needed.
Here is the word equation for aerobic respiration. Energy is put in brackets because it not a substance:
Notice that the word equation for respiration is the reverse of the word equation for photosynthesis. Check back if you are not sure of this.
Plant cells respire, just as animal cells do. If they stop respiring, they will die. Remember that respiration is not the same as breathing, so take care - plants do not breathe.
As we can see from the word equations respiration and photosynthesis are opposites. Respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and produces oxygen.
So what happens to a plant overall? This depends on whether it is in the dark or the light, and how bright the light is.
Plants respire all the time, whether it is dark or light. They photosynthesise only when they are in the light.
Neither gas is taken in or given out, as each cancels the other out
Photosynthesis usually results in a net food gain (net glucose gain), once respiration has been accounted for. This means that there is an increase in the biomass of the plant.
Plants that lose their leaves in winter store food produced during the summer by photosynthesis. They store enough food to last them over winter, and to provide energy reserves for new growth in the spring.

It's up to you to make your mind up about a setting, in just the same way that it's up to you what to make of a new place you visit. Writers often use language in clever ways to build up a sense of atmosphere and setting.
Take a look at the following extract from Robert Westall's novel, 'Urn Burial'. Ralph has been captured by an alien race...
This was the worst nightmare yet. He was standing with his back pressed against a smooth wall cold as ice. The cold nibbled at his buttocks and legs; it ran up and down the knobbles of his spine, making him shiver; it invaded his lungs so he could hardly breathe; he felt he had been shivering a long time.
In the extract, the writer intends to create a very creepy, sinister atmosphere. The way that he describes Ralph's imprisonment makes it sound very unpleasant. He is ""pressed"" against a wall that is ""cold as ice"" and the cold is creeping into every part of his body, making him shiver. Ralph also feels as if he can ""hardly breathe"" because of the cold.
. The simile; ""a smooth wall cold as ice"", helps the reader relate to Ralph as they will know what ice feels like. The writer also uses personification; the cold ""nibbled"" at Ralph, it ""ran up and down"" his back and ""invaded"" his lungs. This makes the cold sound as if it were alive, running over and into Ralph, trying to eat away at him. This adds to the feeling that he has been overpowered and is in danger.

Love is strongly linked to magic. Miranda thinks that Ferdinand is a ""spirit"". He thinks that she is a ""goddess"". It is strongly suggested that their love at first sight is simply an illusion.
Miranda and Ferdinand's speeches are very honest and loving. Ferdinand is ""humble"", whilst Miranda talks of her ""modesty"".
When Prospero describes love he uses terms linked to control, e.g ""They are both in either's powers""; his daughter will ""control"" Ferdinand.
Prospero recognises that Miranda and Ferdinand's love is real and beyond their control. He compares it to a disease. He says his daughter is ""infected"".
There are lots of references to freedom and slavery. Prospero promises to free Ariel; he threatens to ""manacle"" Ferdinand. Ferdinand doesn't mind being a slave as long as he has Miranda to love.
Ferdinand uses a metaphor linked to slavery to describe his past crushes. He admits that he only suffers the indignity of being Prospero's slave for Miranda's sake.

change from hot weather in the summer to cold weather in the winter
change from long hours of daylight in the summer to shorter days in the winter

Let's look at two examples of how organisms are adapted to such changes.
If you have ever been to the seaside and looked for creatures in rock pools, you are likely to have seen lots of limpets on the rocks.
When the tide is in, limpets move over sea-covered rocks, scraping off tiny bits of seaweed. When the tide goes out, limpets clamp themselves very tightly against the newly exposed rock. This makes it difficult for predators to pull them off the rock to eat them. It also stops the limpets losing water, or being washed away by waves.
The snowshoe hare lives in Canada and other parts of North America.
The snowshoe hare has brown fur during the summer, to help camouflage it amongst the earth and plants. Its fur is white during the winter, to help camouflage it in the snow. This adaptation makes it more difficult for predators to see the snowshoe hare, whatever the season.

Read through the following extract. How does the writer create an atmosphere of cold and loneliness?
Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness - a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.
The extract describes a cold, empty landscape.
The text states that the trees have been ""stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost"".
The land is described as ""desolate"" and it contains ""a laughter more terrible than any sadness"".
This suggests that the place is completely isolated.
The fact that it seems to be full of terrible laughter suggests it is a very cruel area, which would be hard to explore.
If you are going to use quotations from the extract in your answer, remember to set them out properly. Here are some points to remember:
Quotes of three words or less can be used in the sentence you're writing - for example ...when the writer talks about the ""futility of life"" he means...
Longer quotations need to be included on a line of their own and with a space before it (known as an indent) - for example ...the writer describes the landscape as a ""desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold"" he creates a picture that...
Short, well-chosen quotations are better than long, vague ones.
Also remember that certain words and phrases are especially helpful when you're explaining an idea in detail. They can be particularly helpful if you are commenting on implicit meaning. The following wordbank shows you some of those phrases, and you might be able to add some more:

Your aim is to get all the unknown x terms on one of the equation side only, so start by adding 2x to both sides: 7x - 2 = 12

This makes sense, so the value x = 2 is correct.
Add x to both sides to give 5x = 10.

When talking about language, the things to concentrate on are:
Whether there might be another meaning behind the first most obvious one
The example below is about the language of love. Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on Romeo's descriptions of love.
Love is an excellent subject for poets. Romeo enjoys using lots of different poetic devices to explore the idea of love.
The idea of love seems to be making Romeo's brain ache. He comes up with a list of oxymorons (pairs of opposite words eg 'loving hate') to try and find the right definition of love. He makes up some vivid metaphors for love, but comes closer with his descriptions to lust. He thinks love is a kind of madness or even a poison. He thinks that he loves Rosaline. He compares her to a Roman goddess and complains that Cupid keeps missing her heart with his arrows. He focuses on her beauty and talks about his problems getting her to love him back as though it is a kind of battle.
At this point in the play, Romeo doesn't seem to understand what true love is. It is possible that he has got some of his romantic ideas from stories. He likes talking about love, but some of his opinions don't sound very loving. We never meet Rosaline in the play, but you may think to yourself that she is wise not to encourage Romeo's advances. They don't sound respectful or honourable. In fact, it could be argued that Romeo's ideas about love are funny or silly, and show him up to be immature and shallow.

Set in Capulet's Orchard - the two characters are alone.
Is a more gentle and humorous end to what has been a very tense and action-packed scene.
A moving and romantic extract that contrasts with the scene before it which is full of Mercutio's rude jokes.
Montague and Benvolio describe how Romeo has been behaving, before he actually appears on stage.
Whereas in the first extract, Romeo talks about love, in the second extract we see how he behaves when he is in love.
The movement of characters is less obvious - it's just two characters having a chat. The director has to make sure that this is interesting to look at on stage.
Again, in the second extract, two characters are talking. The director has to think creatively so that the action is interesting to watch.
The potential for humour comes from the banter and word-play between Romeo and Benvolio.

a) The house was built in 1975. It was a typical semi-detached, but it did have quite an impressive front door. Most of the windows were double glazed and the garden was quite neat.
b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.
There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.
So you need to think about TAP (text, audience and purpose) and make a good start to your writing. You should try to 'set a context', which is like setting the scene. So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on.
a) The subject I am going to write about today is why the local park should not be closed.
b) Have you ever stopped to wonder how many hundreds of people make regular use of our Memorial Park?
a) It is unlikely that newspaper readers who enjoy all the things that our park has to offer will want it to disappear forever under tons of concrete.
b) 'Ashfield Park will be ruined,' claim protestors who held a meeting last night to organise opposition to the council's plans for a car park.
It should be clear that the ""b"" versions are better - they fit the style and show that the writer has used TAP to make their writing work. Remember - you need to make it interesting right from the start.

Friar Lawrence tells them all the truth about the wedding and their children's deaths. He feels so guilty that he asks the Prince to punish him, but Prince Escalus won't because the Friar is a holy man.

Suppose you were in the middle of nowhere, and there were no signs or landmarks to help you find your way. Would you know how to find your way home? Someone might tell you via phone or radio to 'walk to your left', or 'turn through 60 and then start walking', but how would they know which way you were pointing in the first place?
One way of describing direction from a point is to use
A compass always points north. Bearings are measured from the
So when someone tells you to walk on a bearing of 120, you should face north, turn clockwise through 120 and start walking.

Variation and classification - Continuous & discontinuous
Some of the features of the different organisms in a species show continuous variation, and some features show discontinuous variation.
Human height is an example of continuous variation. Height ranges from that of the shortest person in the world to that of the tallest person. Any height is possible between these values. So it is continuous variation.
For any species a characteristic that changes gradually over a range of values shows continuous variation. Examples of such characteristics are:
If you record the heights of a group of people and draw a graph of your results, it usually looks something like this:
The more people you measure, and the smaller the categories you use, the closer the results will be to the curved line. This shape of graph is typical of a feature with continuous variation. Weight and foot length would give graphs similar in shape to this.
Human blood group is an example of discontinuous variation. There are only 4 types of blood group. There are no other possibilities and there are no values in between. So this is discontinuous variation.
A characteristic of any species with only a limited number of possible values shows discontinuous variation. Here are some examples:

Food chains - Changes to food webs
Let's look at the food web again and ask some questions about its predator-prey relationships, with some possible answers.
What would happen if the grass died?
The grass is the producer, so if it died the consumers that feed on it - rabbits, insects and slugs - would have no food. They would starve and die unless they could move to another habitat. All the other animals in the food web would die too, because their food supplies would have died out. The populations of the consumers would fall as the population of the producer fell.
What would happen if the population of slugs decreased?
Slugs, rabbits and insects all eat grass. If there were fewer slugs there would be more grass for the rabbits and insects. With more food the populations of rabbits and insects would increase. However, the thrushes would have to eat more insects to maintain their population, so it is also possible that the population of insects could decrease. This is turn may reduce the populations of voles and frogs.
What would happen if the population of insects decreased?
There would be more food for the rabbits and slugs, so their populations would increase. However, there would be less food for the frogs and voles, so their populations would decrease. This means less food for the foxes and hawks. However, there are likely to be more rabbits and thrushes for them to eat, so their populations are likely to stay the same.

A species becomes extinct when there are no more individuals of that species left. An extinct species has gone forever.
Here are some of the things that can cause a species to become extinct:
a change in the physical environment, such as a change in the long-term temperature or rainfall patterns
competition from another species that is better adapted, including competition from humans
For example, dinosaurs became extinct millions of years ago. This was probably due to changes in the environment. But many species have become extinct more recently because of competition from humans.
The dodo was a flightless bird found on the island of Mauritius. It became extinct in the seventeenth century because of human activities. Humans disturbed the dodo's habitat and also brought new predators to the island, like pigs and dogs.

The key thing about writing to inform is that you stick to the information. You shouldn't really show many of your own feelings, and you definitely don't want to tell your audience how they should feel. Instead, when you inform you make the facts easy to understand, with a clear structure.
Write an information leaflet for Year 6 pupils, telling them about the school day and what they need to know when they start your school in September.
It's important to structure your answer well. Think of the answer in terms of a drawing, like this:
This is a timeline - the arrow is time moving forwards and the four lines are different events in order. Now, you can think of the school day as the arrow, and plan the different events in a typical day. For instance, you could have registration, then an assembly, then two lessons followed by break. It should be easy to add information and detail. The structure also makes it easy for the Year 6 pupils to follow your information. Another way to inform is by subject, as in the diagram below:
These are points linked together. It is not in order of time, but in order of subject. So you could have PE at the centre with all the information connected to PE in the little circles around. For instance, you could have different types of PE kit, the different sports, the sort of exercises you do. Once you have written about PE, you can move on to look at other areas of the school.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - Characters
In the First Key Extract, Romeo claimed to be in love with a girl called Rosaline. By the early hours of the very next morning, in the Second Key Extract, Romeo is exchanging ""love's faithful vows"" with Juliet.
It could be said that when it comes to relationships, Romeo isn't very faithful. On the other hand, perhaps he has found his soul mate in Juliet.
Romeo seemed to be in love with the idea of love, perhaps even more than he was in love with Rosaline. Apart from saying that she was beautiful, he wasn't very complimentary about her personality.
Romeo is besotted by Juliet; the fact that she is beautiful plays a big part.
Romeo loves the language of love. His speeches are full of confusing imagery as he tries to work out just exactly what love is.
Romeo tries to impress Juliet with his poetic descriptions about love. Juliet's words somehow seem more heartfelt than Romeo's clever poetry.
Montague and Benvolio discuss how moody Romeo has been lately. When he enters the scene, the audience can see for themselves how his mood can swing from despair to humour and back again.
Juliet is a deeply emotional person and is open about her feelings from the start. Romeo seems to get caught up in that wave of her emotion. They go from being complete strangers to committed lovers in a matter of hours.
Romeo stubbornly swears that he could never love anyone other than Rosalinebut as we see in the Second Key Extract, by the very next morning he is planning his wedding to Juliet.
Both characters make decisions quickly and take risks lightly. Romeo and Juliet could both be described as impulsive in their actions.

The arrow is usually labelled with the name of the force and its size in newtons. Text books often show a force with a thick coloured arrow, but it is best if you just use a pencil and ruler to draw an arrow with a single line.

If the forces on an object are balanced (or if there are no forces acting on it) this is what happens:

an object that is moving continues to move at the same speed and in the same direction

A boat floats because its weight is balanced by the upthrust from the water
When an object rests on a surface such as the ground, its weight is balanced by the reaction force from the ground. The ground pushes up against the object. The reaction force is what you feel in your feet as you stand still. Without this balancing force you would sink into the ground.

The Second Key Extract takes place outside Prospero's cave. Ferdinand is carrying logs. He thinks to himself that he doesn't mind the hard work because he is doing it for Miranda,

even if her father is cruel and grumpy.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
Miranda comes to see him. Neither of them realise that Prospero is watching them from a distance.
On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance?
Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
but he says he has too much to do, so she offers to carry some logs for him.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
He says he would rather break his back than see her work. Miranda insists again that she should help him.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Looking on, Prospero sees how much Miranda is in love with Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Ferdinand asks Miranda her name and when she tells him, she remembers that in doing so, she has broken her promise to her father.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand admits that he has liked lots of different women in the past

Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
However, Miranda, he says, is perfect. Miranda, on the other hand, hasn't met any men except for her father, or any women, except for herself. Even so, she says that she can't imagine liking anyone more than she likes Ferdinand.
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand tells her that he is a prince, possibly a king (although he hopes his father isn't dead). He wouldn't usually put up with having to carry logs like a slave
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
but he knew as soon as he saw Miranda that he'd do anything for her. When Miranda asks him if he loves her, Ferdinand says he loves, prizes and honours her more than anything else in the world. This makes Miranda so happy that she cries. As Prospero watches them together, he is moved.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Ferdinand asks Miranda why she is crying. She says she thinks she isn't good enough for him
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!
but realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else. Ferdinand happily agrees to marry her. They say goodbye and part.
Prospero is happy for them, but he claims that their engagement is no surprise to him as it was all part of his plan. He goes to get his magic book because he has lots of work to do before supper time.

It is possible to balance the see-saw again if someone else gets onto the other end and sits in the correct place. This is because the turning forces are balanced. We say the moments are equal and opposite.
, we need to know two things:
the distance from the pivot that the force is applied.
This is the equation for working out a moment:
Imagine that a force of 10 N acted on a see-saw 2 m from the pivot. This is how we would work out the moment:
Notice that the unit of moment is
(newton metre). Don't get confused with a 'newton meter', which is another name for a forcemeter.
Here is an example of balanced moments. 10N at 2m from the pivot is balancing 20N at 1m from the pivot. The objects create moments of 20Nm that are equal and opposite, so the see-saw is balanced.
A see-saw will balance if the moments on each side of the pivot are equal. This is why you might have to adjust your position on a see-saw if you are a different weight from the person on the other end.
If a nut is difficult to undo with a short spanner, a longer spanner will help. This is because there will be a bigger moment on the nut, when the same force is applied further from the pivot.
Using the same principle you can increase the moment applied by a lever or a crowbar, and this can help you move heavy objects more easily.

11,"> The Tempest Summary - The banquet
Miranda comes to see Ferdinand while he is carrying logs. Prospero is secretly watching and overhears Ferdinand and Miranda say they love each other. He finally approves of their love.
On their way to see Prospero, to kill him, Caliban and Stephano discuss horrible ways of murdering him. Ariel overhears them and makes them go in the wrong direction, with soothing, magical music.
In another part of the island, King Alonso and his companions sit down to rest. Prospero and Ariel cause the spirits of the island to prepare them a wonderful banquet. But at their first taste, Ariel appears to them. He accuses the ""three men of sin"" (Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian - plotters all) of their crimes. They are warned that they will suffer a nasty death unless they are truly sorry and live a ""clear life"" in the future. Only Alonso will admit what he has done.
A little way away, Prospero tells Ferdinand that he will no longer punish him, but instead will give him his daughter's hand in marriage.
Prospero makes a beautiful illusion of a party appear, to celebrate.
Caliban, Trinculo and Stephano in a smelly pool
Prospero tells Ariel to lead most of the other survivors on the island to him. But remembering Caliban, Trinculo and Stephano's plot against him, Prospero tells Ariel to keep them away from him. Ariel leads them on a wild goose chase ending up in a smelly pool. They are soon attacked by spirits in the form of dogs.
Prospero is pleased with Ariel, and promises he'll soon be free.

235,"> Tone and style - Style tips
Another top style tip is to avoid being boring. It sounds obvious, but many writers put in far too much information. In fact, some even write most of the question out again when they start their answer. So what should you do?
At the beginning, don't waffle, get straight to the point. Don't just repeat things in your conclusion. Put yourself in the reader's shoes - which of these two starts to a school magazine article do you prefer?
Do you know someone who is being bullied right now? Don't know what to do? Well we decided to send Stuart Smith (Year 8) around the school to find out just how bad bullying is, and to come up with some ideas about what we can do to stop it.
Bullying is when people are cruel to other people. It can be hurting them, like kicking them, or hurting them using horrible names. It could be other things too. My article for the school magazine is about bullying. I am going to start by saying what the problem of bullying is and then...
The first one is much better - it gets straight to the point and you want to read on. The second version repeats parts of the question, but for no reason. People who are reading the school magazine don't have to be reminded in each article that it is the school magazine. We also know the article is about bullying from the first sentence, but Stuart's definition is poor and the whole article is slow to get started.
You've got tone and style. Work it!

633,"> The Tempest Summary - The opening
The play opens on board a ship that is being battered by a storm - or tempest. The ship's crew are hard at work trying to stop the ship from sinking.
Antonio, brother of Prospero (a magician, who appears later)
They think they are going to drown.
The action moves to an island near where the ship is in trouble. Prospero, a magician, and his daughter Miranda, are living on the island with two others.
One is Ariel (a sprite, or elf-like character) - who'd once been kept in a tree by an evil witch, Sycorax. Prospero had released him from the tree with his magic.
The other is Caliban (big and nasty, the son of Sycorax) - who Prospero had been kind to. Both Ariel and Caliban are Prospero's servants.
Prospero, we now learn, had caused the storm on purpose. It was because of something that had happened long ago, as he tells Miranda ...
Twelve years earlier, he says, Prospero was the much loved Duke of Milan, a great city in Italy. Miranda was a young princess.
Prospero was always reading. This meant that his brother Antonio (who is on the ship in the storm) had so much power that he wanted more, and plotted against Prospero, with the help of the King, Alonso.
One night, Prospero tells Miranda, he and Miranda were seized, and sent out to sea alone in an open boat. They were lucky to survive, although Prospero's magic books were on the boat. Finally they came ashore on the island where they now live.
When his story is over, Prospero makes Miranda sleep before calling for Ariel, to find out how the plans he has made for the ship in the storm are going.

Prospero tells Alonso that he has lost his daughter, just as Alonso (who still thinks Ferdinand is drowned) has lost his son - but he means in marriage. He draws back a curtain to show the two young lovers playing chess.
The ship's captain brings news that the ship is safe, and all prepare for the return to Naples for the wedding of Ferdinand and Miranda.

Use the TAP technique for the question below. It will help if you read the question through several times and slowly to digest the content.
The following article has appeared in your local paper:
Ashfield Park is threatened with closure next month as a local business has applied for planning permission to turn the area into a car park. Local residents have begun a fierce campaign to save the park, which is a popular walking spot for young children and the elderly, as well as home to the War Memorial and many wildlife species.
Write to your local paper, arguing that the park should be preserved.
Have a think - what is the TAP? When you have your answer, check it with ours by pressing the 'Check ideas' button.
- it's to argue and persuade. This means you want to influence other people and tell them what you think is right
There are lots of ways of planning - some of them are fancy, some of them are simple, but the most important thing is to write your ideas down. If you don't, you could easily forget them.
Let's have a go at using the question about the park. The simplest plan is just to write down a list of all the points. Look again at the question, think of a list, then compare yours to ours.
If you are writing an argument, and we are in this question, we can make two lists - one is the positive side - which supports your view, the other is the negative side - which goes against your view. Have a go, then compare your lists with ours.
Some people like spider diagrams. These are more complicated, but they can show how points are linked, like this:

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to advise
Once you can argue and persuade, it should be easy to advise. The trick is to be gentle - it's no good pushing your ideas at your readers, or trying to impress them. Instead, you should come across as friendly, as someone who just wants to help.
For instance, imagine you're writing to advise someone in Year 9 who is moving house and has to change schools. We know that it won't be easy - they'll have to make new friends and cope with all sorts of changes. So you need to be sympathetic and give some ideas you think could help.
The first thing might be to plan each main idea in a separate paragraph because it's easier to follow like this. Then think about how you want to present your ideas. It might be fine to give some information as an order, such as:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone.
You can add information to this - perhaps explaining why and giving an example of what to do, so now your paragraph looks like this:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone. Most people will be glad to help and it's the quickest way to make friends. You can ask a teacher, but it might be better to ask one of the other pupils. Choose a friendly face if you can, and don't be shy - it might be their first day too.
It is not just the information that makes this a good piece of advice, it's also the style. It includes words like ""might"" and ""can"". These make the ideas softer - they are not in your face and pushing you to agree, they just guide you. And they are very simple to use, so make sure you include words like ""should, can, could, might, ought to and may"" - each one turns an idea into a piece of advice.

Romeo and Juliet first key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Montagues and Capulets have just had a fight in a public place in Verona. Prince Escalus stopped it and warned that if it happens again, those involved will be punished by death.
The first set scene begins with Montague asking Benvolio how the fight began.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
Benvolio tells him that servants from both families were fighting and that when he tried to stop them, Tybalt turned on him.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.
After that, lots of other people joined in until the Prince came and stopped the fighting.
Lady Montague is worried about her son, Romeo. He wasn't involved in the fighting but she wonders where he is. Benvolio explains that he saw him skulking about before dawn. Montague says that this is not unusual behaviour for Romeo: people have seen him crying and sighing on his own before daybreak before.
The audience finds out a lot about Romeo before he even walks onto the stage. What are your first impressions of Romeo?
Montague says he has tried to talk to his son, but he won't open up to him.
Parents and children - You might be able to sympathise with Romeo not wanting to talk about his feelings with his father.
He says he is like a flower that never gets to open because it has been stopped from blossoming by a worm that has eaten into it.
This is a simile to show that no one can get near to Romeo whilst he is in such a bad mood.
When Romeo arrives, Montague and Lady Montague leave Benvolio to try and find out why he is in such a bad mood all of the time.
- Time - There are lots of references to time in this play. The events in this play take place in just less than one week. Romeo and Juliet both feel that time drags whilst they are apart from one another.
Romeo tries to explain that he is in love with a girl who doesn't love him back. He doesn't make himself very clear though and Benvolio has to work hard to get him to tell him about it. Romeo comes up with lots of confusing descriptions of love to try and explain how he feels.
The list of opposites in Romeo's speech ('loving hate', 'heavy lightness', etc) are called oxymorons. They give us an important clue to his character. His confusing speech shows us how confusing the world is to him as a young man. It also shows us that Romeo likes to play with language.
""Here's much to do with hate, but more with love""
- Love and Hate - Romeo is commenting on the street brawl that has just happened: it's about hating an opposing family and feeling love and loyalty towards their own. Taken on its own, the line sums up the play as a whole: it's about two families that hate each other, but more about the love between Romeo and Juliet.
Romeo speaks in rhyme to try to describe how he feels.
Romeo's speeches are often in rhyme. He also likes wordplay, metaphors and similes. Romeo loves to talk about love, but does he really know what love is at this point? You could say that Romeo, at this point is 'all talk and no action'.
He says that love is like smoke made from the hot breath of lovers and that the flames are the sparks in their eyes. But if it doesn't work out, love is a sea of tears. He also describes love as a kind of madness and a poison.
- Love - The language that Romeo uses to describe love gives us an idea of what Romeo believes love to be at this point. For him it's about desire, which sounds like lust rather than true love.
Benvolio brings Romeo back to earth with a straightforward question: who is the girl he is in love with?
Whilst Romeo is pouring his heart out, Benvolio's responses could be performed in a number of ways- sympathetic, impatient, humorous. All three work.
Romeo still won't give him a straight answer though.
Romeo and Benvolio are good friends. We can see this through the way they banter with one another.
He tells Benvolio that the girl is very beautiful but she doesn't want to fall in love. It seems that she is very pure and Romeo says that because she isn't interested in men, her beauty will be wasted!
- Love - We never meet Rosaline in the play and only have Romeo's description of her to go by. It's hard to tell whether she really is a very good girl or whether she simply doesn't fancy Romeo!
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste
Benvolio says that the best thing to do is to forget her. He advises Romeo to look at other attractive girls. Romeo swears that he can never forget her; he'll never find anyone as beautiful as her. Benvolio bets that he will.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.

Ray, the main character in this extract, has stolen a motorbike and caused an accident that killed someone. He has told nobody, but knows that he can't hide for much longer. He is about to get on a bus, but realises that the one person who can link him to the crime is the conductor of that very bus. Before he can run off, he bumps into Mrs Fitzroy, his best friend's mum.
Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. Write one paragraph for each bullet point.
He hung back, groping wildly for some excuse to prevent him getting on, but the bell rang and the engine increased its impatient rumble and his legs carried him upwards on to the platform, and he felt Mrs Fitzroy clamber on behind. The bus began to move. He turned towards the stairs, but she caught hold of his arm.
""Let's go downstairs. I don't like the smoke."" Again he felt her hand guide him, and he ducked his head and began to walk along the aisle. ""Yeah"".
""This'll do,"" she said, and he turned back and sat beside her - the less fuss he made, the less obvious he was, the better. As he settled, he kept his face bent low, aware of the conductor walking towards them. He brushed past, and, noticing things with a total clarity, Ray saw the dark blue uniform that he was wearing and noted the heaviness and thickness of the material. He heard him clumping up the stairs, and he wondered, absurdly, if he was wearing heavy boots, too.
Mrs Fitzroy was opening the bag which she had on her lap, and Ray felt in his pocket for his fare. If he had the right change, he could just hand it to the conductor without looking up. Yes, he had a ten and two pence piece. He glanced at Mrs Fitzroy and saw to his dismay that she was taking out a pound-note from her purse. That would mean a delay while she got her change - plenty of chance for him to be recognised. Could he offer to pay her fare? It would seem strange, but anything was better than being seen.
What kind of atmosphere does the writer create in this extract and how do they do it?
Ray's thoughts and actions as he gets on the bus
how the writer uses language to create the atmosphere.
In this text, the writer creates an atmosphere of fear and tension. Ray's thoughts and actions at the start of the passage show that he is under a lot of pressure. He tries to think of an excuse to 'prevent him getting on' the bus, but knows that this will just make Mrs Fitzroy suspicious. When he tries to go upstairs, she insists they stay downstairs. Nothing seems to be going his way, and this leads us to believe he may well be spotted by the conductor.
As the conductor approaches, Ray's fears increase which creates more tension. He keeps his face 'bent low' to avoid being recognised, and also notices things 'with a total clarity'. This shows that he is very scared and alert, ready for something to go wrong. When he realises Mrs Fitzroy has no change, he feels 'dismay'. The reader is kept on the edge of their seat waiting for the conductor to come along.
The writer uses language, as well as events, to create tension. The phrase 'groping wildly for some excuse' shows Ray's panic and gives the impression that he feels he has no control over events. The way he notices the 'heaviness' of the conductor's uniform, and wonders if he was 'wearing heavy boots as well' might mean that he is afraid of the man. Ray asks himself 'Could he offer to pay her fare?'. This shows he is tense; he is running through possibilities in his mind. The writer uses Ray's fears to create an atmosphere of tension for the reader.

Before this scene, Prospero and his slave, Caliban have exchanged cross words.
The First Key Extract begins with Ferdinand hearing Ariel's song.
Ariel's song calms the stormy waters. In 'The Tempest', music is linked closely to magic and illusion.
He wonders where the sounds are coming from.
Illusion - Ferdinand does not know where the sound is coming from. He assumes that it is magic and tells us that the music not only calmed the storm, but also made him feel better.
He follows the sound, and when the song begins again, it suggests to Ferdinand that his father has drowned.
When Miranda sees Ferdinand approaching, she can't believe her eyes. She doesn't think that Ferdinand is real.
Illusion - Ferdinand is a living human being, but Miranda is convinced that he is a magical creature. In 'The Tempest', things are never quite as they at first seem.
Prospero explains that he is a man, not a spirit and that he is looking for other survivors of the shipwreck. Prospero feels excited that Miranda and Ferdinand seem to like each other: it was his plan all along
Power - Prospero claims that he has used magic to make Miranda and Ferdinand fall in love. Prospero likes to control and manipulate people through his magic.
, and he promises to reward Ariel with his freedom for helping to get them together.
Ferdinand asks Miranda if she is an ordinary girl or a goddess.
Miranda can't believe that Ferdinand is an ordinary mortal. She thinks he's a 'spirit'. She calls him 'divine' and 'noble'. Ferdinand refers to her as a 'goddess'. The language they use suggests that they worship one another.
He is shocked when she speaks his language. When he hints that he is the King of Naples, Prospero challenges him.
Prospero likes to be in control. As soon as Ferdinand suggests that he has any sort of power, Prospero tries to undermine him. Prospero's questions are sarcastic and mocking in his attempt to show Ferdinand who is boss.
Ferdinand sadly explains that he believes that his father, the King of Naples, has drowned in the shipwreck along with the Duke of Milan and his son. Prospero watches Ferdinand and thinks to himself that he will be able to manipulate him easily now that Ferdinand is in love with his daughter.
Think carefully about what kind of man Prospero is. Is he a caring father who will do anything to get the best for his daughter? Is he manipulative and controlling? Love is a powerful emotion. Should people use love to control others?
Miranda can't understand why her father is being so abrupt with Ferdinand. She has fallen in love at first sight with Ferdinand.
Love - Miranda admits that she has feelings for Ferdinand. It is the first time she has ever felt this way. Do you think that she would have fallen in love with Ferdinand even without Prospero's magic?
She wishes that her father could see things from her point of view.
When Ferdinand offers to make Miranda his queen, Prospero steps in. He is worried that his plan won't work if Ferdinand wins Miranda's heart too easily.
Prospero says: 'But this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning/Make the prize light'. He means that he can't let Ferdinand think that it was too easy to get Miranda to be his girlfriend, because he might not treat her well if it's really easy to make her love him.
He says that Ferdinand is lying about being a king and accuses him of being a spy.
Power/ Illusion - Prospero wants to manipulate Ferdinand. He will make him suffer and work hard for Miranda's love. When Ferdinand claims to have some power of his own as the heir to the throne, Prospero takes this power away by accusing him of being a spy and taking him prisoner. Prospero knows that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne. 'The Tempest' is all about the confusion between what is true and real, and what is illusion.
Miranda tries to speak up for him
You might think that Miranda is brave to speak up for Ferdinand. Apart from being a powerful magician, Prospero has quite a temper! Her speech also shows us how innocent she is. She can't believe that anyone who looks so lovely on the outside can be anything other than lovely on the inside. In 'The Tempest', Shakespeare shows us that things are not always as they first seem.
but Prospero tells her off and threatens to imprison Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Ferdinand a 'traitor'. He threatens to 'manacle' his neck and give him sea water to drink and acorn shells to eat. Prospero doesn't mean any of these threats, but in making them he shows that he has power over Ferdinand and could make him a slave just as he made Caliban his slave. Throughout the extract, Prospero uses words like 'usurp', 'traitor' and 'impostor' which all seem a bit strong when referring to Ferdinand. When Antonio took Prospero's place as Duke of Milan, he did 'usurp' him, and in doing so, he was a 'traitor' and in calling himself the Duke of Milan, Antonio is an 'imposter'.
When Ferdinand draws his sword, Prospero uses magic to make it impossible for Ferdinand to move.
Miranda tries desperately to stop her father but he won't listen. Ferdinand comes to the conclusion that all his problems - his father's death, the shipwreck, Prospero's threats - mean nothing, as long as he can see Miranda once a day, even if he is in prison.
Love/ Illusion - Ferdinand suddenly doesn't mind being Prospero's prisoner, as long as he has Miranda to love. He says it's all like a 'dream'. Does love have that kind of dream-like power to overcome difficulties? Or is it another one of Prospero's spells?
Prospero is pleased that his plan to make Ferdinand fall in love with Miranda has worked. He praises Ariel
Love/ Illusion - When Prospero tells Ariel that he has done well, this suggests that Miranda and Ferdinand's attraction towards one another is not true love, but a magic trick, an illusion, that Ariel has conjured.
Prospero promises Ariel that he will be free
Freedom and Slavery - Just as Prospero has made Caliban a slave and threatened to imprison Ferdinand, he has the power to set Ariel free. When Prospero arrived on the island, Ariel was trapped in a pine tree and Prospero set him free, so he has a debt of gratitude towards him. Also, Ariel is gentle whereas Prospero has a temper. It could be that Ariel is a little afraid of his master.
if he carries out all of his commands. Ariel agrees. Prospero orders Ferdinand to follow him and tells Miranda not to try and speak up for him.
Ariel's song calms the stormy waters. In 'The Tempest', music is linked closely to magic and illusion.
Illusion - Ferdinand does not know where the sound is coming from. He assumes that it is magic and tells us that the music not only calmed the storm, but also made him feel better.
Illusion - Ferdinand is a living human being, but Miranda is convinced that he is a magical creature. In 'The Tempest', things are never quite as they at first seem.
Power - Prospero claims that he has used magic to make Miranda and Ferdinand fall in love. Prospero likes to control and manipulate people through his magic.
Miranda can't believe that Ferdinand is an ordinary mortal. She thinks he's a 'spirit'. She calls him 'divine' and 'noble'. Ferdinand refers to her as a 'goddess'. The language they use suggests that they worship one another.
Prospero likes to be in control. As soon as Ferdinand suggests that he has any sort of power, Prospero tries to undermine him. Prospero's questions are sarcastic and mocking in his attempt to show Ferdinand who is boss.
Think carefully about what kind of man Prospero is. Is he a caring father who will do anything to get the best for his daughter? Is he manipulative and controlling? Love is a powerful emotion. Should people use love to control others?
Love - Miranda admits that she has feelings for Ferdinand. It is the first time she has ever felt this way. Do you think that she would have fallen in love with Ferdinand even without Prospero's magic?
Prospero says: 'But this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning/Make the prize light'. He means that he can't let Ferdinand think that it was too easy to get Miranda to be his girlfriend, because he might not treat her well if it's really easy to make her love him.
Power/ Illusion - Prospero wants to manipulate Ferdinand. He will make him suffer and work hard for Miranda's love.

The Tempest second key extract - Performance
There are a lot of different ways to perform a particular scene. How is the drama created in the two Key Extracts?
From the table below, you will see there are elements of the two Key Extracts that are quite similar. But whereas there is a lot of conflict in the first extract, the second one is full of romance. This needs to be brought out in the performance.
Prospero is in control of the action. He even slows the pace down at one point to suit his own ends. He could be compared to Shakespeare, moving the plot forward and molding events.
Prospero watches from a distance and comments occasionally but does not interfere. It is as though he is part of the audience.
Is a more gentle and humorous end to what has been a very tense and action-packed scene.
A moving and romantic extract that contrasts with the scene before it which is full of Mercutio's rude jokes.
Ariel is present at the beginning. Prospero uses magic to prevent Ferdinand from using his sword. Ferdinand seems to submit very quickly at the end of this extract, as though magic may have had some part to play.
There is no sign of magic in this extract. The setting is very ordinary as Ferdinand carries logs to Prospero's cave. Any ""magic"" that exists is in the form of the power of love.
Both Ferdinand and Miranda seem bewildered by their feelings.
Ferdinand and Miranda are bursting to reveal their true feelings to each other.
The tone changes quickly within this scene that contains violence and anger.
The tone remains calm. This is a very moving scene.

Instincts are useful because they do not have to be learned and they can be complex, like the examples above. Instincts let animals form groups for protection, choose mates, fight to be in charge, and show many other behaviours.

Some persuasive texts aim simply at persuading us to do something, particularly charity leaflets, holiday brochures and adverts. Others may try in more subtle ways; newspaper and magazine articles may try to persuade us to agree with a certain view.
Try to convince us to do or agree with something, such as spending money or agreeing with a certain belief.
Contain a mixture of fact and opinion.
Emphasise key points by using subheadings, repetition, memorable phrases and emotive language.
Often use a personal style so that the text seems to speak directly to the reader.
Show clear links between points, such as ""if you donate 20 you will be helping a sick animal"" or ""using our deodorant will attract women"".
Stories can also be persuasive as well. A writer may want you to like or dislike a character. The way that they describe a character can persuade you to do either of these. Look at this extract from 'Jane Eyre':
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at the table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye with flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mamma had taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate health'.
How does Charlotte Bront try to persuade, or convince, us that John Reed is an unpleasant character in this paragraph?
She makes him sound unattractive, with his ""dingy and unwholesome skin"" and ""heavy limbs"".
She suggests that he is greedy as he ""gorged himself habitually at the table"". She suggests that this is why he is so unhealthy, so that we don't feel sorry for him.
She makes him sound spoilt because his mother is keeping him home from school, even though his so-called ""delicate health"" is his own fault.

In a scale drawing, all dimensions have been reduced by the same proportion.
A model boat is made to a scale of 1:20 (1 to 20). This scale can be applied to any units, so 1mm measured on the model is 20mm on the actual boat, 1cm measured on the model is 20cm on the actual boat, and so on.
a) If the 1:20 model boat is 15cm wide, how wide is the actual boat?
b) If the boat has a mast of height 4m, how high is the mast on the model?
The scale is 1:20. This means that every cm on the model is equivalent to 20cm on the boat.
a) 1cm on the model = 20cm on the boat, so:
b) 20cm on the boat = 1cm on the model

The scale of a map is 1:50 000. A distance is measured as 3cm on the map.
How many cm, m and km is this equivalent to in real life?
1 cm on the map represents 50 000cm. Therefore, 3cm on the map represents 150 000cm.
To convert from cm to m, divide by 100.
To convert from m to km divide by 1000.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. What distance on the map will represent 5km?
5km = 5000m = 5000  100 cm = 500 000cm
We want to know what distance on the map represents 500 000cm in real life.

Food chains - Toxic materials in the food chain
Toxic materials are poisonous. Some quickly break down into harmless substances in the environment. Others are
and do not break down. Instead, they accumulate in the food chain and damage the organisms in it, especially the top predators.
Mercury compounds were used until quite recently to make
(chemicals that kill the insects that damage crops) and special
that stop barnacles growing on the hulls of ships.
Unfortunately, when it gets into the food chain mercury damages the
of mammals, including humans. The diagram shows how mercury can accumulate in the food chain.
Tiny plankton in the sea absorb the mercury compounds. When the plankton are eaten by small fish, the mercury they contain stays in the fish. As the fish need to eat a lot of plankton, the concentration of mercury in them becomes higher than its concentration in the plankton.
The small fish are eaten by larger fish, and these are eaten by still larger ones, such as tuna fish. This creates a high concentration of mercury in the tuna. People eating contaminated tuna may get mercury poisoning. Mercury is now banned from many chemical products and mercury use in industry is carefully regulated.
DDT is an insecticide that can pass up the food chain from insects to small birds, and then from the small birds to birds of prey, like hawks. It can accumulate in the birds of prey, giving them a large amount of DDT. Concentrations of DDT in birds causes weakness in their eggs, and reduces their population. DDT is now banned because of this.

During the day, the Sun appears to move through the sky. Remember that this happens because the Earth is spinning on its axis. In the UK if we look south and follow the path of Sun in the sky during the day, it looks like this:
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west
. That's because the Earth is spinning towards to the east, so we see the Sun first appear there at the start of the day. The Sun 'rises' in the east and 'sets' in the west.
One way to remember which way the Earth turns is to remember ""
"", which means the Earth spins from west to east.
Star trails made by leaving the camera shutter open during the night
During the night, we cannot see the Sun. But the Earth is still spinning on its axis. This means that the stars appear to move from east to west in the sky, just as the Sun does in the day.

You cannot see a force but often you can see what it does. Forces can change the speed of something, the direction it is moving in or its shape. For example, an elastic band gets longer if you pull it.
A force meter is used to measure forces.
. Force meters contain a spring connected to a metal hook. The spring stretches when a force is applied to the hook. The bigger the force applied, the longer the spring stretches and the bigger the reading.
The unit of force is called the

If you are asked how many days there are in a week, you would find the answer easy - there are 7. How about the number of days in two weeks? Again, the answer is fairly straightforward - there are 14.
What happens when you are asked how many days there are in three weeks, or four or five? If you know the formula you could work this out.
1 week is 1  7 days = 7
2 weeks is 2  7 days = 14

Astronomy and space science - Years and seasons
A planet's year is the time it takes to make
around the Sun. The Earth goes once round the Sun in one Earth year. That's 365 Earth days.
We've seen already that that different planets take different lengths of time to orbit the Sun. That means their years are different lengths. Mercury has a year of just 88 Earth days, and Neptune has a year of 164 Earth years.
The Earth's axis is the imaginary line through the centre of the Earth between the South and North poles. This axis is
slightly compared to the way the Earth orbits the Sun.
We get different seasons (winter, spring, summer and autumn) because the Earth is tilted. This is how it works:
When the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun it is summer in the UK.
When the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun it is winter in the UK.
When it is summer in the northern hemisphere, it is winter in the southern hemisphere.
Because of the tilt of the Earth's axis the Sun moves higher in the sky in summer, when we tilt towards it, than in winter.

Scientists are trying to solve a mystery: Where is Christopher Columbus buried? The Dominican Republic-an island in Central America-also claims to have the remains of this famous explorer.
In 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain and arrived in North America. He made four trips altogether. Before he died in 1506, he asked to be buried on the island that is today the Dominican Republic. It is part of the area he explored on his third and fourth trips.
When Spain lost control of the island, his body was moved. Spanish officials think it was taken to the island of Cuba before possibly being moved back to Spain. However, the Dominican Republic says the Spanish travelers took the wrong remains. By testing the bones, Spanish scientists hope to get to the truth of the matter.

Koalas are pictured everywhere in Australiaon cleaning products, on boxes of chocolate, on sports team jerseys. Yet the animals are found only in isolated pockets up and down the east coast.

Although koalas can walk on the ground, they are better suited for life in the
the high cover of branches and leaves in a forest. Whenever we find one of the furry leaf eaters, we collect information about the trees in the area. We measure how tall and how fat the trees are. Then we put tags on their trunks so we know theyve been recorded.

Yet Ellis wonders whether the koalas on St. Bees could be headed for hard times. The island is overrun with wild goats. Ellis thinks the goats are eating the small blue gum trees.

They spend most of their time in eucalyptus trees.
A koala eats about 2 ? pounds of eucalyptus leaves each day. Koalas eat so many leaves that they often smell like eucalyptus cough drops.
Eucalyptus leaves are not very nutritious. As a result, koalas spend up to 18 hours a day sleeping. That helps them store up energy.
Bill Ellis shakes the branches of a tree where a koala named Yellow rests.

The oath is the only Inauguration Day event required by law. Every president since George Washington has taken the oath. On April 30, 1789, Washington was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City, which was then the country's capital.
In 1801, Thomas Jefferson was the first president to be inaugurated in Washington, D.C. In 1809, the first organized inaugural ball was held in Washington, D.C., for James Madison. In 1817, James Monroe's inauguration was the first to be held entirely outdoors. Over the years, inauguration traditions have evolved from simple events to elaborate ceremonies.
Since George Washington's time, presidents have used inaugural addresses to unite the country and inspire people. Abraham Lincoln gave his second inaugural speech in 1865, not long before the Civil War ended. He used his speech to draw the country together.
Other presidents' inaugural words are still quoted today. When Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural speech in 1933, the United States was at the height of the Great Depression. That was a time when many people were out of work. He brought promise with his words ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.""
When John F. Kennedy took office in 1961, he encouraged people to help their country. His speech challenged Americans: ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.""
What message will President Bush convey? He will likely continue the message expressed in his victory speech. ""A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation,"" he said. ""We have one country, one Constitution, and one future that binds us. And when we come together and work together, there is no limit to the greatness of America.""
George Washington's second inaugural speech, in 1793, was the shortest on record. At only 135 words, it lasted just eight minutes.
In 1841, William Henry Harrison gave the longest inaugural address. At 8,445 words, it lasted almost two hours!
In 1925, Calvin Coolidge's inaugural speech was the first broadcast on the radio.
Harry S. Truman's speech in 1949 was the first to be shown on television.
After Jimmy Carter was sworn in as president in 1977, he became the first president to walk the parade route instead of riding in a car.

472,"Experts hope 2006 will be the year the world is polio-free.
Will polio be declared a disease of the past?
World health groups are fighting a war
with a crippling and sometimes deadly diseasepolio. Their efforts are paying off. Polio has been wiped out in 10 African countries, according to a recent report.
Since mid-2003, nearly 200 children in those 10 western and central African countries were
for life, but no new cases have been reported since last June. When people are paralyzed, they are unable to move different parts of their bodies and may be unable to walk.
The disease raced across Africa and into Asia after people in Nigeria refused the polio
mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think well get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told
She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria.""
Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly
disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havent been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims.
With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world. On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government approved the use of a vaccine that stopped people from getting the disease. Jonas Salk was the doctor who invented the first polio vaccine.
A boy in Africa receives an oral polio vaccine from a WHO (World Health Organization) worker.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world thanks to Salk, it still threatens children in Africa and Asia. Major efforts were recently under way to
or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been
Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door.
To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November.
After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Its uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives.""
Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization.
Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why?
Jonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.
From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Roosevelts death, Salks vaccine was declared officially safe.
In October 2005for the first time in 26 years in the United Statesfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnt at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.

587,"Florida is the 23rd largest state in the United States. Key West is the southernmost part of the continental United States.
Moving slowly and silently through more than a million acres of wetlands in Florida, water is the lifeblood of the Everglades. However, for the past few decades, the Everglades has been losing its lifeblood.
President Bill Clinton plans to sign a new bill into law that may breathe new life into the Everglades. The bill is called the Everglades Restoration Act. The act will help restore parts of the Everglades to the way they were many years ago, say supporters. Critics of the plan say that it does not go far enough to restore the Everglades.
The Everglades is like a shallow, slow-moving river that covers millions of acres. The ""river of grass,"" as the Everglades is called, is 50 miles wide and 120 miles long. It flows from Lake Okeechobee into Florida Bay.
A large part of the river of grass is contained within the Everglades National Park. The park covers about 1.5 million acres (about the size of Delaware). Many plant and animal species, including alligators, panthers, egrets, and manatees live in the park.
An alligator suns itself in the Everglades. Manatees, many kinds of birds, and panthers can be found in these wetlands.
The Everglades Restoration Act will spend about $8 billion to restore the river of grass over the next 30 years. The act will be managed in part by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
One important part of the act calls for the removal of dams, dikes, and flood control gates. The Corps of Engineers began installing many of those devices in 1948 to control the flow of water in the Everglades. Those devices protect towns and farms from flooding and provide
By removing dams and closing canals, the Corps of Engineers will restore the flow of water in the river of grass to the way it was more than 100 years ago. That's when people first began to drain water from the Everglades.
The act will also improve water treatment plants. Those plants clean wastewater coming from farms or towns near the Everglades. The improved plants will allow less water pollution to flow into the Everglades. The Corps of Engineers will also build reservoirs, relocate roads, and shut off drainage canals.
The maps show (1) how water flowed through the Everglades before farms and towns began draining water from the Everglades, (2) how water now flows through the Everglades, and (3) how water may flow when the plan is completed.
Many people, from environmental groups to private citizens, applaud the act. ""This is as major a restoration as one would hope for,"" said Charles Lee, a spokesperson for the Florida Audubon Society.
Critics of the plan, however, say it does not go far enough toward restoring the wetlands. For example, the Everglades once covered 9 million acres, say officials from the Sierra Club, an organization that works to protect the environment. The Corps of Engineers drained much of that land so it could be used as farmland and to build houses. More of that land should be returned to the way it used to be before the 20th century, Sierra Club officials have said.
Whatever disagreements people may have, all agree that the restoration of the Everglades will take a long time and a lot of hard work. Once the act becomes law, said Stuart Applebaum of the Corps of Engineers, it will be time to ""roll up our sleeves [and get to work] for the next 30 years.""

602,"Something to Go Nuts About: New Treatment May Help Kids With Peanut Allergies
Peanuts may seem harmless, but to some kids they mean trouble. About one and a half million Americans are allergic to peanuts. Between 50 and 100 people, mostly kids, die each year from peanut allergies.
For kids with peanut allergies, help may be on the way in the form of a new drug called TNX-901. Monthly shots of TNX-901 are not a cure, but they may save lives. Results suggest that the drug reduces the chance of a serious allergic reaction if peanuts are eaten accidentally.
Eating just the tiniest amount of peanuts can make kids with peanut allergies very sick. For some of those kids, an allergic reaction can occur from just touching or smelling peanuts. Symptoms include stomach pain, hives, and tightness in the throat.
""I get an itchy rash all over my body when I eat peanuts, so I hope the new injection will help,"" said an 11-year-old girl.
It may be years before the treatment is available to the public. More testing needs to be done before the drug is approved. Researcher Donald Leung said the new drug could ""help lift a cloud of fear that people with peanut allergies live under every time they eat."" That is something that kids with peanut allergies won't find nutty.
These eight foods are the cause of most food allergies:
tree nuts (such as walnuts and cashews)
About 7 million Americans have food allergies. People can be allergic to almost any food.
If you are allergic to any food, it is important to read labels carefully. Always ask an adult if you are not sure about what is in your food.

155,"Report Points to Mice As Asthma Cause
17 million Americans suffer from asthma. About 5 million kids suffer from asthma.
Each year, more than 3 million kids visit the doctor's office because of asthma attacks.
When you run hard and play hard, you may have trouble catching your breath. Some kids, however, lose their breath even when they're not running or playing. Those kids have
, a disease that makes it hard to breathe.
For many years, scientists have known that cigarette smoke, dog and cat
, dust mites, and cockroaches can trigger asthma attacks. Dander is tiny bits of fur and skin. Now scientists have added a new culprit to that list--mouse dander.
Scientists studied dust samples from 608 U.S. homes with children ages 4 to 9 who suffered from asthma. The scientists found many things in the dust, including evidence of mice. About 95 percent of the homes had at least one room that had mouse dander.
The scientists then tested the kids in each of the homes to see if mouse dander triggered asthma attacks in them. The dander triggered attacks in 18 out of every 100 kids.
As a result of those tests, Dr. Robert Wood of Johns Hopkins University concluded that mice trigger many asthma attacks. In fact, he said, the ""mouse is second in line [after the cockroach in causing asthma attacks].""
Mouse dander was found in many of the houses, even though not all of them had mice. Sometimes, kids tracked dander from mice and other animals into their homes when they came in from outside. Sometimes, the dander was from mice that had been in the home in the past.
Daniel, who lives in Clarksville, Maryland, suffers from asthma. Last year, scientists collected and studied dust from his home. The scientists found cat dander in the dust, even though his family didn't own a cat. It was cat dander that was triggering Daniel's asthma attacks, said Daniel's doctor.
To keep cat dander out of their home, Daniel and his mother frequently wash the floors, walls, and other surfaces. As a result, Daniel's mother said Daniel hasn't had an asthma attack in the last year.
Many kids who suffer from asthma might be able to breathe more easily if they could find ways to keep the dander of mice, cats, and other kinds of animals out of their homes.

I also plan to spend time in Arkansas putting together my presidential library and launching a new public policy center. I'm sure I'll be very busy, but I also hope to spend more time with my family and friends and to simply relax after what has been eight of the most incredible years of my life.
William Jefferson Blythe IV was born on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas.
In 1962, when Clinton was a senior in high school, he was chosen to go to Washington, D.C., to participate in Boys Nation, a special youth conference. There he met President Kennedy. After that, he said, he knew he wanted to make a difference in the lives of Americans by becoming a U.S. president.
Clinton went to Georgetown University, after which he studied at Oxford University in England. He then went to law school at Yale University.
In 1976, Clinton was elected attorney general of Arkansas. He later was elected governor of Arkansas.
In 1991, Clinton decided to run for president of the United States.

The quake, which was the strongest to hit India in 50 years, left devastation and heartache in its wake. Initially, rescue workers had little hope of finding survivors under rubble from toppled buildings. However, miraculous rescues did occur. For example, a rescue team saved a 4-year-old girl trapped under tons of concrete several days after the quake had struck.
Disaster experts say that the quake caused more than $5 billion in damage. It will take years for the people affected by the disaster to recover from it.

This cousin of the rat is believed to be the largest rodent that ever roamed Earth. Scientists unearthed its skeleton in a dry region of Venezuela. That is a country in South America.
""Imagine a weird guinea pig, but huge, with a long tail for balancing on its hind legs,"" said the lead scientist behind the find.
Nicknamed ""Goya,"" the rodent lived in an area that once was made up of grassy marshes. Along with the giant crocodiles and giant turtles of the time, Goya lived along the banks of a swamp.
There, it used its long teeth to dine on large amounts of grasses. At about 9 feet long and 4 feet tall, the rodent couldn't move very fast. Its hefty size made it very difficult to outrun an attacking animal. A changing climate and threats from other animals might have caused the animal's extinction, say scientists.

Isabel packed winds of up to 100 miles per hour by the time it hit land. The storm walloped the coasts of North Carolina and Virginia and then moved inland.
The hurricane caused massive flooding and damage. More than 4.5 million people lost electricity. At least 40 deaths were blamed on the storm.
Despite the devastation, Isabel could have been worse. Thanks to the work of Hurricane Hunters, weather forecasters accurately predicted the storms path. Many people received warning and fled, or
Hurricane Hunters are a special part of the Air Force. They found out how dangerous Isabel was before it battered the coast. The experienced fliers and scientists gathered information about the size, strength, and path of Isabel.
They sent that information to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Florida. The information led officials to evacuate shoreline areas in North Carolina and Virginia. The federal government in Washington, D.C., also shut down.

of Isabel, crew members experienced a rocky ride. The eye wall is a solid ring of thunderstorms around the eye. The strongest winds and heaviest rains are located here.
The plane contains equipment that records weather. In the eye of the storm, Hurricane Hunters released small tubes attached to parachutes. Each tube was about the size of a can of tennis balls. The tubes sent information about wind speed, power, and moisture back to the crew.
As part of their job, Hurricane Hunters help forecasters rate storms. Hurricanes are rated on a scale of 1 to 5.
A storms rating is based on wind speed and potential for damage. Before hitting land, Isabel was a Category-5 storm. That is the most powerful type.
Satellites in space and other weather instruments are used to measure hurricanes. However, forecasters say that Hurricane Hunters provide the most accurate prediction of the path and strength of a hurricane.
Hurricanes are rated on a scale of 1 to 5. The ratings are based on the storms wind and potential for destruction.

Collectible coins and currency worth about $1 billion were on display at the World's Fair of Money. The fair was held this August in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
During the five-day event, money was displayed for looking at, buying, and selling. Some coins were worth as little as half a cent. Other coins were worth millions.

Among the fair's most valuable coins were two Liberty Head nickels. The nickels were worth between $2 million and $3 million each.
A 1794 coin couldn't be missed at the fair either. Experts say the coin, believed to be the first silver dollar in the United States, is worth about $10 million.
Coin hobbyists point out that just because a coin is old doesn't necessarily mean it's valuable. A coin's worth depends on how many exist, on how many people want it, and on its condition.
Coin collectors are used to paying more for a coin than its original value. They say their hobby is worth every penny.
Each day, the government prints 37 million bills, worth about $696 million.
About 18 tons of ink per day go into printing those bills.

It was very overwhelming. I got to the point where I was winning races, but I wasnt enjoying myself. I would win a race and come away from the day saying thats what I needed to do, rather than enjoy it. I just took a little time off and then went crazy not driving, so I had to come back for myself.

Adkins and Heller have built a new robot that is so small, it can sit on a dime. The tiny robot weighs less than 1 ounce, has tracks like those on a tank, and carries a camera. For power, it uses three button cells (the batteries in watches).
So far, the robot cannot do many tasks. Recently, the robot steered itself through a small maze, but it moved at only 20 inches per minute. ""It can't zip along as fast as a spider or ant yet,"" said Heller.
In the near future, however, Heller plans to make faster and smaller robots. He foresees swarms of miniature robots doing all kinds of tasks. Police officers could send the small robots after crooks, and the bad guys would never know they were being tailed. Repair workers could send worker robots into tight spaces.
Perhaps in the future, swarms of minirobots will do many of the tasks, such as housecleaning, that people do today.

Many adults think that kids spend their money as soon as they get it. That may be true for some young people, but not for 9-year-old twins Gabriel and Dylan Greene.
For the past three years, Gabriel and Dylan have taken part in Save for America. Save for America is a program that teaches kids the importance of saving money. The program also teaches kids
Last year, 750 schools and 90,000 kids took part in Save for America. Combined, those kids saved $1 million. Since the program began 12 years ago, kids have saved nearly $50 million!
One of the schools that takes part in the Save for America program is Setauket Elementary School, Setauket, New York. Every two weeks that school has Banking Day. Nearly 200 kids from the school deposit money on Banking Day, including Gabriel and Dylan.
Each boy deposits about $5 in his bank account on Banking Day. So far, Gabriel has saved $350, and Dylan has saved $340.
The kids who participate in Save for America save money and learn valuable lessons that they will use for the rest of their lives. Dylan explained that he has learned that saving money for the future can help him obtain the things he wants and lead a better life as an adult.
Save for America also helps kids sharpen their math skills. Gabriel said the program has improved his skills, especially in addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
The kids who take part in Save for America can use their money for a variety of things. Gabriel recently withdrew some of his savings to buy a new scooter. However, he's saving most of his money for college.
Dylan also has reasons for saving his money. ""You should save up all the money that you need,"" he said, ""and you should give some of the money [to] the kids in America that need more [food, clothes and other necessities].""

More class time can improve test scores, according to a recent report by the research group Education Sector. As a result, schools are experimenting with tacking on an hour or more to the school day.
Elementary and middle school students at Fletcher-Maynard Academy in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have gone to an eight-hour school day. Fletcher-Maynard Academy is just one of 10 schools in Massachusetts trying out the new schedule. Lawmakers in Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, and Washington, D.C., are also debating extended school hours.
People in favor of longer school days say kids need to learn more to stay competitive in today's world. The additional hours enable teachers to spend more time on each subject. Fletcher-Maynard principal Robin Harris likes having the extra hours. ""Teachers can be a little more creative,"" she told
Students aren't just spending the extra time with their heads in a book, though. Harris explains that her students get longer recesses and more snack time. Parent Dawn Oliver says her 11-year-old daughter, Brittany, is an advice columnist for a magazine at her school in Fall River, Massachusetts. ""The kids get so involved in these things because it's not all book work,"" says Oliver.
Critics argue that extended school days could be too long for today's busy kids. And extra school time might prevent students from exploring other interests. Some students have complained about having to stay later. They are concerned that they wouldn't be able to concentrate during the last classes of the day.
Other people point out that longer school days

""After-school activities would be affected. Nobody wants to be at school from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m."" If schools have different schedules, planning athletic games could prove difficult.

This week Grade 4 looks at where the two major candidates for president stand on
. Both candidates recognize that the world has changed since the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Each candidate has his own plan to make the United States more secure and keep its citizens safe.
President Bush's antiterrorism program has included removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and restoring freedom to the country. He has also worked to stop terrorist groups in Afghanistan.
In October 2001, shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush signed the Patriot Act. The law gives the government more power to investigate suspected terrorists. President Bush believes that the law should be renewed when it comes up for review in 2005.
Bush also created the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 to keep our airports, borders, and ports safe from attacks. He says that he has worked to improve national security at airports through increased screening and advanced equipment.
Senator Kerry promises to continue to track and stop potential terrorists. He voted for both the Patriot Act and the Department of Homeland Security.
Kerry supports the Patriot Act's renewal in 2005 if some changes are made to it. He argues that certain sections of the Patriot Act violate citizens' rights. Some of those parts include allowing the government to wiretap phone conversations and search business and library records.
If elected, Kerry has a plan to protect the country's borders, ports, and airports. He also says that he will work to give police officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel the information and equipment they need to perform their jobs safely and effectively.

The old saying is true-you are what you eat! That's because your health depends on what you put into your body. Here are some nutrients you might find in breakfast foods:
Complex carbohydrates found in foods such as cereal provide your body with energy. Your body stores up the energy and uses it when you need it!
Protein also supplies your body with energy and helps fight infection. Eggs and cheese are good sources of protein.
Vitamins and minerals help the body grow. Milk and other dairy products provide your body with vitamin D and calcium, a mineral that helps build strong teeth and bones. Fruits and vegetables are good sources of vitamins and minerals. You should eat at least five servings of them a day.

Make a breakfast sundae. Top a bowl of yogurt with fresh fruit and granola.
Toast cheese on whole-grain bread. Wash it down with a glass of cold orange juice.
Got milk? Enjoy a cup with a peanut butter and banana sandwich.
Breakfast eaters also have another reason to smile. Eating breakfast in the morning helps keep tooth decay at bay.
A new study found that kids who do not eat breakfast are more likely to have tooth decay than kids who do. Why? Kids who skip breakfast tend to reach for sugary snacks during the day.
Experts say that if you find yourself crunched for time in the morning, don't rule out breakfast. Being creative with your morning routine can help you make time.
You might try planning your outfit the night before or getting up 10 minutes early. Some families even set the breakfast table before going to bed.
Leaving time for breakfast will give you the brainpower you need in school and will keep you going until the lunch bell rings. ""Breakfast really helps to start your engine!"" says Campbell.

Dos Pilas was located south of both cities. Dos Pilas had been founded by the ruler of Tikal as a military outpost. The brother of Tikal's ruler ran the outpost.
At one point in the war, Calakmul took control of Dos Pilas. Calakmul's warriors spared the life of the ruler of Dos Pilas, so he changed sides. He attacked and defeated his brother in Tikal.
""This was not part of a struggle between two brothers, but part of a world war,"" said historian Arthur A. Demarest.
After Dos Pilas defeated Tikal, the brutal war between Tikal and Calakmul got worse. Eventually Tikal regained its former strength and ""roared back and crushed Calakmul,"" Demarest said.
The fighting between the two cities continued for years. The constant warfare weakened both cities.
The war also weakened the Maya civilization, which began to crumble. Today, only ruins of ancient buildings remain as evidence that the Maya once ruled the area.

As if grades weren't enough to worry about, some students now have weight on their minds too. The number of overweight children in the United States has more than doubled in the past 20 years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Being
or severely overweight, can lead to health problems later in life.
As a result, schools in several states, from California to Pennsylvania, have started sending home ""BMI report cards."" Those schools send home a report of a student's
BMI is a calculation of weight and height that tells whether a person is overweight for his or her age.
Should schools send home BMI reports? People on both sides of the debate are weighing in.
Some lawmakers say BMI reports alert parents to their children's health and help combat obesity. In 2003, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee helped launch the first program to report students' BMIs. Obesity rates in that state have since stopped increasing. Pediatrician Joe Thompson helped plan the BMI program for Arkansas schools. He explains that the reports in Arkansas are sent home separately from report cards. ""The misconception is students are being graded on their weight,"" he told
""Just like a school screens for vision or hearing, this is a health approach to raise awareness about a risk.""
Not everyone thinks that reporting students' BMIs is a good idea. Parents have complained that the reports damage their children's self-esteem. Some parents say kids also worry that they are being ""graded"" on their weight. Opponents of BMI reports argue that schools that label students overweight are acting unfairly. The critics point out that many school cafeterias serve fatty foods. Parent Brett Levy from Chicago, Illinois, believes that schools should teach kids to lead healthy lifestyles instead of reporting their BMIs. ""Telling a boy or girl [a] BMI is not education,"" he told
Schools should issue BMI reports for students.

""I never got used to these 4- or 5-foot crevasses that are hundreds of feet deep,"" said Weihenmayer. ""You had to jump across them. You have to be very careful when you land.""
For most climbers, jumping over a crevasse is hard enough. But for Weihenmayer, jumping over the cracks was particularly hard because he is blind.
Last spring, Erik Weihenmayer became the first blind climber to reach the peak of Mount Everest. He was part of a team of climbers that was sponsored by the National Federation of the Blind.
Mount Everest is 29,035 feet tall and sits on the border between Nepal and China, two countries in Asia. According to many climbers, Mount Everest is one of the hardest and deadliest mountains in the world to climb because of the mountain's height.
""There are a lot of things that can happen up there. You're not ever really sure that you're going to make it,"" Weihenmayer told
. Climbers can suffer from illnesses caused by many things, including the altitude.
sickness occurs when a climber does not get enough oxygen.
The team took more than two months to complete the climb. Weihenmayer spent much of his time moving the team's supplies up the mountain to a base camp, which was located at 17,600 feet. The time spent moving gear helped Erik Weihenmayer get used to the altitude. ""You're letting your body get used to the elevation, the air, the temperature,"" Weihenmayer said.
Weihenmayer, who had already climbed several of the world's highest peaks, had help getting up Mount Everest. ""[People] would walk ahead of me with a bell,"" he said. ""I tried to stay in their footsteps. I tried to stay [close] behind them so I could hear their steps, and I stepped into those places.""
For Weihenmayer, climbing Mount Everest was the toughest but most rewarding experience of his life. When he got to the top, Weihenmayer stopped to think about what he had done.
""I thought about the ground underneath me. I felt these cool flags [at the peak] that were up there in the breeze,"" Weihenmayer said. ""I thought about my family, friends, and about where I was.""

Weekly Reader sat down with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice the day after Iraq announced its draft constitution. Weeks later, Iraqis voted to approve the constitution. Earlier this year, Rice became the first African American woman secretary of state. She is the highest-ranking member of President George W. Bushs Cabinet, or group of close advisers. As secretary of state, Rice advises the president on foreign affairs and works with world leaders on important issues. WR talked to her about Iraq and her job as head of the State Department.
WR: When Iraq announced its draft constitution yesterday, what role did the State Department play?
We were following the Iraqi constitution very closely. It started with a phone call to our ambassador in Baghdad, and then I talked to [President Bush] about what was going on. I probably was on the phone to Baghdad yesterday six or seven times just following what was going on and seeing if there was anything that we could do back here.
WR: Some people say its a mistake to try to build a democracy in Iraq. How do you respond to critics?
I say shame on anybody who says that people ought to live in
. [That is a type of government ruled by someone unjustly. Rice is referring to Iraqi life under former ruler Saddam Hussein.] When are we going to learn that human beings want to be free? And its not as if theres a choice in between. You either are free or youre not. And the people of Iraq are now free.
WR: Youve traveled more than any other secretary of state in your first six months in office. Did a particular experience stand out for you?
I went to Phuket in Thailand, where the tsunami had taken place. And there were all of these American college students there helping out in the schools. And it reminded me whats really great about Americans.
WR: What is a typical day like for you?
I usually get up about 4:30, and I exercise first. I get into the office about 6:30. I read the newspaper before I leave home, but [my staff] prepares for me reports from around the world. International politics is a 24-hour schedule, because while were asleep, the rest of the world is awake. ... My day [may include] meeting with foreign ministers. I go over to the White House for meetings at least three or four times a week. I talk to the president pretty much every day.
WR: Youve repeatedly said that you dont want to run for president in 2008. Why dont you want the nations top job?
(laughs) I do have a lot of respect for people who run for office. But I think you have to have a kind of fire to want to do that, and I justI dont.

A kid reporter journeyed to Mars aboard Disney's new space ride. Find out how close her ride was to the real thing.
kid reporter Sonia Mia Diaz blasted into space on August 22. This 10-year-old from Florida was on a journey to Mars.
Sonia Mia rocketed to Mars aboard a new ride called Mission: SPACE. She experienced the ride during its opening week at Walt Disney World's Epcot Center in Orlando, Florida.
After her mission, Sonia Mia interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the ride's creators. Sonia Mia learned that Disney worked closely with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to develop the new space attraction. The ride lets people experience what a trip to Mars might be like in the future.
On her journey, Sonia Mia never actually left the ground. The ride gives people the feeling of blasting off and traveling through space. ""We really wanted people to feel as close as they could to what it's like to be an astronaut,"" said Bryan.
Sonia Mia read quotes about space exploration as she waited in line. Information about space history fills the attraction. There is even a moon car called a lunar rover on loan from a museum.
Before boarding the shuttle, Sonia Mia and three other riders were given different roles for the mission. Those roles included commander, pilot, navigator, and engineer.
Sonia Mia was assigned to be the engineer. In real life, Sally Ride, the first U.S. woman in space, performed the same role.
After Sonia Mia strapped herself in, the shuttle moved into launch position. The countdown began, and the shuttle blasted off! During the mission, Sonia Mia and her team used buttons and joysticks to perform the tasks associated with their roles. The ride lasted about 4 minutes.
The mission was as intense as Sonia Mia had hoped. What was her favorite part? The liftoff! ""I liked the intensity of the blastoff and the air pressure on my face,"" she said.
So how did the ride live up to a real space shuttle mission? Weekly Reader caught up with NASA astronaut Winston Scott to ask him that question.
Scott launched into space on two shuttle flights. He tested out Mission: SPACE and gave it a big thumbs up. ""It's a thrill a minute,"" he said.
Although no astronauts have been to Mars yet, Scott said the ride's liftoff was realistic. The feeling of moving up the launch pad and being forced back into your seat were similar to those felt on a shuttle.
However, he points out, there are differences. In an actual launch, astronauts feel about three times the force of
. Gravity is the force that pulls things toward Earth.
The blastoff on the ride was also shorter than an actual liftoff. And, he said, riders don't experience weightlessness. On a real space shuttle, astronauts become weightless because there is no gravity.
For many people, the ride brings to mind the courage of space explorers. As Sonia Mia pointed out, ""Going on the ride made me think about how brave astronauts are.""
Sonia Mia Diaz interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the forces behind Mission: SPACE. Here's what Sonia Mia learned.
Imagineers are people who work for Disney.
In general, Imagineering is about storytelling. We build attractions that put people who visit our parks into different worlds and stories. We also use technology to tell stories.
What was your role in creating the ride?
I'm the senior show producer, which is like being a movie director. A movie director guides people and directs the show, including the lighting, music, artists, and motion you experience on the ride.
Where did your team get the inspiration for Mission: SPACE?
People have always had an interest in space. The time and technology were right to create this new space attraction. We worked closely with NASA to develop the science and technology behind the attraction. No one has ever put people into a ride system like this before.
Before the ride, I was warned not to move my head or close my eyes because of motion sickness. I didn't feel sick, but might a person if he or she does those things?
That could happen if you move your head, because of the technology used to create the ride. We give those recommendations because we want people to feel most comfortable. Some people can move their heads, and it doesn't bother them at all.
How many times have you been on Mission: SPACE?
At last count, I've ridden it more than 400 times!

A year after the devastating tsunami that hit southern Asia, rebuilding efforts continue in full force.
Each day, 10-year-old Sarjm walks through the hot sand and past
the rubble where homes used to stand. He can see and even taste the ocean. The ocean used to make him happy. It provided fishermen like his father a way of making a living.
But on December 26, 2004, the ocean turned black and changed his village. It left behind destruction and fear. A memorial outside his school is a constant reminder of the 49 schoolchildren who lost their lives in the tsunami that struck on that date.
Debris of beach resorts washed away in the December 26 Indian Ocean tsunami at Khao Lak, Thailand, seen December 30.
The young boy talks about how his older brother and younger sister were both ""taken by the black wave."" Clapping his hands together, he told
Sadly, it is a story shared by thousands of other children. Sarjm lives in Kottapalli, a fishing village located at the southernmost tip of India. India was one of 12 countries devastated by last years tsunamione of the worst natural disasters in history. The series of gigantic waves, which resulted from an undersea earthquake, flattened coastlines and reduced fishing villages to rubble. More than 280,000 people died.
Now, one year later, many people are still homeless. But slowly, smiles are returning, and laughter once again rings through some of the fishing villages. Relief agencies have been working to help rebuild homes, schools, and lives with donations from people around the world.
Some of those donations came from American students who
or came together, to raise money to help people affected by the tsunami. From schools in small towns to those in big cities, students held bake-a-thons, participated in read-a-thons, and even sold their own belongings at garage sales. The pennies, quarters, and dollars are helping rebuild homes and bringing hope to children whose hearts and lives were shattered.
Nine-year-old Selso, who lives in a fishing village near Sarjms village, was one of those children. Before the tsunami destroyed his home, Selso, his sister, and his three brothers had never had a toilet or electricity in their house. Their house had only two rooms, and at night they all slept together on the dirt floor. ""We knew people who died, but my family was lucky,"" Selso told Weekly Reader. ""We only lost our home.""
Selsos mother used to worry about scorpions and snakes getting inside, but now all that has changed. Volunteers from Habitat for Humanity worked with Selsos family to construct a new home with electricity and plumbing. Habitat for Humanity volunteers build homes with families who have suffered. The organization plans to build 10,000 homes in the area during the next two years. ""This is the happiest day for my family,"" says Selsos dad, Michel. ""My children now have a safe, dry home where they can do their homework.""
With the help of relief agencies, some schools have also opened. Many are housed in temporary locations under thatched roofs. Classrooms are also beginning to receive textbooks and other much-needed supplies.
""When a school opens in a disaster zone, everyone feels a sense of hope,"" said Carol Bellamy, the executive director of the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), after the disaster. The U.S. Agency for International Development is another organization that has helped build playgrounds where children can enjoy new equipment.
As rebuilding efforts continue, many children remain terrified of the ocean. Volunteers have worked with Sarjm and other kids to talk about what happened. ""I was afraid to go back to the ocean,"" Sarjm says, ""but we were taught that the tsunami was very rare and would not happen again. I am not afraid to look at the water anymore.""
Why is it important to feel safe? What makes you feel safe at home? at school?
After the tsunami, countries in southern Asia began to put together a plan for a warning system in the Indian Ocean. Earlier this year, the U.S. government also announced a plan to improve the U.S. warning system by 2007. Under the plan, the number of devices that monitor waves from a tsunami will be increased. The warning system would provide an alert for U.S. coasts ""within minutes, and in some cases, within seconds of a tsunamis formation,"" according to scientist John Marburger.

Shaw, who is blind, said he felt like Cuddles from a television program. Shaw and his wife contacted the Guide Horse foundation in Kittrell, North Carolina. ""Horses make excellent guides,"" said trainer Janet Burleson. ""It is very common in the wild state for a blind horse to bond to a sighted horse that it uses as it' guide.""
Guide horses are usually between 26 and 27 inches tall and weigh between 80 and 100 pounds-about the same size as many guide dogs. However, not just any small horse can be a guide horse, says Burleson. It needs to have the right personality and intelligence level. Like a guide dog, Cuddles has been house trained. She will tap her hoof on the door when she needs to go outside. Unlike guide dog, however, she doesn't sleep in the house. Instead, she sleeps in a small barn.
Shaw says that everyone wants to pet Cuddles because the tiny horse is so cute. But people should not pet Cuddles or any other service animal. Petting can distract a guide animal from its job of keeping a blind person safe. Cuddles and Shaw have traveled many places together, including the Empire State Building in New York City. ""Every time I hear the gasps of amazement from an onlooker who has just realized that Cuddles is not a guide dog, I smile Shaw says.

At her home, Griswold cares for bats that are sick, injured, or orphaned. She has taken care of bats with injuries, such as a broken wing, as well as babies that have lost their mothers.
She has also cared for bats that were stranded in the winter because they had forgotten to travel south during the colder months. With the help of a
, or animal doctor, Griswold helps nurse the winged mammals back to health. Then she sets them free.
But Griswold is no stranger to bats. She grew up on a farm where they were a common sight. So it was no surprise how quickly she took to an orphaned baby bat she found squeaking on the ground outside her house ten years ago. She took the bat in and fed it milk from a goat on her farm.
To her delight, the little creature survived the night. Today, the bat--which she named Poppy--still lives with her. She did not release Poppy back into the wild because it identifies more with humans than with bats.
This bat lady, however, doesnt keep Poppy all to herself. Poppy is one of the winged creatures that Griswold brings with her on school visits. In fact, this Halloween she is speaking at a Connecticut school. Griswold, who teaches kids about bats, is on a mission to change their reputation.
. Many people, she says, are afraid of bats, but theyre actually gentle, shy creatures that are important to the environment.
Bats pollinate plants, spread seeds, and, most important, eat insects. ""There is no animal worldwide that eats more bugs at night than bats do,"" said Griswold, who is full of bat trivia.
However, the number of bats worldwide is in serious decline. They often lose their homes when people cut down trees.
But Griswolds message seems to be spreading. After she spoke to a Brownie troop, the members built bat houses in their town. The project turned into a community effort. ""The kids are making such a huge difference,"" she said.
There are almost a thousand species of bats worldwide. Bats come in different colors, shapes, and sizes. Some have huge ears and unusual faces. In fact, a bats face can teach you about its habits. Read on about some of these creatures.
Vampire bats can be found in Mexico, Central America, and South America. They drink blood, but its usually from cattle and horses--not people. A heat sensor on its nose helps it find blood close to the surface of its victims skin.
Egyptian fruit bats live mainly in Asia and Africa. They eat fruit and nectar. Their long noses help them locate ripe fruit. Fruit bats use their sharp teeth to chew fruit.

(par-ah-PLEE-jik) who climbed to the top of Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest peak, in early September.
The 22-year-old man from Alaska lost the use of his legs seven years ago in a car accident. He is believed to be the first paraplegic to climb Mount Fuji.
""I want to show people what I am able to do,"" Reilly said from the top of Mount Fuji. ""Maybe it will inspire them.""
How exactly did he make his climb? Reilly used a special bike that he powered with his arms. Reilly traveled with a support team of eight people and reached the
, or peak, of the mountain within four days. The climb normally takes about six hours.
Reilly's journey, however, was not without obstacles. His team was stopped by a park ranger who said mountain bikes weren't allowed on the trail. They managed to persuade the park ranger to allow them to continue their journey. Although Reilly's bike was built to climb rocks, the trail was covered with volcanic ash and gravel, making for a difficult ride.
What does Reilly teach people about overcoming challenges to reach their goals?
Mount Fuji is one of the most-climbed peaks in the world. Reilly chose the mountain because he wanted to pick one outside the United States. Since losing the use of his legs, Reilly has also climbed peaks in Colorado and California.
Now that he has accomplished his goal, he has already set his sights even higher. He hopes to climb Mount Rainier in Alaska and the tallest peak in South America. ""I hope to climb one mountain every year,"" he said.

The bears are back after being on the brink of extinction in and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is located in the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana.
Now the U.S. government may remove the grizzly from its list of endangered species in this area. ""The future of the Yellowstone grizzly bears is bright,"" says Chris Servheen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
That wasnt always the case. The numbers of grizzlies began to shrink in the early 1900s largely because ranchers hunted the animals and farmers destroyed their
By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears still lived in the Yellowstone area. That year, the grizzly was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which offers special protection to animals facing extinction. Today, wildlife experts estimate that more than 600 bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone.
Grizzly bears live in other parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as well as Washington state and will remain on the list in those areas. Grizzlies in Alaska, which number about 30,000, have never been on the list because that population is healthy.
Its Not Time Yet Not everyone thinks its a good decision to remove grizzlies from the list. Some wildlife officials fear that if the bear is removed from the list, its habitat around Yellowstone could be used for logging, oil drilling, and development. Others worry that the bears will be hunted again. ""We would love to see the grizzly bear delisted, but its not ready,"" says wildlife supporter Louisa Wilcox. ""If you want to protect bears for future generations, you have to protect the habitat they need. This plan doesnt do it.""
Should grizzlies no longer be listed as an endangered species? Why or why not?
The grizzlys return isnt the only species success story. Take a look at some other animals that are being saved, thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists.
In 1963, only 417 pairs of bald eagles nested in the United States. There are now more than 6,400 pairs, and the national symbol may soon be removed from the list of endangered species.
Hawaiians used to hunt this reptile for dinner. Now they swim alongside the turtles near some islands. The number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400 a year. There were only 67 in 1973.
Pollution and habitat loss have made it hard for sea otters to stay afloat. In 1938, there were only several hundred otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500.

Tortoises and other unique wildlife are safe after a volcano erupts on the Galpagos Islands.
RED ALERT Sierra Negra erupts on the Galpagos Islands for the first time in 26 years.
The Galpagos Islands are home to wildlife found nowhere else on Earth. Here, the islands famous giant tortoises and other unique wildlife roam freely. People were worried that those wildlife were harmed after a volcano on Isabela, the largest of the Galpagos Islands, erupted.
The nearly mile-high volcano, called Sierra Negra, sent three scorching rivers of

According to Dr. Harned, it's important to wash the wound first. Then, apply an antibiotic ointment and cover the cut with a bandage. Leaving a cut uncovered can allow germs to infect it.
: Eating carrots will improve your eyesight.
: Carrots are rich in vitamin A, which helps keep your eyes healthy. According to eye expert Dr. Timothy Wingert, ""Eating carrots will not improve your eyesight. But eating carrots is part of a well-balanced diet. Carrots have nutrients that help your eyes to function properly."" Carrots also make a tasty snack.
: You can hurt your eyes by sitting too close to the TV.

""Generally, it is more comfortable on your eyes to view the television from at least 5 feet from the screen,"" he says. So, back up from that television or, better yet, turn it off!

218,"Technology brings past U.S. leaders into the present.
George Washington and Abraham Lincoln are taking a step out of the history books. Two new presidential museums are using the cutting edge of technology to tell the stories of past U.S. presidents.
A group of students from nearby Rockledge Elementary School recently took a trip to Washington's home in Mount Vernon, Virginia. There, they saw a lifelike statue of Washington mounted on his horse during the Revolutionary War (17751783). The statue is an exhibit in a new museum at Mount Vernon.
""It was cool!"" 10-year-old Jack Eghtessad from Woodbridge, Virginia, told
describing the statue. ""It didn't look fake.""
At the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, students from the city's Iles Elementary School gasped. Lincoln's ghost appeared before them in the museum's library. ""I felt like I was really seeing Lincoln,"" exclaimed Samantha Mackey, 11.
or changing, the way kids learn about presidents. Recently, historians have started using more special effects to tell the stories of famous leaders. The new Mount Vernon museum has been open for only four months, but already it has drawn more than 90,000 visitors. February 19 will be the first Presidents' Day it is open.
Experts used paintings, historical documents, and the latest digital technology to create three statues of Washington for Mount Vernon. One of the statues shows Washington at age 19. Another statue depicts him at age 45, leading the Continental Army in the fight for
or freedom, against the British. The third shows him at 57, when he became the first U.S. president. (See
The museum is also home to a special-effects theater that plays a
or true-to-life movie, about Washington's life. As the film plays, the theater's seats rumble with the cannon fire of major battles. Fake snow even falls from the ceiling as the film shows Washington crossing the Delaware River in a surprise attack on the British military in 1776.
""We are, in a way, definitely on the cutting edge,"" says Ann Bay, the Mount Vernon museum's educational director. ""We were inspired by the Lincoln museum.""
Springfield's Lincoln museum reopened with new special-effects exhibits in 2005. Since then the museum has averaged more than 12,000 visitors a week. Visitors can see a life-size re-creation of Lincoln and his family, use interactive computer stations, and tour the ""ghost library.""
make it look as if ghosts of Lincoln and other historical figures appear in the room. Lincoln historian Thomas Schwartz told
that the special effects draw students into Lincoln's story. In one exhibit, visitors watch as an electronic ticker counts the more than 618,000 Americans who were killed while Lincoln was president during the Civil War (18611865). They see Lincoln's sad reaction to the huge death toll.
""These are real people that had real tragedy, real joy, and real emotion in their lives. People need to understand that,"" Schwartz says. He thinks that special effects help get that point across to visitors.
This life-size model of Washington at age 19 gives visitors a glimpse of the first U.S. president in his youth. Washington was born into a wealthy Virginia family. His first job was mapping out land. He then joined the British army and fought in the French and Indian War (17541763). During the Revolutionary War (17751783), he led the Continental Army against the British to win American independence. In 1789, he was elected the first president of the United States.
Unlike Washington, Lincoln did not have enough money to pay for school. This wax statue shows Lincoln teaching himself by reading between chores. He went on to become a successful lawyer, and in 1860 he was elected the 16th U.S. president. He led the country during the Civil War (18611865) between the states in the North and the South. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation ended slavery in 1863. He was killed in office shortly after the war ended.
In what ways might special effects help students learn history?

Today, ancient Assur is in ruins. Desert sand has covered over much of the 3,500-year-old city. Now Assur faces a new threat: water.
Assur is located in what is now Iraq, a country in the Middle East. Many parts of Iraq are covered by desert. Water is hard to find in the desert areas. To increase the amount of water, Iraqi officials are building a dam on the river Tigris.
The dam will trap the river's water. As the water rises, it might flood Assur and many other nearby ancient ruins.
Scientists worry that floodwaters will destroy artifacts hidden beneath the desert sand. Assur has already been the site of some amazing discoveries.
Scientists recently discovered four hidden tombs at Assur. They found ancient coffins, gold, jewelry, and gems. They also dug up the remains of two ancient Assurian queens.
Scientists used modern medical equipment to study the queens' bodies. They learned about some of the medical problems the ancient queens suffered from. The bodies showed evidence of dental cavities, sinus infections, and poor nutrition.
Michael Mller-Karpe, a scientist who studies ancient Assyria, said, ""The Assyrian queens have just begun to speak to us, and we are looking forward to more answers.""
Mller-Karpe and other scientists worry that the new dam may keep them from getting more answers. Even if the new dam doesn't flood Assur, the rising water could damage the ancient city. Moisture could cause the artifacts to crumble.
""You can't save Assur if it's [near] a dam,"" said scientist Peter Miglus. The soil beneath the ancient city would soak up water like a sponge. The water in the soil would destroy what's left of ancient Assur.
For now, scientists are scrambling to uncover the secrets hidden for centuries in Assur and other nearby communities. Meanwhile, some people are looking for ways to save the ancient cities. ""We don't want the slightest damage to Assur,"" one Iraqi official said.

fires. Because smoke jumpers leap into out-of-the-way areas, they carry enough food and water with them to survive for several days.
Although wildfires can be very dangerous, they are not all bad. In areas where few people live, officials monitor the wildfires. Sometimes, officials allow them to burn because the fires help the environment and keep forests healthy. ""If fires are going to spread to people's homes and property, we have to put them out,"" smoke jumper Lori Messenger told
Wildfires are like nature's housekeeperand forests come back to life after fires. ""Fire is a natural part of our forests,"" says Messenger. ""The fires kill the less healthy, diseased trees. They clean out the brush to make space for animals to graze on the new grass that grows.""
Some plants also need heat from a fire to help them release their seeds, which grow into new plants after a fire. Fire is nature's way of recycling dead plants into the soil. The dead plants help return nutrients to the soil.
Although some animals die, many creatures have ways of protecting themselves. Large animals, such as deer, moose, and buffalo, head to safety. Small animals, such as snakes, toads, and mice, burrow in the ground.
""It's important to realize that fires are an important part of what happens in a forest,"" says Messenger. ""It's a complicated balance, and people who manage the forest have to make good decisions about what fires will be fought and what fires will be left to burn.""

Fifth graders at Carolina International School (CIS) have a goal this Earth Dayto throw away as little trash as possible during lunch. To get their message across, students will encourage their peers to recycle. ""I celebrate Earth Day every day,"" Nirvanna Madho, 10, told
. ""I really don't throw anything away.""
Participating in a zero-waste lunch is just one of many ways students at the school in Harrisburg, North Carolina, work to better the environment. Each April, the school organizes an Earth Day event. Students rotate through stations set up across the school's 36-acre campus, which includes forests and

This year, Earth Day at CIS kicks off a season of change. The school is preparing to go ""green"" with a major construction project, set to begin early next year. Being green means protecting the world and its resources. The school's Earthfriendly makeover will include outdoor

CIS is just one of hundreds of schools in the United States that are going green. A
is built with recycled and environmentally friendly materials. Green schools are designed to use less energy than traditional school buildings.
The majority of the energy supply in the United States comes from the burning of
such as oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels were formed from the remains of prehistoric animals and plants. People use fossil fuels when they drive their cars, heat their homes, and power farms, factories, and cities.
Though people depend on fossil fuels, those energy sources have their drawbacks. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air and releases gases that contribute to global warmingthe gradual rise in Earth's average temperature.
Hoover Dam generates clean energy by using water to spin turbines.
Fossil fuels are gradually being used up. To conserve them, scientists are looking to
sources. Renewable energy is power from sources that can't be used up and do not pollute the environment. Water, wind, and solar power are types of renewable energy.
President George W. Bush announced an energy plan that calls on lawmakers to ensure that ecofriendly fuels are developed and made easily available to Americans. Gas is a fossil fuel used in cars, and the price to fill up a gas tank is rising. Gas costs about $3 a gallon in some parts of the United States.
At CIS, students are excited for construction to begin on their new school building. ""I think the school is going to be a lot better,"" Drew Barsody, 10, told
""I'm looking forward to seeing the solar panels.""
These wind turbines convert wind into electricity.
Here are some common environmentally friendly energy alternatives.
Solar Power: Solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat and electricity. California and Arizona are two states that use solar power. One drawback of solar power is that energy can't be collected if the sun isn't shining.
Energy produced from windmills is used to generate electricity. The amount of electricity generated from wind has been growing in recent years, tripling since 1998 in the United States. Electricity is produced from wind in 30 states, including California, Texas, and Iowa.
is one of the oldest sources of energy. Hydropower often comes from dams or waterfalls. Of all renewable energy sources, it is most often used to generate electricity. In 2004, it accounted for 7 percent of all the electricity generated in the United States.
Ethanol is a clean-burning fuel that can power cars. It is created from several sources, such as corn crops. Typically, a small amount of ethanol is combined with gasoline to fuel vehicles. That helps decrease the fuel's cost and harmful emissions.
Turning off the lights when you leave a room is one way to conserve energy. What are some other ways to save energy?

John Lloyd Wright, son of the famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright, invented Lincoln Logs in 1916. He came up with the idea during a trip to Japan with his dad, who was designing an earthquake-proof building.
Arthur Melin and Richard Knerr invented the Hula Hoop in 1958. They got the idea from a friend who saw schoolchildren in Australia twirling bamboo hoops around their waists for exercise.
Do you know Barbie's full name? Barbara Millicent Roberts was created in 1959. Today, three Barbie dolls are sold around the world every second.
Slinky was invented by accident. In the early 1940s, a spring fell off the desk of Richard James, a marine engineer. It tumbled end over end across the floor.
It hit toy store shelves in 1948, and the rest is history.
The first battery-powered train was created in 1900 by Joshua Lionel Cowen not as a toy but as a window display to get New Yorkers into his store. More shoppers were interested in the Lionel train than the other products in the window. Since then more than 50 million Lionel train sets have been sold.
In 1949, Ole Kirk Christiansen invented plastic LEGO bricks in Denmark. Since then more than 206 billion have been made. LEGO comes from the Danish
In 1964, G.I. Joe became the world's first action figure. Today, two out of every three American boys own a G.I. Joe action figure.
Crayola crayons turn 100 this year! In 1903, Edwin Binney and C. Harold Smith made the first box of Crayola crayons. Each day, 12 million crayons are made. By age 10, the average child will have worn down 730 crayons.
Mr. Potato Head was invented in 1952 and celebrated his 50th birthday in 2002. He was the first toy to be advertised on television. In 1987, he was honored at a White House ceremony when he turned his pipe over to the U.S. Surgeon General.
Sculptor Xavier Roberts first showcased Cabbage Patch Kids as part of an art exhibit. The Cabbage Patch Kids became the most successful dolls in history, with more than 3 million sold in 1983, their first year on the market.

Brandon and millions of other kids have come together to help the victims of the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. Those kids have been offering comfort to one another; collecting clothes, food, water, and other supplies to send to rescue workers; and raising money to help the victims' families.
As kids have reached out to help others, they've learned about what their country stands for. English teacher Nan Bartow of New Haven, Connecticut, has been teaching for more than 30 years. She said, ""Kids are more patriotic than ever before.""
Many other teachers agree with Bartow. ""The students are saying, 'We are proud to be Americans' and that they appreciate everything they have,"" said Cynthia Elwood, a principal in Arlington, Texas.
Kids have shown their appreciation by sharing what they have. Here are some of the things they have done:
In Georgia, Parker Pratt, age 10, and Mac Conway, age 9, opened a lemonade stand and collected about $60 for charity.
Teachers and students at the Academy Hill School in Wilton, Maine, declared Friday, September 21, Red, White, and Blue Day. Everyone at the school wore the colors of the American flag to school that day.
In Stow, Ohio, 7-year-old Alexa came up with an idea that enabled her class to raise $113. ""I saw people who were crying because they didn't have houses or anything and they lost their sisters and brothers,"" she said.
In Oklahoma, kids and their parents collected more than 40,000 teddy bears to give kids in 350 schools in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.
""It is especially hard for children to understand what has happened, but they know how to show love,"" said Sue Hale, who helped coordinate the donations. Many kids wrote and attached special notes to the bears they donated. They said the bears and notes would help give thousands of kids hope for a bright future.
If you are looking to help the victims and families of the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. you might contact the following organizations. Each of these organizations has a long history of helping disaster victims.

To learn about elephant seals, go to
Until recently, however, those beaches were quieter because elephant seals were almost extinct. But in the last few years, the seals have made one of the most amazing comebacks of any animal.
Nearly a century ago, only 100 elephant seals were left in the wild. Hunters had killed the animals for their
, or fat, which was used to make lamp oil to light people's homes. In addition, their skins were often used for clothing.
In 1972, the U.S. government passed a law protecting elephant seals. Now, because of that law, more than 150,000 of the seals live in the wild.
Elephant seals spend much of the year swimming in the Pacific Ocean, far from shore. The seals are looking for food, such as fish and squid. They can swim about 35 miles from shore and dive as deep as 5,000 feet below the ocean surface to search for food. (That's about as deep as a whale can dive!)
By December, elephant seals head for beaches in California and Mexico. They hit the beaches to mate and raise their young. When male elephant seals, called
, haul themselves out of the water, they can weigh as much as 4,500 pounds, or two small cars.
Ao Nuevo is Spanish for ""New Year.""
The world's largest colony of elephant seals spends the winter at the Ao Nuevo State Reserve in California. As many as 5,000 elephant seals spend the winter there. Visitors to the reserve can see the giant seals. One visitor said the animals are ""a cross between a beanbag and a Volkswagen bug.""
However, visitors have to watch out for the giant animals. Seals may look fat and slow, but they anger quickly and can move 20 feet in two seconds.
Some visitors are scientists who want to figure out ways to help seals survive.
One way scientists have learned about elephant seals is by attaching radios to the backs of the animals. The radios send out signals. The radios have helped scientists learn how far and how deep elephant seals swim.

Scientists say a hole has formed in the ozone layer above the South Pole every July for at least 15 years. Each year, the hole grows, reaching its largest size in September and October. The hole then shrinks and finally disappears in November and December.
This year, the hole was larger than ever. It covered an area of more than 11 million square miles. That's much larger than the combined areas of Antarctica and Australia!
The hole was so large that, for the first time ever, the health of thousands of people who live in southern South America was threatened.

Each year, about 6,000 U.S. kids under age 14 are killed in accidents, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Another 120,000 kids each year are permanently disabled in accidents.
The graph shows the number of kids ages 5 to 14 who were treated in emergency rooms in 1999 for injuries suffered while doing these four activities.
""Summer is the most dangerous time of the year for kids,"" said Dr. C. Everett Koop, who is head of the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Koop added, ""The good news is that families can take simple steps to ensure their kids stay out of emergency rooms.""
The 2001 campaign is paying special attention to scooter-related injuries. Because more kids are riding scooters, doctors expect a rise in scooter accidents.
In 2000, more than 30,000 people went to emergency rooms for scooter-related injuries, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said. Most of those injured were kids age 14 or younger.
Because many scooter accidents result in head injuries, some cities and states have passed helmet laws. The New York City passed a law requiring scooter riders under age 14 to wear helmets. Fourth graders from Connecticut, asked their state government to pass a similar law.
Scooter accidents may be on the rise, but bicycles account for more injuries than scooters or any other product except cars, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign.
In 1999, 340,000 kids age 5 to 14 were treated in hospital emergency rooms for bicycle-related injuries, SAFE KIDS reported. The most common bicycle-related injuries are injuries to the head.
The best way for kids to protect their heads while riding bikes is by wearing helmets. But the National SAFE KIDS Campaign says only 15 percent to 25 percent of kids who ride bikes wear helmets while riding.

A recent study shows that how kids answer those questions tells a lot about whether they are headed for trouble. The study says kids who spend their free time aimlessly often get into trouble.
The study, called the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, was funded by the federal government. More than 90,000 kids between the ages of 12 and 18 took part in the study. Those kids attended 134 different U.S. schools. The study followed them from 1994 to 2000.
About half of the kids in the study said they were not involved in dangerous activities. But 25 percent said they had tried a cigarette, 26 percent said they had picked up a gun, and 47 percent said they had tried alcohol.
The study found that kids who spend their free time hanging out with nothing to do, who get poor grades, or who don't talk with their parents are eight times more likely to take part in unhealthful activities later on, such as smoking cigarettes or trying drugs.
Kids who hang out with friends who drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or have tried drugs are likely to do what their friends are doing, said Robert Blum. Blum is one of the doctors who conducted the study. In other words, kids tend to act like their friends, Blum said.
""How young people do at school and what they do with their free time are the most important [ways of predicting] risky behavior,"" said Blum.
Kids should get involved in interesting activities, Blum advised. Instead of hanging out with kids who are already trying what the study calls ""high-risk activities,"" Blum said that kids should play sports, read, talk with parents, or do homework.
The National Longitudinal Study finds that kids who are involved in activities usually don't get into trouble. Here's a story written by a
kid reporter about a few kids who know how to spend their time:

. ""The computers answer questions we wouldn't even have thought of asking."" Now, ""Dinosaurs,"" an exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City (where Mehling works), explores the modern world of paleontology.
In the past, scientists relied only on
to learn about dinosaurs. Fossils are the remains of plants and animals from long ago. When a plant or an animal dies, it usually rots away. However, if it is buried quickly by mud or sand, parts of it may be preserved. Over millions of years the remains can turn into a fossil. Fossils can be bones, teeth, footprints, or nests of eggs.
When a dinosaur fossil is found, scientists carefully dig around it and study it. They photograph, measure, and record each bone's position. Then the bones are dug up and often taken to a museum where the fossil is rebuilt.
Today, advanced technology allows paleontologists to examine fossils in fresh ways. By creating computer models, scientists can tell how bones fit together and how these ancient creatures moved.
used its long neck to munch on tall treetops. Their new model reveals that the huge plant-eating dinosaur most likely bent its neck downward to eat low shrubs and plants.
fossil was discovered by Barnum Brown in 1902 in Montana, long after these ancient creatures roamed Earth. Dinosaurs first appeared on Earth 245 million years ago, during the Mesozoic Era. They died about 65 million years ago.
What caused dinosaurs to become extinct? Scientists don't know for sure, but they have different
or possible explanations. One theory is that a huge asteroid or comet struck Earth. The collision likely filled the air with a huge cloud of dust and blocked out most of the sun's light and heat. As a result, many plants and animals would have died out.
In addition to using computers to study dinosaurs, scientists also use special X-ray machines to look inside fossils. They hope that new technology may one day answer ancient mysteries like what color dinosaurs might have been.
""Every time a new technique comes up, the old fossils are pulled out again and looked at anew with brand-new eyes,"" Mehling says. ""It's cool.""
By studying fossils and using high-tech computer programs, scientists are learning more than ever about dinosaurs.
The skull of this domeheaded dinosaur might have been used to help members of the same species recognize each other.
Computer models show that the dinosaur's neck curved downward and couldn't have been raised as high as scientists once thought.
stood upright and dragged its tail along the ground. They now think it leaned forward, sticking its tail out for balance.
Researchers now think the plates on the back of this dinosaur were brightly colored. Stegosaurs might have used the plates to communicate with other dinosaurs.
Fossil remains of this dinosaur have been found near one another. Scientists suspect the dinosaurs hunted in packs.
What other mysteries about dinosaurs might scientists hope to answer?

Jesse Coltrane, a 15-year-old student at Camden's Promise, says that kids can help people in need through school and community projects. Like Jesse, thousands of students will be working in their schools and communities to make the world a better place during National Volunteer Week (April 27 through May 3).
This year will mark the 30th anniversary of National Volunteer Week. The theme of this year's week is ""Celebrate Volunteers-The Spirit of America."" As part of this year's week, kids across the United States will be taking part in service projects. Many kids will also participate in community events to honor volunteers.
""When you volunteer, you help America become strong. You become an instant champion!""
""Volunteers learn important skills like teamwork and responsibility,"" said Melissa Helmbrecht, founder of the volunteer organization Champions of Hope.
Champions of Hope is made up of more than 650,000 kids across the country and includes Jesse Coltrane and other students at Camden's Promise. Champions of Hope participants across the country are volunteering to collect food for the hungry, clean parks, and raise money for firefighters.
Champions of Hope started a United Day of Service on September 11, 2002, one year after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. On that day,
star Sean Astin spoke to youths gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., about the importance of civic action. Astin plays hobbit Sam Gamgee in the movie. Astin told
, ""It is our responsibility to keep making the world a better place. We can do that by helping others.""
Sixth-grade student Matthew Malon from Illinois attended the September 11, 2002, rally and has collected food for homeless shelters. Astin's speech on volunteering moved him.
Some students from Camden's Promise also attended the rally. Students Damian Johnson, Keith Bennett, and Tashay Moody agree that it's important for kids to volunteer.As 16-year-old Damian Johnson puts it: ""[Volunteering] makes me feel like I have made an impact on people who don't have as much as I have.""
""How can I make a difference in the world if I'm just an ordinary kid?"" Thirteen-year-old author Sondra Clark answers that question in her fourth book,
!, which hit bookstores in March. She shows kids that small actions, such as donating videos to a children's hospital, can make a big difference.
Clark was motivated to write her book after reading an article on volunteerism in
. She has traveled to Africa to help children. Currently, she is traveling across the United States with her parents to share her experiences.
The action doesn't stop for actor Sean Astin when the cameras stop rolling. Astin, one of the stars of The Lord of the Rings movies and the father of two young children, is inspiring kids to make the world a better place.
In January, Astin was appointed to the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation. President George W. Bush created the council to encourage volunteerism. He has urged Americans to make a lifetime commitment to volunteering.
Astin tells kids that it's easy to make a difference. As a teenager in Santa Monica, California, he volunteered his time helping preschool students cross the street. He told Weekly Reader, ""I remember feeling that because I was helping someone, I had an incredible responsibility, and it felt great. It made me a better person.""

Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.

66,"An ancient mystery lurks beneath the coffin of King Tutankhamen (too-tahng-KAH-men). Researchers are trying to determine whether a horrible crime thousands of years ago led to the young Egyptian king's death. Did someone murder a boy called King Tut?
In an attempt to solve the mystery, scientists are X-raying the mummy of the
A pharaoh refers to an ancient Egyptian king.
""The question of whether [King Tut] was murdered or not will be completely answered,"" said Egypt's top archaeologist.
King Tut lived in Egypt more than 3,300 years ago. Despite suffering from a spine disease that made it difficult for him to turn his head, Tut probably spent his childhood swimming in the Nile River, hunting ducks, and learning how to read and write.
After his father died, the young boy was thrown into the royal spotlight. Tut was crowned king at about the age of 10! His reign, however, did not last very long. By 18 years old, he was dead.
Howard Carter, a British archaeologist, discovered King Tut's tomb in 1922.
The mystery of how King Tut died has fascinated people since Howard Carter, a British archaeologist, found his secret
in 1922. A tomb is a burial place.
Ancient Egyptians buried King Tut in an area of hidden caves called the Valley of the Kings. It is located near the Nile River. Tut's mummy was discovered with an elaborate gold mask covering its head and shoulders.
The tomb was filled with royal treasures, including jewelry, statues, furniture, and even some of Tut's childhood toys. Ancient Egyptians believed in life after death. They buried their dead with favorite items they believed could be used in the afterlife.
murdered, crime experts believe the culprit was likely someone close to him. Scientists have narrowed the list to four suspects: his wife, his treasurer, his prime minister, and his military chief.
They suspect those four people because they would have known about Tut's spine disease. His weak condition would have made him an easy target. They also might have had
, or reasons, to murder Tut. (See ""
Why do scientists think Tut was killed? They say the tomb's small size and its rushed state hint that he might have died unexpectedly.
At the time of the tomb's discovery in 1922, experts had ruled out foul play. Yet X-rays taken in 1968 revealed a different story. They showed a hole in Tut's skull, suggesting he might have suffered a severe blow to the head.
Tut's mummy was flown to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo for new X-rays. X-ray technology today is more sophisticated than it was in 1968. Thanks to modern
, or crime-solving techniques, scientists hope the question of whether Tut was murdered will soon be answered.
Was a crime committed? Clues point to four main suspects.
Although paintings in Tut's tomb depict a loving wife, experts say she could still have had a motive. Shortly after Tut died, his wife wrote a letter to the leader of another nation. She requested help in finding a new husband. In ancient Egypt, it was possible for women to become pharaohs. Did she murder her husband to become pharaoh herself?
Tut's treasurer, Maya, had easy access to him during his reign. Evidence, however, shows that Maya liked the boy king. He rebuilt Tut's burial chamber after it was robbed. A gift in Tut's tomb also bears Maya's name. Although Maya was the least likely to ascend to the throne after Tut's death, could the treasurer have been so jealous of the boy king that he murdered him?
Ay was Tut's adviser and grandfather. He became pharaoh upon Tut's death. After Tut died, Ay pressured Tut's wife to marry him. Marrying her made him king of Egypt. Shortly after their wedding, the new bride mysteriously disappeared. Some people think a painting of a hunting scene in Ay's tomb proves his crime. The painting was an odd choice for a royal tomb. Was Ay confessing his crime through the killing in the painting?
War threatened Egypt during Tut's rule. His military chief might have thought the boy king was too young to protect Egypt from its enemies. Because the chief drove Tut's chariot, some experts suspect that he pushed the young pharaoh to his death. After the prime minister's death, the military chief became king of Egypt. At that time, he attempted to erase records of Tut's life. Could that have been to cover up a crime?

However, record companies said that by sharing music files online, Brianna was stealing. As a result, she was one of 261 people sued by the Recording Industry Association of America in early September. Brianna was targeted because she had swapped more than 1,000 songs online.
Approximately 60 million people download music files from the Internet. In most cases, that is against the law. The music industry has compared it with shoplifting, saying most people wouldn't steal CDs from a store.

Many people don't like paying high prices for music CDs. They say they like to get their music online because it's easy-and it's free.
During the past three years, music sales have suffered a huge loss. Record industry officials blame the drop on the increasing number of people who get their songs free on the Internet.
To draw music fans back into stores, the world's largest record company announced a few weeks ago that it would lower its CD prices. Universal Music Group said its CDs would sell in stores for about $12.98 instead of the current prices ranging from $16.98 to $18.98.
For people who still want to get their music online, they can do it without breaking the law. Some music-sharing services on the Web work in a similar way to record stores. The services charge a small fee for each song that is copied.

The Paralympics run from October 18 to 29.
: The Paralympics began in 1960. They parallel the Olympic Games. That's where the name comes from.
: What sports are part of the Paralympics?
: Eighteen sports are included the Paralympics. This year, we have two new sports, wheelchair rugby and sailing.
: Who can compete in the Paralympics?
: This year, 125 countries are sending 4,000 athletes, each with a physical disability.
: Besides the health benefits, sports teach many skills. First, there's the mental discipline involved with sports. You always have to concentrate, think, and plan ahead. Also, sports teach teamwork, leaderships skills, and self-confidence.
: Sports have always been a part of your life. What happened when you were 16 years old that almost ended your sports career?
: When I was younger, I was a skier. I was training in Austria when I fell and severed my spinal cord.
: How did that accident change your life?
: It didn't change anything. I never missed a beat. The accident didn't change my goals. My mind was not touched in the accident. I could do everything after the accident that I could do before it, except walk.
I'm the same person today that I was before the accident.
: Well, one thing changed. I switched sports. I'm no longer a skier. In the 1988, 1992, and 1996 Paralympics, I competed in track and field events, winning four medals. This year, I'm on the basketball team.
: What do you plan to do in Sydney?
: If you could say one thing to the kids of America, what would you tell them?
: Try. And I mean really try. If you want to do something, give it your best effort. If you find a roadblock in your path, take a detour. If you really want to do something, you can find a way to do it.

Scientists in Indonesia think they have found hidden treasure52 new types of marine animals! The researchers believe that the 24 types of fish, 20 types of corals, and 8 types of shrimp are new to science.
The researchers spotted the new species off the coast of Papua, a province on one of the more than 13,500 islands that make up Indonesia. The area, Birds Head Seascape, is one of the worlds most diverse marine regions.

Listening to portable music players, such as iPods, may be fun, but health experts warn that they may harm your hearing. More than 5 million kids and teens suffer some degree of hearing loss from loud noises. And that number may continue to rise.
Since 1971, the number of people in the United States with hearing problems has doubled. Why? Portable music players channel loud sound straight into the ears and don't let it escape.
But it's not just portable music players that are to blame for hearing problems. Everything from noisy rock concerts to loud power tools can harm your hearing.
Loud sounds can damage tiny hairs inside the ear that help you hear. If those hairs are damaged beyond repair, hearing loss is permanent. Extended listening to loud music can also lead to a ringing in the ears called

Several U.S. states have started cyberschools. One company, K12, recently started a national cyberschool.
K12's founder, William Bennett, believes that K12 and the Internet will give kids a new way to go to school. Bennett said, ""K12 will help connect parents, teachers, and children to one of the most effective educational [tools, the Internet].""
Bennett is not alone in thinking that the Internet can provide an alternative to traditional schools. Kathi Baldwin is a teacher at Valley Pathways, a cyberschool in Palmer, Alaska. She thinks cyberschools are as good as traditional schools. ""We wouldn't do it if we didn't think it could produce an equal education--or better [than traditional education],"" Baldwin said.
Some critics say cyberschools are not as good as traditional schools. Michael Carr is a spokesperson for the National Association of Secondary Principals. He says kids who attend cyberschools don't have as many chances to make friends as other kids do. ""The main worry would be the socialization skills,"" he said.

He works with teachers over the computer to complete each assignment. His mother says that the cyberschool has changed Douglas's life.

Some coin collectors say U.S. coins should have a greater variety of pictures. For instance, they want to take the image of Abraham Lincoln off the penny. They want to remove the drawing of Thomas Jefferson from the nickel.
""After almost 100 years, even Lincoln himself would probably say enough is enough,"" said coin collector Fred Weinberg.
Weinberg and others say the presidential portraits are boring. Instead of presidents, the critics want to see patriotic scenes.
""I'm not putting down dead dignitaries, but the public wants to see something new to stimulate pride and interest, not just in coins, but in history,"" Weinberg said.
Officials at the U.S. Mint, which makes coins, say they are looking into the possibility of change. The mint could have a new nickel in 2003, a new dime in 2004, a new half dollar in 2005, and a new penny in 2006.
U.S. coins have honored presidents for almost a century. In 1909, President Abraham Lincoln became the first president to be pictured on a coin.
Later, other presidents were pictured on coins. George Washington's image was added to the quarter in 1932. Thomas Jefferson's picture replaced that of a Native American on the nickel in 1938. Franklin Roosevelt's image appeared on the dime beginning in 1946. John F. Kennedy was pictured on the half dollar beginning in 1964.
Not everyone agrees that a change in change is good. Some people want to keep their loose change exactly the way it is.
""We're open to change in color and general design... but we certainly would not be open to just replacing President Lincoln's image with a flower or something else,"" said a fan of the Lincoln penny.

In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had ordered all but two $20 gold coins destroyed. Those two coins were given to the Smithsonian Institution.

If you're like most schoolkids, you've recited the Pledge of Allegiance more times than you can remember. But now students in three public school districts in California are no longer allowed to say those historic words.
A federal judge in California ruled that the Pledge of Allegiance is
because it contains the phrase ""under God."" If something does not uphold the rules of the U.S. Constitution, it is considered unconstitutional.
For years, Michael Newdow of California has fought to have the phrase removed from the pledge. He continually argues that because of the pledge's reference to God, his elementary school daughter should not have to listen to it recited daily.
Last year, the case did not make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Given the recent lower court's ruling, it is unclear whether the Supreme Court will now hear the controversial case.
Should the Pledge of Allegiance be banned from public schools because of the phrase ""under God""? Discuss in class. Then cast your vote at
According to the federal court, the phrase ""under God"" suggests that the government supports religion. That violates the First Amendment to the Constitution. That amendment guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and press. People often refer to part of this amendment as the separation of church and state.
Newdow provides the reverse argument for removing the reference to God from the pledge. He says, ""Imagine you send your kids to school every day, and the teachers [make] them stand up and say, ""We are one nation that denies God exists.""
The pledge represents a way for many Americans to express their

Others point out that the Declaration of Independence and the national anthem contain religious references. Critics of the ruling argue that saying the pledge is

361,"The Heat Is On: Will Global Warming Affect Animals?
Polar bears in Alaska are having trouble catching one of their main meals--ringed seals. To get to the seals, the bears often walk across islands of ice floating in the water.
Ice throughout Alaska is melting earlier and faster in the spring than it did several years ago. So polar bears don't have as much time to catch seals before the ice melts. As a result, polar bears are catching fewer seals.
Ice along Alaska's coast is melting because the temperature is higher worldwide. In the last 100 years, Earth's temperature has risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit.
. Global warming is changing the environment worldwide. As a result, many plants and animals are being affected, say scientists from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
As temperatures rise, more and more animals will have to
, or move, in order to survive, said scientist Jay Malcolm of the WWF.
Many plants and animals that can't adjust or migrate will not survive the rise in temperature, said WWF scientists. In some areas of the world, the WWF says, as many as two in ten species of plants and animals will die out by the year 2100.
Here are some examples of how global warming is affecting some animals in North America.
The numbers on the map show where each animal can be found.
The black guillemot (GIL-uh-maht) is a bird that lives on an island off Alaska's coast. It eats Arctic cod, a fish that lives in water under ice. Rising temperatures have caused much of the ice to melt. The Arctic cod has moved to other parts of the sea where water is still covered with ice. The guillemot no longer has enough fish to eat.
The American bistort is a plant that lives in Mount Rainier National Park. The Edith's checkerspot butterfly drinks nectar from bistort flowers. The warming temperatures have caused the butterflies to hatch earlier, before the flowers bloom, so the butterflies don't have enough food right after they hatch.
Global warming is actually helping some animals.
The Mexican vole lives in areas with warm temperatures. It is spreading northward into Arizona and Colorado because of the rise in temperatures there.
For years, red fire ants lived in the warm southern part of the United States. Today, because of rising temperatures, they are spreading northward.
Scientists have learned that global warming is already affecting Earth. ""We should not expect the effects of global warming to take place 50 years in the future,"" said scientist Rafe Sagarin. ""It's happening right now.""
Scientists agree that Earth has been getting warmer for the last 100 years. They don't agree on
Gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming. Carbon dioxide in the air traps heat from the sun, causing Earth's temperature to rise.
Volcanoes and forest fires release carbon dioxide into the air. Some scientists blame the rise in temperature on volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and other natural events.
Other scientists blame human actions for the rise in temperature. They say Earth has always had volcanoes and forest fires, so why is Earth warming now? Those scientists say the carbon dioxide from automobiles and factories is causing the recent increase in global warming.

235,"In June, a small car pulled up outside the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad. Three men unloaded a wrapped object from the trunk, handed it to museum officials, and sped off in the mid afternoon heat. No questions asked.
Museum officials were stunned. The men had left a very important vase. Although the vase was in pieces, the good news was that it could be fixed.
""This is one of the most important pieces from the Baghdad museum, and I am delighted it has been returned,"" said a museum official. ""It is reason for people all around the world to celebrate.""
Why, exactly, would the return of a vase be cause for celebration? It was the famous Vase of Warka. The 5,000-year-old
, or man-made object, is one of the world's first sculptures. The images on the vase are important because they link the past to modern times.
Along with many valuable objects, the vase was stolen from the museum after the fall of Saddam Hussein's government in April.
At that time, mobs of thieves and rioters, or
, tore through the museum. They smashed ancient objects. Thieves ran off with prized treasures. Among the lost objects were carvings, jewelry, paintings, and statues.
One museum official referred to the looting as the ""crime of the century."" He said that it wasn't just a loss for Iraq, but that it was ""a loss for all mankind.""
. That means they could never be replaced. Some of the lost objects dated back 10,000 years, to the beginning of civilization.
Many people blamed U.S. troops for failing to protect the museum as Saddam's government fell. They pointed out that U.S. forces had managed to guard the oil reserves. U.S. government officials defended themselves, saying that American troops were focused on taking control of Baghdad.
Officials estimate that about 3,000 pieces from the museum's entire collection of 170,000 items are still missing. The losses were not as large as experts originally thought. Some valuable pieces were hidden in underground vaults. Other pieces were taken by people for safekeeping and then were returned.
Some of the stolen objects are slowly making their way back to the museum. Museum workers are trying to ensure the safe return of other objects. They began a ""don't ask; don't tell"" policy.
The policy allows thieves-like the ones who brought back the vase-to return stolen goods without punishment. Countries around the world are involved in recovery efforts. They are helping to compile a list of the stolen items. However, as one expert pointed out, ""It's going to be a long time before we know for sure what's missing.""
Modern-day Iraq is the site of ancient Mesopotamia. In Greek,
means ""the land between rivers."" There, about 5,000 years ago, the first cities sprang up between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
The area between the two rivers is often referred to as a cradle of civilization. That's because mathematics, science, and one of the first written languages developed there.
Here are some of the Iraqi National Museum's valuable artifacts and their status at the time
This 5,000-year-old stone statue of a woman praying was still missing.
This life-size marble head of a woman is one of the earliest pieces of sculpture. About 5,000 years old, it was stolen during the looting.
How did looters steal from world history when they ransacked the museum?
Originally thought to be missing, this tablet is a record of the world's earliest writing. It was found on the museum's second floor, away from the riots.

, or the exact point where the earthquake struck, was about 65 miles off the coast of El Salvador in the Pacific Ocean.
Officials in El Salvador said more than 700 people were killed and many people were still missing days after the quake. Thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed. As a result, many people were left without shelter.
San Salvador, the nation's capital, was the scene of terrible destruction. Much of the damage was caused by mudslides that buried many buildings.
To help the survivors of the earthquake, dozens of countries, including Japan, Spain, and the United States, rushed teams of rescue workers to El Salvador. The rescuers searched for people buried under mud and rubble from collapsed buildings.
To clear the wreckage, rescue workers used bulldozers, shovels, and their hands. Rescuers also used specially trained dogs, which have a keen sense of smell, to locate victims buried by the quake.
Thick layers of mud made rescue work difficult. ""Mud seals off everything considered essential for survival, such as oxygen,"" explained Gary O'Shea, director of the International Rescue Corps of the United Kingdom.
In addition to sending teams of rescue workers, many countries sent money, food, clothing, water, and medical supplies to help in the recovery efforts. (Ask your teacher how you can help the earthquake victims in El Salvador.)
The Earth's crust is made up of huge segments of rock called

The plates on either side of a fault push against each other. Sometimes, the plates get stuck. When that happens, pressure builds up until one of the plates moves suddenly, releasing the built-up pressure and triggering an earthquake.
The energy from the earthquake travels in waves through the Earth's
. The crust is the outermost layer of Earth and is 6 to 40 miles thick.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) says earthquakes take place every day around the world. Most earthquakes are small, measuring less than 3.0 in magnitude. The El Salvador quake measured 7.6 in magnitude. (The higher the magnitude, the more intense the earthquake.)
After the rescuers leave, the people of El Salvador will still be faced with a massive rebuilding effort. One young survivor, who had lost three sisters in the quake, looked at the devastation and said, ""It's like the world here is upside down.""
The United States is no stranger to earthquakes. Early in the morning of January 17, thousands of New York City residents felt a small earthquake. Many people thought the quake was a subway train running beneath their buildings. ""But then I remembered that there isn't a subway line under my building,"" said one resident.

The poll found that at least 65 percent of Florida's voters favor new steps that would help protect the endangered manatees. Some of those steps include lowering the speed limit for boats in manatee zones, increasing fines for people who speed in manatee zones, limiting the amount of building along waterways where manatees are found, and creating additional protected areas for manatees.
""We are struck by [how far] Florida voters are willing to go to protect manatees,"" said Kate Stewart, who conducted the poll. She said the results also showed that ""boaters and non-boaters alike not just support but strongly support increased protection measures.""
Florida manatees live in the state's warm coastal and inland waters. The Save the Manatee Club says that the Florida manatee population has been shrinking since 1974, when scientists started keeping track.
Collisions with boats cause many manatee deaths. Since manatees swim slowly, they cannot get out of the way of a fast-moving boat. According to the Save the Manatee Club, 78 manatees were killed in collisions with boats in Florida waters last year. So far this year, at least 23 manatees have been killed in collisions.

676,"Hours before giant waves pounded coastlines in South Asia, many animals started behaving strangely. In Sri Lanka, elephants trumpeted frantically and fled to higher ground. Bats and flamingos deserted low-lying areas. Many other animals escaped unharmed.
Wildlife experts are amazed that many animals survived the tsunami. The series of huge waves killed thousands of people in South Asia and East Africa about two months ago. Experts say animals might have sensed the approaching waves and moved to higher ground.
""I think animals can sense disaster. They know when things are happening in nature,"" said an official at the national wildlife department in Sri Lanka.
Elephants' sharp senses may have warned them about the tsunami.
Other stories of odd animal behavior before the tsunami have also surfaced. Giant waves flooded low-lying parts of Yala National Park in Sri Lanka, uprooting trees and killing hundreds of people. Wildlife officials reported, however, that few animals died. The park is home to hundreds of animals, including elephants, monkeys, leopards, tigers, deer, and water buffalo.
In Thailand, elephants carrying tourists from Japan bolted for the hills, and other elephants broke free of their chains. In one fishing village, nearly 1,000 locals escaped safely after birds squawked madly.
Although some animals in South Asia successfully fled to higher ground before the tsunami, other animals were not as lucky. Many dogs and other pets lost their owners in the tsunami and are homeless, sick, and without food or water. Cows, goats, and other farm animals are also roaming aimlessly. Many of those animals are drinking polluted water. Rescue groups have been sending animal food and
to the area. Veterinarians are doctors who care for animals.
Why might animals have known trouble was on the way? Forget special powers. Instead, experts say that animals have better senses of hearing, smell, and sight than humans do. Those sharp senses help warn animals when natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes, are about to happen.
""It doesn't surprise me that animals had an early warning of the tsunami,"" animal expert Michael Dee of the Los Angeles Zoo told
. ""The senses of certain species are far stronger than what any human has."" Dee points out that dogs, for example, have a stronger sense of smell than humans and that cats can see better in the dark than people.
Scientists say that animals might have felt the vibrations from the earthquake that set off the tsunami. In addition, many animals, including elephants, pigeons, and dogs, can also pick up
. That is a sound that is too low in pitch for humans to hear.
""Elephants can hear or feel other elephants grumble up to 2 miles away, so they probably felt the earthquake,"" said Dee. ""Their first
would be to move away from the direction of the sound."" An instinct is a natural, untaught behavior or reaction.
Before the tsunami struck, animals may have started to flee because they saw other creatures running. ""Animals take their cues from other animals,"" said Dee.
How animals sense danger has fascinated people for centuries. Most scientists are quick to point out, however, that nothing has ever been proven.
Will animal instincts be used to create a warning system about natural disasters anytime soon? ""I wouldn't count on [it],"" said Dee.
In the meantime, animals are helping out in other ways. For example, elephants are assisting in the cleanup of areas hit by the tsunami.
Scientists say that elephants can pick up vibrations from earthquakes through their broad feet.
Elephants' toenails are in the skin and not attached to the toes.
Elephants' soles have sensitive foot pads that detect vibrations, such as those from an earthquake. That signals elephants to move to more stable ground.
In what other ways might animals' sharp senses be helpful?

Pluto belongs in a new class referred to as dwarf planets. The decision was made to create the new category because powerful telescopes have let scientists find more and more Pluto-like objects in space.
Jupiter is the largest planet. It is 88,846 miles wide.
Mercury has the fastest orbit around the sun. It moves almost 30 miles a second.
Venus is the hottest planet. Its average surface temperature is 867 degrees.

Jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis hopes to bring some rhythm back to New Orleans, Louisiana. Days after Hurricane Katrina destroyed the city, Marsalis started raising money for those affected by the tragedy. The city holds a special place in the musicians heart. Not only was it the birthplace of jazz music, but it is also his hometown.
In September, Marsalis organized a benefit concert in New York City called ""Higher Ground"" to help the people of New Orleans. The concert raised more than $2 million dollars. Marsalis also recently spoke before Congress on behalf of the city. ""We should use the chance to rebuild New Orleans to find our soul as a nation,"" he told members of Congress.

Last summer, a federal court in California ruled that the pledge is
in public school classrooms. A law is considered unconstitutional if a court decides that it goes against the U.S. Constitution. The court ruled that the pledge is unconstitutional because it includes the phrase ""under God.""
The court says that the phrase suggests that the government
, or supports, religion. That would violate the First Amendment to the Constitution. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech and prevents the government from establishing an official religion for the nation.
The recent court ruling has angered many people across the country. They see the pledge as a way to express their
, or loyalty, to the United States.
Nine western states are part of the court's ruling. Students in those states were ordered to stop saying the pledge. Those states are Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Nevada, and Washington.
However, the ruling has been temporarily put on hold. The Elk Grove School District in California, where the case began, has asked the Supreme Court of the United States to review and overturn the lower court's ruling.

Why did astronomers give Pluto the boot? For starters, they came up with a new definition for a planet. A planet must be nearly round and must

Since its discovery in 1930, astronomers suspected that Pluto was an oddball when compared with the other planets. New technology has shown that its orbit is oval-shaped. Pluto is also smaller than the other planets. Even Earths moon is larger.
Orbit and size werent the only problems. Pluto is made up of material that is different from that of the other planets. While the others are made up of rocks or gases, Pluto consists mostly of ice.
Pluto appears to be similar to other objects in the Kuiper belt. Its status as a planet began to look bleak when 2003 UB313 was discovered three years ago. That Kuiper belt object, nicknamed ""Xena,"" is larger than Pluto. The discovery prompted astronomers to begin thinking about reclassifying the objects in our solar system.

Pluto meets only two of the three new requirements:
 It has to be nearly round.
 Its orbit should not cross another planets orbit.
Pluto was discovered in 1930, long after the other planets, by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh (19061997). He wasnt the person to name it, though. Venetia Burney, an 11-year-old British girl, gave Pluto its name. She thought the new planet should be named for the Roman god of the underworld.
Not all astronomers agree with the decision to change Plutos status. Why might some oppose it?

178,"Rosa Parks is arrested and fingerprinted again in February 1956 for breaking segregation laws.
Fifty years ago, one brave woman's refusal to give up her bus seat changed history.
Honor the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest and the start of the Montgomery bus boycott with our classroom play.
During the 1950s, the law in the South prevented black
people from having the same rights as white people. At that time, the South was
by law. Black people were forced to sit in the back of public buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, drinking fountains, and other public facilities.
Those laws made Rosa Parks angry. She was a well-known leader in the African American community of Montgomery, Alabama. For years, Rosa Parks had stood up to unfair laws against African Americans. She worked courageously with other African American leaders to change them. She also was one of the first women in Montgomery to join the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to fight for
, or equal rights under the law.
Rosa Parks had refused to move from her seat on city buses in the past. Drivers simply forced her off the bus. But 50 years ago, on December 1, 1955, her action changed history. She refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person and was arrested. Her arrest led to the Montgomery
. During the yearlong boycott, African Americans refused to ride public buses. As a result of the boycott and Rosa Parks's courage, the law was changed to provide equal seating on buses. It marked the beginning of the struggle to end segregation.
SCENE 1: Downtown Montgomery, Alabama, December 1, 1955
Rosa Parks, 42, boards a city bus on her way home from work as a seamstress.
At the time, buses are divided into two sections. The section at the front of the bus is for whites only. The section for black people begins five to 10 rows back. Holding her head high, Rosa Parks sits down in the first row of the ""colored"" section.
After the bus grinds to a stop, a few white people get on. They quickly fill the empty seats in the ""whites-only"" section. One white man is left standing. According to a city law, black people are to give up their seats in the colored section if no seats remain in the white section.
There are white people who want to sit down.
You know white people and black people can't sit in the same row. Are you going to stand up?
Then I'm going to have you arrested.
A few minutes later, two police officers board the bus and walk toward Rosa Parks.
Did the driver tell you to stand?
Why do you all push us around?
I don't know, but the law is the law, and you're under arrest.
SCENE 2: Rosa Parks's house, that night
Rosa Parks is released from jail on bail that day. She and other Montgomery civil rights leaders meet at her house to discuss the bus boycott.
For years, civil rights leaders have been planning a bus boycott to fight segregation. They are waiting for the right time and the right leader to spark the boycottand Rosa Parks is that person. They know Rosa Parks has the courage to stand up to segregation. Because most of Montgomery's bus riders are black, the bus companies will lose money if black people refuse to ride the buses.
I know one thing, I will never, ever ride another segregated bus againeven if it means I have to walk to work.
You have to stand up for what you believe in.
Rosa, how would you feel about making your arrest a test case against segregation? We may be able to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.
I don't like being in the spotlight, and I don't want to put my family in danger.
Rosa, this may be our best chance to fight segregation laws.
Good. In the meantime, we're going to boycott the buses.
The next day, community leaders meet to discuss the boycott. At their request, Martin Luther King Jr. agrees to lead it.
SCENE 3: Montgomery courthouse, a few days later
Rosa Parks approaches the courthouse steps with her husband for her trial.
The steps of the courthouse are packed with people. Some bystanders threaten Rosa Parks. Others shout their support.
Your place is in the back of the bus, lady!
Oh, she's so sweet. They've messed with the wrong one now!
After Rosa Parks and her husband manage to push their way into the courtroom, the trial begins. The bus driver takes the stand.
I politely asked her to move to the back, which is required by city law. She refused to listen.
Rosa Parks is not called to the stand. Instead, her lawyers speak on her behalf.
I find Rosa Parks guilty of violating the city law. She must pay a $10 fine plus $4 in court costs.
The crowd of supporters in the courtroom reacts angrily to the verdict.
You haven't heard the last from us.
Despite the boos from supporters, the guilty verdict was exactly what Rosa Parks and her lawyers wanted. Their case eventually made it to the nation's highest courtthe Supreme Court.
Montgomery's black community continued to boycott the buses. On November 13, 1956, their efforts finally paid off. The Supreme Court ruled that Alabama's segregated buses were against the law. After more than a year, the boycott ended.
At the urging of photographers, Rosa Parks boarded a bus on December 20. This time, she sat in the front seat. (See the cover.)

A tropical rain forest is warm and has heavy rainfall. The Amazon, in South America, is the largest rain forest in the world.
Yet the Amazons future is grim. Farmers are rapidly destroying this lush landscape.
has been huge problem in the Amazon since the 1960s. Deforestation occurs when farmers and loggers cut down trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Until recently, scientists thought the rain forest was losing about 5,800 square miles a year. However, using the latest satellite technology, researchers have discovered that the Amazon is shrinking at about twice that rate.
Why should we worry about a rain forest that is thousands of miles from where we live? Deforestation reduces the rain forests
or the variety of plants and animals in a particular area. The Amazon is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant diversity. It is home to the biggest flower in the world, a bird-eating spider, and a monkey about the size of a toothbrush.
Scientists estimate that they have identified only a small number of all species that live in the rain forest. As loggers and farmers destroy the forest, animals and plants may become extinct before they are discovered.
Deforestation affects people too. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines we need come from the rain forest.
The Amazon is often called the ""lungs of the world."" Its trees clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans. Carbon dioxide is a
Greenhouse gases trap the suns heat close to Earth. Without the trees in the rain forest, the Earths climate would become much hotter.
Stopping the destruction of the rain forest is not an easy task. Brazils government recently created two national parks in the Amazon rain forest. The governments efforts placed 3.7 million acres of rain forest off-limits for development. The protected area is more than twice the size of Maryland.
Others think that this is not enough. ""The single most important factor contributing to forest loss is population growth in Brazil,"" scientist Jim Bowyer of the University of Michigan told
""People make the forest their home. All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive.""
Scientists estimate that if deforestation continues at its current rate, the rain forest may survive only another 40 to 50 years. ""We need to address the real causes of deforestation, like poverty and population growth,"" says Bowyer. ""Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest.""

""Volcanoes are just like people--they're awake and active, and they go to sleep,""
. A volcanologist is a scientist who studies volcanoes.
In September, Mount St. Helens began blowing large
, or clouds of steam, thousands of feet into the air. The 8,364-foot mountain is not the only restless volcano in the country. Scientists are also paying close attention to awakened volcanoes in Alaska and Hawaii.

Volcanoes can remain quiet for years and then erupt violently, sometimes without warning. Using the latest technology, scientists hope to better
Mount St. Helens is located in Washington.
Scientists say Mount St. Helens is one of the most closely monitored volcanoes and the most active volcano in the lower 48 states. Mount St. Helens is also among 13 active volcanoes that are located in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. That range is home to several powerful volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier and Mount Hood.
Although scientists say a large eruption at Mount St. Helens is unlikely, they are cautious because of the volcano's history. Officials have sealed off a 5-mile area around the volcano.
Mount St. Helens erupted with tremendous force in May 1980, blowing more than 1,300 feet off its top and killing 57 people. The blast destroyed thousands of acres of forest and scattered ash for thousands of miles. Mount St. Helens continued to rumble until 1986 but has been quiet since that time.
How can scientists tell when a volcano will awaken from its slumber? ""We measure earthquake activity, changes in the mountain, and volcanic gases,"" said Driedger.
Although scientists can't tell exactly when or with what force a volcano will blow its top, they rely on advanced equipment to help them predict eruptions. Special devices called
are installed around volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens to detect earthquakes. Earthquakes always strike before a volcano erupts.
Volcanoes are mountains where hot, liquid rock called magma deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure can cause magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the crater at the top of the volcano and vents, or cracks, along its side. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called lava. Once lava cools, it hardens into rock.
Scientists use special global positioning instruments to measure movements on the slopes of the mountain--a clue to the buildup of
. Magma is red-hot molten rock located inside the volcano. It is called
when it pours out of the volcano.
As magma rises, volcanoes release carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Sensors on helicopters test the air for gases that signal rising magma. ""The gases are like telegrams that tell us what's going on inside the volcano,"" said Driedger.
More than 500 million people around the world live near active volcanoes. Monitoring volcanoes is a dangerous job, but scientists take precautions to stay safe.
""By watching volcanoes, we learn how they work,"" said Driedger. ""The more we know, the better prepared we can be to save property and lives.""
Besides volcanoes, what natural disasters are hard for scientists to predict? Why?

The twin girls, now 20, were adopted in Mexico by different sets of parents in the United States. As luck would have it, the girls grew up in the same area in New York and went to different colleges near each other.
A common friend insisted the girls were twins and put them in contact. The girls exchanged
e-mail messages. Tamara had to do a double take when Adriana e-mailed a picture of herself.
The girls were stunned to learn that they each had a sister. Tamara's adoptive mother was surprised, too. Adriana's adoptive mother was aware that her daughter had a twin, but that was all she knew.
Besides looking alike and being the same height, the girls have a lot in common. They love to dance, and both started lessons when they were young. Upon meeting her sister for the first time, Adriana said, ""It was a shock. I saw me.""

President Bush says that he has worked to reduce pollution. Earlier this year, he announced a plan to improve the country's water quality.
To help Americans breathe cleaner air, Bush started the Clear Skies program. It is designed to reduce the amount of air pollution from power plants.
President Bush has allowed companies to cut down trees in some national parks. He says that will help prevent the number of wildfires.
The president favors oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He says the new oil source will reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East and will lower the cost of gasoline. He also wants car companies to use hydrogen fuel cells, a clean energy source, to power vehicles.
Kerry wants to do more to keep our waterways free from pollution.
Senator Kerry does not think President Bush is doing a good job taking care of the environment. He says that Bush has not enforced many important pollution laws.
Kerry thinks more needs to be done to keep our waterways clean and free from pollution. He plans to make the air cleaner and launch new ways to protect the country's water supply.
If elected, Kerry proposes to give more money to national parks. He says that Bush has let companies cut down too many trees.
Kerry also opposes Bush's plan to drill for oil in Alaska. Kerry wants to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil by using new forms of energy. He also supports the making of more fuel-efficient vehicles.

Bullying may be one of the causes behind some of the recent shootings in U.S. schools, according to Stephens. Kids at Santana High School, in Santee, California, said bullying may have a part in a recent shooting there.
Santee student Charles ""Andy"" Williams, age 15, is accused of killing two boys and wounding 13 other people at Santana High School on March 5. According to schoolmates, in addition to having other personal problems, Williams had been bullied and teased.

To stop bullying, some schools have organized
. A peer mediation group allows students who have problems getting along to work the problems out with the help of peers and teachers.
Other schools have sent students and teachers forms asking questions about such problems as bullying and teasing. The answers from the forms help school leaders and parents become more aware of kids' problems and figure out ways to solve them.
Finally, Stephens suggests that there are steps a student who is bullied can take. ""Make it clear that you don't like being bullied and then walk away and tell an adult,"" Stephens said.
Ronald Stephens, of the National Center for School Safety, gives these three tips to remember if you are ever bullied:
If a person is bullying you, tell the person in a firm, loud voice that you don't like what they are doing. Then...
Find an adult (teacher, parent, coach) and tell that adult what happened.

Many Californians have had similar problems. Since December, power companies have had trouble meeting the demand for electricity in the Sunshine State. In January and March, more than a million Californians sweated through
, which happen when power companies turn off electricity in an area for a short time.
Several factors contributed to the shortage, said Lawrence J. Makovich, a scientist who studies energy use. One problem is that California doesn't have enough power plants to supply all the electricity the Sunshine State needs. In addition, prices have risen for the fuels used in power plants to produce electricity, Makovich said.
The energy crisis may become worse this summer as Californians turn on air conditioners. According to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the state will probably be 10 percent short of the amount of electricity it needs.
This summer, the electricity crunch may spread to other parts of the country. In some areas, prices for electricity have been on the rise.
Many states are taking steps to solve the shortage. In California, Gov. Gray Davis is urging people to save energy.
""Yes, we have a power shortage, but we are far from powerless,"" Davis said. ""By reducing our electricity demand by even a small amount, we can reduce the price, avoid shortages, and lower energy bills.""

Drumbeats echoed. Songs and cheers filled the air. Spirits soared. More than 20,000 Native Americans in traditional feather headdresses and clothing gathered in Washington, D.C., in late September.
They were there to celebrate the grand opening of the National Museum of the American Indian. The new museum is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It is located on the National Mall, near the U.S. Capitol.

The museum is dedicated to the life, culture, and traditions of Native Americans. It tells the stories and struggles of tribes throughout North, South, and Central America.
Ten-year-old Jessica Lovato, from the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe in New Mexico, joined the celebration. To her, visiting the museum was ""a great learning experience!""
Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, Edward S. Curtis Collection, [reproduction number, LC-USZ62-130198]
Native American artifacts, such as these baskets, will be on display at the National Museum of the American Indian.
A wealthy New Yorker named George Gustav Heye collected most of the new museum's items throughout the early 1900s. He was interested in Native American culture and traditions.
There are about 800,000 Native American objects included in the museum's collection. The museum plans to display about 8,000 artifacts at a time.
The 4 million people who are expected to visit each year won't just find ancient objects--although there are plenty of them to see. Officials say the new museum also teaches people about Native Americans in modern times. Along with ancient pieces, such as beadwork, pottery, and carvings, visitors will also find newer ones, such as modern art and beaded sneakers.
The museum has been a work in progress for 16 years. Twenty-four Native American tribes helped build and plan the museum. They even reviewed the traditional dishes served in the museum's caf.
Symbolism abounds in the five-story building, which is made of limestone from Minnesota. The building's curved exterior resembles rocks shaped by wind and water over thousands of years.
In honor of many types of Native American dwellings, the museum's entrance faces east, in the direction of the rising sun. Inside, an electronic welcome sign greets visitors in 150 Native American languages.
Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today, each with its own culture. Native Americans have lived in North, South, and Central America for more than 20,000 years. When European explorers first arrived in North America, they thought they had landed in the East Indies. Those are islands located near Asia. That is why the explorers called the people living in the Americas ""Indians.""
To many Native Americans, the new museum has been a long time coming. ""[It is] long overdue,"" said Lawrence Small, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
Now that it is officially open, Native Americans hope the new museum keeps their culture alive. ""This will be a good education tool for everyone that wants to learn about the Indian people,"" a Cherokee woman told
. ""Our languages are still here. Our culture is still here.""
Why is the new museum an important part of Native American history?

Such legends are important to native Hawaiians. Today, however, ancient gods are a part of a fiery debate in this land of spirits.
Mauna Kea is an extinct, or dead, volcano on the island of Hawaii. According to an ancient Hawaiian saying, Mauna Kea ""is the astonishing mountain that stands in the calm."" These days the 13,700-foot-high peak is anything but calm.
, scientists who study space, say the mountain peak is a perfect spot to place telescopes.
Currently, scientists use 13 telescopes in a special 11,000-acre area called the Science Reserve on Mauna Kea. Using those telescopes, scientists have made several important astronomical discoveries. The scientists who use the telescopes pay a fee to the University of Hawaii, which built the observatories.
The use of the mountain for scientific research, however, is the source of a debate between scientists and some native Hawaiians. Some Hawaiians believe that the top of Mauna Kea is sacred, or an important place to their religion. They believe that the peak is the home of the snow goddess Poli'ahu.
According to officials at the Center for Hawaiian Studies, the university is making money from the site without sharing much of the money with native Hawaiians.
""We don't get a penny from Mauna Kea, and it's our land,"" said Jon Osorio, of the Center for Hawaiian Studies.
University officials say that a master plan, completed in June, addresses native Hawaiian concerns. The goals of the plan include educating people about Mauna Kea. It also states how many telescopes the university can build in the future.
According to observers, the debate will not end soon. A 1968 agreement gives the university control of the area until 2033. Until then, native Hawaiians will fight for what is theirs while scientists keep studying the skies.

spacecraft has spent nearly seven years on a journey into the far reaches of space. During that time, it has covered more than 2 billion miles. In July, the spacecraft finally reached its destination--the ringed planet of Saturn.
You could not stand on Saturn. Unlike Earth, Saturn does not have a solid surface. Saturn is made mostly of gases.
Saturn is light because it is a ball of gas. If you built a HUGE swimming pool, Saturn would float in it. In fact, it is the only planet in the solar system that is less dense than water.
Saturn is windy. The fastest winds on Saturn can reach about 1,100 miles per hour! In comparison, the fastest winds on Earth can reach about 250 miles per hour.
Three other giant planets in the solar system have rings-Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. Saturns rings are the only ones that can be seen from Earth with a small telescope.
""The trip has sort of been like a long car drive, and we cant wait to get out there and explore the sites,"" said NASA scientist Jeremy Jones about the mission. ""In a sense, the tour is just beginning.""
Over the next four years, that tour will include studying Saturn, its rings, and its 33 known moons. Scientists say that Saturn holds clues to how the solar system formed. They think that Saturn and its moons are like a miniature version of our solar system.

Saturn, the sixth planet from the sun, lies between Jupiter and Uranus. Of the nine planets in the solar system, Saturn is the second largest, after Jupiter. In fact, more than nine Earths would fit across Saturn.
The planets rings are not solid. They are made up of particles of rock, ice, and dust. Some of the particles are as tiny as grains of sand. Others are as large as skyscrapers. Although the rings are wide, they are also very thin. The planets rings are only about half a mile thick.
In addition to learning about the rings, scientists are studying Saturns moons. The scientists primary focus is Saturns largest moon, Titan. Titan is larger than the planets Mercury and Pluto.

Scientists are interested in Titan because they think it might teach them about Earth. Experts used to think that Titan resembled Earth as it was billions of years ago. They are starting to question that idea.
What do scientists expect to find? ""In many ways, the most exciting part of the journey is about to begin because we dont know what lies ahead,"" said NASA scientist Julie Webster.
Earth and the other planets in our solar system travel around the sun. Saturn is so far from the sun that it receives less sunlight than we get on Earth. The sun also looks much smaller from Saturn.

When you come home from school, does your pet dog run to you barking and wagging its tail? Does your cat purr when you pet it? Many pet owners believe that tail wagging and purring are signs that pets are happy.
Most scientists are not sure that animals feel emotions. They say animals never feel happy or sad. In fact, they say, animals probably don't feel love, anger, hate or other emotions either.
Scientist Joseph LeDoux studied rats to find out whether the rodents have emotions. He found that rats do feel at least one emotion--fear. He also found the part of the brain that seems to control fear in rats. In humans, that part of the brain controls fear and some other emotions.
Even though LeDoux says rats feel fear, he doubts that other animals have emotions in the way humans and other primates do. ""A whale may behave as if it's in love,"" he said, ""but you can't prove what it's feeling, if anything.""
A number of scientists say animals do have a range of emotions. Some scientists who have studied such animals as dogs, cats, elephants, lions, and whales say those animals feel emotions. Scientist Joyce Poole studies elephants. She has written that pachyderms often show grief when a relative dies. She says elephants have ""deep emotions.""
Jane Goodall, studies chimpanzees. She says she has seen chimps playing and chasing one another for fun. Goodall also says chimps feel grief. After Flo, a 50-year-old chimp, died, one of her sons, Flint, refused to eat food. Flint's brothers and sisters tried to get him to eat, but they couldn't. Three weeks later, Flint died. Goodall says Flint ""died of grief.""
More recently, scientist Marc Bekoff watched an elk run back and forth through a patch of snow, jumping into the air as it completed each back-and-forth pass. Bekoff said the animal was feeling the ""joy of life.""
Bekoff said he can't prove that animals have feelings, because animals can't talk. But, he said, animals can communicate feelings in other ways. ""I can't prove that another human being is feeling happy or sad,"" he said, ""but I can [guess] how [he or she is] feeling through body language and facial expressions."" Both people and animals use
-- gestures and movements--to communicate without words.

Washington's widow, Martha, freed her husband's slaves on January 1, 1801. Martha was carrying out the wishes of the country's first president, who had died on December 14, 1799. In his will he had requested that his slaves be freed after his wife's death.
During the ceremony, Alexander, a descendant of a slave who worked at Mount Vernon, told visitors, ""I hope you all feel, as I do, a sense of joy, a sense of sadness but also a sense of hope that the contributions of good people will always be remembered.""
Jennifer Saxon, a spokesperson for Mount Vernon, told
that Mount Vernon couldn't have prospered without slave labor. ""Slaves did most of the work,"" she said.
When Washington was born, many Americans owned slaves. Those people used slaves to plant crops and perform many other duties. Most people thought slavery was OK. When Washington was 11 years old, his father died and left him ten slaves.
During the American Revolution, which began in 1775, some people began to think that slavery was wrong and should be ended. Washington was one of those people. He vowed never to buy another slave.
In his will, Washington wrote that all his slaves should be freed. ""Upon the [death] of my wife,"" he wrote, ""it is my...desire that all the slaves which I hold in my own right shall receive their freedom.""
To make sure Washington's wishes were carried out, Martha freed his slaves in 1801, a year before she died. Martha, however, kept the slaves she owned when she freed her husband's slaves.
Even though Washington freed the slaves he owned, slavery remained legal in some states for another 64 years, until 1865. Slavery did not end in the United States until after the Civil War ended it.

This year's Summer Olympics will take place from August 13 through August 29 in Athens, the capital of Greece. The Summer Games are held every four years.
""This Olympic homecoming will be an opportunity to reawaken the true spirit and meaning of the Olympic Games,"" said an Athens organizing committee member.
The Olympic Games date back more than 2,700 years. They were first held in Olympia, an area west of Athens.
The first known Olympic competition included just one event-a 200-yard footrace. Winning athletes were crowned with a wreath of olive leaves.
Over the years, more events were added, such as wrestling, discus throwing, and chariot racing.
As times changed, the Olympics evolved. In 1896, the first modern Olympic Games began in Athens. At that time, 312 athletes from 13 countries competed in nine sports.
Now, more than a century later, 10,500 athletes from more than 200 countries will go for the gold. The athletes will compete in 28 events, including baseball, gymnastics, swimming, and tennis.

Around the rest of the city, workers are completing a railway system and tearing up narrow roads to widen them for traffic. Hotels and restaurants are getting ready for an influx of tourists. Topping the Olympic planners' list is making sure the city is secure for athletes and visitors.
Some people are concerned that Athens might not be ready for the Olympics. But the Greek government was quick to reassure: ""We will have everything ready when it matters. We will offer what the world expects of us.""
- The first modern Olympics are held in Athens, Greece.
- Women compete for the first time.
- Gold, silver, and bronze medals are awarded for the first time.

""I thought, how are they going to make that [store] into a school?"" she said. Cassandra's mother, however, now likes the school and all the new equipment in it.
Mesa isn't the only community that has recycled old buildings into schools. Schools in Georgia, New Jersey, Ohio, and other states are also recycling schools. Recycling old buildings into schools is less expensive and takes less time than building new schools. Recycling schools also helps the environment by leaving space for trees.

McGwire has never openly admitted to steroid use. However, during a hearing before the U.S. Congress in 2005, he did not deny using the muscle-building drugs.

Check out the stats for the two newest members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.
Ripken grew up near Baltimore, Maryland, where he played pro baseball throughout his 21-year career. He was a two-time American League Most Valuable Player and set a record for playing the most games in a row: 2,632.
Gwynn grew up in California, where he played basketball and baseball. He decided to play baseball professionally and became one of the sport's best hitters. During his 20-year career, he led the National League in batting average eight times.

The cheetah cubs, then just 10 weeks old, explored the outdoors under the watchful eye of their mother, Tumai. It was a big event for the zoo! The fuzzy, caramel-colored cats were the first cheetahs born at the zoo in its 115-year history.
Zoo workers have been caring for the animals, which were born in late November. At the time of their first public appearance, the spotted cubs were about the size of house cats, weighing 10 pounds each. They will grow to their full adult weight of 100 pounds within about a year.
As the fastest land animals, cheetahs can run up to 70 miles an houras fast as a car travels on a highway.
Cheetahs can run at top speeds for only a short distanceabout the length of three football fields.
Cheetahs have small heads, wiry bodies, and long legs that enable them to run quickly.
The cheetahs' outdoor playtime has been limited to several hours a day because of chilly temperatures. ""They actually seem to like the snow,"" said the zoo's cheetah keeper, Craig Saffoe.
Cheetahs are the world's fastest land animals. In the wild, the fast cats live mainly in Africa, but they are heading toward extinction as they lose their natural habitat. The National Zoo is working with groups in Africa to help protect cheetahs.
In the meantime, the zoo is proud of its newest cheetah cubs, whose individual personalities have started to shine. ""One girl is very mischievous, while the other is very [pushy],"" Saffoe told reporters. ""One of the males loves to climb trees, and his brother is very relaxed.""

The zoo reopened its doors over the summer. It welcomed its first visitors since the war with Iraq began in March. Today, the Baghdad zoo is home to about 80 animals. In addition to the lions, the zoo's animals include brown bears, monkeys, cheetahs, and rare birds.
Before the war began, this zoo in Baghdad was one of the largest in the Middle East. More than 600 animals were housed there.
When fighting began, the zoo was turned into a battleground. At one point, the zoo's population dropped to as few as six animals.
Many animals died and others were stolen, especially many of the birds. The cages of other animals were left open. Animals, such as lions and camels, roamed the streets. Other animals, locked in their cages, were left without food and water.
U.S. soldiers were the first people to come to the animals' rescue. They secured the zoo, found some of the wild creatures, and helped feed them. Since then, wildlife groups have helped nurse many of the sick animals back to health.
To people in Iraq, the reopened zoo is a sign of hope for their country. ""The Iraqi people see it as a small but important step in returning the country to [normal],"" said one wildlife rescue worker.

The wildfires that recently swept through southern California have been called one of the Golden State's worst natural disasters. The raging wildfires destroyed homes, businesses, and forests. Nearly 750,000 acres burned-an area of land about the size of Rhode Island. ""The whole sky seemed as if it was on fire,"" said one California resident.
Investigators say both people and nature were to blame for the fires. The fires spread rapidly because of the Santa Ana winds, which blow hot, dry air from the desert. Cold and rainy weather eventually rolled in to help quench the flames.
About 15,000 firefighters battled flames that were out of control. Thousands of people had to quickly

Bush, the 43rd president, is the Republican candidate who wants to be reelected. His running mate is Vice President Richard Cheney.
John Kerry, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, is the Democratic candidate running against Bush. His running mate for vice president is John Edwards, a U.S. senator from North Carolina.
John Kerry and John Edwards are the Democratic team.
With Election Day just weeks away, the presidential candidates are crisscrossing the country on the campaign trail to get their messages out. They are meeting voters, giving speeches, and telling people why they think they are best qualified to lead the country.
The candidates are also speaking out about important
, or problems, that our country faces. Some of those issues include rebuilding Iraq, protecting the environment, and improving schools.
Political polls predict that the 2004 presidential election will be a close race. The candidates know that every vote will count.
""I want to be your president for four more years,"" Bush said in a speech on the campaign trail. ""From creating jobs to improving our schools, from fighting terror to spreading the peace, we made much progress, and there is more to do.""
Those issues are important to Kerry too. ""You meet incredible people, and you want to make their lives better,"" said Kerry. ""They tell you about their lives--their schools, the cost of health care, or their sons and daughters serving in Iraq. It's a huge sense of responsibility and a daily reminder of why elections are so important.""
Who will be the best person for the job? The American people will decide on Election Day.
Winning the presidential election tops the list of George W. Bush and John Kerry these days, but that wasn't always the case. Both candidates dreamed of being sports stars as kids.
President Bush was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on July 6, 1946. His family moved to Texas not long after he was born.
As a child, Bush dreamed of becoming a baseball player. One of his hobbies was collecting baseball cards. When he was 10 years old, Bush used to mail cards to famous baseball players to have them autographed and returned to him.
Before being elected president in 2000, Bush was a part owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He also served as governor of Texas for six years.
Senator Kerry was born in Denver, Colorado, on December 11, 1943. His family moved to Massachusetts a few months after he was born.
As a child, Kerry wanted to become a hockey player and even thought about becoming a football player. His interest in sports continued through the years. He played hockey, soccer, and lacrosse in college.
As he grew up, Kerry began to think about public service. Before serving as a Massachusetts senator for the past 20 years, Kerry was the lieutenant governor of that state for two years.

Thousands of kids recently had a sneak peek at the world of tomorrow. They experienced talking robots, underwater vehicles, and lifesize video games. These inventions were among the 150 creations at this years NextFest fair. The four-day festival was held in New York City, New York.
NextFest gave inventors a chance to unveil their latest creations. Many were right out of the lab. Others were still being developed. Here are a few of the high-tech gadgets that captured our attention.
Actroid is a robot designed to look and talk like a human.
Dont let this photo fool you! Actroid may look real, but she is actually a
or humanlike, robot. She was designed to greet and entertain people. When Actroid talks, she moves her hands and makes eye contact. Other versions of this robot are programmed to reply to hundreds of questions, such as ""What time is it?"" and ""Are you a real person?""
What is it like to live like a sea creature? The Bionic Dolphin gives people the chance to find out. The vehicle can cruise across the water at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour (mph) and then dive at least 10 feet. Its inventor, Thomas Rowe, designed the vehicle with wings to enable it to ""fly"" underwater as fast as 40 mph. ""The majority of my research was on dolphins, but where I got the most help was penguins and diving birds,"" Rowe told
The Bionic Dolphin was first designed for
or play. However, it may be used in the future to save whales entangled in nets. A larger version of the vehicle has been designed to rescue people lost at sea. ""It swallows them,"" says Rowe.
What combines music, rock climbing, and video games? Its a musical climbing wall called DigiWall. This climbing wall has interactive games based on speed, cooperation, and creativity. ""We wanted to do some kind of computer game where you are very physical,"" project leader Mats Liljedahl told
""We removed the computer screen, and instead we are using the lights and the grips."" The grips light up when they are touched.
Robonaut may help astronauts in future space missions. The robot is being designed by NASA, the U.S. space agency. The robot will ""perform tasks that up until now only astronauts could do,"" NASA engineer Roger Rovekamp told
Robonaut can operate on its own or be controlled by a human operator from Earth or in space. The operator would wear a special headset that displays live video from the cameras on the robots head. By wearing a glove with sensors, that person can control the actions of Robonauts fingers, which can hold tools as small as tweezers.
""I got to see some awesome exhibits,"" says
kid reporter Michaela Ritz. The 11-year-old was on the scene at NextFest. Along with checking out the latest gadgets, Michaela caught up with some inventors to learn more about their unique designs.
What was her favorite invention? Brainball! In this game, players wear headbands that monitor their stress levels by measuring brain waves. A computer directs a ball away from the player who is calmer.
""You needed to relax in order to get the ball into the opponents circle,"" says Michaela. ""It is a good game for relieving stress.""

An adult head louse is about the size of a sesame seed.
Spiders and bats may spook you, but nothing will make your skin crawl more than head lice. Each year, 6 million to 12 million Americans get lice. Many of those affected are school kids.
Head lice outbreaks are the number-one reason that kids miss school. Now the National Parent Teacher Association is fighting back against lice. The group is launching a program called Keeping Our Kids Lice Free.
The tiny bugs, each about the size of a sesame seed, spread quickly from one person to another. The bugs cant fly, but they can crawl.
Experts say the most common way to catch lice is through head-to-head contact. Lice can also be spread through the sharing of personal items such as hats, scarves, headphones, barrettes, and combs.
Head lice dont discriminate. They like everybody equally. It doesnt matter how often a person showers or bathes. Health experts say to follow these tips to keep the bugs from making your head their home.
Avoid touching your head to someone elses head.
Dont share personal items with your friends or classmates.
Use your own sleeping bag and pillow on sleepovers.

Join families across the U.S. and Canada in practicing ""The Great Escape"" on October 11, 2000, at 7:00 p.m. You'll be part of the world's largest fire drill! Better yet, you and your family will know exactly what to do if there is ever a fire in your home.
Test your doors and windows. They must all open easily so that you can get out easily.
Are there any boxes, toys, or pieces of furniture blocking your escape path? Move them out of the way!
Make sure all smoke alarms are working by pushing the test buttons.
: Newer smoke alarms have a universal signal repetition pattern of three beeps, followed by a one and a half second pause.
Start your home fire escape drill by assigning one member of the family to push the test button on your smoke alarm. When you hear the alarm, spring into action!
Feel around the door frame and the space between the door and frame with the back of your hand. Is it warm? For the first run through of your drill, pretend that it's not warm. That means you can exit the room safely because the fire is not nearby.
For the second drill, pretend that the door does feel warm. What's your plan now?
At the end of each drill, meet outside at your family meeting area. Practice your home fire escape plan at least twice a year with every member of your household.
Many communities have 911 emergency telephone service. Other communities have a different number for help in an emergency. What is the emergency telephone number where you live?
""Change the batteries in your smoke alarm once a year. Get into the habit of changing smoke alarm batteries on the same day each year, such as a special holiday, birthday, or when you change your clocks in the fall.""

Over the years, many people have dreamed of going to Mars. The day when travel to Mars is possible is coming closer. Robot spacecraft have already traveled there. Those spacecraft have made many amazing discoveries.
The most recent spacecraft to journey to the fourth rock from the sun is
. It started orbiting the red planet more than a year ago.
Recent photos taken by Mars Odyssey show that Mars has water. Because it is very cold on Mars, the water is frozen. Most of the water is frozen under the surface of Mars.
Even though lots of ice crystals are mixed in with the Martian soil, Mars doesn't have as much water as Earth has. Mars has lakes of water, not oceans of water. In fact, scientists say that if you collected all the water on Mars, it would fill a lake about twice the size of Lake Michigan.
There is evidence that some of the frozen water locked under the surface of Mars might melt every once in a while. Some of the water is only 18 inches below the surface. Molten rock deep beneath the surface of Mars might heat the ice. The melted ice might mix with salt deposits in the Martian soil and flow down steep canyon walls.

Not all scientists agree, however. Many scientists say wind blowing across Mars caused the streaks. Scientists have long known about powerful wind storms on Mars. Some of those storms blow across the surface for months at a time.
Even if liquid water and life do not exist on Mars today, many scientists agree with Danny. They want to explore the red planet.""I'm interested in Mars because it's probably the most fascinating planet in the solar system besides Earth, and probably the only one that could have ever supported other forms of life,"" said one NASA scientist.

Mei Xiang (MAY SHONG) is a 2-year-old female panda. Her name means ""beautiful fragrance."" Tian Tian (tee-YEN tee-YEN) is a 3-year-old male panda. His name means ""more and more.""
The map shows China, the most populated country in the world. More than 1.2 billion people live within China's 3.7 million square miles.
The two pandas arrived from China aboard a plane called
. From the airport, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian were taken to the National Zoo, where they will live for the next ten years.
Officials at the National Zoo agreed to give China $10 million in exchange for lending the United States the two pandas. That money will be used to protect pandas from becoming extinct in central China.
About 1,000 pandas live in the mountain forests of central China, where they eat mainly bamboo shoots. The pandas need the forests to survive.
The land where pandas are found, however, is being cleared and used for farmland. The trees are being used for firewood to heat people's homes.
There are now seven pandas living in the United States. Two are in Washington, D.C.; two are in Atlanta, Georgia; and three are in San Diego, California.
One of those seven pandas is a baby. The baby panda, Hua Mei, was born at the San Diego Zoo on August 21, 1999.
Hua Mei is the first baby panda born in the Western Hemisphere since 1990. When he was born, he weighed less than 5 ounces and looked more like a rat than a panda.
Fa Mingzhi is one of more than 4 million people who live near the area where the pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian come from. Most of the people who live in that area are farmers who need the forest to survive.
Like many people, Fa Mingzhi wants to protect the animals. But, she says, people want to eat, too. ""It's good to protect the panda, but it's harder now on the people who live here,"" she said.
As pandas and the people of China compete for the same resources, both face an uncertain future.

252,"The Southeast: Exploring the 'Land of the Flowers'
Long before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, Spaniards had explored and settled large parts of what is now the United States.
One of the regions the Spanish explored first was the Southeast. Hernando de Soto and 600 followers were the first European explorers to journey through the Southeast. For nearly four years, de Soto and his followers wandered through the region.
After sailing from Cuba in 1539, de Soto landed in Florida. An earlier Spanish explorer, Juan Ponce de Len, had named the land
, after a Spanish word meaning ""flowery"".
La Florida was much larger then present-day Florida. It covered most of the area in what are now the southeastern states. One of de Soto's men described the animals the explorers found. ""There are many lions and bears in Florida, wolves, deer, jackals, cats and rabbits (also live there),"" he wrote.
Many different groups of Native Americans lived in La Florida. They grew corn, beans and squash. They also fished and hunted.
Because the native groups did not trust de Soto, they often left their villages before the Spaniards arrived. The Native Americans had good reason to fear de Soto. He captured and enslaved some of them.
De Soto and his men were mainly looking for gold. The search for gold led them out of present-day Florida north to what is now Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
After reaching North Carolina without finding gold, the explorers turned west and crossed the Appalachian Mountains. Upon hearing rumors of gold, de Soto led his men into Tennessee and south to Alabama.
In southern Alabama, the Choctaw Indians attacked the explorers. They killed many of de Soto's men, and some of his supplies were taken.
De Soto's expedition then turned northwest through Alabama and into present-day Mississippi. In May 1541, de Soto reached the Mississippi River, near what is now Memphis, Tennessee. Then they crossed into Arkansas, where in May 1542, De Soto died.
The explorers then retreated to the Mississippi River, where they built boats, which sailed down the river to the Gulf of Mexico. Only about half of the people who had landed with de Soto in Florida survived the trek across the Southeast.

""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

According to the National Research Council, one out of every four cats and dogs in the United States weighs too much. How did these animals get so plump? Many of their owners overfeed them.
Like people, overweight cats and dogs have a greater risk of developing heart disease and other health conditions. The clue for determining whether a pet is overweight is in the ribs. ""If you can feel the ribs under your pet's skin but not see them, your pet is a perfect weight,"" animal expert Karen Volkerts told
Owners can help their plump pups and fat cats shed some extra pounds. Animal experts recommend feeding pudgy pets smaller portions, reducing their number of feedings, and using diet pet food. Regular exercise will also help pets trim down and stay healthy.
Many owners reward their pets or show them affection by giving them table scraps and other treats. Volkerts says that dogs and cats have their own food for a reason. ""They aren't able to digest human food,"" she said. What should people do who want to spoil their pets? ""Play with them,"" she said.

Stalagmites rise from the ground. Stalactites resemble icicles and hang from a caves ceiling.
Californias newly discovered cave creatures hold clues to monitoring changes in the environment.
caves of two national parks in central California, scientists made an amazing discovery. They found 27 previously unknown species of spiders, centipedes, millipedes, and scorpion-like creatures. The scientists explored 34 of 238 known caves in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks over three years and recently released their findings.
or animals without backbones. The discoveries included a tiny pill bug that is
or almost clear. Its internal organs are visibleeven its bright-yellow liver! There was also a daddy longlegs with a jaw larger than its body, as well as a little, bright-orange spider. Some creatures were so tiny that scientists had to use the fine hairs of a paintbrush to collect them.
""We thought we might find a handful of new species,"" says Joel Despain, a cave expert for the parks. ""It was amazing to find 27.""
Why had the cave creatures gone undetected? Though it is rare to find unknown animal species on Earths surface, the same is not true for caves. Like the deep sea, caves are difficult to reach and havent been explored as thoroughly as the surface.
Discovering so many unknown species was thrilling for Jean Krejca. She is a scientist with Zara Environmental, the Texas-based group that led the project. ""You get the feeling that youre Lewis and Clark, charting undiscovered territory,"" says Krejca. ""Caves are one of the last frontiers.""
This millipede is one of the less strange creatures scientists find in caves. Creatures are often blind and have no pigment.
The creatures are unique not only because they are found just in caves but also because some are found in only a single cave or a specific part of a cave. ""There are usually more creatures at the caves entrance because there is more food there,"" scientist Rob Myers of Zara Environmental told
""The farther back in a cave, the more you find creatures have adapted to cave life. What you find is more and more strange. The creatures are often blind and have no pigment.""
A creature such as the pill bug, for example, doesnt need pigment in its skin because it doesnt have to protect itself from the sun. And the daddy longlegs probably developed such big jaws to quickly grab prey, which is scarce inside caves.
The next task is to name the new species. Specialists called
are working to classify and name the creatures.
Scientists will also study the new species to determine whether their populations are healthy. Cave animals can teach scientists a lot about the environment because the creatures are sensitive to changes in the
An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that interacts with the environment. If cave creatures decline, it could signal problems or changes in the environment.
The recent discoveries have led park officials to plan to protect the caves and the newfound species. ""Now that we know the species are there, we can use them to learn more about cave ecosystems and life on this planet,"" says Myers.
Think Critically Why, do you think, is more food found at the entrance to a cave?
What do you call someone who explores and studies caves? A
""Caves are absolutely dark,"" Rob Myers of Zara Environmental told
""They are darker than your bedroom gets at night. There is zero light in a cave, so you cant see a hand in front of your face.""
When a spelunker heads into a cave, he or she wears a helmet with a headlamp and carries an extra flashlight. The cave explorer also wears elbow pads and kneepads to crawl along the rocky floor. Many caves are underground, so the explorer slides down on ropes connected to special harnesses.
While there, a spelunker might see the magnificent cone-shaped formations of

, scientists who study volcanoes, rushed to the mountain. Mount Etna is on Sicily, an island that is a part of Italy.
The scientists went to Sicily to learn from the 3,000-year old volcano. One of the things they wanted to learn is how to predict when a volcano will erupt.
Dozens of vulcanologists bravely climbed Mount Etna each day. They hoped that the mountain of fire would be a good teacher. ""We will probably learn more about this volcano during this eruption than had been learned in 3,000 years"", said Borris Behnke, a German scientist.
Climbing Mount Etna is more dangerous than climbing some other volcanoes. The scientists risked being burned by the rivers of lava flowing down the volcano. Hot lava flowed from both the top of the volcano and from many
, or holes, along the volcano's sides.
Etna was also hurling huge rocks into the air. ""Some of them are bigger than cars and some might be as big as trucks,"" said Behnke.
Some of the scientists didn't need to climb Mount Etna. Over the past few years, scientists had placed hundreds of sensors on the volcano. The sensors gather data about the lava flow and send the data by radio to scientists located a safe distance from the volcano.
The sensors also record earthquakes. Earthquakes in a volcanic area can mean that the volcano is about to erupt. In the days before Mount Etna erupted, the sensors had picked up more than 2,600 small earthquakes.
Behnke says that lava may erupt from Mount Etna for at least six more months. During that time, he plans to climb the volcano many times, risking his life to learn firsthand what is happening.

""What should I wear today?"" That's a question you might ask yourself in the morning. For some kids, the answer is the same every daya school uniform. Officials in Elmira, New York, are currently debating whether students should wear uniforms in the next school year. Uniforms would contribute to ""building pride within our school and community,"" Elmira Superintendent Raymond Bryant told

Uniforms make schools better places in which to learn, supporters say. They argue that dress codes often improve discipline and lessen bullying and teasing. ""I think [uniforms help] students focus on their academics and not the latest fashion,"" principal Megan Mannion told
Her school, Rankin Elementary School in Akron, Ohio, has had a uniform policy since 1995.
""The best thing I like about our uniform is the style, especially the shirts and sweaters,"" says Rankin fourth grader Clifton Harris. It's not just the look that makes the grade.

Her classmate Wade Fleetwood agrees. ""Kids should be allowed to wear different styles of clothes.""

A great white shark cruised across the Indian Ocean in a record-breaking swim. The great white became the first shark known to complete a round-trip journey between two continents.
""This is the first time that an individual fish has been found to go across an entire ocean and come back to the same spot,"" says Ramn Bonfil, one of the scientists who studied the shark. Scientists named the shark Nicole, after Australian actor Nicole Kidman.
Nicole not only set a distance record but also took a bite out of the speed record. The great white clocked more than 12,400 miles on her trip from South Africa to Australia and back. She
or moved between locations, faster than any other marine animal.
The map shows Nicoles route between South Africa and Australia.
Great whites live mainly off the coasts of California, South Africa, and Australia. Nicoles 99-day journey was tracked with an electronic tag placed on her fin.
The tag recorded her movements, including how deep she dove in the water. The results stunned scientists. They discovered that there is more interaction among great white populations in Africa and Australia than had previously been thought.
The new find is helping scientists learn more about how sharks migrate and
(find their way). Why might Nicole have swum so far so fast? Scientists dont know for sure, but they think one of the reasons that she may have made the trip was a search for food. Great white sharks feed mainly on whales, seals, and fish.
And how did Nicole find her way from one continent to another? Although she frequently plunged to depths of more than one-half mile, Nicole spent most of her time swimming on the surface. That led scientists to suspect that great whites might use the sun and the moon to help navigate.
The recent discoveries have excited shark lovers. ""Its clear that we have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg,"" says Bonfil. ""There is still much to learn about great white shark migrations.""
Great whites arent the only big fish in the sea. There are about 370 species, or types, of sharks. Here are some sharks that make a splash.
The whale shark grows up to 40 feet long and weighs about 15 tons. Thats heavier than two elephants!
The dwarf lantern shark is thought to be one of the smallest sharks. It is about 6 inches long.
Although most sharks swim about 1.5 miles per hour (mph), the mako shark is thought to cruise around at 22 mph.
The dusky shark has the most powerful bite. Its jaws clamp together with 132 pounds of force.

Scientists were conducting a study of fish at Meadow Lake in New York City. To their horror, they found a fish with a long body, a snakelike head, and razor-sharp teeth. They counted another and another, until there were five in all. At that point, they knew they had a problem.
Snakehead fish can slither over land from one body of water to another and can breathe air. They dine greedily and can clear a pond of all its fish. They are among the hundreds of

An invasive species is a plant or an animal that does not belong in the area in which it is living. Many invasive species lack

Snakehead fish arrived in the United States from China and Korea, most likely as pets. When their owners no longer wanted them, they threw the fish into nearby lakes and streams. Snakehead fish now live in several states, from Maryland to California.
Snakehead fish aren't the only accidental arrivals. In the Great Lakes region, fingernail-sized zebra mussels hitchhiked from Russia in the water tanks of ships. Now the mussels clog pipes that provide drinking water to homes and schools.
In Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, young emerald ash borers have killed more than 6 million trees. These beetles likely arrived from China in wood packing material carried in ships or airplanes.
And in Hawaii, tiny coqui (koh-KEE) frogs are now a huge problem. The frogs hitched a ride to the ""Aloha State"" in a plant shipment from Puerto Rico. The noisy frogs produce a piercing sound that keeps people awake at night.
Scientists in New York are trying to control the snakehead fish population by increasing the salt levels in the lake. Snakeheads can't survive in salty water.

Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.

Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,

The astronauts traveled to the moon aboard the
spacecraft. The main mission of the Apollo program was to put Americans on the moon. When Armstrong became the first person to set foot on the moon, he spoke these famous words: ""That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.""

The new spaceship will take the place of the space shuttle. NASA plans to end the space shuttle program within the next five years.
The first phase of the plan to return to the moon calls for a launch in 2012. The vehicle would bring crews and supplies to the
, a research laboratory in space. Later, the vehicle will carry four astronauts to the moon for a weeklong mission.
'We will ... extend the human presence across the solar system and beyond.'
The moon mission is part of President George W. Bush's long-term space plan. Last year, the president promised to return astronauts to the moonthe first step in an eventual mission to Mars.
The main goal of the mission is to build a research base on the moon where humans can live and work. The moon is very different from Earth. Unlike Earth, there is no air, wind, or weather. The moon's dusty surface is pitted with craters.
While on the moon, astronauts hope to demonstrate that they can ""live off the land."" Learning how to live off the land is important for future human missions to Mars. Because Mars is so far from Earth, traveling there will require humans to stay for long periods of time.
The United States has already begun using robots to explore Mars. Two robotic vehicles,
, are on the Red Planet now. They are searching for signs of water, a requirement for life. Another vehicle, called an orbiter, is on its way. The orbiter is set to arrive in March and will circle Mars, studying the planet for signs of water.
Should We Go Back to the Moon?
Although some space experts and lawmakers praise the plan to return to the moon, others oppose it because of the high cost. The project is set to cost $104 billion.
Some people think that money should be used for other causes, such as helping to rebuild the Gulf Coast after the hurricanes Katrina and Rita. But NASA is quick to defend the space program. ""[It] is a long-term investment in our future,"" says Griffin.
Others say that the public needs to keep being reminded of the ultimate goal. Scientist Louis Friedman says, ""If you don't keep the Mars mission out front, people are going to ask, 'Why are we returning to the moon?' It's got to be because we're extending ourselves into the solar system.""
In 1961, President John F. Kennedy promised to land a person on the moon by the end of the 1960s. It was part of the ""Space Race"" with the then Soviet Union. Each country wanted to be the first to send a human to the moon. The time line shows some famous moon milestones and a vision for the future.

John started the effort through his church and hopes to help hundreds of schoolchildren in that war-torn country. His goal is to raise $30,000 to purchase and deliver the playground to an elementary school located outside Kabul, the country's capital. The school has 800 students.
Where did he get the idea for his project? ""I've seen on the news and read newspaper and magazine articles about how people are trying to rebuild Afghanistan--in particular, the schools,"" John said. ""I thought 'Now, what does every school need? That's right, a safe playground!'""
So far, John has raised more than $7,000. The not-for-profit organization AmeriCares will help ship the playground to the school in Afghanistan when John finishes raising the money. The playground equipment will include swings, slides, and monkey bars.

It was a big day at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. First the mother cheetah came out of her cage. Then came one, two, three, four, five cubs. The babiesborn this summerleaped and played around their mother. The cubs, then just 10 weeks old, weighed only 9 pounds and were about the size of house cats.
The litter was the second born at the zoo in seven monthsand in its 116-year history. Cheetahs are extinct in the wild except in Africa, where only between 8,000 and 10,000 remain.

As smoke billowed from the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, a dark cloud seemed to descend over the world.
As news of the terrorist attacks spread, people were shocked and horrified by the terrible events.
Throughout the world, people expressed outrage at the attack. ""It's just sick,"" said one firefighter. An airplane expert said, ""This is perhaps the [worst] terrorist attack that's ever happened in the world.""
Like adults, kids were very upset by the attacks. Many of them first learned about the brutal attacks at school.
In many schools, students and teachers comforted one another. Teacher Diane Bulens said the principal at her school in California told the teachers to watch out for the students and then ""told the kids to take care of the teachers.""
Donna Taylor, a teacher in Ohio, said some of the students in her school had friends and family in New York and Washington, D.C.
One student was worried about her father, who was in New York. Taylor offered to let the student use her cell phone to learn whether her father was OK. He was!
Taylor told her students that terrorists wanted ""to disrupt everyone's lives, but we aren't going to allow them to disrupt our day.""
Even though teachers and students looked after one another, many were still fearful that something more would happen. Erin Ricketts, age 11, feared that her state would be attacked. ""I heard California may be next,"" she said. She added that she was worried ""because my mom works in a big building.""
After school, many students went home to talk with their parents about the attacks. Doctors say that in this tragic time, kids, parents, and teachers need to talk to one another. By coming together, Americans will grow and become stronger than ever.

Every student in class has a remote control, and the kids are clicking away at the screen. But they aren't changing channels. They're taking a test! Terry Rex's fourth graders at Wings Park Elementary School in Oelwein, Iowa, are using a new kind of classroom technology. Instead of writing with pencils on exam papers, the students use remote controls to take tests.
""It's more fun,"" Courtney Ricchio, 9, told
""I don't have to write, and my hand doesn't get tired."" The remote controls are part of the Classroom Performance System (CPS). When students use CPS to take a test, the questions appear on an electronic screen. Students key in their answers on the remote-control response pad.
Rex is one of the first teachers in Iowa to use CPS. His students use the technology for more than taking tests. They also play learning games with the system. Sam Myott, 9, says his favorite CPS activity is a football game. ""It's a math game with multiplication and subtraction,"" he told
""Since it's on the computer, it's more fun than a worksheet on your desk.""
Some teachers think using CPS to grade a test is more
or a better use of time, than grading a written test. The computer keeps track of the students' answers and prints out their grades at the end of the day. The computer also reports which questions the class found most difficult to answer, so Rex can review them with the group.
Classrooms across the country are trying out new teaching gadgets.
Sixth graders Marina Gagliano and Kerry O'Conner of Wellwood Middle School in Fayetteville, New York, label parts of a microscope on an interactive whiteboard. The whiteboard allows students to use their fingers to click and tap answers on the projected image.
Fourth and fifth graders at Elton Hills Elementary School in Rochester, Minnesota, are on the move. Their classrooms have no chairs!

The fourth grader swam the 1.4 miles between Alcatraz Island and San Francisco in just less than two hours. He swam to raise money for Hurricane Katrina victims.
Although Johnny trained for three months, the water was colder and wavier than he had expected. Johnny made it to the shore by telling himself, ""Im almost there. Im almost there.""
His classmates were waiting on shore, cheering ""Go, Johnny! Go, Johnny!"" When he came out of the chilly water, his father hugged him and said, ""Can you believe it? You did it!""
Johnny successfully made the trek that Alcatraz prisoners had dared to cross years ago. Alcatraz Island housed a prison from 1934 to 1963. In 1962, three prisoners escaped by swimming across the bay. They were never heard from again, so it remains a mystery whether they made it through the frigid waters to land.
Johnny didnt only raise more than $30,000 for his swim. He also reportedly became the youngest person to swim the distance from Alcatraz to San Francisco.

That is exactly the point. ""The museum shows what happens to our trash, how we can reduce our trash, and what we can do instead of throwing our trash away,"" said museum director Sotoria Montanari.
Today, Americans create more garbage than ever before. In the early 1900s, most items were packed in containers that could be used again. Now, most of the food we buy, from cereal to milk, comes in boxes and cartons that can be thrown away.
So what happens to trash after it is tossed out? Some trash ends up in

The 30-foot-wide wings carried Leden about 35 feet into the air. Her flight lasted for 17 seconds.
The plans for Leden's flight were 500 years in the making, but she was airborne for a fraction of a minute.
The story of Leden's flight begins in Italy in the late 1400s. Italy is a country in Europe. At the time, Italy was caught up in the Renaissance. Many great artists lived during the Renaissance.
One of the greatest artists of the Renaissance was Leonardo da Vinci. Though da Vinci is best known for his art, he was also an inventor. He drew many machines that wouldn't actually be built for centuries. For example, he drew pictures of an armored car, a helicopter, a hot-air balloon, and a submarine.
Between 1490 and 1505, da Vinci made several drawings of a glider. A glider is an aircraft that doesn't have an engine. It glides on air currents. The wings that Leden used were based on da Vinci's glider.

Our classroom play celebrates Philadelphia's hometown hero. Discover how his hard work helped to improve the lives of all Americans.
Honor the 300th birthday of one of our countrys greatest thinkers, inventors, and statesmen with our classroom play.
Each morning, Benjamin Franklin asked himself, ""What good shall I do today?"" And that is how he lived his life.
His can-do attitude launched him into the history books as one of Americas most famous citizens. Ben was a printer, a writer, an inventor, a community leader, and a founder of our nation.
Ben was born in a cottage in Boston on January 17, 1706. He attended school only between the ages of 8 and 10. Bens education was cut short because his family was poor and needed him to work.
His love of learning, however, stayed with him throughout his life. Ben read all the time. He often went without food to buy books! At 12, he began his lifelong love of printing.
In honor of the 300th anniversary of Bens birth, our three-act play looks at some key events in the life of this great American. Find out how his good deeds helped shape the history of our country.
ACT 1: Ben the Young Man, Boston, 1718-1723
Bens older brother, James, owns a printing press that publishes a very popular newspaper,
In 1718, Bens father decides that 12-year-old Ben should work for James.
At that time, Ben signs a document promising he will work for his brother until he is 21, without pay. In return, his brother is to provide Ben with food and clothes.
Ben likes to read and is a good editor and proofreader. Over the next few years, he learns all about printingand even begins writing letters to the newspaper under a different name. Thanks to Bens sense of humor and clever writing in those letters,
becomes one of the most-read newspapers in Boston.
James finds out that the letters are from his brother and he becomes jealous of Ben. James is furious and vows never to publish any of Bens writing again. He also finds fault with Bens work, even though Ben rarely makes errors.
I know I am a better printer than he is.
You cant leave! You have to work for me until you are 21!
Youll never find a job in this city! Youll come crawling back to me.
But Ben never comes back to his brother. Instead, he leaves in the early morning and runs away to New York City, in hopes of finding work as a printer. After not finding a job there, he heads to New Jersey where he boards a boat to Philadelphia.
The journey is three days long, and Ben is dirty, hungry, and penniless. But Philadelphia is a lively city, and Ben loves it.
ACT 2: Ben the Community Leader, Philadelphia, 1723-1740s
After arriving in Philadelphia, Ben works to establish himself as a printer. In 1728, he opens a printing shop and begins publishing his own newspaper,
A few years later, he also publishes
The book includes weather forecasts, recipes, and jokes. It also contains some of Bens sayings, such as ""Well done is better than well said."" The almanac becomes a best seller and makes Ben wealthy.
Although Ben works to better himself,it is also important to him to help the community. He considers Philadelphia his hometown and works to make life in the city better.
Ben starts projects to pave and sweep Philadelphias streets. He redesigns the citys streetlights so that roads are safe at night.
Ben also helps set up the first public library, hospital, and volunteer fire department. At this time, most houses in Philadelphia are made of wood and stand side by side. When a fire breaks out, it can destroy an entire neighborhood.
Extra! Extra! Fire destroys row houses on Market Street!
We need to train men to fight fires so that this doesnt keep happening.
Ben persuades more than 30 men to form the Union Fire Company.
We nominate Ben as our fire chief.
Ben is appointed fire chief. He makes sure that firefighters are trained to put out fires and rescue people.
(dragging a leather bucket full of water)
(helping a little girl from a burning house)
The Union Fire Company meets once a month to discuss fire prevention. Ben also publishes fire prevention tips in his newspaper.
Bens ideas for Philadelphia help shape how fire departments, hospitals, libraries, and post offices work in other cities.
ACT 3: Ben the Statesman, Philadelphia, 1776
Along with his work in Philadelphia, Ben helps change the course of American history.
At the time, America is made up of 13 Colonies ruled by Britain. England has passed many laws that the Colonists think are unfair.
Ben works to mend the relationship between the Colonies and Britains ruler, King George III.
Despite his efforts, the Colonies decide to break away from Britain. They fight Britain in the Revolutionary War (1775-1783).
Ben is appointed to the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence. This document frees the Colonies from Britains rule.
We have to decide who should write the Declaration of Independence.
I wont. Many people disagree with my opinions.
I cant. I am not a writer.
I am unsure about independence from Britain.
You must write this very important document. Your writing style is perfect.
When Thomas Jefferson finishes his draft, he shows it to Ben.
Ive made small changes. For example, you wrote, sacred and undeniable, and I changed that phrase to make it stronger.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.
On July 4, a group of representatives from the 13 Colonies approve the Declaration of Independence and some people sign the document.
This for King George, so he can read it without his glasses.
On August 2, Ben and others also sign the document. They know they are risking everything for freedom from Britain.
Seven years later, in 1783, Ben negotiates the treaty that ends the Revolutionary War. In 1787, at age 81, he signs the U.S. Constitution.
Ben Franklin dies on April 17, 1790, at the age of 84. He is buried in Philadelphia. In honor of the 300th anniversary of his birth, people across the country will celebrate the life of this remarkable man.
If you could award a medal to Ben Franklin for one of his achievements, which accomplishment would it be? Why?

While coral may look like a plant, it is actually made up of tiny sea animals. Those sea animals are called
As polyps die, they leave hard shells behind. Other polyps grow on top of the shells. Over thousands of years, they form a coral reef in warm water that is not very deep.
In many ways, the Great Barrier Reef resembles an underwater garden. Coral can be hard or soft. It forms in different colors and in strange shapes. Some coral looks like hardened brains. Other coral looks like fans and lettuces. The reef bursts with schools of tropical fish, darting among gaps in the coral.
The reef supplies food and shelter to creatures living in and around the coral. Turtles, sharks, sea horses, and crabs are among its many inhabitants. The reef also acts as a barrier to keep waves from slamming against the shore.
While the reef is important to ocean life, it helps humans, too. People rely on the reef for both food and jobs. It also provides medicine used to treat disease. Each year, the Great Barrier Reef contributes about $975 million to the economy through tourism and fishing.
Is it surprising, then, that the Great Barrier Reef is under too much stress? Fishing nets and ships break off sections and damage the reef. Air and water pollution are also doing harm. At the same time, warmer sea temperatures have caused
on half of the reef. The high temperatures cause the coral to turn white, often killing it.
In an effort to help save the reef, the government has limited fishing to two-thirds of it. That plan increases the number of ""green zones."" Those are areas that are off-limits to fishermen and boats. However, tourists and researchers can still visit them. Many fishermen are upset about the plan because they rely on the reef for jobs.
The Australian government says that its plan will help keep the reef safe from some threats. ""It is very important that we give the reef proper protection for the future,"" said one government official. ""The reef is Australia's greatest natural [treasure].""
Ships and fishing nets are destroying the Great Barrier Reef. They sometimes break off large sections of the reef.

Wheel sports--skateboarding, bike riding, and in-line skating--can be a lot of fun. They are also good ways to get moving. Follow these tips for a safe ride:
Make sure the helmet fits well. (If your helmet rocks forward or backward or from side to side, it's not protecting your head properly.)
Wear wrist guards, elbow pads, and knee pads.

One of the most surprising finds is that parts of Saturn's innermost ringthe D ringhave grown dimmer since 1981. In addition, the D ring has moved 125 miles closer to Saturn.
What do these new discoveries mean? Scientists aren't sure, but hope the discoveries will reveal clues about the age of the rings around the sixth planet from the sun. ""I don't think Saturn's rings will disappear anytime soon, but this tells us how the rings are [changing] and how long they might last,"" says Linda Spilker, a scientist with the U.S. space agency, NASA.
Although Saturn's rings appear solid, they are actually made up of pieces of rock, ice, and dust. Those pieces vary from the size of tiny dust particles to the size of large mountains.
Scientists are also studying the shimmering rings to learn more about how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. They say that Saturn's rings are a model of the gas and dust that once surrounded the sunthe center of the solar system.

The actor recently announced that he is running for governor of California in the state's
election on October 7. The recall is a special election allowed by California law. People will vote whether to remove the current governor, Gray Davis, from office.
Some people in California are unhappy with the job that Davis is doing. They blame him for the state's money problems.
Schwarzenegger, the star of movies such as
and Kindergarten Cop, is one of many people running to replace Davis. The actor is getting a lot of attention because of his movie-star status.
Schwarzenegger is no stranger to politics. From 1990 to 1993, he headed the Council on Physical Fitness under President George H. W. Bush. In 2002, he helped raise millions of dollars for school programs in California.
Schwarzenegger isn't the first actor to try to make the move from Hollywood star to governor. Movie star Ronald Reagan was elected governor of California in 1966. He then served as U.S. president from 1981 to 1989.
Even if he is elected, Schwarzenegger won't be following Reagan's path to the White House. He was not born in the United States, which is a requirement for being president.

spoke to Buzz Aldrin about NASA's planned return to the moon, a future on Mars, and his children's book,
, which was recently featured at the National Book Festival in Washington, D.C.
What does it feel like to walk on the moon?
Aldrin: You knew that you were there, but it was unreal at the same time. It's so different and unusual that it's almost dreamlike.
What was the most memorable part of walking on the moon?
Aldrin: There are two moments that are not recorded on film. They're recorded in my mind. One was just the second or two after we shut the engine down and we realized that the spacecraft was on the moon. That really was the major achievement. When I was outside seeing the Earth, my other thought was that there were only three human beings who were not on Earth. [The third was Michael Collins, who was orbiting the moon in a craft that would take the astronauts back to Earth.]
Your children's book is about following your dreams. Did you dream of being an astronaut?
Aldrin: Well, there wasn't any such thing as an astronaut until about 1958 or 1959.
[the Soviet space satellite] didn't go up until 1957, so thinking of human beings in space was not at all common.
Will returning to the moon have the same impact as it did when you and Mr. Armstrong first set foot on the moon?
Aldrin: No, I don't think there is any way you can replace that competitiveness [to reach the moon first] that existed, that pioneering spirit. The moon is a proving ground in our backyard. We've been there before, but it's preparing us to visit another planet.
You've been a supporter of a piloted mission to Mars. Why do you think it's so important that we send humans to Mars?
Aldrin: Now we can send robots to Mars, but that just wouldn't satisfy the human desire to want to expand our horizons. We've always done that. I can't answer by saying that there is going to be something profitable that will be returned from Mars, other than perhaps storytelling or making movies en route.
Your sister gave you the name ""Buzzer"" when you were youngand then it got shortened to Buzz. And that stuck?

268,"Can Iraq's new constitution help bring peace to this war-torn country?
Although the constitution has been approved, Iraqis clash over the countrys future.
Nothing was going to stand in the way of
Zeinab Sahib, a mother of three, as she voted on Iraqs constitution. She cast her ballot at a school in Baghdad, the war-torn countrys capital. ""I came to vote because I am tired of terrorists, and I want my country to be safe again,"" she says.
Sahib was one of 7 million Iraqis who voted to accept or reject the new constitution on October 15. The ballots took days to count by hand, but the constitution passed. Seventy-eight percent of Iraqis voted to make the constitution the countrys new set of laws. ""It is a landmark day in the history of Iraq,"" White House spokesperson Scott McClellan told reporters. ""The political process is continuing to move forward in Iraq, and it is an encouraging sign to see more and more people participating in the process.""
The new constitution marks a step toward establishing a
in Iraq since U.S.-led forces removed Saddam Hussein from power in 2003. A democracy is a type of government in which people vote for their leaders in elections.
Bringing democracy to Iraq has been a challenge. Violent attacks continue throughout the country as
, or rebels, try to prevent Iraq from becoming a democracy. More than 150,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq, helping to bring peace and stability to the country. The U.S. military has also been training Iraqis to protect themselves from insurgents.
Although the constitution was approved, the country is deeply divided. Not all Iraqis agree on how Iraq should be run. Iraq is made up of three major groupsShiites (SHEE-ights), Sunnis (SOON-eez), and Kurds.
Under Saddam Hussein, who was a Sunni, Shiites and Kurds had little voice in the government. The Shiites who live in southern Iraq and the Kurds who live in northern Iraq largely voted for the new constitution. The Sunnis, a minority group, live in the middle of the country and voted against it.
U.S. troops patrol the site of a car bomb explosion in Baghdad, Iraq, in March 2004.
Many Sunnis, who were in control during Saddam Husseins rule, say the constitution favors Shiites and Kurds. The constitution allows the Shiites and Kurds to govern their own areas. Those regions have more oil than where most Sunnis live. The Sunnis worry that the Shiites and Kurds will control most of the oil and leave them weak and powerless.
Along with granting more power to local governments, the new constitution allows Iraqis to vote for leaders every four years. On December 15, Iraqis will vote on a permanent government. They will choose a
, a lawmaking body, like the U.S. Congress. The new government will have the power to revise the draft constitution. If they decide to revise it, voters will have to approve the changes.
As Iraqis begin running their own government, the United States hopes to begin withdrawing its troops. Since the war began three years ago, more than 2,000 U.S. troops have died. Recent polls show that support for the war has dropped and that many Americans want troops to come home. Others warn that the country still faces many obstacles on its path to stability.
In the meantime, President George W. Bush praised the high participation in Iraqs vote. He says, ""The Iraqis are making inspiring progress toward building a democracy.""
Why are the people of Iraq divided over their form of government?
Size: 168,754 square miles (about twice the size of Idaho)
Religion: About 95 percent of Iraqis are Muslims. They practice the religion of Islam. Shiite Muslims make up about 60 percent of Iraqs population. Sunni Muslims make up about 35 percent.

The mini motorcycles, which are powered by lawn mower engines, are also noisy. They typically reach speeds between 25 and 40 miles an hour. That is about the same speed a car travels on local streets.

Pocket bike racing has been a popular sport in Europe. It has caught on in some communities in the United States during the past few years.

In December, President George W. Bush signed the Angel Island Immigration Station Restoration and Preservation Act. The law provides up to $15 million to set up a museum and research center on the island to help tell stories like Kais. The money will also be used to protect hundreds of poems carved in the wooden walls of the station that describe the difficult journey.
People from China didnt always have difficulty entering the United States. The earliest Chinese immigrants arrived during the California gold rush in the 1840s and 1850s. They nicknamed the United States
or ""Gold Mountain,"" because many of them hoped to strike it rich.
But as the number of Chinese immigrants grew, Americans became less welcoming. In 1882, the U.S. government passed the Chinese Exclusion Act. The law made it almost impossible for Chinese workers to enter the United States.

On Ellis Island, more than 95 percent of travelers were processed quickly and allowed into the United States. On Angel Island, many Chinese immigrants were held for weeks, months, and sometimes even years. After being cruelly questioned by officials, more than 30 percent of immigrants were sent back to China.
Angel Islands doors closed in 1940 when China and the United States became

""We hope that Angel Island becomes a bookend to Ellis Island.""
More than 200 poems are on the walls of Angel Island. The following two poems were recently translated:
Its been a long time since I left my home village
Who could know Id end up imprisoned
Im heartsick when I see my reflection,

According to the age-old myth, Atlantis was a place of great wealth. The ancient kingdom gleamed with gold and silver and was a center for art and learning.
Over time, the people there became corrupt and greedy. As punishment, the gods unleashed powerful earthquakes and floods that swallowed up Atlantis and sank it to the ocean floor.

The breakaway states formed a new country called the Confederate States of America. The other states were called the Union. About 625,000 people died fighting the war.
The Union won the war and the rebel states eventually rejoined the United States. The end of the war also brought about the end of slavery in the United States.

On a summer day in 1963, more than 200,000 people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to rally for equal rights. There, they heard Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Today, construction of a memorial honoring King is under way about a half mile from the Lincoln Memorial, where King gave that famous speech. The new memorial will be the first on the National Mall to honor an African American.
The groundbreaking ceremony for the King memorial was held on November 13. President George W. Bush, former President William Jefferson Clinton, poet Maya Angelou, and talk show host Oprah Winfrey were among the speakers at the event. ""We give Martin Luther King his rightful place among the many Americans honored on the National Mall,"" Bush told the crowd of about 5,000 people.
King (19291968) dedicated his life to helping others. As a boy growing up in the U.S. South, King witnessed African Americans being treated unfairly. At that time, the South was
or separated by race. Under the law, African Americans were not allowed to attend the same schools as white people and had to sit in the backseats of buses. African Americans also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains.
When King was older, he worked to change those unjust laws. During the 1950s and 1960s, he gave speeches and organized peaceful marches and protests.
Beginning in 1955, King led the famous Montgomery bus boycott to protest segregation. For 381 days, African Americans
or refused to use, public buses in the Alabama city. A year after the boycott began, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregation on buses was illegal.
King gained national attention from the boycott. As a result of his work, civil rights laws were passed.
are personal rights to freedom and equality guaranteed to all U.S. citizens and protected by the Constitution.
The King memorial is scheduled to be completed in 2008. The design uses water, stone, and trees to represent the themes of justice, democracy, and hope. The King memorial will also include a boulder called the Stone of Hope, from which will emerge a 30-foot figure of King. The memorial will contain a circular stone wall chiseled with King's words.
King's dream was for all people to be treated fairly and equally under the law. The design of the memorial is based on a line from his historic ""I Have a Dream"" speech: ""We will be able to hew [cut] out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.""

Leaping from his rowboat, Australian crocodile hunter Steve Irwin lands on top of a fierce 12-foot-long crocodile. Covered with mud, Irwin wrestles with the reptile and finally ties up its snout and legs. The out-of-breath hunter then stands in front of the croc and declares, ""She's a beauty!""
Irwin is the star of the hit TV show
. In the United States, 60 million viewers see the wildlife show each week. The show is watched by people in 122 countries around the world.
Irwin, age 38, has been interested in animals and the environment since he was a child. He grew up in a wildlife park in Queensland, a state in Australia. For his sixth birthday, Irwin's parents gave him a 12-foot snake called a scrub python. At age 9, Irwin captured his first crocodile. Ten years ago, Irwin took over the park that his parents had started. Five years ago, his show aired on American TV for the first time.
is about more than wrestling crocodiles, snakes, and other wild animals, Irwin says. He explained that the show is also about making people aware of problems facing many animals.
""We don't run around capturing wildlife for the fun of it,"" Irwin said. ""Our love is to educate and share with the world threatened wildlife. We want to bring animals into your house so that we can share and learn about them.""
For example, Irwin was recently on the Australian island of Tasmania. Irwin was working with the World Wildlife Fund to rescue stranded whales. He wants to call attention to whale hunting in the South Pacific Ocean. ""This practice [whaling] has to stop,"" Irwin said.
Not everyone agrees that Irwin's show is good for animals or the environment.
Kent Vliet does not like ""the haphazard way in which [Irwin] handles snakes and gets bitten."" Vliet is a reptile expert who has worked for the National Geographic Society. Vliet fears that viewers might copy the croc hunter's dangerous moves and get hurt.
Instead of wrestling animals, Vliet said, Irwin should talk more about protecting endangered animals and the environment.
For now, the croc hunter said he will keep on wrestling crocs and snakes and bringing people up close with some of Earth's endangered animals. ""I will continue to put my life on the line to save wildlife,"" he said. ""This is my passion, and it won't stop.""

258,"The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle's grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles.
The disease attacks an infected bird's brain and spinal cord.
At first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird.
In recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year.
Although the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased.
By the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild.
Wildlife experts are especially concerned because they don't know much about the disease, including what causes it. ""We have some ideas, but we don't have any answers,"" John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said.
Experts also don't know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. ""This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn't noticed,"" Fischer said.
While wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Scientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America's bird--the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn't true in 1782.
Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol.
""I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country"", Franklin wrote. ""He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird"".

More than two-thirds of the Himalayan glaciers are already melting. This could spell disaster for countries such as China, India, and Nepal, which depend on rivers fed by melting snow from the glaciers for water.
Despite the loss of a few feet, Everest is still the highest point above sea level. Its peak lies on the border between China and Nepal. The mountain was named after Sir George Everest, who mapped much of South Asia between 1830 and 1843.

337,"Preserving the Past: Saving the Mummies of the Ibaloi
High up in a dense, lush bamboo forest in the Philippines, scientists hike up a steep and narrow trail. (The Philippines is an island country in South-east Asia.)
As the scientists climb higher, they watch out for mud slides and rock falls. Finally, they emerge from under the forest's dripping leaves to face a forbidding black rock. As their eyes adjust to the light, they can see a small, narrow cave near the base of the rock.
Inside that cave, and numerous other nearby caves, is a national treasure. The treasure is not made of gold and silver, however, but of flesh and bone.
The treasure is actually dozens of mummies, some as old as 1,000 years. The Ibaloi people placed the mummies in the caves.
The mummies are the remains of some of the Ibaloi leaders and their families. The descendants of the mummies still live in the Philippines.
The mummies are located in an area called Kabayan in the Cordillera Central mountains. As many as 200 mummies may be located in 50 caves in the mountainous area.
The mummies are important because they tell scientists about past life in the Philippines. The mummies are also

Scientists from the National Museum of Manila in the Philippines are scrambling to find and protect all the mummies. The scientists worry that logging, forest fires, farming, or vandals may damage the mummies.
To protect the mummies, the Philippine government is putting up gates in front of the caves. Guards and tour guides are being hired to show people the mummies and to keep vandals away.
According to museum scientists, it took as much as one year to prepare an Ibaloi mummy. The process started when an Ibaloi tribal leader or family member who was near death drank a very salty liquid called

The body was then strapped to a chair and placed over a low fire, as well as left in the sun to dry, for up to one year. Over time, the body would shrink. The body was then folded and placed in a coffin carved from a pine tree.

Scientists found the lemurs on Madagascar, an island nation off the southeast coast of Africa. Madagascar is home to more than 30 species of lemurs. Most lemurs are the size of small rodents, but some can grow to be as large as a medium-sized dog. Lemurs are usually
animals, which means they mostly sleep during the day and come out at night.
The discovery surprised scientists. ""It's incredibly rare to discover a new species of primate, let alone three new species,"" said Steven Goodman of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.
Lemurs live only in the island nations of Madagascar and Comoros.
The smallest lemur weighs about 1 ounce.
The newly discovered species live only in the rain forests along Madagascar's west coast. They weigh a few ounces and eat beetles, fruits, and plants.
All lemurs on Madagascar are in trouble, however. Scientists fear that lemurs are in danger of becoming extinct.
One threat is from people cutting down the trees in which lemurs live. The trees are being cleared to create farmland. Another threat to lemurs comes from hunters who are trapping the primates for food.
To protect lemurs and the rain forests in which they live, wildlife officials in Madagascar have set up special parks and nature reserves. Loggers and hunters cannot cut down the trees or hunt the animals in the nature reserves.
Scientists hope that the special areas are large enough to protect all the species of lemurs that are living today. Scientists are especially concerned because there may be undiscovered species that need protection. ""So many areas of Madagascar haven't been [explored],"" said Dean Gibson of the Duke University Primate Center. ""I think there are more [species] to find.""

That isnt the only thing the landmarks share. Experts say the Everglades, the Great Barrier Reef, and Kathmandu are in trouble and should be closed off by 2020.
are endangering the landmarks, warns a new report by the Centre for Future Studies (CFS). Global warming is the gradual rise in Earths average temperature.
""The combined impact of too many tourists stomping all over these important sites plus climate change is having a severe [effect],"" Susi Moser, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told
The last nine years were the hottest since scientists began tracking Earths temperature in 1861. Some scientists say global warming will create more
or powerful, hurricanes. Researchers predict that the heat will cause glaciers in the Antarctic to melt. That will cause ocean levels to rise.
Those changes could destroy the Everglades, the CFS report says. Stronger hurricanes could threaten the areas plant and animal species, including American crocodiles and manatees. Rising seawater could flood the swampy region.
Its important to protect the 2,358-square-mile landmark, Jan Michael Jacobson, director of the Everglades Institute, told
""The Everglades primarily is valuable because it is a unique habitat,"" he said.
The historic temples of Kathmandu, Nepal, were built between 1300 and 1800. They draw millions of tourists each year.
The Great Barrier Reef and Kathmandu are facing a different threattourists. The Great Barrier Reef attracts about 1.8 million tourists a year, who pump billions of dollars into Australias economy. Visitors can also damage the delicate system of coral reefs.
Tourists are endangering Kathmandu, too, CFS officials say. The valley is in the shadow of Mount Everest, the worlds tallest mountain. The report warns that skiers and climbers hoping to tackle Mount Everest and other Himalayan peaks may harm Kathmandus ancient temples.
The effects of global warming are already being felt. More than 150 countries are working to stop the rising temperatures. They have
emissions. Those gases contribute to global warming.
As for the Great Barrier Reef and Kathmandu, the CFS report recommends limiting the number of tourists allowed to visit the sites. But some people say that visiting endangered landmarks could encourage tourists to fight for their protection.
Many cars and factories burn fossil fuels. That releases greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the air. Those gases form a layer and trap the suns heat close to Earth.
That process is called the greenhouse effect. The layer of gases acts as a window in a greenhouse doesit lets in heat but doesnt let much out. The result is global warming, a worldwide rise in average temperature.
There are 788 World Heritage Sites, but becoming one is not easy. Landmarks must meet one of 10 requirements. For instance, a site must represent a unique culture or a significant period in history. Independent groups
or examine, each landmark. Then an international committee, which is part of the United Nations, votes on the new sites. The Great Wall of China and the Statue of Liberty are included on the list.

A team of scientists might be ditching the phrase ""oh, rats!"" from their vocabulary. They are experimenting with ways that rats may help find people who are buried as a result of earthquakes or other disasters.
Like dogs, rats have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out survivors. The rodents are also small enough to crawl almost anywhere. Dogs can be limited in their searches because of their larger size.
The scientists trained the rats to recognize the scent of people. To do that, researchers implanted electronic devices into the brains of the animals.
The electronic devices affect the rat's brain so that it picks up the scent of a person and then plans how to locate the person. Signals from the rat's brain are relayed to a radio transmitter that scientists attach to the rodent's back.
Rescue teams then will be able to track those signals and follow the rat's path. That will help rescuers determine where to start digging for survivors. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next nine months.

Scientists working in Argentina are finding larger and larger dinosaurs. About a dozen years ago, they discovered
, a plant eater that was longer than three school buses placed end to end. Now, a scientist says he has uncovered an even larger plant eater.
Jorge Calvo is leading the team of
, scientists who study fossils, who found the giant plant eater. Calvo says the newly discovered dinosaur lived 87 million years ago, stood 52 feet tall, was 130 feet long, and weighed 100 tons. ""It would be safe to say, this is the biggest [dinosaur],"" said Calvo.
The giant plant eater is not the only dinosaur fossil that scientists have recently found in Argentina. Scientists have discovered an area that stretches for hundreds of miles and is loaded with dinosaur fossils. So far, they have found four previously unknown dinosaur species in the area.
The Age of the Dinosaurs began about 225 million years ago and ended 65 million years ago. Scientists divide that huge period of time into three shorter periods, called the Triassic Period, the Jurassic Period, and the Cretaceous Period. The first dinosaurs probably developed about halfway through the Triassic Period. Different dinosaurs lived in each of those three periods.
The dinosaurs discovered in Argentina date from the Jurassic Period. Paleontologists don't yet know much about the dinosaurs that lived during the Jurassic Period. ""Jurassic Period fossils are very, very rare,"" said scientist Gerardo Cladera.
During the Jurassic Period, Earth's temperature was warmer than it is today. The warmer temperature caused glaciers to melt and the sea level to rise. The oceans flooded much of the land, leaving little land area where dinosaur fossils could be preserved.
Calvo's newly discovered dinosaur stood taller than a three-story-high tree. Despite its size, the towering plant eater was preyed on by
, the largest known meat eater. It stood 12 feet tall, had large, serrated teeth, and hunted in packs.
The giant plant eater would have been no match for a pack of hungry giganotosaurs. ""By working as a team, these predators would be able to eat even a giant plant eater,"" explained paleontologist Thomas Holtz.

Homework is on the rise! Nine- to 12-year-olds are spending 20 percent more time studying at home than they spent in 1997, according to a recent study from the University of Maryland. ""Kids spend an average of 50 minutes to 75 minutes studying every day,"" says the studys author, Sandra L. Hofferth.
But is taking schoolwork home a good thing? Two recent books have education experts asking, is homework helpful?

Cooper is one of the countrys leading researchers on homework. He says practicing homework now will help kids in high school. Cooper suggests that students should expect to do 40 minutes of homework each day.
Many teachers see the value of homework as well. ""I think homework is helpful to most kids. It gives them more responsibility,"" fourth-grade teacher Pepper Schrock of Orlando, Florida, told

Meteors are also known as falling stars. They are called falling stars because some people used to think that meteors were stars falling from the sky.
Today, we know that meteors are bits of dust and rock from space. As a meteor speeds through the atmosphere, friction causes it to heat up. The meteor gets so hot that it glows and appears to streak through the sky as it moves.
The dust that forms the Leonid meteor shower came from a comet. A comet is a large ball of frozen dust and gas that

Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on armor and talk to tour guides. This year, more than 2.4 million people from across the country are expected to attend Jamestown events.
Stepping into Jamestown Settlement museum in Virginia is like stepping into the past. And that's just what thousands of people are planning to do this spring. May marks the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America. Organizers are expecting nearly 90,000 visitors on the weekend of May 11 to 13, when many major events are planned.
Jamestown is a tourist destination for people who want a frontrow seat to American history. ""The whole idea is to give people an idea of Jamestown and the world in 1607,"" historian Tom Davidson told
Davidson helped put together exhibits at the Jamestown museum for the anniversary.
Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on English armor and watch experts demonstrate how to fire muskets. Tourists can also go aboard and explore
or models, of the three ships that brought the first settlers to present-day Virginia.
The story of Jamestown began on May 14, 1607, when about 100 English men and boys arrived in present-day Virginia. They came seeking gold and other treasures. The settlers, called

or businesspeople, of the Virginia Company to make money in North America. But the settlers faced many problems, including disease, starvation, and conflict with the area's Powhatan people (see ""
At first, settlers stayed close together for protection. ""There were hundreds of people living inside a wooden-walled fort,"" explains Davidson. Living in the fort helped the settlers defend themselves from attack, but it also made hunting for food or growing crops difficult.
Captain John Smith was one of Jamestown's original leaders. He took command of the colony in 1608. When the colony was in danger of running out of food, Smith gave an order: ""He who does not work, will not eat.""
spent five months crossing the Atlantic. The original Godspeed carried 39 passengers from England to Virginia, making two stops along the way. The new Godspeed traveled from Maine to Virginia, stopping along the way to let visitors see the ship.
By 1613, Jamestown had expanded into a successful colony. At about that time, the settlers began to grow tobacco. Tobacco was a
meaning that it could be sold in large amounts to England. In the following years, the settlers pushed the Powhatan off the land and built tobacco
or large farms. Later, the Jamestown colonists bought slaves from Africa to work on the plantations.
Over time, Jamestown grew to become the colony of Virginia. Virginia was one of the 13 colonies that joined in 1776 to rebel against England, starting the American Revolution (17751783).
Much is known about Jamestown, yet more details are being discovered. For more than a hundred years, experts thought the site of the original settlement had been destroyed by the James River. In 1994, archaeologists, or scientists who study the remains left behind by past cultures, discovered what may be Jamestown's original location.
""Visitors can see things being excavated that haven't seen the light of day in 400 years,"" Jamestown spokesperson Mike Litterst told
Scientists are currently looking for the foundation of the first church that the Jamestown settlers built. If found, it will be the oldest English church ever discovered in the United States.
The skeletons of two settlers have already been uncovered at the site. They are on display beneath a glass case, exactly as they were found. Historians believe that one of the skeletons is that of Captain Bartholomew Gosnoll, a member of Jamestown's original ruling council. Gosnoll and Jamestown Settlement will have a lot of visitors in the coming weeks for the 400th anniversary. ""It's the biggest event we've had since 1957, when the [Jamestown] museum first opened,"" says Litterst.
When the English colonists first settled in what is now Virginia, a powerful Native American group had lived on the land for hundreds of years. ""There were about 20,000 Powhatan people there when the English arrived in Jamestown,"" Virginia Indian culture expert Karenne Wood told
She hopes that the 400th anniversary of Jamestown will help shed light on the Powhatan's story.
When Jamestown began, the English and the Powhatan tried to trade with each other peacefully, but soon fighting broke out over land and resources. Beginning in 1614, the fighting stopped for eight years when Pocahontas, a daughter of the Powhatan chief, married Englishman John Rolfe. However, the fighting quickly resumed as Jamestown expanded.
Over time, the Powhatan people lost their land to the English settlers. However, Virginia is home to many Native American descendants today. ""We have changed a lot,"" says Wood, ""but we are still here.""
Organizers at Jamestown are not calling the 400th anniversary a celebration. Why might that be?

But some Americans acted differently. Instead of helping others, they attacked innocent Arab and Muslim Americans.
Some individuals vandalized mosques (the buildings where Muslims practice Islam, their religion). Others attacked anyone they thought looked to be from the Middle East.
Dr. Abdullah Khoui, of the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C., condemned the attacks while defending his religion.
""What took place, no sound mind would approve of it, and no religion at all in the world would accept it,"" Khoui said. ""Islam does not approve of what took place.""
Arshad Majid, of the Islamic Center of Long Island, N.Y., said that Islam promotes peace.
""We're concerned that the actions of a small number of extremists is likely to paint with a very broad brush the large population of God-fearing, peace-loving Muslims in America,"" Majid said after the attacks.
President George W. Bush agreed with the Islamic leaders. While visiting a mosque, President Bush commented on the attacks on Muslim and Arab Americans. ""That's not the America I know,"" he said. ""That should not and that will not stand in America.""
Muslims practice the religion of Islam. Islam was first preached by the prophet Muhammad about 1,400 years ago.
In the 600s, Muhammad had a dream in which Allah, the Arabic name for God, called him to be a prophet. Islam means ""submission, commitment, and peace"".
Islam teaches that human diversity, or difference, is a sign of the richness of Allah's mercy. In other words, according to religious experts, Islam promotes peace.
Those experts add that the September 11 attacks do not represent Muslim beliefs. The majority of the 1.2 billion Muslims worldwide practice peace and tolerance toward others.

His plan calls for rounding ""all final sales, up or down, to the nearest nickel.""
Kolbe and others point out that pennies are expensive to produce. Pennies account for more than half of the U.S. Mints coin production. It will cost about $44 million dollars to produce pennies this year. That is nearly $14 million more than it cost in 2005.

He also says that many charities depend on these coins. Last year, children in New York City donated more than 65 million pennies, adding up to more than $650,000.

Although most of the worlds tigers live in India, the endangered cats also prowl other countries in Asia. These survivors, too, are under attack. The major threats to tigers include
There is a high demand for tiger body parts in Asia. In China, healers use bones, tails, and other body parts to make traditional medicine. People make clothes and rugs from the animals thick black-and-orange coats. Some people eat tiger meat. Poachers can make more than $70,000 per animal by selling its body parts.
Humans also compete with tigers for land. Millions of people now live in or near areas where tigers prowl. Developers build roads through forests, loggers clear forests for lumber, and farmers use the land for crops. All those practices destroy the tigers habitat.

Some countries in Asia, such as Thailand, have good conservation policies, but others are still far behind.

Wildlife officials are using new computers, hightech cameras, and radio collars to track and count Bengal tigers in India. This state-of-the-art equipment will make sure that no cat is counted twice. The task force will also work closely with the Chinese government to help stop the illegal trading of tiger parts. It plans to educate farmers and ranchers about how to live with the tiger. Smith stresses that people who live closest to the majestic beasts need to help protect them from disappearing. He is involved with projects in several Asian countries where the endangered cats live. Smith says these projects have been successful because wildlife officials work closely with local people.
""This approach is powerful because these village rangers soon become recognized in their villages as experts,"" Smith says. He explains that it motivates people to make good decisions about the tigers future.
Sunita Narain, one of Indias top environmental officials, agrees. ""The country has no choice but to make peace with the communities that share the tigers home,"" she says. ""If not, we will lose the war of conservation, tiger by tiger.""

By flying flags and holding vigils, millions of Americans shared the president's sentiments. ""As Americans, there is a bond between us, no matter how far away we are from one another,"" said Karen Bogart of Pasadena, California.
In the aftermath of the attacks, thousands of heroes offered to help. Those heroes were the volunteers, firefighters, police officers, and emergency crews at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Many of those heroes traveled thousands of miles to help out at ""ground zero,"" the site of the World Trade Center collapse, in New York City. ""We've had fire departments from Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and so many other places help us,"" said New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In addition to their usual jobs, rescue workers looked for pets trapped in deserted apartments or injured in the attacks. Many people who live near the World Trade Center in New York City had to leave their apartments quickly and were not allowed to return--even for their pets.
""Sometimes the owners feel so guilty that they abandoned their pets,"" said Jennifer Olsen of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ""But it is so gratifying to see them when they reunite with their pets after all this time.""
The rescued animals included cats, dogs, birds, and even a
, a kind of lizard. To get to the gecko, named Little Dude, rescue workers had to climb stairs to the 39th floor of a building. Despite that obstacle, Little Dude was reunited with its owner.
Whether rescue workers cleared rubble, looked for and helped survivors, or retrieved lost pets, their heroic efforts made all Americans proud to be Americans. Recently, President Bush also spoke of national pride. ""As president of this great land, nothing made me more proud.""

Students in Laura Grafs social studies classes at Diamond Valley Elementary School in St. George, Utah, are getting a lesson in how a bill becomes a law. They are urging state lawmakers to approve a new state symbolthe western rattler.
The idea for the state reptile came from the schools mascot, a diamondback rattlesnake. The students convinced their state representative, David Clark, to present the bill to the state Congress.
Sixty students from Diamond Valley recently visited the state House of Representatives in Salt Lake City, the state capital. They sang their school song, which mentions the slithery reptile. They also presented Governor Jon Huntsman Jr. with a cherry pie (cherries are the state fruit) and performed a lively square dance (the state folk dance).
The students efforts are paying off. The bill passed the House of Representatives. Next it has to make it through the state Senate before it lands on the governors desk for signing.

The long gray line is what all the students who have ever attended West Point are called. The term refers to the color of the uniforms that the
, or military students, wear. It also reminds the cadets that they are part of a long tradition, which celebrates its 200th anniversary this year.
On March 16, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson founded a school to train military officers and teach engineering. The school was established at West Point, which had been used as a fort.
The school's first class of students was smaller than the one that entered this year. In 1802, only two students were enrolled at the school. The youngest was 10 years old!
When West Point was founded, the United States was much smaller than it is today. The country extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River.
Until 1817, West Point did not have a set course of study. In that year, Sylvanus Thayer was appointed the superintendent of West Point. He developed the school's curriculum and turned West Point into one of the best schools in the United States. George Woodbridge, who graduated from the school in 1826, explained Thayer's accomplishment, saying, ""His object was to make [us] gentlemen and soldiers.""
The officers who graduated from West Point helped build and defend the United States. They explored the vast areas west of the Mississippi River. They designed the roads, bridges, dams, railroads, and canals that the United States needed as it grew. They also helped design some of our greatest buildings and monuments. For example, they worked on the Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the base of the Statue of Liberty.
Many of the school's graduates have gone on to play important roles in U.S. history. They have been famous generals and U.S. presidents. Both President Ulysses S. Grant and President Dwight D. Eisenhower were generals and graduates of West Point. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, also graduated from West Point.
Even though all West Point graduates serve America in different ways, they all share important lessons learned at the academy. For example, they learn about taking responsibility for one's actions. They also share the school's motto. ""Always there echoes and reechoes in my ears [the motto]: Duty. Honor. Country,"" said General Douglas MacArthur, a West Point graduate.
George Washington Whistler graduated from West Point in 1819. He spent most of his career building railroads. He also built steam locomotives.
While building his first locomotive, Whistler also built the first American train whistle. He placed his whistle on top of the locomotive. He called his locomotive the Whistler. The sound of Whistler's whistle can still be heard on old steam locomotives.

As a result, Florida recently removed the manatee from its list of
Endangered species are animals or plants that are at risk of dying out.
The first laws protecting this slow-moving marine mammal were passed in the late 1970s. Those laws made hunting, capturing, or killing manatees illegal.
As Floridas human population grew, however, manatees faced more threats. Last year alone, 396 manatees died in Florida, according to the states Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Many manatees have been injured or killed in collisions with boats. Others have gotten tangled in fishing gear. Manatees are also threatened because of the loss of their
As builders develop along the coastline, they destroy the manatees natural homes.
Environmental factors, such as red tide, have also taken their toll on the playful creatures. Red tide occurs when millions of tiny organisms are present in an area of the water. Those tiny organisms turn the ocean red and brown. Some of them are harmful to fish and other animals.
Red tide occurs naturally in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2005, more than 80 manatees were killed in red-tide outbreaks.
Not everyone thinks it is a good idea to remove manatees from the list. Many wildlife experts worry that the unusual mammals will not receive the same protection they had in the past. ""We cant celebrate yet,"" warned manatee expert Patrick Rose in an interview with
State officials say that the manatee is not under urgent threat. Although the huge creatures are being removed from Floridas list, state scientists say that the animal will remain protected under the nations Endangered Species Act. That law offers special protection to animals and plants facing extinction.
Wildlife officials say protection of the manatees might even be strengthened. The next step calls for the writing of a plan to continue increasing the number of manatees. ""There will be no less protection,"" says Henry Cabbage of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
A manatee recently got a taste of the Big Apple. Manatees are rarely seen far from the warm coastal waters of Florida, but one adventurous sea cow swam north to waters off New York City this summer. The large marine visitor then swam to waterways about 25 miles inland. Wildlife officials say its not unusual for manatees to
or move from one place to another. However, the mammals typically dont go much farther north than Virginia.
Should manatees have been removed from Floridas endangered species list? Why or why not?

On September 11, 2001, help was needed immediately. Terrorists had crashed airplanes into the World Trade Center in New York City, New York, and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. Police officers and firefighters weren't the only ones to respond. More than 200 search-and-rescue dogs used their noses to help find victims.
Deja Vu, a German shepherd from Pennsylvania, hunted through piles of
or wreckage, looking for survivors. The air was filled with harmful dust and smoke, but Deja Vu and the other dogs didn't wear protective masks. They needed their noses clear because they rely on their powerful sense of smell to find people. (See ""

Today, more than five years later, Otto has surprising results: Many of the dogs are fine. In fact, the dogs in her study are just as healthy as other search-andrescue dogs not involved in the 9/11 recovery efforts.
Deja Vu is no exception. ""We were concerned [about] what the dogs were inhaling and walking through,"" Deja Vu's handler, Pat Thompson, told
""But Deja Vu has remained in good health.""
The study results are surprising because thousands of people who volunteered at the disaster site now have

The search-and-rescue dogs' noses might have protected them from the bad air, Otto

sometimes reacts differently than a human's immune system does. That system protects the body against diseases and infections. For example, respiratory problems such as asthma are unusual in dogs. Otto and other researchers say that may be why the search-and-rescue dogs haven't developed any breathing disorders.
The scientists also think the dogs in the study may be healthier than the people who worked at the sites because most of the canines spent less time at the disaster sites than their two-legged counterparts. Many rescue workers who developed breathing problems spent months volunteering after the attacks. The dogs in Otto's study spent an average of 10 days helping.
Scientists may never pinpoint the exact reason that most of the dogs in Otto's study are in good health. But Otto hopes to continue the study for as long as the dogs live. She wants to stay on the lookout for any health problems that may develop over the next few years.
She plans to use the information she gathers to protect search-andrescue dogs on future disaster missions. ""No piece of equipment can ever do the job that these dogs do,"" Otto told

Woolfolk and 28 other students are currently learning what it takes to become a firefighter. Classes at the fire academy, which is in Connecticut, last for about 22 weeks. On most days, the students go to school from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. However, once a week, school lasts until 10 p.m.
For two days each week, the students sit in a classroom to learn science, math, and emergency medicine. They learn the science of fires, how to calculate water pressure, and how to treat medical emergencies.
During the other three days, the students go outside and learn how to hook hoses to fire hydrants, climb buildings, rescue people trapped in burning buildings, and many other things.
""Firefighters have to know lots of different things,"" said Pablo Menendez, an instructor at the school. ""We have to treat medical emergencies, know how to handle dangerous chemicals, and rescue people who have fallen from cliffs.""
Teamwork is one of the most important lessons students learn at the school. ""Working together saves lives,"" said Capt. William Seward, the director of the academy. ""Students need to learn that they are part of a team.""
Fighting fires is not easy. The suits and equipment a firefighter wears weigh about 40 pounds.
Firefighters are very busy. In New Haven, they respond to 32,000 emergency calls a year. Each time firefighters go out, they know they might not come back. Across the United States, about 100 firefighters die each year.
""That's why the lessons learned here at the academy are so important,"" said Seward. ""What they learn here can save their lives.""
Firefighters know how dangerous their jobs are. Their training helps them overcome their fear of heights and fires. ""When you're up there on the ladder looking down, it's scary,"" said one student. ""To do this job, you've got to wipe out the fear.""
Firefighters overcome their fear for one reason. ""I wanted to help other people,"" said Leah Harwin. ""I think it is important to help other people whenever you can.""

: How would you describe Harry these days?
Daniel: He's grown up quite a bit. In this story, everything is being taken away, and it's out of his hands. Harry struggles to get a grip on the situation.
: Are you shy, as Harry is with Cho Chang [his Goblet of Fire crush], in real life?
Daniel: I'm quite shy, but I'd like to think that I'm not. Sometimes I find myself not knowing what to say to [girls].
: Which scenes did you most enjoy filming?
Daniel: The underwater scenes were the most interesting and the most fun. Mike [Newell, the director] told us, ""Don't try to actually speak your lines underwater. Just move your mouth.""
: If you could have any magical power of Harry's, what would it be?
Daniel: [I would want to do] everything with the wand, like cast spells.

708,"Top Thrill Dragster is the worlds second fastest roller coaster. It is topped only by Kingda Ka.
The world's newest roller coaster is one wild ride.
As you wait in line, you hear the screams of people riding Kingda Ka. Part of you can't wait to ride the roller coaster; another part of you wants to bolt in the opposite direction. Before you know it, it's your turn to board. You brace yourself.
! With a roaring blast, the thrill ride rockets from 0 to 128 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds. Before you can catch your breath, the train whisks you straight up 456 feet. When it can go no farther,
plummets the coaster downward into a dizzying spiral twist. The train then whips you through another valley and zooms up another hill.
Congratulations! You have just experienced the fastestand tallestroller coaster on Earth.
Kingda Ka, or the ""King of Coasters,"" opens this spring at the Six Flags Great Adventure theme park in Jackson, New Jersey. The jaw-dropping thrill ride shatters the world's record for roller coaster speed and height. Of the more than 1,000 roller coasters in the United States, it is the latest ""extreme"" coaster to be built.
Six Flags roller coaster designer Larry Chickola says building Kingda Ka wasn't easy. ""We considered the wind strength, the possibility of earthquakes, the weight of Kingda Ka itself, as well as the forces caused by launching a [coaster faster than one] has ever gone,"" he told
enable roller coasters like Kingda Ka to move for most of the ride. According to scientists, energy is the ability to cause change. At the beginning of the ride, Kingda Ka blasts passengers to a speed of 128 miles an hour with technology similar to the kind that launches Navy jets from aircraft carriers. Each train on Kingda Ka is hooked up to a
cable. Liquid under high pressure is pushed through the cable. Along with motors, the hydraulic power rockets the coaster skyward.
After reaching the top of the first hill, the coaster works in the same way your bike does when you roll, pedal-free, down a slope. When a roller coaster is stopped, it has
, or stored energy. At any moment, the coaster can move, so it has the potential for motion.
As the roller coaster starts cruising, gravity takes over and converts the potential energy into
, which is the energy of motion. The repeated changes of potential energy to kinetic energy and then back again drives the roller coaster.
Kingda Ka covers 3,118 feet of track and lasts less than a minute. To roller coaster buff Steve Urbanowicz from New Jersey, the new ride is a scream! ""The ride seems like it's over really quickly, but Kingda Ka packs eight high moments of drama into those 50 seconds,"" he told
Urbanowicz, 46, speaks from experience. He has ridden 876 roller coasters around the world. In fact, he has taken more than 5,000 rides on one in particularthe wooden Cyclone at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, where the first true American coaster opened in 1884. ""I loved going to amusement parks when I was a kid and never grew out of it.""
Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division (reproduction number LC-USZ62-63945)
This illustration from 1886 shows passengers getting a one-minute ride for 5 cents aboard Coney Island's coaster.
The idea for the roller coaster was born in Russia in the 1600s when huge blocks of ice, supported by wood, were made into sleds. Straw or fur covered the icy seats.
Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, is credited with beginning America's amusement park history, in 1875. The nation's first coaster opened there in 1884 and cruised all of 6 miles an hour!
Some of the best coasters of all time were built during the 1920s. That era reigns as the golden age of amusement parks. By the end of the decade, the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression caused many parks to close.
Give another example of potential energy that is being converted into kinetic energy.

As the school year begins, how has the Gulf Coast changed since Katrina?
""I cried when I saw my house,"" Chakia Boutte told
The 12-year-old's New Orleans neighborhood looks different from the way it looked a year ago. Chakia points to a block of homes that were damaged when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast. ""All these houses used to be fixed up,"" she says. Chakia's own home flooded in the storm last year.
More than 1,300 people died in the storm, and many more lost their homes. Hurricane Katrina is the costliest natural disaster in American history. Relief and recovery costs from the storm are nearing $100 billion.
Some areas are coming back to life. Along the Mississippi coast, homes and businesses are being rebuilt. Volunteer camps are full of people eager to help.
Other places look as though Katrina passed through one month, rather than one year, ago. In New Orleans's Lower Ninth Ward, abandoned homes sit waiting to be
or torn down. Overturned cars and uprooted trees line the streets. The air smells of mold and garbage.
This fall, Chakia will attend school in Texas. She has lived there since her family fled the hurricane. Other families are returning to New Orleans. About 55 of the city's 128 public schools are scheduled to reopen in time for the new school year. Though the public school system will be able to accommodate 34,000 students, only 20,000 are expected to attend.
""Parents have been very reluctant to bring young children back to the city,"" New Orleans City Councilmember Cynthia Hedge-Morrell told
In New Orleanss Lower Ninth Ward, flooded homes floated off their foundations during the hurricane. Here, a home sits on top of an overturned truck.
In New Orleans, about half of the city's former population of 450,000 has returned. Electricity and phone service are still out in the hardest-hit areas. The city's roads are full of potholes. Mail delivery is slow. Grocery stores, banks, and hospitals remain boarded up.
The federal government has invested billions in a program known as the Road Home. The program will provide money for Louisiana residents to rebuild or sell their storm-damaged houses.
The most urgent task is protecting New Orleans against another hurricane. The
structures that prevent floodingcollapsed during Hurricane Katrina.
Although the damaged levee system has been repaired and improved, it is still not designed to handle a storm like Katrina. The Army Corps of Engineers is preparing plans for Congress that will propose ways to protect New Orleans against the strongest hurricanes.
On the Gulf Coast, people speak of life in terms of ""before Katrina"" and ""after Katrina."" ""My life before the hurricane was so beautiful,"" says Myeisha McDaniels, 13. ""I had just made the dance team. My mom was just letting me go to the movies by myself. I was mad the hurricane came and messed everything up.""
Myeisha and other kids who have returned to New Orleans want to help rebuild the city. As part of a summer program called Gulf Coast WalkAbout, kids built bus stop benches and planted flowers in a park that had flooded during Katrina. They also reflected on their hurricane experiences.
In a journal entry, 12-year-old Duriel Harris wrote: ""I am now used to a whole new lifestyle. ... Every day now is different from my pre-Katrina days.""
Over the summer, kids in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas participated in the Gulf Coast WalkAbout program. They helped rebuild their communities. Here are some of the projects kids in New Orleans completed.
Kids painted trash cans, picked up litter, and planted flowers at a park that had flooded during Hurricane Katrina.
Kids recorded their hurricane experiences. Duriel Harris, 12, explains his family tree. His familys home was flooded in the storm.
After noticing that people were sitting on stoops or overturned buckets as they waited for buses, kids built two bus stop benches.
Why might some families have chosen not to return to New Orleans?

Anyone who's ever had a toothache will tell you that it can be very painful. Since ancient times, humans have tried different ways to stop the rot. Here are a few:
Ancient Egyptians placed a live mouse on a person's gums to relieve a toothache. They believed mice could cure toothaches because the rodents have good teeth.
One ancient Roman author wrote that tying a frog to a person's jaw would make teeth stronger.
Ancient Romans believed that boiling earthworms in olive oil and then using the oil as eardrops would relieve a toothache.

Although the toothbrush has been around for several hundred years, people have been caring for their teeth since ancient times. In fact, some scientists say that ancient Egyptians used stalks of grass to clean their teeth. They also believe that people long ago used tooth powders made of charcoal to clean their teeth.

The centennial celebration honors the Ancient Pueblo (PWEH-bloh) people, formerly known as the Anasazi (ah-nuh-SAH-zee). The word
means ""town"" in Spanish. The Ancient Pueblo, who constructed Mesa Verdes cliff dwellings, are the ancestors of todays Pueblo people of the U.S. Southwest.
The Ancient Pueblo were an agricultural people who

Why did the Ancient Pueblo abandon the region? ""We dont know the exact reason,"" says Puskar. Some possibilities are climate change, drought, or overuse of the areas soil and other resources.
In the late 1800s, explorers found the ancient dwellings and removed pottery, baskets, and other
from the site. An artifact is any object made or used by people in the past.
On June 29, 1906, Congress passed a bill to establish Mesa Verde National Park. The bill, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt, protects the cultural treasures at this historic Native American site. It is a federal crime to remove or destroy any historic object or monument on land owned by the U.S. government.
""Its not often that you come across a hundred years of something special,"" Puskar says about the park. ""It was worthwhile to celebrate the past that comes from the Pueblo people as well as our nations past. [The centennial] provides us the chance to look forward to the next 100 years and make sure this place stays preserved and enjoyed by the public.""

Mesa Verde National Park protects more than 600 cliff dwellings built by the Ancient Pueblo. The two largest dwellings contain about 160 rooms each.
By building their dwellings out of stone, the Ancient Pueblo could construct homes on top of one another. By 1100, their structures were as large as some modern-day apartment buildings.
Why did the Ancient Pueblo of the Southwest rely on farming rather than hunting?

Sumeyya is among the very few people who have caught the disease. So far, the H5N1 virus has infected about 150 people, killing at least 85 people since 1997. The virus does not usually spread from person to person.

555,"Dodging Danger: Should Dodgeball Be Tossed Out of School?
For many kids, dodgeball is a harmless game. But gym teacher Neil Williams does not see anything ""harmless"" about the game.
Recently, Williams recalled an accident that happened during his first year teaching. His students were playing dodgeball. Suddenly, the ball slammed into one girl's face, smashing her nose. The girl had to be taken to the hospital.
Soon after that, Williams started a campaign to ban dodgeball from schools. Some schools in several states have already banned the game.
The object of dodgeball is to get other players out by hitting them with a ball. Critics of the game say that it teaches violence. ""The game allows the stronger kids to pick on and target the weaker kids,"" Williams told
Judith Young is the executive director of the National Association for Sport and Physical Education. She told
the game doesn't belong in school. ""I don't have a problem with the game at backyard picnics and parties,"" she said. ""I just don't think it should be used in phys-ed classes.""
Rick Hanetho strongly disagrees. He likes dodgeball so much that he started the National Amateur Dodgeball Association.
Hanetho says dodgeball teaches kids important skills. ""It teaches eye-hand coordination, decision making, concentration, and agility,"" he said.
Hanetho also says that dodgeball does not encourage bullying. ""I don't buy the idea that dodgeball allows some kids to pick on the smaller and weaker kids,"" he said. ""In fact, it's the littler kids who are usually the best players. They are faster and can avoid being hit.""
Here's what some kids have to say about dodgeball:
Isabela, age 11: A dodgeball isn't hard and it can't hurt anyone.
Paloma, age 9: I like dodgeball. You get to run around a lot and that's a lot of fun.
Liliam, age 9: Dodgeball is great because you get to throw the ball at other kids.
Mara: age 10: Some kids don't like dodgeball because they get hit at the beginning of the game. But I like it.

Past sculptures that have made it into the winners circle include a hot dog, a castle, and sea creatures, such as an octopus and a shark. The number of cans used to build those structures ranged from 1,000 to 13,000.
Elementary school students in Tampa, Florida, recently built spooky sculptures with everything from cans of black beans to boxes of spaghetti. Eleven-yearold Ashley Weaver, who helped construct a haunted house, thought her project looked ""cool.""
Canstruction prizes are awarded to the sculpture with the most cans, the most creative sculpture, the best use of can labels, and the ""best meal""the tastiest combination of food.
Canstruction is about more than creativity, though. All the food used to make the sculptures is donated to shelters and food banks. To view the artwork, visitors have to bring canned goods as their admission fee. That food is also donated. Some food banks have helped feed evacuees from Hurricane Katrina.

97,"Hiram Bingham lived for adventure. In 1911, the American explorer trekked through the jungles of Peru. He was searching for clues to explain how the once-mighty Inca Empire had disappeared.
His journey through the Andes Mountains in South America was not easy. Bingham hacked his way through thick forests and climbed slippery slopes. One wrong stop could have sent him plummeting off a cliff.
After crawling up a snake-infested mountain, Bingham stumbled upon one of the greatest finds of the last century. He uncovered ruins from the ""lost city"" of Machu Picchu (MAH-choo PEE-choo).
Until Bingham's discovery, the ruins remained hidden for more than 400 years. Machu Picchu, which lies high atop a peak, is an ancient city that belonged to the Incas. Its name means ""old peak.""
Thanks to a traveling museum exhibit, people in the United States can go back in time to experience Incan life in Machu Picchu. The exhibit, called ""Machu Picchu: Unveiling the Mysteries of the Incas,"" is currently on display at the Chicago Field Museum.
""It is the first exhibit of its kind,"" museum project manager Hillary Hansen told
. ""It is the largest traveling exhibit of Inca objects.""
that Bingham collected are on display--from ceramic jars to copper and bronze jewelry. Artifacts are objects that people made long ago.
Machu Picchu is an ancient city that belonged to the Incas.
The Incas were people who ruled one of the largest empires in South America. Their empire extended from present-day Colombia into western Argentina.
Their vast civilization began to spread in about 1200. It lasted through the mid-1500s.
When Bingham discovered Machu Picchu, he thought he had found the birthplace of the Inca Empire. Since that time,
have learned that the city served as a summer residence for Incan kings. (Archaeologists study artifacts to learn about the past.)
The Incas built Machu Picchu between 1450 and 1470 for the ruler Pachacuti. The royal family would relax, hunt, and entertain foreign visitors there.
Machu Picchu wasn't just a home for nobles. About 500 common people lived in the stone city and worked for the royal family as farmers, artisans, and servants.
The city was abandoned in the mid-1500s, not long after the Spanish
(conquerors) arrived. The Inca Empire collapsed under Spanish rule.
Today, Machu Picchu is a popular tourist attraction. Nearly 400,000 people visit the ancient grounds each year.
Scientists still research the area to unlock more mysteries about the Incas. ""In the scheme of things, we still know very little about Machu Picchu,"" said Hansen.
Machu Picchu, which is located in Peru, was a city of palaces, temples, farms, and small houses.
Many of the buildings at Machu Picchu are made of large stones. The stones are so tightly wedged together that a piece of paper cannot fit between them.
Machu Picchu's farmland was carved into steps because it was hard for farmers to plow up and down the mountain. That allowed farmers to plant crops on the flat parts of the land and prevented rain from washing soil downhill.
The Incas had no writing, no money system, and no knowledge of the wheel. How do you think they created such a large empire?

489,"Going, Going, Gone! African Monkey Declared Extinct
In 1933, a discovery in Africa excited scientists around the world. They had found a
, or kind, of monkey that they had never seen before--the Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey. Now, only 77 years after it was found, that monkey is extinct, scientists recently announced.
No one has seen a Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey for more than 20 years. In 1988, scientists declared the monkey an endangered species. For the last seven years, scientists searched for the monkey in Ghana and Cte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), two countries in western Africa. They found no sign of the animal.
""If [the] red colobus were present near any of our survey routes, it is likely that we would have seen one,"" said scientist John Oates.
Scientists blame the animal's extinction on hunting and the destruction of the forests where it lived.
Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was the first primate --which includes monkeys and apes--to become extinct in nearly 300 years. But scientists say it will not be the last. They worry that many of the 600 other primate species may die out within the next 100 years. Twenty-five species may die out within ten to 20 years. More than 120 primate species may become extinct before the end of this century, said Ross MacPhee of New York City's American Museum of Natural History.
Endangered primates live in Africa, Asia, and South America. Many of those primates live in areas where people are poor and need to hunt for food to survive.
Scientists fear that unlimited hunting could kill off more primates. ""Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was eaten by people. The last ones probably went into someone's pot,"" said scientist John Terborgh.
MacPhee explained that the best way to help primates is to protect them and the areas where they live. ""As long as there are a few individuals, and as long as humans leave them alone, they'll come back [from near extinction].""

Here's one message you never want to forget: ""When Fire Strikes: Get Out! Stay Out!"" That's the theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week, which runs from October 5 through October 11.
For the past 81 years, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has used Fire Prevention Week to teach people how to prevent fires and how to protect themselves all year long. The NFPA has the following safety tips for you and your family:
. Every family should have a home escape route planned. As part of the plan, identify two ways out of every room, such as a door or window exit. Be sure your plan includes a meeting place outside that is a safe distance from your home. Practice the plan at least twice a year.
. Smoke alarms are often the first signal of a fire. Your home should have a smoke alarm on every level and in or close to each bedroom. Be sure an adult tests alarms monthly and replaces batteries once a year.
. Whenever the stove is on, make sure there is an adult in the room. Keep a ""kid-free zone"" about 3 feet around the stove.

No person was behind the camera's lens. The camera was triggered by motion and heat from the passing cat.

Belize has a healthy number of jaguars. The wildlife group estimates that about 14 jaguars live within a 55-square-mile area there. The cameras are helping researchers count the number of jaguars within certain areas of Belize and other places where jaguars roam.
Today, jaguars can be found from northern Argentina in South America up through Mexico. At one time, they lived as far north as New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. However, these powerful cats are now considered extinct in the United States.

The actions of people have caused a decline in the animal's range. The cutting down of trees has destroyed some of the jaguar's habitat.
Many ranchers shoot the cats because they fear that jaguars will kill their livestock, such as sheep and cattle. Researchers say, however, that livestock are often killed by puma cats or die from disease or poor nutrition.
Although the cats face many threats, they have a hopeful future. Researchers have been educating ranchers and helping them build electric fences to keep their livestock from wandering into the wild.
Using cameras, scientists are keeping a watchful eye on these threatened cats and learning more about their range. As Rabinowitz points out, ""In some areas, jaguars are decreasing. In other areas, they are making a comeback.""

Hispanic Americans are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. Those parts of the world include Spain, Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and most countries in Central America and South America. In the United States, many Hispanic Americans are also called Latinos.
As of June, about 39 million Hispanic Americans are living in the United States. That number marks a jump from the 2000 census count. At that time, Hispanic Americans numbered about 35 million. Today, the total population of the United States is estimated at more than 288 million people.
Currently, 1 out of every 6 kids in this country is Hispanic. Officials estimate that by 2020, 1 out of 4 children will be Hispanic American.
Hispanic Americans have influenced food, music, and customs in the United States. Hispanic Heritage Month marks a time for Americans to celebrate the traditions and history of Hispanic people. It takes place from September 15 to October 15.
People in communities around the country will celebrate the month with festivals. Many students will recognize the month by learning about the important roles Hispanic people have played in our countrys history.
Ellen Ochoa, the first Hispanic American astronaut, told
that to understand the history of the United States, people should learn about the contributions of different groups, including Hispanic Americans.
People sometimes refer to the United States as a ""melting pot."" That phrase means that people from many different countries have settled here. People of Hispanic heritage, along with people from other cultures, help make the United States strong.
From science to sports, people of Hispanic heritage have contributed to the history of the United States. Take a look at some of these well-known people.
Dr. Novello was born in Puerto Rico. In 1990, she became the first Hispanic American to serve as the U.S. surgeon general. That is the doctor who leads our country on health issues. She worked to improve healthcare for Americans, especially children, women, and minorities.
Gary Soto is an award-winning Hispanic American author. He writes fiction and poetry for adults and children. His writing is based on his experiences growing up as a Mexican American in California. His books, including
Baseball in April and Other Stories and Taking Sides
, are popular with many young readers.
In 1990, Ellen Ochoa became the first Hispanic American woman astronaut when she was accepted into NASAs training program. Ochoa, whose fathers parents were from Mexico, flew her first space shuttle mission in 1993. Since then she has clocked more than 720 hours in flight.

Daytona Beach, Florida--As millions of racing fans watched the closing lap of the Daytona 500 car race last month, they saw a familiar sight. Dale Earnhardt, nicknamed ""the Intimidator,"" was near the front of the pack.
In an instant, however, Earnhardt's car swerved and slammed into the track's concrete wall. That crash instantly killed the legendary driver, who was considered the Michael Jordan of NASCAR racing. (
stands for National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing.)
When Earnhardt's car, painted with the driver's well-known number 3, slammed into the wall, he was traveling at 180 miles per hour. According to doctors who examined Earnhardt, the racing legend died of a head injury caused by the crash.
Many safety experts say that if Earnhardt had been wearing a HANS device, he might have survived the crash.
The device is a rigid collar that slips over a driver's uniform and rests on his or her shoulders. Two straps connect the helmet to the collar, locking the helmet in place. The device is designed to prevent a driver's head from whipping forward or side to side in an accident.
NASCAR driver Robby Gordon ordered a HANS device immediately after the race in which Earnhardt was killed. ""As a direct result of what happened at the [Daytona] 500, I have ordered the support system,"" said Gordon.
NASCAR officials say they will look more closely at the device and may require drivers to wear it in the future. Until then, drivers, who are well aware of the risks in their sport, will continue to get behind the wheel.

Demarest plunged into a deep, tangled snake hole up to his armpits. Hearing snakes slithering around him, Demarest froze. For half an hour, the scientist didn't move, waiting for the snakes to settle down so he could climb out safely. While stuck in that snaky situation, Demarest looked around and realized the pit was actually part of a jungle-covered three-story building.
As soon as he got out of the hole, Demarest and his team of scientists explored the hill. They found that it was an ancient palace built by the Maya people. The Mayan civilization covered parts of Mexico and Central America, and reached its greatest power between the years 250 and 900.
Demarest's team also discovered a city surrounding the palace. The Maya people called the city
, which means ""place of serpents."" The palace at Cancun was built more than 1,300 years ago by the Mayan king Tah ak Chaan.
So far, Demarest and his team have counted 170 rooms in the palace, which has 11 courtyards and covers an area the size of two football fields. Because of its sturdy limestone walls, the palace is in extremely good condition, Demarest said.
Demarest said Cancun is different from other Mayan cities. Unlike the other Mayan cities, Cancun doesn't have temples or evidence that there was warfare. ""The basis of power among the Mayan [kings] was religion and warfare,"" explained Demarest. ""Apparently, Cancun needed neither.""
The drawing shows an artist's idea of what the Cancun palace might have looked like.
Demarest said the city must have been very powerful. But its leaders were more focused on
, or widespread buying and selling, than on religion or warfare.
Located near the Pasin River, Cancun was a thriving trading center for the Maya. ""That river,"" Demarest said, ""was really the superhighway of the Mayan world.""
Jade, a semiprecious stone, is everywhere at the site, Demarest said. Scientists even uncovered the remains of a woman who had jade false teeth! Finely carved jade statues were found in the graves of workmen.
Demarest estimates that it will take about 10 to 15 years to
, or dig out, Cancun. In his 20 years of uncovering Mayan ruins, he said, Cancun is ""by far the most spectacular.""
The snakes must think so, too. ""A buried palace is exciting to us,"" said Demarest, ""but it's even more exciting to snakes. They love it! This place is full of snakes.""

Israel responded to the Hezbollah attack with force. Israeli planes bombed Hezbollah neighborhoods in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon. They also hit Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon. Israeli army troops crossed the border and fought with Hezbollah.
As a result, Hezbollah launched missiles at Israel. Hundreds have been killed in the conflict. The United States and other nations sent ships and planes to evacuate their citizens living in or visiting Lebanon.

As a result, the National Anthem Project, spearheaded by music educators, is dedicated to reteaching people the words to Americas official song. A crosscountry campaign kicked off in January and is currently touring cities in the West from Los Angeles to Seattle.
The tour includes interactive exhibits and a singing contest. In each location, the singer who belts out the best version of the national anthem wins a $1,000 donation to a school music education program of his or her choice. In Richmond, Virginia, an 11-yearold boy took home the top prize.

During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote the poem that later became the national anthem.
On September 13, 1814, Key watched British ships bomb Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. The next morning, he spotted the American flag still flying over the fort. The sight inspired him to write the poem. In 1931, Congress made it the national anthem.
Here is the first verse of the four-verse song:
O say, can you see, by the dawns early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilights last
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through
     the perilous fight,
Oer the ramparts we watched, were so
     gallantly streaming?
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting

34,"Five California condors died last summer in Arizona's arid backcountry.
A condor's wingspan is 9.5 feet across. That's about as wide as two kids lying down head to toe.
Wildlife experts say the condors did not die from the heat. Instead, the experts believe the huge birds died from lead poisoning. They say the condors had swallowed lead shotgun pellets.
, which means they eat the remains of dead animals. The condors probably ate the remains of an animal that had been shot by a hunter. As they ate the dead animal's flesh, the birds ate the deadly pellets.
If swallowed, lead can make an animal sick or cause death. Lead stops the body from making red blood cells. It can also damage an animal's organs, including the brain and liver.
The five poisoned birds were among 35 condors that have been released in Arizona since 1996. The release program has cost millions of dollars.
After the dead condors were found, wildlife experts recaptured and tested the 16 birds left in the Arizona group. All the birds were healthy and were soon released.
Members of the Peregrine Fund have been releasing and watching the condors set free in Arizona. Jeff Cilek, of the Peregrine Fund, told
that saving California condors is important. ""Condors are good for the environment. They [eat] dead animals,"" Cilek said.
California condors are among the world's largest birds. A hundred years ago, the birds were found in many parts of the United States. Today, the condor is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's list of endangered species. That means the number of California condors is so low they all could disappear someday.
Why are scavengers an important part of the food chain?
Peregrine Fund officials say there are 150 California condors left on Earth. Forty-eight of those birds are living in the wild; the rest are in zoos.
Although the loss of five birds is a ""serious setback,"" Cilek said his group is looking to the future. Peregrine Fund officials recently announced plans to release 12 more California condors in Arizona this winter.

Ecuador is home to hundreds of types of frogs and toads. But now scientists are worrying about their health.
The mountains and thick forests of Ecuador, in South America, are home to 417 types of frogs and toads. Tiny red-eyed tree frogs hide inside flowers. Bumpy-skinned toads use their sticky tongues to catch mosquitoes and other prey. Colorful poison dart frogs rest on tree branches. These brightly colored frogs are packed with poison, which protects them from their enemies.

, or died out, in North and South America in the last 100 years. ""It's the same magnitude event as the extinction of the dinosaurs,"" says scientist Luis Coloma.
. Amphibians are animals with backbones that spend part of their life in water and part on land. Frogs and toads lay jellylike eggs in water. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, which breathe through gills. As the tadpoles grow into frogs or toads, they develop lungs and live on land.
Like reptiles, such as lizards and snakes, amphibians are
. That means their body temperature depends on the environment. Unlike reptiles, amphibians lack protective scales. Amphibians must live near water so that their skin stays moist.
Over the last 50 years, many amphibian species have become extinct. Two of every five of the 3,046 species that live in North and South America are at risk of vanishing.
Why are these creatures in trouble? Their
is being destroyed as loggers cut down trees to make room for farms and roads. A habitat is a place in nature where a plant or an animal makes its home. Disease, weather changes, and pollution are other causes of the decline in amphibian populations.
Scientists are concerned about the decrease in the number of frogs. The health of frogs is closely linked to the health of the environment. ""Amphibian extinction is an indicator of [a problem with the environment],"" scientist Jonathan Campbell told
Because amphibians breathe through their skin, they easily absorb pollution. They are usually the first to disappear when the environment is under threat. As a result, some frogs are born with
, or wrongly shaped, body parts, such as extra legs and eyes. When frogs with strange body parts are found in an area, it is a clue that the environment is polluted or suffering.
Scientists are fighting to save amphibians. Some scientists believe that South America's poison dart frogs have chemicals in their body that can be used to treat diseases, such as cancer. The scientists want governments to pass laws that will reduce pollution and to create parks that protect the amphibians' habitat.
""Almost half of the extinctions are happening for unknown reasons,"" scientist Robert Kaplan told
. ""Scientists have a lot of work to do, and quickly.""
Here are some of Ecuador's threatened frogs and toads.

This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
. The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A

. A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
. That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
. Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's As Easy As One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
. The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
. The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
. We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.

Although the hairy creatures spook many people, there isn't much reason to be afraid of spiders. ""Most spiders are not very dangerous,"" said Bradley.
In fact, most are timid creatures that are unable to give humans more than a harmless bite. Although spider venom is deadly to insects, it often has little effect on humans because of our larger size.
Spiders may have a bad reputation for being scary, but they are important to us. Bradley hopes his work shatters some
about spiders. (A myth is a false idea that many people believe is true.)
Spiders eat mosquitoes and other insects that harm farmers' crops and carry diseases. Bradley's research is teaching scientists more about how spiders help control
, or communities of plants and animals. If spiders didn't exist, there would be a lot more insects!
""Spiders are your friends,"" Bradley said. ""They make our life more pleasant.""
Get caught up on some different types of spiders. Spiders come in all shapes and sizes. Crab spiders, jumping spiders, and orb weavers have made Rich Bradley's Ohio count. Find out more about them and other spiders.
Can you guess how this spider got its name? It may not live in the ocean, but it looks like a crab. The crab spider lives on flowers. It can match its body color to the flower's color. That allows it to sneak up on insects.
What a leap! The jumping spider can jump between 10 and 40 inches. To catch an insect, this hunting spider sneaks up on its prey and pounces.
The trap-door spider lives in a tunnel. The spider, common in the southwestern United States, lines the tunnel with silk and fashions a door made of silk and dirt. It peeks out of the slightly open door and grabs passing insects.
The tarantula is a large, hairy spider found mainly in warm regions, including the southwestern United States. Although the tarantula's bite is painful, it is not very poisonous to humans. Tarantulas hunt insects, lizards, mice, toads, and frogs.
E. B. White's famous spider Charlotte was an orb weaver. The orb-weaving spider spins a wheel-shaped web. When an insect flies into the web, the spider races toward its meal.

According to the National Safe Kids Campaign, children younger than 15 were hurt in nine out of ten of those accidents. In one-third of those scooter accidents, the rider fell and broke or dislocated an arm or a hand.
Most scooter accidents happen when a rider goes too fast and does not wear safety equipment.
Safety gear helps protect riders, who usually ride at about 4 miles per hour. But some people cruise at speeds of 25 miles per hour or more. In England, police gave a man a ticket for racing a scooter at 39 miles per hour!
The number of scooter-related accidents has prompted some U.S. communities to pass laws requiring kids who ride scooters to wear helmets and other safety gear. Many states already have helmet laws for kids who ride bicycles, and some have helmet laws for kids who use skateboards and in-line skates.
Ann Brown, an official with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, recommends that kids use safety gear when riding scooters. ""We're trying to head off some of the kinds of injuries that happen with in-line skates,"" Brown said about scooter safety. ""We want people to know about the safety gear early on.""
This isn't the first time scooters have been popular. Scooters have been around since 1816. According to Annette Thompson of the Bicycle Museum of America, the first scooter was made from a board and two large wheels.
Even if scooter riders are careful, accidents can happen. Here are a few safety tips that scooter riders can use:
Always wear a helmet, wrist guards, and elbow and knee pads;
Make sure your scooter works properly and is not broken;
Ride only on smooth surfaces free of traffic;
Never hitch a ride from a bicycle or a motor vehicle;
In the 1930s, kids nailed roller skates to milk crates to make homemade scooters. Scooters remained popular until the 1980s, when skateboards and in-line skates became popular.

On the first day of school, Rand said, her classmates ripped out pictures of Saddam Hussein from their textbooks. Saddam is the former president of Iraq. The students tossed the pages out the window, yelling ""Bye, bye, Saddam.""
That was not an unusual sight at some schools throughout this war-torn country. Saddam's government was toppled in April. At that time, U.S.-led forces took control of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.
During Saddam's rule, teachers were forced to mention him in every lesson, from history to music to gym class. Students even learned math by adding 4 + 28. That's because April 28 is Saddam's birthday. Now schools are erasing Saddam's image and teachings from their lessons.
Iraqi officials are rewriting the country's textbooks. That will give students the opportunity to learn new ideas about the world.
The new textbooks, which will arrive this month, don't include any references praising Saddam. Pictures of Saddam have been removed from classrooms. Students are no longer forced to chant ""Long live our leader, Saddam"" during their classes.
Despite the changes, U.S. soldiers report that many of Iraq's schools are in various states of

1. This is the ninth year of TV-Turnoff Week.
2. Many kids like to watch TV.
3. TV-Turnoff Week lets kids discover other activities they enjoy.
So think about what you might do if you zapped off your television set for an entire week. Would you read a book? Head outside to ride your bike? Play a board game with your mom or dad?

Some of Evelyn Arroyo's relatives offered a kidney, but their kidneys did not match the tissue that made up Arroyo's kidneys. Arroyo's family feared she might die before a matching kidney was found.
That's when Bocchichio volunteered one of his kidneys, which matched Arroyo's tissue. During the operations, which took place in January, doctors removed one of Bocchichio's kidneys and put it inside Arroyo.

Instead of using soap and water, the doctors use a special gel. The gel kills germs and saves time. Doctors often take more than a minute to wash their hands with soap and water. The gel speeds things up.
What's more, constant washing and drying with soap and water dries out hands. The gel causes fewer problems, so doctors who use it are less likely to skip a cleaning.
Killing hospital germs is important. About 2 million hospital patients are infected by viruses each year. About 90,000 die from viruses they got in the hospital.
If you're not working in a hospital, using soap and water is good enough. All of us need to keep hands clean to keep germs away. Washing hands is important, especially before eating and before leaving a bathroom, where many germs live. It is important to keep your hands clean at school, too!

What do those dreams mean? No one quite knows for sure, but scientists are getting closer to solving the puzzle. They are using new technology to study how the sleeping brain works.
Although there are still many mysteries about sleep, scientists know that everyone needs sleep to boost brain power and keep the body healthy. School-age kids need at least nine hours of sleep each night to perform their best in school.
So can a good night's sleep help Christina do her best playing ice hockey and the flute? Can sleep help
""Getting a good night's sleep is good for your brain and body and helps you grow,"" sleep expert David Dinges told
. ""You're less likely to be tired the next day, you're less grouchy, more alert, and perform better in school and in sports.""
While you're snoozing, your brain doesn't shut down. Your brain stays busy and goes through five stages of sleep each night.
, sleep. It gets that name because your eyes move around quickly under closed eyelids. Your brain becomes very active during REM sleep. Most dreaming takes place during that sleep stage. Your body cycles through REM and non-REM stages several times a night. Each cycle lasts about 90 minutes.
Everybody dreamsalthough scientists don't know exactly why. Scientists have different
, or ideas, about why dreams are useful. One theory is that dreams help make sense of the day's events. Some scientists think that dreams help the brain sort and store information.
The latest evidence shows that dreams may help people master new physical skills, such as playing an instrument or riding a bike. Both dreaming and getting a good night's sleep may also help people improve their problem-solving skills. In one study, scientists divided volunteers into groups to solve a math problem. The group that received more sleep solved the problem more often than the group that didn't receive as much sleep.
Why do we remember some dreams but not others? When you wake up affects how vividly you recall your dreams. If you awaken during REM sleep, you're more likely to remember the details of a dream. If you wake up during another stage, you might not remember your dreams as wellor at all.
Whether or not you remember your dreams, it's important to get into a healthful sleep routine. ""The enemies of sleep are staying up late to play video games or watch TV,"" said Dinges.
Like people, all warm-blooded animals dream. Some animals sleep a little, and others sleep a lot. The amount of sleep an animal requires depends on its needs. Take a look at the sleep patterns of some creatures.

Accepting the Nobel award for work in promoting peace will be Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank. It might seem strange that someone would receive a peace prize for founding a bank. But Yunus is no ordinary banker.
In 1983, Yunus founded Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, a country in Asia. The bank gives small loans to poor villagers, especially women. The Nobel Prize committee honored Yunus because ""peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty.""
In addition to celebrating progress toward peace, the Nobel committee gives awards for achievements in other areas, such as literature, physics, chemistry, and medicine. Each of the winners receives $1.4 million, a gold medal, and a diploma.
The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway. The other Nobel Prizes are given out in Stockholm, Sweden. Both countries are in Europe.
This year, all five of the science Nobels went to Americansthe first time that has happened since 1983. Scientist Roger Kornberg won the chemistry prize for his work on how people inherit diseases. In 1959, as a 12-year-old, Roger watched his father, Arthur Kornberg, win a Nobel Prize. The Kornbergs are the sixth father-and-son pair to have won Nobel Prizes.
Although Roger was stunned by his win, his father saw it coming. ""His work has been awesome,"" says his dad.
The Nobel Prizes were the brainchild of Alfred Bernhard Nobel (18331896) of Sweden, the inventor of dynamite. At the time of his death, Nobel left $9 million to fund the prizes that bear his name. The first annual Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901. The prizes are presented each year on December 10the anniversary of Nobels death.

Counting giant pandas in the wild is no easy task. Just ask a team of scientists who recently put their detective skills to the test.
The scientists trekked through dense forests in central China to search for clues of giant pandas. China, a country in Asia, is the only place where giant pandas live in the wild.
After spending four years in the country's mountainous region, scientists completed the largest
of giant pandas ever done. A census is a population count.
The results of the census surprised scientists! They counted about 1,600 giant pandas living in the wild in China. That is double the number originally thought to live there. ""We found giant pandas living in areas we didn't know had any,"" scientist Colby Loucks told
Although the news is hopeful, Loucks and other scientists are quick to point out that giant pandas still need protection. They are among the most
animals. That means there are very few left in the wild.
Human activity is the main reason the pandas are threatened. Their

Giant pandas must eat a lot of bamboo to get the nutrients they need. Pandas spend up to 14 hours a day eating bamboo, because it is not very nutritious.
, or go into a long sleep, in the winter, because they can't store up enough fat on a bamboo diet.
A newborn panda weighs between 3 and 5 ounces and is about the size of a stick of butter.
Each front paw on a panda has an extra wrist bone that acts like a thumb to help the panda grasp bamboo shoots.
Scientists needed to collect clues to count pandas because the shy creatures are hard to spot in their natural environment. ""Giant pandas are very hard to see in the wild,"" said Loucks. ""They hide in the thick
Bamboo provides giant pandas with their main source of food. Each animal consumes about 80 pounds of this plant's stems and leaves a day.
In fact, the giant pandas' survival is linked to eating bamboo. If bamboo disappears in an area, giant pandas there risk starvation.
To collect clues, scientists combined the latest technology with old-fashioned tracking skills. Each time they spotted a clue, such as a panda paw print in the mud or fur on the bark of a tree, they entered their finding into a computer. Computer mapping helped them pinpoint the locations of the giant pandas.
How will the census results help protect pandas? Scientists hope their findings will lead to the creation of more
for giant pandas. Nature reserves are areas of forest that are protected from development. Currently, China has 40 nature reserves.
""Pandas live in the same place as other animals,"" said Loucks. ""If we conserve the panda habitat, we conserve [the habitat of other animals] too.""

Even though the coqui and greenhouse frogs are each only about the size of a dime, they make a huge racket. Instead of making soft chirping or gentle croaking sounds, the frogs chirp as loudly as a lawnmower. ""You'd never believe so much noise could come from a creature that small,"" Stevens said.
Scientists say the frogs in Stevens's backyard recently arrived in Hawaii. They came from islands in the Caribbean Sea, south of the United States mainland. Scientists think the frogs were accidentally shipped to Hawaii in flowerpots.
Since arriving in Hawaii, the foreign frogs have spread to 150 areas. In some areas, more than 8,000 can be found on a single acre of land. Each one is adding to the noise level.
The frogs are more than a noisy nuisance; they are causing other problems, as well. They eat insects that birds and other frogs used to eat. Each night, each thunderous frog can eat at least six insects.
The number of frogs is increasing because no other animals prey on them. If the foreign frog population keeps growing, other frogs and birds in Hawaii might not have enough insects to eat and might starve.
Some officials worry that the frogs might cause some people to leave Hawaii because of the racket. ""We get a lot of complaints from residents,"" said Fred Kraus, a spokesperson for the state. ""Some [have] threatened to leave the state.""
Residents of Hawaii are trying to capture the shrill frogs, which live in trees. Recently, Stevens and some of his neighbors went out looking for the noisy critters. They used ladders to climb into trees and capture frogs. ""We got them all,"" he said.
However, within a few months of the frog roundup, more frogs moved into Stevens's neighborhood. ""It was hopeless,"" Stevens said. ""There were just too many [frogs to capture]. Now they're out of control.""

NASA recently announced plans to build a permanent base on the moon. Astronauts could be living and working there by 2020, according to the U.S space agency. The goal is to prepare astronauts for a trip to Mars in the future.
Under the plan, four-person crews will begin with weeklong missions to the moon. By 2024, when more equipment has been set up, astronauts will be able to

NASA hopes to establish a lunar outpost near one of the moon's poles. ""These locations experience sunlight for longer periods of time than other locations on the moon, which will make it possible to use solar power,"" NASA official Michael Braukus told
Solar power is energy from the sun that can be used to generate electricity.
It is also likely that the polar regions are rich in natural resources, such as oxygen and hydrogen. While on the moon, astronauts plan to use natural resources for water and fuel.
The moon is the only place beyond Earth that humans have visited. About 238,900 miles away, the moon is Earth's closest space neighbor.
On July 20, 1969, Americans Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the moon. Those space pioneers traveled to the lunar surface on the

or stop using, its aging space shuttle fleet by 2010. For their trek to the moon, astronauts will travel aboard the new
crew exploration vehicle, which is being developed. The vehicle, a modernized version of the
craft, will attach to a lunar lander.
The moon mission is part of President George W. Bush's longterm space plan. The proposed base is the first step in the bold plan to prepare astronauts for their ultimate destinationMars.
Because Mars is so far from Earth, traveling there will require humans to stay for long periods of time. Astronauts will not be able to bring enough supplies for the entire mission. They will have to use the elements on Mars to survive.
""By demonstrating we can survive on another world for a long time, we build confidence that we can venture much farther from Earth and stay for longer periods of time,"" says Braukus of NASA.
While some supporters are jumping over the moon about launching a new era of space exploration, not everyone is pleased with the plan. Critics warn that it will be difficult to fund the moon program. So far, NASA has not put a price tag on the mission but welcomes participation by other countries to help carry out its plan.
In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched
the first artificial satellite in space. The U.S. space program was established as a response. The ""space race"" between the two countries had begun. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy challenged Americans to send a person to the moon by the end of the 1960s. The time line shows some U.S. space milestones and NASA's plans for the lunar base.

Sojourner Truth is best known as an outspoken
someone who worked to end slavery. But what people may not know is that Truth was one of thousands of slaves in the United States who were bought, sold, and forced to do labor in the North.
""Many people are surprised when you talk about slavery in the North,"" Alan Singer, a professor of education at Hofstra University, told
""We associate slavery with the South, even though the biggest importer of slavesafter South Carolinawas New York City.""
Singer and other educators spread the word about slavery in the North. Although there were fewer slaves in the North than in the South, slavery flourished in New York City, northern New Jersey, rural Pennsylvania, and the shipping towns of Connecticut and Rhode Island. In 1771, slaves made up about 12 percent of the population of New York City.
Some slaves in the North were offered freedom to fight for the British during the Revolutionary War (17751783). However, slavery wasnt abolished in the United States until the end of the Civil War (18611865). New Jersey, for example, reported 18 slaves in 1860.
Singer explains that the slave trade helped support the
in many major Northern cities, such as Boston and New York City. The Industrial Revolution was a rapid change in the economy in the 1800s, when factories and powerdriven machines were introduced. Many U.S. businesses got their start with profits from the slave trade and slave-produced goods.
Singer tells students that the effects of slavery linger today through racial prejudice and discrimination. ""Kids see slavery as something that happened in the deep past. I want children to know that we still live with the effects of that slavery society.""
Isabella Baumfree (17971883) was born one of 13 children but never got to know her siblings because they were sold into slavery. She was emancipated, or freed, in 1828. In 1843, she changed her name to Sojourner Truth. She traveled throughout New England and the Midwest, speaking publicly against slavery and in favor of womens rights.

About 2 million died in the war. Many of the casualties were civilians. More than 107,230 U.S. soldiers were killed.
Most of the fighting ended when an armistice, or agreement to stop fighting, was signed on July 27, 1953. Land mines were placed in the DMZ to keep the two sides from combat.
However, the two sides never signed a peace treaty. The two sides continued to fight occasionally. Now the countries are trying to settle their differences and work together.

A polar bear waits patiently at the edge of a sheet of ice. Suddenly, the bear jumps forward and grabs a seal from the frigid water. But there is danger underfoot. The Arctic ice-the polar bear's main habitat-is melting.
The Arctic is the region around the North Pole. It is one of the coldest areas in the world. Polar bears rely on the Arctic ice for survival. In the Arctic, there is a lot of ice floating on top of the water. Polar bears use it as a bridge. The bears walk over the ice to get to seals, their main source of food. If the ice continues to melt, polar bears face starvation.
Some scientists fear that polar bears may disappear within the next 100 years. ""You don't have to be a polar scientist to see that if you take away all the sea ice, you don't have polar bears anymore,"" said scientist Andrew Derocher.

Scientists worry that rising temperatures will continue to shrink the polar bears' icy homes. Research shows that 2002 was the second hottest year on record. The hottest year was 1998.
To help protect polar bears and other animals in the Arctic, scientists say people need to use less fossil fuels. The U.S. government is working on a plan to reduce global warming. The officials want to develop technology that does not release as much carbon dioxide into the air.

On reality TV, video cameras follow celebrities and ordinary people as they go about their lives. Now cameras are even popping up in public schools.
Students in Biloxi, Mississippi, have found themselves under the watchful eye of Web cameras. Their school district is one of the first in the country to have cameras located in all public-school classrooms.
The school superintendent says that the use of cameras helps make sure students behave and prevents crime. The cameras, which don't record sound, are not open to public viewing.
Only the superintendent and school officials, such as principals, can watch.
Before watching the class on computers, officials are required to enter a password. Parents, teachers, and students would need court permission to watch.
Many teachers and students say they feel safer with cameras and are pleased to have them in the classrooms. Others say they don't feel the same way. They are concerned that Web cameras may interfere with teaching and distract students from learning. They also point out that the use of cameras is an invasion of privacy.

Venice attracts millions of tourists each year for its beautiful art and architecture. People weave their way through the city on boats because there are no streets. A maze of long

Venice is located in northern Italy on the Adriatic Sea. The city was built on a series of small islands in a
or an area of shallow water. During some high tides, water floods the city. For hundreds of years, people have tried to keep water out of the city to save it from sinking. Now a group of scientists has introduced a bold plan to keep the city afloat. And it means adding more water!
Venice is sinking at a rate of 1.57 inches per year, according to scientists. The Italian government has proposed the building of floodgates to control the flow of the sea.
Scientists hope to turn the tide in favor of Venice. They want to pump huge amounts of water into the ground through sturdy pipes. Scientists expect the water will expand the sand underneath and prop up the city. They hope to test the project on a small area over the next few months.
In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads.
Scientists behind the plan say that the pipes will work along with the floodgates to help save the city. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnt carried out in a careful way.
Everyone, however, agrees that saving the sinking city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose tremendous part of [history],"" Melissa Conn of Save Venice, an organization dedicated to helping preserve the city, told reporters.
Venice in Italian means ""city of canals.""
About 1.6 million people live in Venice.
The most famous building in Venice is the Basilica of St. Mark, a church dedicated to the patron saint of the city.

The statues, one 120 feet tall and the other 175 feet tall, were of the religious leader Buddha (BOO-duh), the founder of Buddhism.
Many art and history experts say the statues were historic treasures. ""They were among the most stunning [statues] I've ever seen,"" said. Professor James Fisher of Carleton College in Minnesota.
The Taliban, the religious group that rules most areas of Afghanistan, ordered the destruction of the two statues. (
In 1996, the Taliban seized the Afghan capital, Kabul, and took control of most of the country. The Taliban and a large majority of people who live in the country are Muslims. They practice a religion called Islam.
The Taliban said their holy book, the Koran, forbids the creation or worship of statues. Before the statues were destroyed, a Taliban leader said, ""Because... these statues are there to be worshipped, and that is wrong, they should be destroyed.""
Throughout the world, leaders were outraged after learning that the Taliban planned the destruction of the huge statues. World leaders and officials from the United Nations (U.N.) tried to stop the destruction. Iran, a country where most people are Muslims, asked the Taliban not to blow up the statues. Japan, a country where Buddhism is widely practiced, threatened to withhold money that the country had planned to send to Afghanistan.
Now many people are mourning the loss of the statues. ""It is [horrible] to witness the... destruction of [historic monuments], which were the [history] of the whole of humanity,"" said a U.N. representative.

Even though cell phones are a hot fad, some scientists are ringing an alarm about them. The scientists say that cell phones might pose a health threat.
In the United States, more than 90 million people use cell phones. Many of those people are kids. For kids, cell phones are about more than phone calls, says Anne Charlton of the University of Manchester in England. ""It's all about the cool factor,"" Charlton said. She added that a cell phone is not just about making calls, it's also a fashion statement.
Most cell phone users don't think about the health risks the phones might pose. Some scientists warn that cell phones give off radiation that might be harmful to users. One recent study shows that cell phone radiation might increase a person's chance of getting some kinds of cancer.
Other medical experts say cell phones don't pose a health threat. They point to studies that have not found any link between phone use and cancer.
Scientists say that people can protect themselves from cell phone radiation. One way is to use a headset instead of talking directly into a cell phone. Or, for an even simpler solution, people can make shorter calls.
When the first cell phones were sold, they all had the same ring. Today, most cell phones can be made to ring one of several different tones. But at least one cell phone manufacturer plans to change that.
Nokia plans to start making phones that play pop tunes when they ring. Users could choose tunes by the Spice Girls, Enrique Iglesias, Lenny Kravitz, and many other artists.

In the winter, West Indian manatees are found in many of the warm, shallow waters around Florida.
. A lock is an area of water in a canal enclosed by a set of gates at each end. The gates open to allow a ship to enter. The lock then fills with water to raise the ship or drains water to lower it. A lock allows a ship to move from one elevation to another.
Canal locks, however, can be deadly traps for manatees. An average of ten manatees a year have been killed in the gates in the past decade.
A little more than a year ago, the canal lock at Port Canaveral, Florida, was fitted with sensors like those used by the U.S. Navy to detect underwater mines.

The third graders at Prairie View Elementary School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, play special computer games for homework. Students spend at least 20 minutes four times a week playing the games. Each game is based on their schoolwork.
Laurene Lanich, the principal at Prairie View, says the games help kids learn. Other educators agree.
""The kids love it,"" said Joy Davis, a principal at a school where the games are given as homework. ""If you can get students where they think they're learning and playing, it has hit the magic mark,"" she said.
Kids like to play the computer games. ""I like it because it's challenging, and when I mess up I do it over and over again,"" student Adel Ahmed said.
Lightspan, a company in San Diego, California, designs the games. More than 4,000 schools in 46 states use them. The games have helped a few schools increase scores on standardized tests. The new games might even improve grades, and kids say the games are fun.
According to fourth grader Osley Galvez, playing learning games is better than doing homework the old way. ""With this, you play with the controls. It's fun!""

The Chinese calendar is split up into months based on the
or moon, cycle. The Chinese New Year begins on the first new moon falling between January 21 and February 20. It ends on the full moon 15 days later, when the moon is brightest.
People in Chinese communities around the world celebrate the holiday with music, dancing, fireworks, feasts, and parades. At celebrations, people wear red clothes and give children red envelopes with money for good luck. Red is considered a color that wards off bad luck.
The Chinese New Year ends with the Lantern Festival. On that night, children carry lanterns in a parade under the light of the full moon. The highlight of the Lantern Festival parade is the traditional dragon dance, when dancers guide a long, colorful dragon made of silk, paper, and bamboo through the streets.
Each year in the Chinese calendar is named after one of 12 animals. Legend has it that people born in each animal's year inherit some of that animal's qualities. This year is the Year of the Pig. People born in pig years are considered honest, kind, and well informed.

After the storm ends, wait 30 minutes before going outside. To determine how far away lightning is, count the seconds between the flash and the thunder. Every 10 seconds equals 2 miles.
Lightning strikes the ground in the United States about 25 million times each year! Although getting hit by lightning is unlikely, it is important to stay safe. In the United States, about 60 people are killed each year by lightning.
To stay safe, follow the golden rulehead for cover. ""There is no place outside that is safe from lightning,"" Holle said firmly. ""There are two safe placesinside a [permanent] building or a metal-topped vehicle.""
Lightning expert Ron Holle shared the following tips with
Find shelter in a building or a metal-topped vehicle (not a convertible), and close the windows.
If you're caught outdoors, stay away from open spaces and avoid standing near tall objects, such as trees.
Avoid using electrical equipment, such as computers, TVs, and phones. (Cell phones are safe to use.)
Stay away from sinks and showers. Lightning can travel through water pipes.
Wait 30 minutes after the last sound of thunder or flash of lightning before going outside.

Southern Asia is split between two tectonic platesthe Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. As the Indian Plate moves, it jams into the Eurasian Plate. (See ""Crash Course"" above.) The collision has forced the rock layers on each plate's edge upward, creating the Himalaya mountains. Scientists say the recent earthquake was caused by pent-up pressure at the place where the two plates meet.
In many of South Asia's towns, homes and buildings were not constructed to withstand the quake. That is something officials will keep in mind as they work on rebuilding efforts. From Pakistan, Bushra Hassan witnessed the destruction and told

or types, of plants and animals than any other place in the world.
Since 1970, more than 232,000 square miles of the Amazon rain forest have been destroyed. That is nearly the size of Texas! The destruction has endangered many animal species. Experts predict that the continued

Officials were especially concerned about preserving the forests. Part of the area is believed to contain more than half of all bird, animal, and plant species found in the Amazon. Many endangered animals, including the giant Amazon otter, make their homes there. Under the government's plan, those parts of the Amazon will be off-limits to the public.

179,"""May I stay up just a little longer?"" That's the cry heard from kids every night in many U.S. households. That's because most kids don't want to go to bed.
Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks.
The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8? hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said.
Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said.
In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should.
Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school.
Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep.
Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' ""
If a kid loses one hour of sleep a night, how many hours of sleep does he or she lose in a week? A month? A year?

Fourth grader Annie Inglese knows how important it is to get the right amount of sleep each night. ""If I don't get enough sleep,"" she says, ""I have trouble getting up in the morning.""
Sleep experts say that kids who do not get a good night's sleep on a regular basis put their safety at risk. Delaying bedtime for other activities can lead to accidents, such as falling off a bike or getting hurt on the playground.
In addition to preventing injuries, children who get enough sleep on a regular basis tend to get better grades and be in a better mood. ""Sleep is just as important as nutrition and exercise in our overall health,"" says Dr. Carl Hunt, a sleep expert with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Estimates show about 1 out of every 4 adults does not get enough sleep. Sleep experts think that number may be just as high for kids. According to the NIH, children ages 7 to 11 need at least nine hours of sleep each night.
Most kids and families today have busy schedules that can keep them from getting enough sleep. Plus, watching television, chatting on the Internet, and playing video games all compete with valuable sleep time.
Going to bed at the same time each night will help you get a good night's sleep. If you have trouble falling asleep, Dr. Hunt advises you to unwind with quiet time. Reading or listening to soothing music can help bring on sleep.

Woodstock was a large music festival held in the rural town of Bethel, New York, in 1969. At that time, the United States was divided over the war in Vietnam and the struggle for civil rights. Adam interviewed Michael Lang, one of the organizers of the concert.
When did you come up with the idea for the Woodstock Music and Art Fair?
In the winter of 1968. I was 23 or 24.
How did you get big stars to come to the concert?
Woodstock sounded like an event nobody wanted to miss, and the name Woodstock in those days was known. It was the home of Bob Dylan, Janice Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and other cultural icons. Initially, it was all about making everyone believe that these people were going to come and that I could get everyone to come. Soon, through word of mouth, bands were calling us.
Did you have any idea that so many people would show up?
In the beginning, we planned on 200,000, but officially we were trying to get a permit for only 50,000. In the end, we had somewhere between 500,000 and 600,000, but more than 1 million who tried to come were turned away. They had to close the [New York State] Thruway and the Canadian border.
Why did you choose Woodstock as the site, and why did you decide to keep the name Woodstock even after you ended up holding the festival 60 miles away, in Bethel?
We had to move to Bethel because we could not find a largeenough place in Woodstock. A lot of people tried to convince me to change the name [of the festival] to Bethel, but I felt the name reflected the spirit of what we were trying to do, which was to create an atmosphere of artistic community. Woodstock always stood for that.
Why are people still talking about Woodstock today?
What made Woodstock unique was how many people came and how well they treated each other. The world was shocked to discover that a crowd of more than 500,000 could live together for three days in a field and treat each other with love and respect. This was set against a backdrop of the war in Vietnam, ... a battle for civil rights and women's rights, and a yearning for peace in the world. The people who came to Woodstock accomplished all of these things, at least for that period of time, so it gave people hope for their future.
The interview taught me that a lot of musicians were activists. I also learned that no matter how prepared you are, you also have to

Tornadoes come in all shapes and sizes and do not always appear in the funnel form depicted in movies such as
The March tornadoes occurred when cold weather from the west collided with warm weather from the Gulf of Mexico.
Wind gusts that raged across the Midwest reached 90 miles per hour in five states, according to the National Weather Services Storm Prediction Center. One gust clocked in at 107 miles per hour in Kansas.
Tornadoes can strike in any month in any part of the world. In the United States, peak activity for tornado season is from April through July.
scientists who study weathersay the series of 113 damaging storms that tore through the Midwest will beat the recent record for the number of tornadoes on a single day in March. The previous record was 69 on March 13, 1990. ""For this early in the year, its a heck of a deal,"" says weather expert Joe Schaefer. ""What happens after that is anybodys guess.""
After the thunderstorms caused the series of deadly twisters, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for Michigan and Indiana. If a
is issued for an area, the conditions are favorable for a tornado to form. If the Weather Service issues a
for an area, a tornado has been spotted. In the case of a tornado warning, people should seek safe shelter immediately.
The National Weather Service also employs storm spotters to help predict where and when a tornado will strike. The trained volunteers are positioned before a storm hits to report what they see developing in the sky. Their reports confirm what weather forecasters see on their radar screens.
For many, there is no escaping the tornadoes wrath. ""It was over before you knew it,"" Greg Kospar of Bentonville, Arkansas, told reporters after the storm. ""The house is gone.""
The strength of a tornado and its potential to cause damage are rated using the Fujita scale, with 0 being the weakest and 5 being the strongest. A new tornado rating system is scheduled to go into effect early next year.

Skateboard class is rolling into schools! For sixth grader Carlos Cervantes, learning to skateboard takes a lot of work, but its worth it. ""[On] the first day of class, I was scared, but I tried it,"" the 12-year-old told
""After two days of practice, I felt more comfortable.""
Carlos is learning to skateboard in an after-school program at West Middle School in Aurora, Colorado. Skateboards are now finding their way into the regular school day as well. Douglass Elementary in nearby Boulder is the first public school in the country to offer skateboarding in gym class.
Douglasss physical education (PE) teacher Richard Cendali starts his skateboarding class by teaching students how to put on their safety gear and how to fall without getting hurt. Then kids start rolling around the gym. ""Sometimes theyre so excited, they fall. Theyre screaming, Im doing it! Im doing it!"" says Cendali, laughing. ""Its such a thrill to see those kids succeed and see their smiles.""
PE instructors around the country have started teaching classes such as skateboarding, in-line skating, yoga, and even rock climbing. Experts call these sports ""the new PE."" These individual sports are designed to help fight childhood
by getting kids involved in fun physical activities. Obesity is the condition of being dangerously overweight. Another goal of these nontraditional activities is to promote lifelong fitness habits.
Since 1980, the percentage of young people who are overweight has more than tripled. The time students spend in PE class, however, is decreasing. Many schools have dropped gym classes to save money or to provide students with more classroom time. Only 8 percent of elementary schools offer gym class to students every day, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Because students have less PE time, teachers are searching for ways to keep kids moving. ""[Skateboarding] is a great activity that keeps kids engaged in physical movement and gives them new skills and interests,"" says West Middle Schools afterschool program coordinator, Lindsey Johnson.
Some people say skateboarding not only offers health and fitness benefits but also teaches life lessons that could help kids with their schoolwork. Students who are learning to skateboard often spend hours practicing a new trick before they get it right. ""Skateboarding teaches kids to believe that if they stick with something, they will ultimately succeed,"" says education expert Richard Sagor of Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon.
Carloss skateboarding teacher at West Middle School, Eric Klassen, agrees. ""A baby will attempt to walk 600 to 900 times before [he or she] is successful,"" Klassen says. ""We tell students that they shouldnt say I cant do it unless theyve tried 600 to 900 times.""
Klassens students take his advice to heart. ""It took me 600 times to learn one new trick,"" says Martin Carrera, 11.
Over the last decade, team sports have dropped in popularity while individual sports, such as skateboarding, have been on the rise. This trend may affect the kinds of activities PE teachers offer in gym class. Learning individual sports gives all students an opportunity to exercise, whether they make it onto a school team or not.
Imagine that your school offers a skateboarding class. Would such a class have a positive effect on you? Explain.

President George W. Bush is the Republican candidate.
Senator John Kerry is the Democratic candidate.
How do you plan to create a cleaner environment?
My administration has put in place some of the most important antipollution policies in a decade. I have a responsibility as the president to put people in my administration [who] understand the importance of conserving our natural resources and making them better.
As Americans, we have the right to breathe unpolluted air and drink safe water. Across America, we will guarantee all children access to clean, safe parks and baseball fields and take on traffic congestion. We will protect the health of all Americans by [improving air quality].
Both George W. Bush and John Kerry support the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law.
What will you do to make sure kids in the United States get the best education possible?
I believe every child can learn and every school must teach--so we passed the most important federal education [law] in history. Because we acted, children are making progress in reading and math, America's schools are getting better, and nothing will hold us back.
Every child should be held to high standards. Every classroom should have a great teacher. Every young person should graduate [from] high school, and every young person who works hard and wants to go to college should be able to afford it.

465,"Overfishing is harming the world's sea life.
Troubled waters are ahead for the world's fish. Those finned creatures and shellfish, such as crabs and clams, may be a rare sight by 2048, according to a fouryear study. The study, recently published in the journal
was conducted by a team of 14 researchers in four countries.
If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
The study warns that ocean life is being wiped out because of overfishing and pollution.
Global warming (a rise in Earth's temperatures) and habitat loss are also to blame for the decline in seafood.
Although the world's sea life is in serious danger, it's not too late to reverse the problem, says the study's lead author, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. The researchers have called for measures to protect current fish populations, such as reducing large-scale fishing and pollution. ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we don't change things,"" Worm told reporters.
The loss of ocean life will cause more than just a shortage of seafood. It could spell disaster for ecosystems too. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that work together as a unit to live. A declining fish population would cause a disaster up and down the food chain. Larger animals, such as seals and dolphins, depend on fish for food. Without enough fish to eat, those animals would be in trouble.

95,"On March 16, Michael Yachinich of Chicago Heights, Illinois, heard a smoke alarm go off on the stairs to his upstairs bedroom. Michael, age 7, quickly went into the living room where his mother was sleeping. He woke her up, and the two quickly left the house. They ran to a neighbor's house and called 911. The fire was quickly contained by firefighters.
Michael had recently participated in his school's ""Great Escape"" project for Fire Prevention Week. Michael and his family knew how to exit their home safely during a fire. Firefighter Terrence Campbell of the Glenwood Fire Department said that Michael showed good fire safety behavior. He acted quickly to help his mom leave the house and report the fire, as well as by using a home escape plan to escape danger. ""I feel that his actions from the 1999 ""Great Escape"" project helped Michael know what to do,"" Campbell said.
An escape plan also helped save the lives of the Walker family in Ontario, Canada. Shortly after 3 a.m. on February 18, 1999, a fire began in the ground floor apartment below the Walker apartment. The family awoke to find their apartment filling with smoke.
Everyone reacted immediately. The family put their home fire escape plan into action, and everyone left the building right away and went to their meeting place outside. By the time they got there, flames were racing through the apartment.
Earlier in the school year, 9-year-old twins Ashley and Ryan Walker participated in their school's ""Great Escape"" fire safety program. Mr. Walker says the twins helped the family know what to do when the fire began. ""They pushed the fire procedures,"" he said. ""They learned them at school and had us practice how to get out.""
Although the idea of a fire starting in your home is scary, you can use the prevention skills taught in your school to keep fires from starting in your home. But, if a fire does start, you can prepare your family and yourself by having a ""Great Escape"" plan and practicing it at least twice a year!

674,"The mummy which may be Nefertiti lies in Egypt's Valley of the Kings.
Queen Nefertiti's name means ""the beautiful one has come."" It is not surprising that she was given such a name. Queen Nefertiti has long been admired for her swanlike neck and high cheekbones.
But Nefertiti was more than just a pretty face. She is believed to have been one of the most powerful women who ever lived. She ruled Egypt more than 3,000 years ago. Egypt is a country in Africa.
Mysteriously, no one knows how Queen Nefertiti died. Her remains have never been found--until now, perhaps.
led by Joann Fletcher uncovered three mummies in a tomb in Egypt. (Archaeologists are scientists who dig up ancient objects and study them to learn about the past.) Fletcher believes that one of the mummies is Queen Nefertiti.
Modern science is helping Fletcher prove her idea and identify the face of the mummy. After X-rays of the mummy were taken, scientists put together a computerized version of what the face would have looked like.
What they discovered was amazing! The re-created face resembles a famous sculpture of Queen Nefertiti that was made during her reign.
""If the mummy is who we think it is, it would certainly help to answer a lot of unanswered questions,"" said Fletcher.
Scientists are quick to point out that the computerized version of the face does not prove that the mummy is Queen Nefertiti. The re-created face, however, isn't the only clue to the past.
There are other pieces of the puzzle that make Fletcher's team think the mummy is Nefertiti. First, the mummy's hair had been shaved off. Nefertiti preferred a shaved head so that her crown would fit tightly. A shaved head also helped her stay cool in Egypt's heat. Second, traces of a wig found next to the mummy matched the kind Nefertiti would have worn.
In addition, the mummy's left earlobe was pierced twice. Statues of Nefertiti show her having a double-pierced ear. The mummy's forehead showed the mark of a tight-fitting band--a sign of royalty. Another clue was the mummy's bent arm, which was broken off. Royalty were usually buried with their arms bent.
Not all scientists are convinced that the mummy is Nefertiti.
""If the mummy is female and if it is royal, then you still do not necessarily have Nefertiti,"" one archaeologist told
Another scientist from Egypt expressed doubts that the mummy is even a female. He said that both men and women could have double-pierced ears.
But Fletcher believes that she has found the long-lost queen and has returned Nefertiti to her rightful place in history.
The mummy which may be Nefertiti lies in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. That is an ancient burial ground for royalty. It is located in the desert, south of Cairo (the capital of Egypt) and along the west bank of the Nile River.
Scientists are starting to piece together more about the legendary queen's life. Nefertiti is now one of the most popular faces from ancient history, but that wasn't always the case.
, ruled Egypt together and had many enemies. Pharaoh is a name given to Egyptian kings.
The pharaoh and Nefertiti were disliked because they challenged the religion of the time. They began to worship one god instead of many gods. As part of their new religion, they moved from the city of Thebes and built a new capital in the heart of the desert. The new capital was called Akhetaton (ah-keh-TAHT-uhn).
(The modern name is Amarna.) They also made many changes to the style of art and architecture of the time.
Many historians think that when Nefertiti's husband died, she became pharaoh.

How do changes taking place in the Supreme Court affect the lives of all Americans?
States is now in sessionwith a brand-new leader. John G. Roberts Jr. was recently sworn in as the 17th chief justice.
The Supreme Court is the highest court in the nation. The Court is made up of nine judgeseight associate justices and one chief justice. Justices are appointed for life. The retirement or death of a justice can create an opening on the Supreme Court.
or chose, Roberts to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. O'Connor, the first woman justice, had announced in July that she would retire. But on September 3, Chief Justice William Rehnquist died.
Bush then asked the Senate to consider Roberts for the chief justice position. The chief justice is considered the justice with the most influence on the Court.
""One of the most [important] decisions a president makes is his appointment of a justice to the Supreme Court,"" said Bush in his announcement of Roberts's nomination. ""The decisions of the Supreme Court affect the life of every American.""
At press time, the president had nominated Harriet Miers to take over O'Connor's position. If Miers is confirmed, she will be the third woman to serve on the Supreme Court, after O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
John Roberts was born in Buffalo, New York, on January 27, 1955. In high school, he was captain of his football team. He also wrestled, sang in the choir, and edited the school newspaper. After graduating from law school, he assisted then Associate Justice Rehnquist. He is married to a lawyer and has two childrenJosie, 5, and Jack, 4.
The Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., heads the judicial branch, one of three branches of the U.S. government. The other two branches are the legislative branch and the executive branch. Each branch has a different job.
The authors of the Constitution created the three branches to ensure that no branch had too much power. That system is called
The legislative branch makes laws. That branch is also called Congress and is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The executive branch carries out laws made by Congress. That branch is headed by the president. The judicial branch
or explains, the laws. Many courts across the nation make up the judicial branch.
A case makes its way to the Supreme Court through lower courts. The Supreme Court has the power to overturn rulings made in lower courts. Once the Supreme Court rules on a case, the decision is final. All lower courts must follow its decision in similar cases.
How does a person become a Supreme Court justice?
1. The president nominates a person to serve as a justice.
2. A group of senators, called the Senate Judiciary Committee, asks the nominee his or her opinions about various laws and cases.
3. The Judiciary Committee votes on the nominee.
4. If the nominee is approved by the Judiciary Committee, all 100 U.S. senators vote. (There are two senators for each state.)
5. A nominee is confirmed if he or she receives 51 votes. Roberts was confirmed by a Senate vote of 78 to 22.
Roberts is the youngest chief justice since John Marshall led the Supreme Court more than 200 years ago. At age 50, Roberts is likely to be chief justice for a very long time. The chief justice decides which cases the Court will hear. In many cases, the chief justice speaks first and leads the debate.
During his swearing-in ceremony, Roberts said to President Bush, ""There is no way to repay the confidence you have shown in me other than to do the best job I possibly can do, and I'll try to do that every day.""

Should humans be afraid of sharks, or should sharks be afraid of humans? Debate this issue.
The above incidents took place in Florida during October. After reading such stories, many people might think that they should not swim in Florida's waters. But shark experts say that would be an overreaction. As scary as they are, shark attacks are rare.
The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) says you are more likely to be hit by lightning than be bitten by one of the more than 350 shark species. In fact, each year about 500 people are hurt by lightning in the United States. In 1999, only 58 shark attacks occurred
Scientists say some species of sharks can live up to 50 years.
The largest shark, the whale shark, can be 50 feet long.
Shark skeletons have no bones. The skeleton is made of a tough substance called
Not all sharks are meat eaters. Basking sharks, for example, eat
, tiny plants and animals that float in water. As a result, basking sharks don't have teeth.
Shark Expert Rodney Fox explained, ""Sharks do not like humans; we are too bony. A lot of people who have been bitten by sharks have survived because the shark spat them out.""
One reason that shark attacks may seem more common than before is that more people are using shorelines for recreation, said George Burgess of ISAF.
Sharks that do bite humans have often mistaken people for other kinds of animals. For example, ISAF officials say sharks attack surfers wearing dark-colored wetsuits more often than they do anyone else. To a shark, the wetsuits make surfers look like seals, a favorite food.
Some shark experts say sharks should fear people, not the other way around.
One of the biggest threats to sharks, said Burgess, is
. Finning happens when a fisher catches a shark, cuts off its fins, and tosses the dead fish overboard. The fins are used to make delicacies such as shark fin soup.
Conservation groups are urging governments to protect sharks. During the summer, the U.S. House of Representatives acted to protect sharks when it passed a bill that could prevent finning in U.S. waters. In order for that bill to become law, the U.S. Senate has to pass it, and the president must sign it.
U.S. Rep. Randy Cunningham introduced the bill. ""We must end the harmful and wasteful practice of shark finning,"" Cunningham said.

In 1951, Linda Brown, a third-grade student in Topeka, Kansas, was one of many African American children forced to attend black-only schools. Even though the school for white students was just blocks from her house, Linda had to travel all the way across town to an all-black school.

Niger is the second-poorest country in the world. The United Nations estimates that 2.5 million of Niger's 12 million people live on less than one meal per day.

The aquanauts spend as much time as they can on the reef studying sea life. They can spend up to nine hours at one time outside the laboratory.

Coral reefs are in danger. One-fourth of the world's coral reefs have already been destroyed, and the remaining reefs could be destroyed within the next century, scientists say.

The strange substance is not some weird goo from space. It is actually bee waste. The environmental workers found an unusually large number of beehives near the towns where the goo fell.
When the bees from those hives flew over the communities, they dropped the waste. Because it was a good year for bees, there was a lot of waste. Luckily, the bee goo is made mostly of pollen and is harmless.

Last October, the Piscataway Board of Education voted to limit the amount of homework kids get. For kids in elementary school, homework is limited to 30 minutes a weeknight. For kids in high school, the amount of homework is limited to two hours a weeknight.
In recent years, many U.S. parents have called for limits on the amount of assigned homework.
Those parents have argued that heavy loads of homework leave kids little time for other activities. In addition, some parents say that homework assignments are so tough that they have to hire tutors to help their kids with homework.
Before the school board in Piscataway acted, parents there had been concerned about the amount of homework assigned by teachers. ""[Kids] are in school for six-and-a-half hours a day,"" said parent Cheryl Weaver. ""They don't need to come home and do another two or three hours of homework. That's more than a full-time job.""
Many educators worry about cutting down on homework. They say that limiting homework could mean limiting learning.
Some educators say that even a light load of homework helps kids learn and do well in school. The Educational Resources Information Center the of U.S. Department of Education has released a report about homework and its impact on students.
Many companies across the United States have developed Web sites aimed at helping kids with their homework. Many of those Web companies hire teachers to help kids come up with the answers to questions. Here are two such sites.
According to the department's report, homework helps students in many ways. For example, homework helps students become interested in different subjects, teaches them responsibility, and improves their classroom work. In short, homework helps students do better in school and get better grades.
Some students agree with the experts. New York resident Kaitlin Ofman, 12, notes that although she sometimes has a lot of homework, she still feels that there is a benefit to doing it.
""I understand that homework is important,"" Kaitlin said. ""After we learn something in school, we might forget it if we [didn't] have any practice in it,"" she said.

Bidis are not candy. They actually contain even more deadly poisons than other kinds of cigarettes. The American Lung Association says bidis contain five times more
than other cigarettes. Tar is a chemical that causes disease. Nicotine is a drug that makes people crave cigarettes.
Health experts also say people who smoke bidis have to puff longer and harder than they do with other cigarettes. That means smokers breathe in more poisons.
In every state, it is illegal for kids to buy cigarettes, including bidis. The U.S. government has also banned the importing of bidis because child laborers often make them.
The laws, however, are being broken. Recently, a group of kids in Oregon went undercover to help the police. The kids, ages 8 to 15, were able to buy bidis in some stores.
Health experts say the best way to stop kids from using cigarettes is to give kids the facts about how deadly cigarettes are. Another way to keep kids from smoking ""is to get adults to quit, because they are the biggest role model for kids,"" said health expert Greg Conley.
Smoking kills parts of the lungs that allow a person to breathe. It causes illnesses, such as bronchitis and emphysema.

The student had seen the principal choking during lunch and had used the

At the time he read the story, Brandon didn't think he would ever need to use the Heimlich maneuver. But what he learned from the article later helped him save a life.
During lunch on October 3, Brandon looked up and saw a classmate, Joseph Dettwiler, choking and frantically pointing to his throat.
""I saw Joseph choking on a potato chip,"" Brandon recently told
. ""His face was turning red and blue, and he was holding his throat.""
Then Brandon remembered reading about the Heimlich maneuver in

Joseph doesn't remember much about the experience except being frightened and seeing Brandon jump out of his seat. ""I was really scared,"" Joseph said, but ""Brandon got up and saved my life.""
What did Joseph learn from the experience? ""I learned that you should chew your food slowly and that you should also learn about the Heimlich maneuver. You might have to use it on somebody.""
Stand behind the choking victim and wrap your arms around his or her waist.
Make a fist and hold it against the victim's stomach, about halfway between the belly button and the rib cage.
Grab your fist with your other hand. Press it in with an upward thrust. Repeat until victim stops choking.

The wolves, however, weren't injured. The sharpshooter had shot special darts at them. The darts contained a drug that put the wolves to sleep.
U.S. government officials picked up the sleeping wolves. They planned to move the wolves to an area far away from people.
The two wolves are part of a program to bring wolves back to Arizona and New Mexico. Until about 1900, the Mexican gray wolf lived in both states. Some of the wolves ate cattle and attacked people. People hunted the wolves because they thought the animals were dangerous. By 1950, few wolves were left in the area.
The U.S. government has brought wolves back to those states. But ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico say wolves are causing problems again.
What's the scariest animal? Is it a grizzly bear, a shark, or a wolf? Or is it something else? Believe it or not, deer are more dangerous.
Deer may seem harmless, but they can cause a lot of trouble. Deer often wander onto busy roads. When they do, they can cause car accidents. In 2001, deer caused 26,000 car accidents. A year earlier, they caused 83 human fatalities.
Ranchers say the wolves that the sharpshooters hit with darts killed 19 calves. The ranchers fear that the wolves might attack people as well.
""I can handle the bears and the mountain lions and the bobcats,"" said one rancher. When you see [those animals], they take off. They're scared of you. These wolves, they're not scared. And that's what scares me.""
The ranchers say wolves cannot be reintroduced to their area because too many people live there now. ""You can't turn back the clock,"" one person said.

Did some of baseball's top players cheat by taking steroids illegally? Among the players appearing before Congress were former stars Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire. Canseco wrote a book admitting to using steroids and accused other players, including McGwire, of steroid use.
During the hearing, McGwire, a top home run hitter, refused to say whether he used steroids but acknowledged ""there has been a problem with steroid use in baseball.""

""I started thinking of them as a family almost immediately,"" filmmaker Martyn Colbeck told
He was talking about wild elephants, not his next-door neighbors. For more than 15 years, Colbeck has filmed a family of African elephants in Amboseli National Reserve in eastern Africa.
airs April 1 on the PBS television show
The new film comes after recent studies found that elephants can recognize their reflection in a mirror. That is something only humans, chimpanzees, and dolphins were thought to be able to do. ""These animals are smart,"" Colbeck says. His documentary shows just how intelligent African elephantsthe world's largest land animalsare.
Colbeck's film follows an elephant family led by a 62-year-old female elephant named Echo. In the wild, African elephants live in herds. They roam long distances to find food. The oldest female elephant, called the
leads the herd. Adult male elephants live separately from the females and the young calves.
Echo guides her family to fresh water and food while staying alert for danger. The young elephants are the most
or at risk of being harmed. Colbeck witnessed that danger when he saw another elephant family attempt to kidnap Echo's calf Ebony. Echo gathered the other adult female elephants in her family to come to the rescue. ""Together they plowed into the kidnappers to recover Ebony,"" Colbeck explained. ""It showed forethought and teamwork.""
During his years of filmmaking, Colbeck observed other signs of elephant intelligence. Elephants communicate with each other through low rumbling sounds that people often cannot hear. Family members also make distinct sounds that other members can recognize.
or customs. After an elephant dies, the other family members cover the body with sticks and leaves and linger near the site for days. The animals often return to the site years later.
Amboseli National Reserve covers about 150 square miles in southern Kenya, near the Tanzania border. The Kenyan government protects the nature reserve's elephants from
or illegal hunting. Elephants have been hunted throughout history for the ivory in their tusks. Humans have used ivory to make jewelry and other objects. Today, elephants are an endangered species.
Since strict anti-poaching laws were put into effect in 1968, the number of elephants in Amboseli has risen from 500 to more than 1,200. When Colbeck began filming Echo's family in 1990, the family had only 14 members. Today it has 30 members.
Although the elephants still face some danger from the local Masai tribespeople, the creatures have become remarkably comfortable around human visitors. That makes Amboseli an ideal place for scientists to study elephant behavior.
""The elephants are totally relaxed about having vehicles in amongst the herd,"" says Colbeck. ""Nevertheless, it is still very important to respect the animals and not disturb them.  That respect develops into a trust, and in that way we have been able to document some extraordinary moments in their lives."" That trust has not only allowed Colbeck to film Echo's family, but it has also made him feel like one of the family.
The elephant families in Amboseli National Reserve are organized alphabetically. Echo's family is the ""E"" family, so every member of the family is given a name starting with
Here's how Echo fits in with some of her relatives.

(age 17): When he was born, Ely couldn't walk. The family waited to move until he stood on his own. Now he lives alone. He left the herd at age 12.
(age 25): Edwina is Echo's first known grandchild.
(age 22): Eleanor helped care for Email after Erin died.
(age 6): Email's mother, Erin, died when he was 2. Now the rest of the family takes care of him.
(age 12): Europa is Echo's first known great-grandchild.
(age 8): Elaine is Echo's second great-granddaughter.

For students in cities across the country, from Atlanta to Las Vegas, break time is over. Elementary-school children at the Clark County School District in Las Vegas recently said good-bye to recess.
Why has this Las Vegas district and many others eliminated, or

The students in Clark County have a 30-minute lunch period. They have to squeeze playground minutes into that half-hour block. They no longer get an additional 15- to 20-minute recess.
Many teachers, parents, and students disagree with the decision to ban recess. Education experts often say that recess is an important part of the school day.
Those experts say that the benefits of recess outweigh the lost class time. Recess gives students the opportunity to take a break, exercise, and socialize with their friends. At recess, many students learn how to cooperate and play with other students. In addition, some studies show a recess break can help improve test scores.

Skin may not seem very important, but it is. It protects your body from burns, dirt, germs, and dangerous rays from the sun. It keeps fluids inside your body. And it contains all the nerves that allow you to feel things.
Skin is the largest organ in your body. If you stretched out an adult's skin into a flat sheet, it would cover an area of about 21 square feet. A square foot is a square whose sides each measure 1 foot.
Skin may cover a large area, but it is very thin. It is only about 1/8 inch thick. Despite being so thin, skin is made of three layers. The outermost layer is the epidermis. Just below the outermost layer is the dermis. Beneath those two layers is the subcutaneous tissue.
The epidermis contains a chemical called keratin. Keratin makes skin tough and waterproof. Keratin keeps germs out of your body.
The dermis is mainly made of blood vessels and nerve endings. The dermis provides the epidermis with food and oxygen.
The lowest layer, the subcutaneous tissue protects the body from blows. It also regulates the body's temperature.
All three layers of your skin protect you. Because your skin protects you, you should protect it by keeping it clean and eating a healthful diet. You should use sunblock when you are in the sun. If you take care of your skin, it will last a lifetime.

Her brother, Terren, had arranged his school supplies in his backpack to prepare for his first day of second grade. But Hurricane Katrina prevented schools in New Orleans from opening.

Now Tenisha and her brother are getting used to a new school in Houston. ""I've started making new friends already,"" Tenisha told
Tenisha and Terren are not alone. An estimated 372,000 children from Louisiana and Mississippi have found themselves in new schools, since the hurricane caused damage and flooding in those states. Schools from Maine to California have embraced students like Tenisha and Terren with hugs, smiles, and welcome signs.
Schools in Texas expect to enroll as many as 60,000 new kids. Houston schools alone enrolled almost 2,000 students in the few days following the devastating hurricane.

I live in Desoto, a town outside Dallas, Texas. My school district has taken in roughly 188 students from New Orleans. I must hand it to the kids; they are adapting pretty fast. It is cool because our school is doing everything to make the new students feel at home. We call it ""Southern hospitality.""
I have seen many acts of kindnesswhether it's letting a kid from New Orleans go to the front of the lunch line or giving a new student a personal tour of the school.
I wonder if I could be as strong if my city went through a disaster such as Katrina. What happens to New Orleans from here, we don't know. But what we do know is that we need to appreciate our family and friends. We need to be thankful for the things that we have because we do not know what tomorrow will bring.

Now Farid Dadashev, age 11, is doing something to stop the fighting.
A few years ago, Farid said, ""I don't want to be a soldier when I grow up. I want to be a teacher."" Because of that desire for a peaceful life, Farid started the Child Peace Network. He sent out a petition to kids calling for peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia. So far, 10,000 kids from three countries have signed that petition.
In January, Farid traveled to the United Nations (U.N.) in New York City to talk about how the kids in his country are suffering from the war.
Azerbaijan and Armenia have been fighting over a region called Nagorno-Karabakh. Both countries claim the region belongs to them. Most of the people who live in that region are Armenian, and in 1988, the people of Nagorno-Karabakh began asking for independence or to join Armenia.
In 1991, that request turned into a bloody conflict between the two countries. The fighting lasted until 1994, when a cease-fire was declared. Although the cease-fire continues, the two sides have not settled their differences, and fighting still breaks out.
""The war affects everyone in Azerbaijan,"" Elmira Suleymanova, Farid's grandmother, told
from her home in Baku, Azerbaijan. ""No one can feel safe. One night, an entire community was burned to the ground.""
According to the U.N., the years of fighting have left 1 million people homeless. About 30 percent of those refugees are kids under age 15, said Farid.
No one knows if Farid's petition has had an impact on the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But last month, the leaders of the two countries met to discuss peace.

Some of the sites include Stonehenge, a circle of prehistoric stones in England; the Taj Mahal, a tomb in India; and the Everglades, a huge swamp.
Governments of the countries that have signed the World Heritage treaty
, or propose, sites that should be protected. The governments must also provide a plan for protecting each site.
A committee of 21 people then decides which sites should be protected. Preserving important sites worldwide is important so future generations can appreciate and learn from them. The World Heritage Convention is ""a noble, vital force in the world, fostering peaceful coexistence and honoring our past in equal measure with our future,"" said one convention member.

241,"The sounds of ivory-billed woodpeckers convince scientists that the birds are no longer extinct
Knock, Knock? Who's there? The ivory-billed woodpecker, that's who!
For more than 50 years, scientists thought the ivory-billed woodpecker was extinct in the United States. Now bird lovers are flying high. Scientists recently announced that they have evidence the bird still exists in eastern Arkansas. The scientists caught the black-and-white birds in flight on a blurry videotape.
The ivory-billed woodpecker was seen again at Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in Eastern Arkansas.
The rare woodpeckers began to disappear between 1880 and the 1940s when loggers cut down the forests where they lived. The last sighting was in 1944.
The ivorybill is the largest woodpecker in the country. The red-crested bird's body is shiny blue-black. It has white markings on its neck and on both edges of its huge wings. The woodpecker's wingspan extends almost 3 feet. The bird also has a straight bill, short legs, and feet with curved claws.

For people who doubted the videotape of the woodpeckers, the scientists collected more proof. They recorded the bird's double knock.
The recording made believers out of the doubters. ""Hearing [the recording] was very exciting!"" Richard Prum, a scientist from Yale University who studies birds, told
. ""[It is] convincing evidence that the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct.""
What are people doing to help the number of ivory-billed woodpeckers bounce back? Nature lovers are cutting down some trees in a select area of Arkansas. Sound strange? The woodpeckers feed on young beetles that thrive under the bark of fallen trees. With more food for the woodpeckers, bird lovers hope that the ivorybill's double knock will become a common sound again.

People saw green, blue, and red lights. The lights formed different patterns. Some looked like rings. Others looked like curtains. And still others looked like pillars. The lights continually changed shape and color.
are also called the northern lights and southern lights.
Usually, only people living close to the North Pole and South Pole see auroras. But auroras were unusually active this fall. Even people in Arizona saw the lights.
Auroras are caused by the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The solar wind is made of tiny particles that stream away from the sun. Earth's magnetic field is similar to the field that surrounds a magnet. When the solar wind strikes Earth's magnetic field, gases in our atmosphere glow. Those glowing gases form an aurora.
The kind of glowing gas determines an aurora's color. Glowing oxygen makes red, yellow, and green auroras. Glowing hydrogen and helium make blue and purple auroras.
Don't worry if you missed the colorful auroras in October. An aurora can form at any time of year. If the solar wind continues to be as strong as it was in the fall, you may see the northern lights on any clear night.
The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth. You could line up more than 1 billion hot dogs end to end between Earth and the sun.
If you could drive to the sun in your family's car, it would take you nearly 2 million years. That's if you drove 55 miles per hour and didn't take any rest stops.
Light from the sun travels a lot faster than you can in your car. A beam of light travels at about 186,000 miles per second. It takes sunlight a little more than 8 minutes to reach Earth.

The graph shows percentages of people living in the U.S. from some ethnic groups. The figures add up to more than 100% because some people said they were from more than one ethnic group and were counted more than once.

The census also showed that U.S. kids are more
diverse than ever before. That means that today's kids have ancestors who came from a greater variety of foreign countries. ""The nation is more diverse in the year 2000 than it was in 1990, when the last census was taken,"" said Jorge del Pinal of the U.S. Census Bureau.

Much of that minority increase is due to immigration to the United States, the census reported. One in five kids has at least one parent who moved to this country from another country.
Del Pinal added that kids are more diverse than their parents because the number of marriages between people of different races is four times higher than it was in 1990. Two out of every five kids are part of at least one minority group.
Nearly 3 million kids have parents who have different ethnic backgrounds. For example, one parent may be from Asia and another from Europe.

Bringing peace and lasting democracy to Iraq will be a challenge for the country's temporary government. Different ethnic and religious groups in Iraq want a voice in the government. The assembly is made up of three groups: Shiites (SHEE-ights), Sunnis (SOON-eez), and Kurds.
The majority of Iraqis are Muslims, who practice the religion Islam. The Muslims are divided into two groupsShiites and Sunnis. The two groups have a long history of tension.

The babies are receiving constant care at the nature center. They are covered with white hair and weigh 4 to 6 ounces. That's about the size of a hot dog.
As the pandas grow, they will develop black hair on their ears and around their eyes. Black hair will also grow across their shoulders and on their legs.
The infants offer hope to scientists concerned about pandas, which are endangered. The nature center is home to more than 60 pandas. There are fewer than 1,100 giant pandas left in the wild.
Pandas in the wild live in bamboo forests in the mountains of China. The panda's diet consists mainly of bamboo shoots, stems, and leaves. Pandas lose their homes and have less food to eat when people cut down bamboo forests for wood and farmland. In an effort to protect pandas, the government of China has made it illegal to cut down bamboo in certain areas.

""This is a piece of history,"" said Bruce Danks, who worked on the bus.
On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a seamstress, boarded the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, on her way home from work. Refusing to give up her seat to a white man, Rosa Parks was arrested and sent to jail.
Her arrest sparked the beginning of the Montgomery bus boycott. A boycott is a protest in which people refuse to
buy, sell, or use something. As part of the boycott, African Americans refused to ride buses in Montgomery if they couldn't sit in the front.
The Montgomery bus boycott lasted for over a year. In December 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to segregate, or separate, whites from African Americans on buses.
An ordinary woman who made an extraordinary difference, Rosa Parks is often referred to as ""the Mother of the Civil Rights Movement."" She inspired a new era of civil rights in the United States.

This copper brooch belonged to one of the Vikings.

The Vikings were pirates and warriors, known for their sea faring voyages. From the late 700s to 1100, the Vikings lived in Scandinavia. That region of Europe includes the present-day countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
Viking sailors spread fear throughout Europe. They raided and conquered coastal villages in Europe and along the Mediterranean coast. During their raids, Vikings captured slaves. They also
, or stole, treasures, such as silver and gold.
For their voyages, Viking sailors crafted swift, narrow
that could navigate the stormiest seas. The Vikings were the master shipbuilders of their time. Vikings also worked as farmers and craftspeople. Others hunted and fished.
The Vikings' claim to fame may have been their fearsome raids, but they were explorers and traders too. They were among the earliest explorers to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to North America.
The Vikings traveled to other parts of Europe, the Mediterranean, Greenland, and North America.
One of the most famous Vikings was explorer Leif Eriksson. He reached North America almost 500 years before Columbus arrived in 1492.
Longships varied in size, but many were between 60 feet and 90 feet in length.
A larger ship could carry about 50 raiders at a time.
Strong winds allowed a longship, which had one large sail, to reach speeds of up to 17 miles an hour.
Vikings used multiple oars to row the ship when there was no wind.
The front end of a longship curved upward and was adorned with a wood carving of a snake's or a dragon's head.
Over time, the Viking raiders lost their power as people learned to defend against their attacks. Today, the remains of Viking villages can be found throughout Europe and North America.
Archaeologists plan to study the burial ground in England to learn more about the life of the Vikings. Based on the objects found, they believe the site was once a Viking settlement.
Vikings were known to bury valuable items with the dead. As one historian put it, the site will allow experts to ""uncover the secrets of a time capsule more than 1,000 years old.""

In late January, officials fro South Korea traveled to North Korea. Both countries are located in eastern Asia. The reason for their visit was to try get North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Last October, officials in North Korea admitted to a U.S. official that North Korea is building nuclear weapons. That action violates a 1994 agreement to stop the spread of nuclear arms.
Tensions further increased when North Korea's leader, Kim Jong II, opened up nuclear power plants. The power plants had been closed under an agreement that North Korea made with the United States nearly ten years ago. Officials in North Korea say the power plants will only be used to generate electricity.
However, people in the United States and countries near North Korea, like South Korea and Japan, are concerned. They think that North Korea will use the plants make nuclear arms. North Korea recently kicked out U.N. weapons inspectors. That only added to the mistrust.
North Korea is an extremely poor country. Yet it spends most of its money on its army. It relies on help from other countries to feed its starving people.
Area: 46,500 square miles (about the size of Mississippi)
Economy: many children and families are starving
Area: 38,000 square miles 9about the size of Indiana)
Economy: it has the fourth largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The United States is working with countries in the region, such as South Korea, to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear crisis. South Korea was hoping to help the United States negotiate a peaceful solution. However, officials in North Korea want to discuss the issue directly with the United States.

are large sheets of snow and ice that move slowly over land.
Glaciers are found in the polar regions around the world and in mountain valleys. The glaciers in South America are some of the largest outside the polar regions.
Because of the region's rough terrain and harsh weather, scientists have trouble reaching the area by foot. To study the melting of the South American glaciers, scientists recently relied on satellite technology.
Scientists discovered that glaciers in this area are rapidly melting.In fact, they are melting twice as fast as they were just a few years ago. Erik Rignot, an expert who studied the glaciers, referred to the South American ice fields as the ""fastest area of glacial retreat on Earth.""
As the glaciers melt, their water flows into lakes or oceans. As a result, the meltdown is causing sea levels to rise. If ocean levels rise by even a foot, the water could flood the world's coastal cities.
What is causing the glaciers to pull a disappearing act? Warmer temperatures and less snowfall from
are to blame for the meltdown, say scientists. Global warming is the worldwide rise in temperature.
The warmer temperatures cause the glaciers to break off into the ocean as icebergs. That process, called
It's not just that the South American glaciers are on thin ice. Scientists warn that about 90 percent of the world's glaciers are melting from global warming.
Some scientists say that people contribute to Earth's warmer temperatures. Harmful gases are released into the air when people burn certain fuels for electricity or for driving cars.
To help solve the problem, some scientists say people must work to reduce the effects of global warming. ""Once the glaciers have melted, that's it [for them],"" said one scientist.
Glaciers are large sheets of moving ice and snow. As snow accumulates, or builds up, on a glacier, the weight causes the snow underneath to turn into ice. The ice becomes so heavy that it forces the glacier to move.
As glaciers slowly move, they carve out the land beneath them, carrying away rocks and soil. Glaciers erode, or gradually wear away, the land.
What are some ways people can help prevent global warming?
Over hundreds and thousands of years, glaciers create different landforms, such as lakes.

It's not just governments helping out. People are making a difference in ways large and small, with companies donating millions of dollars and kids organizing bake sales to raise money.
Officials say an early warning system could have saved thousands of lives. A warning system was established in 1965 for countries that border the Pacific Ocean. The United States is part of that system.
What other problems may arise after the tsunami?
Because tsunamis are rare in the Indian Ocean, countries in that area did not have a warning system. World leaders are working to create a system that will warn and help protect people in all countries.

Republicans and Democrats compete for control of Congress.
The countdown to Election Day has begun. On November 7, Americans will head to the polls to vote in the
Midterm elections happen in the middle of a presidents term in office. (Voters choose a president every four years. The next presidential election is in 2008.)
Members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate meet in the Capitol in what is called a joint session.
Midterm elections give voters a chance to choose people to represent their state in
Members of Congress make up the U.S.
Congress, the legislative branch of government, makes our nations laws.
On Election Day, candidates will compete for 33 of 100 seats in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Elections for governors will also be held in 36 states.
Members of Congress typically belong to one of the two main
in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about government goals. This election will decide whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party controls Congress for the next two years.
Republicans currently have control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Republicans have had the upper hand in the House since 1994. Republicans have also controlled the Senate for most of the past 12 years.
A party controls the House of Representatives or the Senate when its members win a
or more than half, of the seats in it. (See
.) Why is control of Congress so important? The party in power can more easily accomplish its goals and shape U.S. law.
For months, representatives from both political parties have tried to win over voters. Their members have been speaking about important issues, or problems, our country faces. Some of those issues are the war in Iraq, gas prices, and health care. (See
""Our country is facing some serious challenges here and around the world,"" Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told
""At home, our economy has made it harder and harder for working people to make ends meet."" He added that ""the war in Iraq and emerging threats from other nations present new challenges to our national security.""
""Our top priority is to ensure that we continue to keep Americans safe while spreading freedom and democracy abroad,"" Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told
""Republicans will also work to keep taxes and healthcare prices low so that families have more money to spend on things that are important to them.""
Which party will come out on top in this election? Its up to the voters to decide.
Here are some key issues on voters minds this election season.
Recent polls show that Americans support for the war in Iraq has dropped. President George W. Bush and many Republicans say the war is an important part of making the United States safer. Many Democrats say its time to rethink U.S. strategy in Iraq.
Gas prices have been high for the last year. Only recently have they begun to dip. Many voters are worried about the high cost of gas. They want to hear plans for making gas more affordable.
About 45 million Americans dont have health insurance. If they get sick, it will be difficult for them to pay for medical care and drugs on their own. Voters are looking for ways in which the government can make health care more affordable.
Which election issues are most important to you and your family? Why?

Earth's atmosphere is made of several layers. Ozone is a gas that makes up one of those layers. That layer stretches from 6 miles to 30 miles above Earth's surface.
Ozone is an important gas. It protects life on Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. Without ozone, life couldn't exist. The dangerous solar rays are called ultraviolet rays, or UV rays. UV rays can cause sunburn and skin cancer.

Scientists first noticed the ozone hole in the 1970s. Since then, each year, the hole has opened above Antarctica for a few months in the fall. The largest hole formed in 2000. It was three times larger than the United States. This year, unusually severe storms caused the hole to split, say scientists.
Cold temperatures in the atmosphere over Antarctica and chemical pollution cause the ozone hole. Chemicals that used to be in aerosol cans, air conditioners, and refrigerators made the pollution. To protect the atmosphere, people stopped using those dangerous chemicals in the mid-1990s.
Although the chemicals are no longer used, they stay in the atmosphere for a long time. Scientists say the ozone hole will continue to form for a long time. But it should start getting smaller.

Hollywood is used to rolling out the red carpet for celebrities. Now it has laid out the carpet once again for its latest starKing Tutankhamun (too-tahn-KAHmun). The famous Egyptian king's treasures are traveling the country in a new exhibit, now open in Los Angeles. The tour will make stops in three other U.S. cities before returning to Egypt in 2007. ""

who ruled ancient Egypt more than 3,500 years ago. A pharaoh is an ancient Egyptian ruler.
After the death of his father, King Tut became pharaoh at just 9 years old. Tut reigned for about nine years before he died mysteriously. He was buried in a hidden tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, an area near the Nile River.
Tut's tomb remained locked away until 1922, when British

""Not only does [the figure] show Tut's majesty, but it also shows his human side,"" Egyptian expert David Silverman told
""You can see a young boy behind those eyes.""
The exhibit also includes the boy king's crown and gold dagger. The dagger was found strapped to the mummy's thigh. Scientists believe that Tut's subjects buried their king with the dagger to fight villains on his journey to the afterlife. Objects that belonged to Tut's family members and other Egyptian royalty are also featured at the exhibit.

A spectacular tradition of college football takes place before every Florida State University (FSU) home game.

by sports teams after the regular season. A mascot is a symbol that represents a sports team.
Seminole tribes in Florida and Oklahoma objected to the ban. The NCAA then removed FSU from its list of universities that are not allowed to use such names and mascots.

The biggest cities in the Asian nation of India are not much different from New York City or San Francisco. Towering buildings scrape the sky. Cars, trucks, and buses clog the busy roads. McDonalds restaurants and Barista coffee bars dot the avenues. Over the past 15 years, India has become one of the fastestgrowing countries in the world, second only to China.
In March, President George W. Bush made a three-day trip to the worlds largest
(A democracy is a form of government in which people vote to elect their leaders.) There, Bush and Indias Prime Minister Manmohan Singh talked about science and technology, trade and investment, and a clean environment. They also agreed on an energy proposal that both countries hope will help India meet its rapidly growing demand for electricity.
Experts predict that India will continue to grow, and by 2040 the country will boast the worlds third-largest economy, after the United States and China. The United States wants to develop a better business relationship with India.
Bush believes that trade is important to help India overcome its poverty. Even though the economy there is improving, a large portion of the population is still poor. More than 300 million people in India live on less than $1 a day. That number of people is larger than the population of the United States.
As India develops, it will require more electricity to power homes and businesses. Today, many cities in India suffer frequent blackouts because the country doesnt generate enough electricity.
During Bushs visit, he and Singh made an important agreement. The United States will share nuclear technology and fuel with India. In return, India will allow international inspectors into 14 of its 22 nuclear plants (see
The plan will allow India to reduce its dependence on
such as oil and coal. Fossil fuels are formed in Earth from plant and animal remains over millions of years. In addition, the United States and India will work together to develop new technologies for producing clean and safe energy.
The new agreement, however, is not a done deal. The changes still have to be approved by the U.S. Congress. Many U.S. leaders think India should not be allowed to have nuclear technology. India has refused to sign a treaty that outlines rules for using nuclear technology.
However, Bush continues to emphasize the importance of trade with one of the worlds fastest-growing economies. In 2005, trade between India and the United States was $25 billion and is expected to reach $40 billion by 2009.
""The United States and India, separated by half the globe, are closer than ever before,"" Bush says. ""The partnership between our nations has the power to transform the world.""
How might Indias growing economic power affect other countries?
Currently, India gets 56 percent of its electricity from coal plants and just 3 percent from nuclear power. Coal, when burned, causes air pollution. Nuclear power plants, however, release almost no pollution.
Nuclear energy is created by the splitting of the nucleus of an atom. That process is called nuclear fission. Many countries today use nuclear energy. Some experts predict that by 2050, nuclear power will provide 25 percent of Indias electricity.

So how does interest work? Say you deposit $100 in a savings account. If the banks interest rate is 2 percent per year, the bank will pay you an additional $2 after one year. (2 percent can also be expressed as a decimal: .02)
To calculate 2 percent of $100, multiply $100 by .02. Therefore, 2% of $100 = $2.
So, after one year, you will have $100 + $2, or

Many kids are unaware that the original Pinocchio story was not written in America. Pinocchio's roots can be traced back to Tuscany, an area of Italy. Carlo Collodi wrote the original story in Italy in 1881. Since then the book has been translated into more than 250 languages.

The movie appears on HBO Family in February and comes out on video and DVD in April. Playing the part of Pinocchio is 16-year-old Gabriel Thomson, who lives in England. Gabriel starred in the movie when he was 12 years old.
Gabriel described his experience as ""incredible."" During filming, he attended school for three hours each day and worked with different tutors.
Just as Pinocchio learns lessons about growing up, Gabriel learned some of his own lessons. ""I learned a lot about acting from Martin Landau, [the actor who plays Geppetto]. He taught me how to relax on the set.""

The task force will create computer models to figure out whether and when one of these flying objects might hit Earth. Its path would then be plotted on a map. Although there are no asteroid busters right now, scientists hope that soon rockets could be sent to knock asteroids off course.
Close encounters may be scary, but they help to give astronomers opportunities to better understand the beginnings of our solar system. Many scientists believe that asteroids and comets are leftovers from the formation of the sun and planets about 4.6 billion years ago.
""Its through collisions that planets are born,"" Giovanni Valsecchi, an astronomer from Italy, told reporters. ""And its through collisions that planets die.""
There are more than 1 million asteroids circling the sun between Mars and Jupiter.
Some asteroids are smaller than a car. Others are hundreds of miles across.
The first known asteroid was discovered in 1801. Today, asteroids are found regularly.
The largest asteroid is named Ceres. It is about the size of Maine. Ceres was recently classified as a dwarf planet, along with Pluto.

Rocky Mountain moose are on the moveand they're flying firstclass. Wildlife workers are using helicopters to send Utah's moose to Colorado. In exchange, wildlife officials in Colorado are capturing bighorn sheep to send to Utah. The animal swap is part of a plan to keep the moose and sheep populations in both states healthy.
Rocky Mountain moose are on the move.
One of the largest moose hauls took place in January, when a single helicopter team captured 24 of the animals in a day. The moose are now roaming free in the Grand Mesa National Forest in Colorado, where the appearance of calves indicates that the moose population is growing. Colorado workers planned to hold up their end of the bargain by capturing 20 bighorn sheep to send to Utah in February.
""This year was a major group move,"" Stephanie Duckett, a biologist with the Colorado Division of Wildlife, told
Biologists are scientists who study living things. Duckett works at Grand Mesa, which didn't have any moose two years ago. ""So far we have moved 90 moose to the mesa,"" she says. Most of those animals came from Weber County, Utah, where the moose population is in trouble.
The moose in northern Utah are threatened by
That means there are too many animals for the environment to feed and support. Overpopulation can lead to animal starvation and disease. ""It's bad for the population and bad for the environment,"" says Duckett.
Wildlife officials often try to prevent overpopulation by issuing permits that allow hunters to kill more animals during hunting season. That wasn't an option with Utah's moose; many of them live on private land where hunting is
or not allowed. Instead, wildlife officials decided to make a trade.
""Here in northern Utah, we have too many moose, and we've lost a lot of our bighorn sheep population,"" Utah wildlife manager Justin Dolling told
Colorado had a healthy supply of bighorn sheep to send to Utah, and Colorado had plenty of room for Utah's extra moose.
Once they had a plan, wildlife officials had to find a way to safely catch the wild mooseone of the largest animal species in North America. They turned to animalcapture expert James Innes and his experienced team of helicopter ""moose muggers."" A moose mugger is an animal worker trained to capture a moose without harming it. ""We have zero tolerance for
Innes's helicopter chases a moose into a clearing by flying over the forest before dropping a net to catch the animal. Once the moose is down, a moose mugger jumps out of the hovering helicopter and secures the animal's legs. ""You have to use every trick in the book to tie them up,"" says Innes.
Once the moose is secured, it is placed in a canvas bag that hangs from the helicopter and then flown to a base camp. There, a veterinarian, or an animal doctor, gives the moose a checkup before it is placed on a truck and taken to its final destinationGrand Mesa.
Wildlife managers tackled the moose overpopulation problem in Utah by sending moose to areas where they would have enough food. The map shows how moose and bighorn sheep were swapped this year to keep both groups of animals healthy.

Adult moose are too large to be hunted by other animals. Human hunters are their only predator. Half of all moose scalves are killed by wolves, grizzly bears, or black bears.
How might other animals living in the same environment be hurt by moose overpopulation? How does the animal swap help solve that problem?

For most of the last century, the flag that President Lincoln had touched was missing. This summer, officials at the Connecticut Historical Society said that they had discovered the flag in the society's basement. How did a flag from one of the darkest days in American history wind up in the historical society's basement?
After the shooting, the flag that Lincoln had grasped was given to a Civil War veteran from Connecticut. He gave it to his son, who gave it to the historical society in 1922. The flag ended up in the basement, where it lay, forgotten, for 76 years.
In 1998, a society librarian was in the basement. ""I looked down and saw what looked like a flag in a box,"" the librarian said.
The flag was in tatters, so the society spent the next three years repairing it and making sure it was the flag that our 16th president had touched.
Now visitors can see the flag at the society's museum. ""The flag makes history real,"" Susan Schoelwer, of the historical society, told
The American flag has changed many times. Here are some of the changes:
1607-1775: The British flag was flown by the 13 British colonies.
1775: The first U.S. flag had 13 stripes, with the British flag in one corner.
1818: The U.S. flag had 13 stripes and 20 stars.
1960: The current flag with 50 stars was made official.

Last month, workers in Oklahoma loaded about a dozen pieces of historic Route 66 onto trucks. Each of the 3,000-pound pieces then made a 1,400-mile trip to Washington, D.C., where they will become part of an exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
Route 66 has been called the ""Main Street of America."" It once stretched 2,400 miles, from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California. The road connected eight states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
In the 1920s, engineer Cyrus Stevens Avery of Tulsa, Oklahoma, envisioned a road connecting the Midwest and the Pacific Ocean. During the 1930s, Route 66 was completed and was soon lined with hundreds of businesses.
The road became so popular that it inspired a 1960s TV show,
, as well as a famous song, ""Get Your Kicks on Route 66.""
In the past few decades, however, Route 66 has fallen into disrepair, and parts of the old route have been dug up. Today, drivers use faster superhighways to get where they were going.
Even though fewer people drive on Route 66 now, many people still think of the road as the Main Street of America. That's why the National Museum of American History wants to include the road in its new exhibit, ""America on the Move."" The exhibit is scheduled to open in 2003.

""We ask this body on behalf of Sierra Leone to do all they can to bring our sad story to an end,"" he said. ""We want to be able to move about freely in all parts of the country.""
Sierra Leone is just one of an estimated 41 countries around the world that use child soldiers. While the most offenses occur in Africa and Asia, the problem also exists in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East.
Most children who become soldiers come from very poor countries. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers estimates that 300,000 children are fighting as soldiers. In some countries, boys and girls as young as 8 years old are being recruited, or called upon, to fight.
Protecting children in war and conflict zones has become a top job for the United Nations. And the U.N. has made significant progress. In a report issued in December 2002, the U.N. named 28 governments and armed groups that use children to fight their battles.
International law prohibits countries from using children who are younger than 15 years old in combat. However, several U.N. conventions condemn, or do not approve of, having anyone under 18 serve as a soldier. If a country recruits child soldiers, it is violating, or breaking the rule of, international agreements.
Why us it important for governments around the world to protect children?

Rats have always lived in cities. The rodents live off food and waste that people throw away. Recently, however, rat populations have grown because many communities don't have the money to pay for rat-control programs, said Jerry Hershovitz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Such programs keep rat populations down.
Rats can carry diseases that can make people seriously ill, so controlling the rat population is important.

Most of the colonists came to Virginia to search for treasure. Most did not know how to grow crops to feed themselves. They became so hungry that they ate dogs, rats, and snakes.
Eventually, more people settled in Jamestown. They turned the fort into a town. The colonists began to grow and sell crops. The small fort became the first permanent English settlement in North America.
The ""garbage"" from the well is helping historians better understand how the colonists lived.

Eric Olson, age 17, has been investing since he was 13 years old. He says kids should ""read everything on investing--books, magazine articles, the business pages of [the] newspaper."" As kids read, investing will be easier to understand, Eric said.

Activity on the sun can affect Earth. It can disrupt communications. It can also cause the

When the sun is very active, dark spots, called
, dot the sun's surface. Each day, scientists can see more than 100 sunspots on the sun. Sunspots slowly change shape and move across the sun's surface.
Sunspots have a temperature of 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit (F). That might seem hot, but it is cooler than the rest of the sun's surface, which is a sweltering 10,000 degrees F. Because sunspots are cooler than the rest of the surface, they look dark--almost like shadows.
When the sun is very active, huge explosions can rip across its surface. Those explosions, called
, propel solar material into space. About three or four days after a flare erupts on the sun, the flare may collide with Earth's atmosphere.
When a flare reaches Earth, it can damage satellites orbiting Earth, power stations, and electrical equipment. In July, a huge flare interfered with communication satellites.
The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth.
A car traveling at 55 miles per hour would take 193 years to get from Earth to the sun.
It takes a beam of light eight minutes to travel from the surface of the sun to Earth.
When solar flares reach our planet, they can make gases in Earth's atmosphere glow. The glowing gases form the northern lights.
The northern lights can be many different colors: red, blue, green, or a combination of colors.
Scientists say the best time to see the northern lights is when the sun is active. People in many parts of the United States should be able to see the northern lights in the night sky this fall. People who live in the northern part of the United States have the best chance of seeing the dancing lights. To see them, the sky must be very dark.
senior editor Fran Downey once saw an aurora (the northern lights) while visiting Washington state. ""It began as a dull green light and got brighter and brighter, until it lit up the sky,"" Downey said. ""In the distance, I could hear coyotes howling at the aurora. It was beautiful.""

Some fourth and fifth graders are on the move. The students at Ottawa Elementary School in Buchanan, Michigan, are getting a sneak preview of middle school life. Theyre switching classesand teachersfour times a day.
So far, the program has been a big hit. ""The kids really like that theyre going to get up and move every 40 minutes,"" science teacher Sue Borr told
""They dont like sitting in the same place all day.""
Borr suggested the program, which is called team teaching. Instead of staying with one teacher all day, students go to four different classrooms, where they learn four different subjects. Those subjects are math, social studies, science, and language arts. The students begin and end the day with a homeroom teacher.
""I like it better because the teachers like what theyre teaching,"" says Ottawa fifth grader Michael Meersman. ""They have fun, and theyre not as grouchy.""
Unlike many elementary school students, these fourth and fifth graders dont leave their papers and supplies in a desk. They carry their work with them from class to class in three-ring binders and colored folders. ""Theyre really organized,"" adds Borr.
Fourth graders at Ottawa have another reason to like the program: They wont have to get used to a new teacher when school starts next September, because they will learn the same subjects from the same teachers.

Should classes be girls only and boys only? Public schools now have more freedom to teach boys and girls separately. The U.S. Department of Education recently announced that it is changing the
That law prohibits public schools from treating boys and girls differently.
After the Title IX rules were put in place in 1975, singlegender classes were allowed only in specific cases, such as gym class. Under the new rules, school officials can separate boys and girls if they think it helps the students learn better. The decision has stirred up debate about equality in the classroom.

Supporters say single-gender schools help kids improve their performance in school. ""Research shows that some students may learn better in single-[gender] environments,"" says Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings.
Boys and girls may feel more comfortable raising their hands if they know they won't be embarrassed in front of the opposite gender. ""[Single-gender schools] can offer a learning environment with less peer pressure,"" Arne Duncan, head of the Chicago, Illinois, public schools, told

610,"History in the Making: Japan Invades Hong Kong
War broke out between China and Japan in 1937. An undeclared war was fought until 1941, when China, as well as the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, declared war on Japan, Germany, and Italy. In 1941, Japan invaded the British colony of Hong Kong, which is part of present-day China. Connie interviewed her grandfather, Locksley Siu, who was in Hong Kong during the Japanese invasion.
How old were you when World War II began?
World War II in Hong Kong was from 1941 to 1945. The Japanese army occupied the former British colony when I was 11 years old.
Where did you live, and did you have a car?
Altogether, eight people lived in [an] apartment of 500 square feet. Our apartment was in Wan Chai, on Hong Kong Island. Most people did not have cars. My dad had an old bicycle.
Did you still go to school during the Japanese occupation?
Yes, I continued to go to school for the first year. Later the school was closed because the school ran out of money. During the occupation, students were required to learn Japanese. Japanese teachers taught us Japanese.
Did you have enough food to eat every day?
No, we did not have enough food. We only ate vegetables, beans, and potatoes, but no rice at all. Meat was very costly and in short supply. When we were really hungry, we drank water. Sometimes we had to pick up grass and leaves from trees to eat.
How did the Japanese soldiers treat the Chinese people?
They were rude, and they hated Chinese people. We had to salute the Japanese soldiers when they passed by. Otherwise they would kick [us] in the back.
How was life affected by the occupation?
There was little freedom. The Japanese forbade people to go out after 11 at night. There was no traffic during the curfew. There was a lack of electricity for lighting; instead, we used candles. The only entertainment at night was the radio. The Japanese government took all Hong Kong dollars away. The Japanese government forced us to use Japanese yen. Roads such as Queen's Road and King's Road were changed to Japanese names.
Do you have any comments about the occupation?
More than 60 years after [the end of] World War II, there are still many people  who live in fear, hunger, and poverty because of wars. I hope that you will think more of those less fortunate.
I learned that there was little freedom under the occupation. I should be grateful that I live in a country where I am not forced to do things that I don't want to do. I'm going to do something for the less fortunate, just as my grandpa told me.

Eight-year-old Kristina Rauccio from Guilford, Connecticut, wears a helmet each time she rides her bike.
She makes sure she has it on correctly. ""It's important to wear a helmet because if you fall you could get really hurt or injured,"" she says.
Like Kristina, more kids than ever before are wearing bike helmets. A new study showed that 73 out of every 100 kids riding bikes had a helmet strapped to their head.
But there is flip side. The study also reported that most kids are not wearing their helmets correctly. In fact, only 4 out of 100 kids in the study wore their helmet properly. Wearing a helmet incorrectly can lead to injury.
So what is the correct way to wear a helmet?
The helmet should rest on your head in a straight position and should cover your forehead. The chin strap should fit around your ears in a V shape.
Make sure the strap is snug and fastened. If your helmet is rocking forward and backward or from side to side, it's not protecting your head properly.
Health experts say that wearing a helmet correctly when you ride a bike or do any wheel sport--for that matter-- is important. That's because helmets can protect your head and brain from injuries if you should happen to fall. The outside of the helmet is made of plastic, and the inside is lined with a stiff foam to help keep your head safe.
In addition to wearing a helmet, you should remember to protect other parts of your body. Other gear, such as kneepads and elbow pads, help protect you if you should fall or crash. Kristina makes sure she wears kneepads and elbow pads each time she rides her bike. She knows how important it is to put safety first!

It's not just adults who have expanding waistlines. Over the past 20 years, the percentage of overweight kids in the United States has doubled. About 15 percent, or 9 million kids, are overweight today. That is one out of every six kids.
Obesity is becoming a serious dietary problem in the United States.
Being overweight can lead to serious health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes, later in life. ""Obesity ... is now the most serious dietary problem affecting the health of American children,"" said nutrition expert Marion Nestle.
So why are so many people packing on the pounds? People gain weight when they take in more
than they use up through activity. A calorie is a measure of the amount of energy from food.
Exercise burns calories, but kids today aren't moving as much as kids did in the past. Studies show that kids spend more time than ever before watching television, playing video games, and sitting at computers.
Some schools have also dropped recess in favor of more classroom time. Other schools have cut back on their physical education programs.
On average, an American kid eats a fast-food meal once every three days.
At the same time, portions at many fast-food restaurants have become supersized. In 1957, the average hamburger weighed 1 ounce and had 210 calories. Today, it has grown to 6 ounces and contains 618 calories.
Many people can't resist the larger portion sizes and have included more fries, burgers, and other fast foods in their diets. On average, it is estimated that an American kid eats a fast-food meal once every three days.
Megameals can't take all the blame. Each year, kids are exposed to more than 10,000 television ads for candy, soft drinks, and other sugary snacks. Very few television ads promote healthful foods, such as fruits and vegetables.
Many schools are changing their lunch programs to include more fruits and vegetables.
To help fight the problem, the U.S. government recently issued new guidelines for healthful eating. The guidelines recommend that kids exercise for at least 60 minutes a day and eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Parents, schools, and health officials are also helping kids battle the bulge. Even some fast-food restaurants are working to make their meals more healthful.
Schools in California, Texas, and New York toughened their junk food policies. They have banned soft drinks and other junk food. Candy and other sugary snacks in school vending machines are being replaced with more healthful choices, such as nuts, bottled water, and granola bars. Schools are also reworking their lunch programs to include more fruits and vegetables.
In addition, some schools are motivating couch potatoes to get up and move. Those schools are finding new ways of encouraging physical activity in students. In Hortonville, Wisconsin, gym classes are teaching kids that exercise can be fun. Kids go in-line skating and dance to videos. One Hortonville school has even raised money for a rock-climbing wall.
Are these fun programs working? Eleven-year-old Logan Beck from Wisconsin thinks so. He says that the mix of fun things makes him ""more active.""
Ten-year-old Thailee Tran of Fort Worth, Texas, recently enjoyed a ""peanut butter"" and jelly sandwich made with a sunflower seed spread instead of peanut butter. Fourth grader Paige Murset gave a sweet potato pancake a thumbs up. ""I like it,"" she said. ""It's really sweet.""
Thailee and Paige are among 40 fourth and fifth graders at Meadowbrook Elementary School who taste-tested foods such as blueberry burgers, dried plum barbecue sauce, and asparagus salsa. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) conducted the taste test. It was part of a national school lunch event. USDA officials are encouraging schools to find creative ways to add more fruits and vegetables to lunches.
The kids' opinions from the taste test carry weight. If kids like the new healthful lunch options, the foods might be added to school cafeteria menus across the country. ""It [will] be up to the students and the schools whether they'll see [these food items] on their menus,"" said John Lund, an official with the USDA.

Later that year, Ryan proudly took his savings to WaterCan, a Canadian organization that helps provide safe drinking water to impoverished countries. To his disappointment, Ryan was told that the cost of building a well was much higher: $2,000.
or promised, to continue raising money. Word of his mission spread, and soon the media picked up his story. To Ryans astonishment, people started sending him donations. By 2000, Ryan, then 9, had raised enough money to build his first well. With help from Canadian Physicians for Aid and Relief, Ryan chose Jimmys village as the site for the well.
Ryans well changed the lives of the people in Agweo and especially affected Jimmys life. Thats when the two boys became pen pals. They became friends when Ryan traveled to Uganda in 2000 to help complete the well.
In 2003, Ryans family arranged to bring Jimmy to their home in Canada. ""We used to live as friends,"" Jimmy, now 17, says, ""but now we live as brothers.""
The two teenagers hope their book will raise awareness about unsafe drinking water and prompt people to take action to help. ""The situation is difficult, but you have to start somewhere,"" Ryan says. ""We need to work harder to make the world a better place.""

More than two-thirds of Earths surface is covered in water, so you might think there is enough to go around. You may be surprised to learn that only a scarce, or limited, amount of the water is drinkable. Salty seawater makes up about 97 percent of the worlds water. Another 2 percent is frozen at the North and South poles.
More than 1 billion people around the world dont have access to safe drinking water, according to the United Nations. Why isnt all the freshwater available to people safe for drinking? Chemicals from factories, fertilizers from farms, and untreated sewage pollute the water supply. ""One of our goals is to educate people about the importance of clean water,"" says Ryan.

A new study shows that kids need to lessen their backpack loads.
Chances are youre carrying a heavy burdentoo much weight in your backpack. A new study warns that American kids need to reduce their backpack loads and spread out the weight.
Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, have shown that too much pressure from an overloaded backpack may cause shoulder pain. In addition, an uneven backpack load may lead to pain in the lower back.
Five girls and five boysall 13 years oldparticipated in the study. The kids wore identical backpacks, fitted on the shoulder straps with measuring devices called pressure sensors.
The children first carried 10 percent of their body weight, then 20 percent, and finally 30 percent. With each increase, the kids reported that their pain worsened.
According to previous studies, children typically carry loads that are about 22 percent of their body weight. The new study confirmed that 22 percent of body weight is too high.
Each year an estimated 7,500 emergency room visits result from injuries related to backpacks and book bags, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The researchers hope their information will encourage backpack makers to design wide, well-padded shoulder straps to help spread the weight.
The researchers also hope the results of their study will encourage kids to
or lessen, their loads. ""The weight in the backpack should be minimized as much as possible,"" Brandon Macias, one of the studys lead authors, told
Here are some tips to help you wear your backpack safely.
Dont carry more than 15 percent of your body weight. This means that if you weigh 100 pounds, you should not wear a backpack heavier than 15 pounds.
Choose a backpack that is the right size for your body.
Pack only what you need, and load heaviest items closest to your back.
Always wear both shoulder straps, and fasten the waist strap to balance the backpacks weight evenly.
Adjust shoulder and waist straps so the backpack fits snugly to your body and the weight is evenly balanced.
If your backpack is too heavy, consider using a book bag on wheels, if your school allows it.

Everyone loves pizza, but should it be used as a reward for reading?
Should kids be reading for pizza? A nationwide reading program is drawing criticism for putting pizza front and center. Since 1985, the restaurant chain Pizza Hut has been running the Book It program, which rewards students for reading with personal pan pizzas. Now some people are taking a slice at Book It. They say the program promotes poor eating habits and gives Pizza Hut free advertising in public schools.
""It's clear that Pizza Hut's Book It has no place in public schools. ... It promotes junk food,"" says Susan Linn, a cofounder of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. The group has called for schools to stop participating in the Book It program.
Nearly 22 million children in 50,000 U.S. schools take part in Book It. Since the program began, more than 200 million pizzas have been given away. Each year, from October 1 through March 31, students read books to meet monthly reading goals set by teachers. When students meet their goal for the month, they get a certificate for a personal pan pizza.

But critics say schools can teach students to enjoy reading without the help of a fast-food company.

Pandas favorite food is bamboo, but they have trouble finding enough of it to eat. Almost all of the bamboo in their habitat, or home, has died off. The bamboo has died in part because people have built cities where pandas live.
People created the panda centers to help keep the giant pandas safe. One of the most famous centers is the Wolong Nature Reserve. It is in southwest China. More than 100 giant pandas have been born there since it opened in 1980.
The goal is for the young pandas to be able to live safely in the wild one day. Until then, some of the animals will continue to live in captivity. Scientists in China hope to raise more giant pandas within the next few years.
The future of captive giant pandas is [very] bright, Bexell says.

Kids collect pennies and take part in class projects to remember Lincoln.
Lincoln was born 200 years ago, on Feb. 12, 1809. This month marks the

The students in Idaho raised money to help
, or move, a statue of Lincoln to a park near the Idaho Capitol. The project is one of hundreds of events across the country being held to celebrate Lincolns birthday.
In Washington, D.C., officials will honor Lincoln with a ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial. That is a special statue of the president. In other states, people will attend speeches and plays about the leader.
There are events being planned in all 50 states, David Early told
. He is a spokesperson for the group that has been planning the celebrations. [Lincoln] believed everyone should be treated the same.
Lincoln served as president during the Civil War (18611865). During that war, Southern states tried to break away from the country. They fought for their right to own slaves. Northern states were against owning slaves. Lincoln was also against slavery. In 1863, he signed the Emancipation Proclamation. It helped free most U.S. slaves.
Thats why third grader Morgan Squires, of Gooding, Idaho, was happy to collect pennies for the president.
[Lincoln] was a great leader, Morgan told

Abraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin in Kentucky. He moved to Illinois when he was a young man. There, he worked as a shop owner and a lawyer. Lincoln also served as a lawmaker for Illinois and the country.
In 1842, Lincoln married Mary Todd. Together they had four sons.
Lincoln became the 16th U.S. president in 1861. The Civil War started a few weeks later. Lincoln won reelection in 1864.
The war was coming to an end in April 1865. Lincoln was shot on April 14, while watching a play in Washington, D.C. He died the next day. Lincoln is buried in Springfield, Ill.

Experts have also warned that tourists visiting Machu Picchu are damaging the Inca ruins. In recent years, tourists have started small fires and have littered the Machu Picchu area.
The government of Peru, however, disagreed with the warnings. ""Machu Picchu won't collapse,"" said one government official.
The official said that Machu Picchu has lasted for more than 500 years. He added that he doesn't see why landslides or tourism would destroy the city anytime soon.
The Incas built Machu Picchu sometime around 1460. The blocks used to build Machu Picchu were wedged so tightly together that a razor blade cannot fit between the stones. The ruins include about 200 stone buildings, including palaces, temples, and small homes.
The Incas were a South American Indian people who ruled one of the largest and richest empires on the continent. By 1532, the Incas ruled an area that stretched for 2,500 miles along the west coast of South America. The Inca empire included parts of what are now Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.
The Incas were skilled in farming and in building stone structures and roads. They were also skilled craftspeople, making many fine gold and silver ornaments. They studied the stars and knew how to predict the seasons of the year.
Spanish soldiers, led by Francisco Pizarro, attacked and conquered the Incas in 1532.

Koalas are pictured everywhere in Australiafrom boxes of chocolate to sports team jerseys. Yet the animals live only in small areas along the east coast.
The koalas were once widespread on the east coast. However, farmers cut down many of the forests where koalas lived. Hunters also killed the animals for their fur.
I recently joined Bill Ellis and his team in a forest on St. Bees Island. Ellis is a scientist who studies koalas. He and other scientists hope that studying koalas on the island will teach them how to protect koalas elsewhere in Australia.
We spotted a koala named Abby in a blue gum tree. The blue gum is a
or type, of eucalyptus (yoo-kuh-LIP-tuhss) tree. The leaves of eucalyptus trees are the main food source for koalas.
Whenever we find a koala, we collect information about the trees in the area. We measure how tall and how fat the trees are. Then we put tags on their trunks, so we know theyve been recorded.
We also capture and tag the koalas. Before releasing them back into the wild, we give them a health checkup.
Ellis wonders if the St. Bees koalas are headed for hard times. The island is filled with wild goats, which may be eating small blue gum trees. Ellis hopes more research will help him understand how to protect the blue gumsand the koalas that depend on them.
 Volunteers shake a tree branch on which a koala named Yellow sits. Yellow falls onto a plastic sheet and is placed into a sack.
 Volunteers hold Yellow in the sack. They adjust a radio collar around the koalas neck.

Batman, have you heard? A new kind of ""batmobile"" is in the works!
Scientists in Rhode Island are studying how bats fly. The United States Air Force is funding the $6 million project. It hopes the mammals will offer clues about how to design better-flying aircraft. Mammals are warm-blooded animals that feed their babies milk.
Bats can fly in ways that birds and airplanes can't. The animals' wings have more than 24 joints. The joints allow them to
, or control, their wings while flying. Bats can stretch and bend their wings. This helps them fly higher and faster. Scientist Sharon Swartz says bats' control of their wings is similar to humans' control of their hands. ""Bats are the only flying animals whose wings are really just like human hands,"" she told
Swartz and the other scientists will study about 20 species of bats over the next five years. They are using real bats, high-tech cameras, and wind tunnels in their research. The team hopes to find out why bats can turn sharply without falling. If airplanes could do that, they could
, or move, in tight spaces. They could also fly in more dangerous conditions. The Air Force also hopes to learn how weight affects bat flight. Bats can carry up to 50 percent of their weight while flying. If aircraft designers knew bats' secrets, they could design airplanes that could carry more weight.
Swartz says there is still a lot more to learn about the animals. ""We expect to be studying bats long into the future,"" she says.
It's going to be a hair-raising Halloween for Little Rock Zoo in Arkansas. Three vampire bats were born there recently. Vampire bats are the only type of bat that drinks the blood of other animals. They do this to survive, but don't worry! Vampire bats are usually friendly with people. Of the more than 1,000 bat species, only three are vampire bats. They live mostly in Mexico and Central and South America.

The orbiter will join two robots, called rovers, that are already there. They have been rolling around on the surface of the planet for more than two years. They are searching for signs of water.
Mars is cold and dry. Scientists think the planet was once a warmer and wetter place. Evidence of water can mean that life once existed on Mars.
The orbiter will look for signs of water. It is expected to spend at least two years studying Mars. It will scan Mars with the largest telescope camera ever sent to a planet. The orbiter's radar will look for water beneath the planet's surface. It will also search for landing spots to prepare for future human missions to Mars.
This is an artists depiction of the spacecraft as it nears Mars.
""This orbiter is going to look much farther and with more detail than what the rovers could do,"" NASA's Ramon DePaula told
. ""We are going to bring back more data than all other missions to Mars combined.""
Mars is called the Red Planet because its soil is a reddish color.
Like Earth, Mars has mountains and valleys.

Even in the summer, the temperature on the planet's surface is below zero.

At the end of the Ice Age, some animals survived. Other animals, like the woolly rhino, became extinct. The new fossils are clues to the past. They will help scientists learn more about the Ice Age.

New roller coasters are getting bigger, faster, and scarier. Millions of kids and adults take these thrill rides each year. Some experts worry that the rides' sudden twists and turns are unsafe.
High-speed coasters whip riders' heads back and forth. One report blamed coasters for 13 brain injuries from 1995 to 2000. Another report says some people have nearly died from coaster-related brain injuries.
Recently, two scientists set out to learn if coasters really do cause brain injuries. They studied the effects of riding three of the fastest coasters in the United States. The scientists say the coasters' twists and turns are not fast enough to cause brain injuries.
""People take more than 1 billion rides on roller coasters each year. The reports on brain injury are few and not proven,"" said Douglas Smith. He is one of the scientists who did the new study.
Some experts do not think the new study proves coasters are safe-especially for kids. They say the scientists only studied how coasters affect adults, not kids. They want a new study.
Edward Markey is a government official. Recently, he asked a group of experts to include children in their next study about roller coaster safety. Results from that study will be reported next year. Roller coasters have to be studied to make sure that ""riders of all ages"" are safe, Markey said.

You don't have to travel to Asia to see sloth bears slurp up insects. You can see the shaggy-coated creatures at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The zoo opened a new exhibit, called the Asia Trail, in October.
Sloth bears and six other species, or types, of animals from Asia have new homes at the National Zoo. Those animals face several threats in the wild.
Before the Asia Trail opened, the animals lived in tight spaces. Now they have twice the room. The changes are part of a 10-year plan to update the zoo.
""This is a giant leap forward for the National Zoo,"" says its director, John Berry. ""Our goal is to be the world's finest zoo by 2016.""
Giant panda cub Tai Shan (tie-SHAHN) and his parents are the stars of the show. They help draw huge crowds to the zoo. Three million people are expected to visit this year.
The giant pandas' new home includes more trees for climbing. Pandas like water, so their area has a waterfall and pools. Fog machines help make the exhibit more like their habitat, or natural home, in China.
Visitors now have closer views of the giant pandas and other animals. ""You can see, hear, touch, and even smell the zoo's science,"" says Susan Ades, head of the new design.
The National Zoo is home to 2,000 animals. Along with fishing cats, clouded leopards, sloth bears, and Japanese giant salamanders, the creatures here live on the Asia Trail.
Giant panda cub Tai Shan relaxes while chewing bamboo at the zoo.
Red pandas use their bushy tails to cover their bodies when they're cold.
Is it important for zoos to create homes that are like the animals' natural habitats? Why or why not?

To migrate is to move from one area to another when the seasons change.
Whooping cranes are endangered. There are only about 380 of them in the United States. In the fall, whooping cranes in the North are supposed to migrate south for the winter. However, many whooping cranes dont know how. With so few birds, many baby whooping cranes dont have any adults to teach them how to migrate, explains Joe Duff. He is an Operation Migration pilot.
Thats where the trikes and costumes come in. Each October, pilots in Wisconsin dress up like whooping cranes and take to the skies. The young birds follow them because they think the trikes are whooping cranes leading the flock.
It takes about three months for the birds to reach the Southwith plenty of stops along the way. The pilots lead the whooping cranes to special

For Duff, the best part of the trip is bringing whooping cranes to the refuges. Its [a nice feeling] because you know the birds are going to make it, he told
Last fall, pilots in Wisconsin led a flock of whooping cranes across seven states. In Florida, the flock was divided and taken to two refuges. Study the map for a birds-eye view of their trip.

The last owner of the nickel was a man from North Carolina. When he died in 1962, he left the rare coin to his family. However, they thought it was a fake and kept it in a closet.

Scientists dont expect to find much else inside the burial chamber. That is because robbers most likely found the pyramid long ago. They probably took any gold or other treasures that were inside.
Still, finding the pyramid is important, scientists say. To find a new pyramid is always exciting, Hawass explains. And this one is magical. It belonged to a queen.
People have lived in Egypt for about 5,000 years. Early Egyptians invented forms of math and writing. They had the first national government.
The Sahara is the worlds largest desert. It covers most of the country. The Nile River runs through Egypt. It is the longest river in the world.
The Great Pyramid is the worlds largest pyramid. The Great Sphinx is located nearby. It has the body of a lion and the head of a human.

Move over, Spider-Man! Now you don't have to be a comic-book superhero to creep up walls. Scientists have recently invented a powerful tape. Someday, people may be able to use it to climb walls.
To make the tape, scientists studied gecko lizards. The little lizards are great climbers. They can cling to smooth walls and hang from glass ceilings.
What is the secret to the gecko's power? A gecko has millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of its feet. The hairs create a natural force between the gecko's feet and the wall.
Scientists modeled the new tape after the feet of geckos. The tape is covered with billions of tiny plastic hairs. ""It's like Velcro,"" said one scientist.
It will be a long time before the sticky tape is ready for people to use. One scientist believes it may be ready in five years. Until then, the little lizards are still the climbing champions!

A celebration is under way for Ben Franklin's 300th birthday. Way is he considered one of the greatest Americans of all time?
Put on your party hat! January 17 is the 300th anniversary of Ben Franklins birth. People across the United States will celebrate the ways this great American helped our country. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, events are taking place all year.
The main event is an exhibit called
Benjamin Franklin: In Search of a Better World.
It began in Philadelphia and will travel to four other states during the yearMissouri,Texas, Colorado, and Georgia.
""In his 300th year, we want people to understand why Ben Franklin is still so important,"" spokesperson Nicola Twilley told
""We want to bring him and his
to life."" A legacy is something passed on to future generations.
Why is Philadelphia making such a big fuss about Franklins birthday? In 1723,when he was 17 years old, Franklin made his home there. He worked to make life in that city better. In Philadelphia, he helped set up the countrys first hospital, public library, and volunteer fire department.
During the 1700s, Philadelphia was the center of American government. When Franklin was young, America was made up of 13 colonies ruled by England. Franklin helped America gain independence. He also helped write the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.
""Hes very inspirational,"" says Twilley. ""He came from a poor background. He had only two years of school. He made himself into one of the greatest Americans of all time.""
If you could interview Ben Franklin, what would you ask him? Why?
Ben Franklin only attended school from the ages of 8 to 10. But his love of learning lasted a lifetime.
Even at a young age, Franklin was a scientist and an inventor. At the age of 10, Franklin invented wooden swim fins to help him swim faster.
When he was 12 years old, Franklin worked in his brothers printing shop. Later, he opened his own shop.

Real Wrestling. Real Heroes. That is the
, or slogan, of this year's Olympic wrestling team. The wrestlers use this motto because they are proud to wrestle for their country. They want people to know that the competition of Olympic wrestling is tougher than the professional wrestling of Mankind and Shane McMahon.

. In Greco-Roman, wrestlers can use only their arms and upper body. In freestyle, wrestlers can use their legs to trip their opponent.
Unlike pro wrestling, the two challengers wrestle on a padded mat, not in a ring with ropes. They use certain moves to force their opponent to the mat.
Greg Strobel, a U.S. Olympic wrestling coach, says pro wrestling is meant to entertain. He says it is not a sport, like Olympic wrestling.
Chris Benoit and the Undertaker are two famous pro wrestlers. Many fans enjoy pro wrestling because of the action, fireworks, and costumes. However, pro wrestling is more of a show than a real contest, said Ron Buck, a sports reporter. According to many critics, the moves and punches in a professional match are fake.
U.S. Olympic wrestlers do not get paid to compete in the Olympics. For many team members, the chance to win a gold medal is a dream come true. Though pro wrestlers get more fame and attention, Olympic wrestlers consider representing the United States an honor. That is why, to many fans, these wrestlers are real heroes.
Olympic wrestlers compete only against others who are in the same weight class. Why is that an important rule?

Allergies [are] increasing over time, says Andy Nish. He is a doctor from Georgia.
Allergens in the air arent the only problem. Kids food allergies have risen too. Between 1997 and 2007, the number of kids with food allergies jumped 18 percent. Eating milk products and eggs can give some children rashes. Those foods can even cause some people to have trouble breathing.
Whats behind allergies spread? Some scientists think our
dont have enough to do. Immune systems help our bodies fight germs. But kids today come in contact with fewer germs than their grandparents did. Thats in part because more medicine is available. Experts say that when our immune systems have fewer germs to fight, they can get confused. They attack other things, such as milk, instead.
Other scientists say hotter temperatures are to blame. They say the weather is warmer for longer periods now, so plants bloom longer. Plants release pollen (left), which is a common allergen.
Doctors do not know for sure whats making allergies increase. But they do know how to treat them with medicine. There is very good treatment for allergies, Nish says. No one should suffer with symptoms.
Dust and other allergens that float into your nose are in for a blasta cough or a sneeze, that is! Both are natural

Sneezes start at the back of your throat. Each quick burst can force out up to 40,000 droplets of saliva. The tiny droplets travel at up to 300 miles per hour.
Coughs come out of your lungs. Each blast can push out 3,000 saliva droplets as fast as 50 miles per hour. Enough air comes out to almost fill a 2-liter bottle.

It is not uncommon for a large pod, or group, of pilot whales to get stranded. They are highly social animals that stay close together. ""The value of sticking close together at times brings the risk of beaching. When one whale beaches, the other whales may follow,"" said scientist Michael Moore.
Sadly, 120 whales died on the beach. But volunteers were able to rescue 39 of the whales. The rescuers poured cool water on the whales to protect them from the heat. They helped push the huge mammals back into the water. Then small boats led the pilot whales back to sea.

So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Keep reading to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's As Easy As One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart (below).
So what's the result? Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?
The new motto of Polling Place is

If the animals at a Baghdad zoo could talk, they would have a lot to say. When a war began in March, their home turned into a battlefield.
""Before the war, there were 650 animals. Afterward, just 13 remained,"" said the zoo director. Many of the animals died. Others escaped or were stolen.
The animals that survived were starving and sick. Many of their cages were damaged. When wildlife groups found out, they offered a helping hand. The groups donated money, medicine, and food. Those efforts helped return the animals to good health.
Today, the zoo is home to about 80 animals. They include lions, monkeys, and bears. U.S. soldiers now guard the zoo to protect the animals.
Location: Iraq is a country located in Asia. It is in an area known as the Middle East.
Language: Most of the people in Iraq are Arabs. They speak Arabic, the official language of Iraq.
In July, the zoo reopened its doors to visitors. To the people of Iraq, the zoo is a welcome sight. ""I've been mostly inside the house for the last few months,"" said an 11-year-old girl in Iraq. ""I missed things like this.""
Many people think the zoo brings hope for Iraq. ""There's a war going on around us, but here, everything is going well,"" said one rescue worker. ""It's an island of peace in a war zone.""

Scientists believe the horseshoe crab population around the world is falling--for many reasons. Fishermen catch horseshoe crabs and use them as bait.

Everyone knows helping others is a good thing - maybe even chimps! Scientists recently studied from Uganda. That is a country in Africa. The scientists did tests that show that chimps often help people or other chimps, even if they get nothing in return.
In one test, a person dropped a stick near a group of chimps. In most cases, a chimp handed the stick back to the person. Chimps care about other chimps too. In another test, a chimp handed over the stick when another chimp dropped it. The animals did not receive food or praise for their actions in either test.

Fifty years ago, the courageous act of Rosa Parks changed history.
For years, Rosa Parks stood up to unfair laws against black people. Then on December 1, 1955, she changed the history of the United States forever. Rosa Parks was riding a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and was told to give up her seat to a white passenger. When she refused, she was arrested and taken to jail.
At that time, states in the South were
by law. The law kept black people from having the same rights as white people. Black people were forced to sit in the back of city buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, water fountains, and other public facilities.
After Parks was arrested, thousands of people refused to ride the city buses in Montgomery. The
was led by Martin Luther King Jr. and lasted for more than a year. It was a success. In 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the bus segregation law was illegal.
December 1 marks the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest for not giving up her seat. On that day, people across the United States will honor this important time in history.
Special events will take place in Montgomery, where the equal rights movement began. As part of the day's events, hundreds of kids will march to remember the bus boycott.
""Never again should we foster hate or distrust based on one's skin color,"" says event spokesperson Kenneth Mullinax. The children will march ""as a pledge to treat everyone with equal love,"" he told
""Rosa Parks's not giving up her seat on the bus shows how important it is to stand up for what we believe in,"" says Mullinax.
Today, people can step aboard the bus that Rosa Parks made famous. It is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan. The bus has been restored to look as it did in 1955.

Astronauts are aiming for the moon again. This time, though, they plan to stay there. Astronauts hope to live and work on the moon by 2020, according to NASA. The U.S. space agency recently announced plans to build a base there.
At first, four-person crews will stay for a week. By 2024, they will be able to live there for as long as six months.
The base will most likely be built near the moon's north or south pole. The poles get the most sunlight. At those locations, the moon base would be able to use solar power. That is energy from the sun that can be used to create electricity.

When people think of lightning, they generally picture it as a single bolt. However, scientists have recently reported that one flash of lightning often strikes in more than one place. It is common for lightning to fork, or split, and strike in two or more places, scientists say.
Lightning is a flow of electricity. A flash of lightning can heat the air around it to up to 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun!
When lightning heats the air around it, the air expands and makes a loud crashing sound-thunder. If you hear thunder, you are within striking distance of lightning. ""Anytime you hear thunder, you should immediately move to a safe area,"" said scientist E. Philip Krider. Safe places include a school, house, or car.
While it is unusual for people to be struck by lightning, it does happen. According to the National Weather Service, lightning causes nearly 300 injuries and 100 deaths in the United States each year.

! Fourteen-year-old Steven Shin from Cleveland, Ohio, hits a tennis ball over the net. He has been playing in tennis tournaments since the age of 8. This July, he plans to compete for a medal in the International Children's Games, also known as the Children's Olympics.
""Whenever you watch the real Olympics on TV, you root for your country,"" Steven told
. ""I have a firsthand opportunity to represent the U.S.A. Instead of watching the games, I actually get to be the athlete this time.""
About 1,500 athletes, ages 12 to 15, from nearly 50 countries will take part in the competition. This year, it is being
by, or held in, Coventry, England. From July 6 through 11, athletes will compete in tennis, soccer, track and field, swimming, and table tennis.
The 100-meter race is one event at the Children's Games
During their stay, the young athletes will live in an Olympic-style athletes' village. There, they will have the chance to learn more about one another and make new friends. ""There will be differences, but I'm sure there are going to be a lot of things that we have in common,"" said Steven.
The International Children's Games were first held in 1968 as a way to promote, or help develop, peace and friendship through sports. Since that time, more than 27,000 kids from around the world have participated.
The International Children's Games are modeled after the Olympics. The Olympic Games have a long history:
The first Olympic Games were held more than 2,700 years ago in Olympia, Greece. The Games included just one eventa 200-yard race.
The first modern Olympics took place in Athens, Greece, in 1896. More than 300 athletes from 13 countries competed in nine sports.
The Winter Olympics began in 1924. Like the Summer Olympics, they are held every four years.
If you were going to the Children's Games, what would you want athletes from other countries to know about the United States?

 After a seed takes in water, a root pushes out from the seed. The root collects water and minerals from the soil.
 A stem and leaves come out of the seed and grow upward. The stem brings water and minerals to the leaves.
 The leaves use sunlight to make food for the plant. That process is called

This pterosaur was about 6 feet long with a wingspan of 20 to 25 feet.
This is the largest pterosaur ever found. Its wingspan was about 40 feet. It also had a long, thin beak.

Bright-colored birds fly through the air. Monkeys leap from tree to tree. Jaguars creep on the ground below. Those are just a few of the thousands of animals that live in the Amazon rain forest.
The Amazon in South America is the largest
in the world. A tropical rain forest is a thick forest in a warm region with heavy rainfall.
People are destroying the Amazon. Each year, farmers and loggers cut down rain forest trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Scientists have recently discovered that the Amazon is shrinking twice as quickly as they once thought.
The Amazon rain forest is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant
or variety. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines people need come from the Amazon.
The Amazon rain forest also helps recycle Earths air. The trees give off oxygen for people to breathe. Trees also clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans.
Stopping people from destroying the rain forest is not an easy task. ""Almost 2 million people make the forest their home,"" scientist Jim Bowyer told
""All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive. Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest.""

Scientists hope the missions will answer questions about Mars. The spacecraft will take pictures of the planet. Some spacecraft will even collect samples of the soil on Mars to study. NASA first sent spacecraft to Mars in the 1960s. Since then, several spacecraft have landed on Mars. One of the most exciting landings happened in 1997, when
landed on Mars. Millions of people on Earth watched as it's tiny rover, Sojourner, wandered over the planet's surface.
Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is often called the Red Planet because it looks red from Earth. Mars looks red because its surface has lots of iron. The iron has rusted and turned a reddish-brown color. Sometimes, winds on Mars whip the reddish dust into the sky, turning the sky pink.
A dust storm whips across the Martian surface. Dust storms often form in the Martian spring. A dust storm forms when high winds pick up sand and blow it across the surface. Large dust storms can last for months and blanket the entire planet with the red dust.
Two dry riverbeds cut across the surface of Mars. Each riverbed is more than a half-mile deep. Scientists say the riverbeds formed when water suddenly gushed to the surface from inside Mars. The riverbeds might have formed billions of years ago, scientists say. Hundreds of dry riverbeds crisscross the Red Planet.
Valles Marineris is the largest canyon on Mars. It is nearly 2,500 miles long and about 4 miles deep. On Earth, it would almost span the distance between New York City and Los Angeles. (The Grand Canyon on Earth is only 227 miles long and 1 mile deep!) The volcanoes on Mars are larger than volcanoes on Earth. The largest Martian volcano, is about the same size as Arizona at its base.
Mars has ice caps at its north and south poles, much like Earth has. But Martian ice caps are made of water ice and frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. The polar ice caps grow in the winter and shrink in the summer. This photo shows the planet's south pole in summer.
One day on Mars is 24 hours long; one year is 687 days long.
Temperatures on Mars range from -220 degrees Fahrenheit (F) to 68 degrees F.

Female penguins lay eggs on land. Both parents raise the chicks. The parents take turns finding food in the ocean. They throw up food and feed that to their chicks.
That is the part of Earth below the
The equator is the make-believe line around the center of Earth. Most penguins live in Antarctica, where it is cold. Some live near the equator. It is warm there.

Eating in space can be hard because everything floats. Juice poured into a cup will float away and crumbs can get into air vents. So astronauts drink and eat in special ways. Astronauts drink with special straws and pouches. The pouch closes around the straw so juice doesn't leak out. Astronauts eat foods that don't make crumbs, like tortillas instead of bread.

Why are students learning how to grow gardens? Teachers want kids to learn healthy eating habits. Healthy foods give the body the energy it needs to grow and heal.
Many kids are now trying new foods and learning they like them. Lisa Samuelson is the parent volunteer in charge of the program. She says a lot of students have told her, I like salad. I didnt think I liked salad! Then those students have gone home and asked their parents to buy vegetables that they have tried at school.

In a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear.
Scientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help.
Scientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled.
Scientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest.
The African elephant is the largest animal that lives on land. African elephants can weigh up to 16,000 pounds.
An elephant's trunk contains more than 40,000 muscles. The trunk is used to smell, breathe, touch, eat, drink, and bathe.

Antarctica is a big icy continent. It is around the South Pole. The South Pole is found at the bottom of Earth.
Penguins are birds. Emperor and Adelie penguins live in Antarctica. The penguins stay warm because they have feathers that are very small and close together. The feathers have oil on them. Cold water can't get through the feathers to touch the penguins' skin. Each year, penguins molt, or lose, their feathers and grow new ones.
Penguins can waddle faster than humans can walk.
Penguins like to line up and dive into the water again and again.
Penguins sometimes toboggan, or slide, on their bellies.
Penguins surf waves to get back to shore.
Weddell seals live in Antarctica. Weddell seals swim in the cold ocean water to catch fish and other ocean animals to eat. These seals don't chew their food. They swallow the food in big pieces.
Weddell seals stay warm because they have a layer of blubber, or fat. They also have a coat of thick fur. The fur keeps water from touching the seal's skin.

Kids in some countries must deal with problems like those. But a special worldwide organization is trying to help them.
UNICEF helps children around the world. One way it helps is by providing schools and supplies. Three of the countries where UNICEF helps with education are Colombia, in South America, Rwanda (ruh-WAHN-duh), in Africa, and Thailand (TIGH-land), in Southeast Asia.
Those countries are probably far from where you live. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to go to school in another country?
In Colombia, the government requires kids to go to school for at least five years. Some people are poor and must work hard to survive. Some children must quit school to help their parents earn money.
With UNICEF's help, Colombia's government is creating a special school for those children. The students learn at their own pace and attend when they can. They have a small library and a garden where they grow vegetables.
One or two teachers must teach all the students, from grades 1 through 5. Students of the same age work together in small groups, helping one another learn.
Children in Rwanda must go to school from ages 7 to 15. But there is not enough space in some schools in Rwanda to fit all the students. Some students cannot afford to buy the uniforms and notebooks they must have to go to school.
To help solve those problems, UNICEF has created a special program called Schools-in-a-Box. Each box contains school supplies, workbooks, and learning games. When teachers use the Schools-in-a-Box, kids can be taught wherever they are.
Children in Thailand must go to school for six years. Though school is free, some families cannot afford to buy the uniforms children must wear to school.
Some classrooms in Thailand have as many as 50 kids and only one teacher! Often, children of all ages are in the same grade. The children must share the few books and school supplies that are in the school.
But UNICEF is working to help these people. The organization has built Village Education Centers in parts of Thailand. At night, adults gather there and take classes. During the day, the buildings are schools for children.
UNICEF is an organization that works to help children all over the world. UNICEF tries to provide health care, nutritious food, clean water, and an education for all children. The organization raises money and talks to world governments about helping children.

February 15 is Presidents Day. Do you know why we honor George Washington and Abraham Lincoln on that day? Both presidents were born in February.
George Washington was our first president. He was born in Virginia on February 22, 1732. He was president from 1789 to 1797.
 When he was a boy, his favorite subject was math.
      1+1 = 2 3x7 = 21
 He started writing in a journal at age 16. He had good handwriting. He wrote about what he did each day.
 He was a soldier and a farmer before he became president.
 He had many dogs and horses. He also had a parrot named Polly.
 At the age of 22, he started to lose his teeth. When he became president, he had only one tooth left. He wore false teeth.
 He never lived in the White House. Why? It had not been built yet. Work on the White House was started in 1792. It was finished in 1800.
Abraham Lincoln was our 16th president. He was born in Kentucky on February 12, 1809. He was president from 1861 to 1865.
 When he was a boy, he loved to read. One of his favorite books was about the life of George Washington.
 He was known for being honest. People often called him Honest Abe.
 He was a shop owner and a lawyer before he became president.
 He had goats, dogs, and a cat named Tabby. Tabby was the first cat to live in the White House.
 He was the tallest president. He was 6 feet 4 inches tall.
 He was the first president to have a beard. He grew it after getting a letter from a little girl named Grace. She told him that his face was thin. She said he would look better with a beard.
What do Washington and Lincoln have in common?

Goats are doing their part to help prevent forest fires. Goats eat tall grass, weeds, and small branches. Those plants often spread forest fires in places such as California and Florida.
Many states are using goats to eat plants on mountains and in fields close to people's houses. By eating plants in those areas, the goats leave a clear patch of land. That way, if a fire starts in the forest, it will not be able to spread to where people live.
In 1999, there were about 94,000 forest fires in the United States.
Forest fires in 1999 burned nearly 9,500 square miles of land in the United States.
Most forest fires are started by people. People are sometimes careless with cigarettes and campfires.
Lightning is another cause of forest fires. When the forest is very dry and lightning strikes it, a fire can start.

A program called Ice Hockey in Harlem teachers kids how to play hockey. They learn the rules of the game and about hockey equipment. Then, one night per week, kids practice hockey at a local skating rink.
To play hockey, the kids have to go to tutoring sessions. The sessions use hockey information as learning tools. For example, the kids practice math skills by comparing hockey teams' scores. If the kids keep their grades up, they can play on hockey teams. Some travel across the country playing other teams.

In July, wildlife workers rescued African penguins from Robben Island. Robben Island is in the Atlantic Ocean near South Africa. Workers took 14,500 oily penguins to a wildlife center. Each penguin was carefully washed. It took two people about an hour to clean the oil from each of the birds!
Workers took the cleaned penguins to the east coast of South Africa. The penguins were set free in the ocean and swam back to Robben Island. While the penguins were swimming home, workers had time to clean up the spilled oil.
Workers put a special device on a few penguins. The device sent information to a computer. The computer showed exactly where each penguin was on its 560-mile swim home.
Did you know that there are 17 kinds of penguins? Here are just a few:
The emperor penguin is the largest of all penguins. It stands about 4 feet tall and can weigh up to 100 pounds.
The little blue penguin is the smallest penguin. It is only a foot high and weighs less than 2 pounds.

A mother robin lays her eggs in the nest. Three to five eggs are laid at one time. The robin eggs are light blue. The mother sits on top of the eggs to keep them safe and warm. Baby robins hatch in about two weeks.
When a robin hatches from its egg, it has no feathers and it is blind. Its parents need to take care of it. The parents bring worms, spiders, and insects for the babies to eat. Baby robins grow up fast. After about two weeks, baby robins will leave their nest.

Playing outside gives you a chance to breathe fresh air, but it also exposes you to harmful sun rays. Harmful sun rays can cause sunburns. You can get a sunburn even if you are outside for a short amount of time. So when you are in the sun, always wear sunscreen. Use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher, and be sure to rub it evenly into your skin. You should also wear a hat and try to play in the shade.
Whether you ride a bike, ride a scooter, or use in-line skates, be wheel safe. The most serious way kids get hurt while on wheels is by hitting their heads. So always wear a helmet when you are playing on wheels. When you ride scooters and use in-line skates, always wear wrist guards, kneepads, and elbow pads.
What's the Right Way to Wear a Helmet?
A helmet should be straight on the head, just above the eyebrows.
The chin strap should be snug but not too tight.
The rear straps go behind the ears; the front straps should run up and down.
One way to beat the summer heat is by swimming in a cool pool. To stay safe when you swim, you need to follow water-safety rules. Be water safe by swimming only when a grown-up is nearby. You should always swim with a buddy.

Most bats eat insects. Bats have a special way of finding food. They make high-pitched sounds. The sounds bounce off insects and return to the bats. That lets the bats know where to find the insects.
Pit vipers are snakes. They sense the heat of other animals. Their heat sensors are inside holes on their faces. The holes are called pits. They help the snakes find their prey in the dark. Pit vipers eat frogs and other small animals.

Different types of weather can happen in March. What is the weather like near you?
Sunlight comes from the sun. The sun is a huge, hot ball of gas. It sends warmth to Earth. How warm or cold it is outside depends on how much sunlight reaches Earth.
Clouds are groups of tiny drops of water floating in the air. Clouds can be puffy and white or flat and dark. They can block the sun from shining in places.
Snow is made up of tiny pieces of ice that fall to Earth. The pieces of ice stick together to form snowflakes. Each snowflake has a different shape.
Rain is made up of drops of water that fall to Earth from clouds. Rain gives freshwater to people and animals for drinking. Plants also need water to grow.
Wind is air moving on Earth's surface. Wind carries things such as plant seeds from one place to another. It can also carry a kite high into the sky!

202,"Hi! My Name is Pam Pollster. This is my pet parakeet, Polly. We live in Polling Place. Polly is a smart bird. In fact, she's so smart, she can count very high numbers. This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
. That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's as Easy as One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.
Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

The orange-and-black butterflies are on the move.
It's time for monarch butterflies to take a trip. Each fall, they
means ""to move from one place to another."" Many monarchs leave Canada and the United States to travel to Mexico. Others go to California, Texas, or Florida.
In the winter, monarchs stay close together on trees. That helps protect them from wind, rain, and cold. The trees look bright orange because they are covered with millions of butterflies!
In the spring, monarchs migrate north. On the way, female monarchs stop to lay eggs. A baby caterpillar hatches from each egg. Many of the new monarch butterflies finish the trip north.
Second graders at Arlington Elementary School in Indiana are ready for a monarch visit. That school has a garden full of milkweed plants. Monarchs can rest, eat, and lay eggs there.

A predator is an animal that eats another animal for food. The porcupine fish puffs up and raises its spines when danger is near.
Twilight Zone (650 feet to 3,300 feet)
The ocean is colder in the twilight zone. Only dim light reaches this area. There is not enough light for plants to grow. Fewer sea creatures are found here than in the sunlit zone. Jellyfish and octopuses are often found here.
Many jellyfish have stinging tentacles that they use to defend themselves and to capture
Prey is an animal that is caught and eaten by a predator. Octopuses use the suction cups on their tentacles to hold on to prey.
Midnight Zone (3,300 feet to 19,800 feet)
It is pitch-dark and very cold in the midnight zone. No plants grow here. Many of the animals have sharp teeth and big jaws. Other creatures, such as the ratfish, have large eyes to see in the dark. Ratfish swim along the bottom of the ocean and eat smaller sea animals, such as shrimp and sea stars.
Some animals, like the hatchetfish, have body parts that glow in the dark. That helps them to attract prey.

It happens when a hurricane travels over water. The strong winds push against the water. The water gets higher and higher. As the hurricane passes over land, the water pushes onto the shore. The rising water can cause flooding.
Hurricane Hunters are ready. They are a part of the U.S. Air Force Reserve. Their job is to fly airplanes into the
of a hurricane! The eye is the calm center.
Inside the storm, the hunters measure the amount of rain and the speed of the wind. Their work helps weather experts predict where the hurricane will go and how strong it will become.
The three pictures show how a hurricane forms.
 First, small storms begin over an ocean.
 Then strong winds make the storms spin around and come together.
 Soon, a hurricane forms. It spins around and around. Sometimes it moves over land and brings heavy rains and strong winds.
