- lines of broken, unemployed men, rows of shabby housing - and
- new washing machines, automobiles, electricity and cinemas.
In 1929, the Wall Street Crash plunged the USA into economic depression. The Americans were alarmed, so they called in their loans to other countries and put up customs barriers to stop imports of foreign goods. This created a depression across the rest of the world.
Unemployment in Britain rose to 2.5 million (25 per cent of the workforce) in 1933. Worst hit were the areas of heavy industry (eg coal, iron, steel, shipbuilding) in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the north of England. These industries were already struggling because they had not modernised after the war and had been badly affected by competition from other countries. The Depression meant that now these industries crumbled. For example, when the coal mine, the steel works and Palmer's shipyard closed down in Jarrow in the north-east of England, every single man in the town was made

2185,"Three factors can limit the speed of photosynthesis: light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature.
Without enough light, a plant cannot photosynthesise very quickly, even if there is plenty of water and carbon dioxide. Increasing the light intensity will boost the speed of photosynthesis.
Sometimes photosynthesis is limited by the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air. Even if there is plenty of light, a plant cannot photosynthesise if there is insufficient carbon dioxide.
If it gets too cold, the rate of photosynthesis will decrease. Plants cannot photosynthesise if it gets too hot.
If you plot the rate of photosynthesis against the levels of these three limiting factors, you get graphs like the ones above.
In practice, any one of these factors could limit the rate of photosynthesis.
Farmers can use their knowledge of these limiting factors to increase crop growth in greenhouses. They may use artificial light so that photosynthesis can continue beyond daylight hours, or in a higher-than-normal light intensity. The use of paraffin lamps inside a greenhouse increases the rate of photosynthesis because the burning paraffin produces carbon dioxide, and heat too.

we saw how you could use short quotations as evidence.
We might want to say Don John is an aggressive and angry character. We can then support this view by looking at his language. He says that if he had a mouth he ""would bite"", and that he only has his unhappiness to make use of.
Here we are using two ways to provide evidence: words that are directly from the play are put in quotation marks, for example, ""I am a plain-dealing villain."" The second way is to describe what is said in your own words, for instance, Don John plans to stop Claudio's marriage to Hero. It is often good to combine these methods, perhaps quoting just one word from the play. For instance, Don John despises Claudio and calls him a ""start-up"" (an 'upstart' in modern English).
The one thing you should avoid is using a long quotation. Many students write out whole chunks of the play. This is just like retelling the story - there is no reason for it, and you will not get any marks for it.

Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.
. This usually happens in vehicle engines and power stations.
Deposits soot on buildings and trees, causing them damage. Permeates the air, making it difficult for living creatures to breathe.
greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming
depletes ozone in the upper atmosphere, so damages the ozone layer
Lichens are plants that grow in exposed places such as rocks or tree bark. They need to be very good at absorbing water and nutrients to grow there, and rainwater contains just enough nutrients to keep them alive. Air pollutants dissolved in rainwater, especially sulfur dioxide, can damage lichens, and prevent them from growing. This makes lichens natural indicators of air pollution. For example:
leafy lichens can survive a small amount of air pollution
crusty lichens can survive in more polluted air
In places where no lichens are growing, it's often a sign that the air is heavily polluted with sulfur dioxide.
Individuals that are poorly adapted to their environment are less likely to survive and reproduce than those that are well adapted. Similarly, it is possible that a species that is poorly adapted to its environment will not survive and will become extinct.
Here are some of the factors that can cause a species to become extinct:
changes to the environment, such as a change in climate
since life on Earth began. Extinction is still happening and a lot of it occurs because of human activities. We compete with other living things for space, food and water, and we are very successful predators.
The dodo was a large flightless bird that lived on Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean. The island was uninhabited and the dodo had no natural predators. Then Mauritius was colonised by the Dutch in 1638. Dodos were
and easy to catch because they were not afraid of people. New competitors were brought onto the island, including pigs, cats and rats, which ate the dodos' eggs and their young. Within 80 years, the dodo was
The panda and gorilla are endangered, and may become extinct. Some species in Britain are endangered, too, including the red kite, red squirrel and osprey. They could be helped by measures such as:
legal protection and protection of their habitats
making artificial ecosystems for them to live in
These measures are difficult to implement when dealing with certain organisms, such as whales. These animals live in international waters, so international laws and agreements are needed to protect them.
Fish are an important part of the human diet, accounting for a worldwide average 15% of humans' protein intake. Most of these fish are caught wild, and if fish are caught at a faster rate than the remaining fish can reproduce, the stock of fish will obviously decline. Trying to harvest more fish than the sea can produce is an example of
an activity which uses up resources or damages the environment so that it cannot be continued in the future
Since the 1960s North Sea cod have been overfished, as more and more - and bigger - fishing boats caught more and more cod. At first, catches continued to increase each year. But then - surprise, surprise! - they started to decline, as there were not enough breeding fish left to maintain the cod population. Today, North Sea cod are in danger of extinction.
Humans have now been cutting down trees for around 10,000 years - for wood to burn or build with, or to clear land for farming.
Sustainable means using something or doing something in a way that minimises damage to the environment and which avoids using up natural resources, eg by using renewable rather than scarce resources.
as long as forests are allowed to replace themselves, or are replanted after harvesting - but often this is not done. The result is that the area of forest is steadily shrinking - a process called

. This type of forest is often referred to as 'the Earth's lungs' because it produces around 40% of the world's atmospheric oxygen. It is also home to an estimated 50% of all species on Earth - once lost, the original habitats can never be replaced. Tropical rainforest is being cut down at the rate of 17 - 20 million hectares a year.
Humans reduce the amount of land and resources available for plants and animals. This happens because of farming, quarrying, dumping waste and building.
Urbanisation means the growth of cities. About
half the worlds population live in cities
, and most of the population growth in the future is expected to take place in cities. It is predicted that by 2015,
the worlds six largest cities will each have more than 20 million inhabitants
. These are some of the effects of urbanisation:
land no longer used for food production
decline of rural towns and villages as people leave them to live in cities
means improving our quality of life without damaging the quality of life of future generations. It is important to all of us, not just the other inhabitants of the planet, that sustainable development is achieved. This involves each of us as individuals, and careful planning at local, regional and global levels.

It takes a certain amount of time for a driver to react to a hazard and start applying the brakes. During this time, the car is still moving. The faster the car is travelling, the greater this thinking distance will be.
The thinking distance will also increase if the driver's reactions are slower because they are:
The braking distance is the distance the car travels from where the brakes are first applied to where the car stops. If the braking force is too great, the tyres may not grip the road sufficiently and the car may skid. The faster the car is travelling, the greater the braking distance will be.

It is also used to print newspapers and paperback books.
This is the most widely used method of printing today, and is equally good for colour work as for black and white printing. The process works on the principle that oil and greasy substances do not mix with water. The plate to be printed is coated with a type of grease, then rinsed, dampened with water and coated with ink.

The printing plates for lithography are made by a photographic process. Lithography is used for medium and long printing runs of products such as magazines, posters, packaging and books.
For this process, the image to be printed is made up of small holes sunk into the surface of the printing plate. The cells are filled with ink and the excess is scraped off the surface, then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing plates are usually made from copper and may be produced by engraving or etching. Gravure printing is used for long, high-quality print runs such as magazines, mail-order catalogues, packaging, and printing onto fabric and wallpaper. It is also used for printing postage stamps and decorative plastic laminates, such as kitchen worktops.

Be clear about what the examiners will be looking for. For example, to get a grade A, you must be able to write an accurate account in the past tense. You must also be able to give and justify ideas and points of view. There are a number of other grade criteria that an ""A"" candidate has to meet.
Be sure that your teacher has given you the criteria for writing that match the grade you are trying to achieve.
Make sure that you have a vocabulary book/record that covers each area of the syllabus.
Build up your personal vocabulary by learning a small number of new words every day.
Be clear about which aspects of grammar you need to revise. For example, you will need to be able to use verbs in the present, perfect and future tenses if you are aiming for a grade C or above. You will also be expected to use the imperfect tense in the higher tier exam.

You must come to the exam with a clear idea of the strategies that will help you work well under pressure. Here are some suggestions:
On foundation tier papers, the important thing is to get the message across. Small spelling mistakes and errors of gender are not likely to lose you many marks.
On the higher tier papers, accuracy, quality and range of language are much more important, so you will need to check your writing. For more hints, look at the Revision Bite on Checking your writing.
Read the questions slowly and carefully. Be absolutely sure about what you have to do.
Look carefully at the words used in the question. You might be able to 'recycle' some of them in your answer.
Before you begin writing, plan what you will write. For example, you might need to decide where to put an opinion, a verb in the future, a key phrase you have learnt by heart or a structure you have been practising.
If you have learnt by heart a number of set phrases, don't use them if they do not relate to the subject of the question.
Use the Spanish you know when you are writing your answers. Don't think of phrases and sentences in English and then try to translate them into Spanish.
Now decide which strategies will work best for you and practise using them as much as you can between now and the day of the exam. The more you practise them, the more you are likely to remember to use them during the exam itself.

Eoghan gives some excellent reasons why he likes the place in which he is staying and again uses the present tense.

Folk is still popular in its own right, being performed in folk clubs, festivals, ceilidhs.
Mixed styles such as country and western, folk-rock, soul, and gospel music have developed.
Many folk elements have become common in modern popular song: eg the dance rhythms, the strophic form of short stanzas with rhyming line-ends, the subject matter (especially love), the association with partying, and instruments such as the guitar.
Bands such as Steeleye Span ('a rock band that happens to play folk music'), The Chieftains, The Pogues, The Levellers and The Cranberries are just a few who play popular music based on folk.

""I want to convey the feeling of the body which is more important than identity.""

Antony talks about the sculptures he creates from casts of his own body
Antony Gormley was born in London in 1950. He studied archaeology, anthropology and history of art at Cambridge University, graduating in 1971. After university, Gormley travelled to India and Sri Lanka to study Buddhism. On returning to Britain he studied sculpture at the Central School of Fine Art and Goldsmiths College before completing a postgraduate course in sculpture at the Slade School of Fine Art, graduating in 1979.
Antonys most famous piece is the impressive and imposing
a steel sculpture of an angel, standing 20 metres tall with a 54 metre wing span. It stands in Gateshead near Newcastle overlooking the A1 road into Tyneside and the main east coast train line.
Most of Antonys work is based on
. 'Untitled, (For Francis)' is a mould of the artist's body and has been pierced in the feet, hands and chest. The sculpted figure stands like a saint receiving the stigmata (marks like those made on Jesus' body at the crucifixion).
Antonys work continues to be exhibited world wide. He won the Turner Prize in 1994, the South Bank Prize in 1999, and was awarded the OBE for his services to sculpture in 1998.
Art is the means by which we communicate what it feels like to be alive - in the past that was mixed up with other illustrative duties but that was still its central function that has been liberated in the art called modern. Art is not necessarily good for you or about communicating 'good things'.
I'm not interested in features as features identify a personality, a person.... You'll notice that there aren't any noses, eyes, ears, or fingers in my work... I want to convey the feeling of the body which is more important that the identity.
Sculpture, for me, uses the physical as a means to talk about the spirit ... a visual means to refer to things which cannot be seen... [It's] an attempt to materialise the place at the other side of appearance where we all live.

Highest common factor and lowest common multiple
We can use prime factors to find the highest common factor (HCF) and lowest common multiple (LCM).
Here are the list of prime factors of 24 and 36:
24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3
36 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3
If we write down the numbers that are the same in both lists, they will give us the highest common factor of 24 and 36:
HCF of 24 and 36 is 2 x 2 x 3 = 12
To find the lowest common multiple, we need to think about which list has the most of each factor.
24 = (2 x 2 x 2) x (3)
36 = (2 x 2) x (3 x 3)
24 has the most 2s. (it has three 2s). And 36 has the most 3s (it has two 3s).
So the LCM of 24 and 36 is (2 x 2 x 2) x (3 x 3) = 72.
Find the HCF and LCM of 90 and 175.
90 = 2 x 3 x 3 x 5
175 = 5 x 5 x 7
To find the LCM we group the prime factors using brackets.
90 = (2) x (3 x 3) x (5)
175 = (5 x 5) x (7)
LCM = 2 x (3 x 3) x (5 x 5) x 7 = 3150

3417,"The context of this poem is quite complicated, because it involves the poet's own history of moving between cultures - Caribbean and English - and the wider history of both those cultures.
Grace Nichols grew up in a small country village on the Atlantic coast of Guyana, in the Caribbean. Guyana used to be a British colony, so English literature has always been part of her personal background. In the 1970s, she moved to England, and now lives on the coast of Sussex.
In 1987, the southern coast of England was hit by what was known as The Great Storm. Hurricane-force winds are rarely experienced in England, and the effect on the landscape, particularly the trees, was devastating. In the Caribbean, on the other hand, hurricanes are a regular occurrence, and Grace Nichols had experienced them during her childhood.
Grace Nichols said about the 1987 hurricane:
It seemed as though the voices of the old gods were in the wind, within the Sussex wind. And, for the first time, I felt close to the English landscape in a way that I hadn't earlier. It was as if the Caribbean had come to England.
Listen to the poem and watch the slideshow
It took a hurricane, to bring her closer
I am following the movement of your winds,
I am riding the mystery of your storm.
Come to break the frozen lake in me,
Shaking the foundations of the very trees within me,
That the earth is the earth is the earth.
A woman, living in England, is woken by a hurricane.
Addressing the wind as a god, she asks what it is doing creating such havoc in this part of the world (stanzas 2-5).
She then speaks of the effect the storm has on her personally. She feels somehow unchained, and at one with the world.
She feels that the hurricane has come with a message to her, perhaps to tell her that the same forces are at work in England as in the Caribbean.
The Carib Indian God of the winds. The Carib Indians were the original inhabitants of the Caribbean Islands, until they were wiped out by European settlers.
Oya and Shango are both storm gods - one female, one male - belonging originally to the Yoruban people of West Africa. When, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the people of Africa were transported to the Caribbean to be sold as slaves, they carried their religion with them. At first, the gods were worshipped secretly, but in the 20th century they emerged as symbols of the African side of Caribbean identity. 'Ogun', in Edward Kamau Brathwaite's poem, is also a Yoruban god.
Hurricanes are given names, by meteorologists, in alphabetical order. Until quite recently, these names were always female. Hurricane Hattie is one Grace Nichols remembers from her childhood.
The poem is written in eight stanzas of varying lengths. The lines are also of varying lengths. Perhaps this helps us to see how unpredictable the hurricane is - and how unpredictable the woman's thoughts are.
The first stanza of the poem is in the

Do you think the style of language changes in stanza two, when we hear the woman's own voice?
There are a number of contradictions in the poem:
For example, the poet says that the raging wind is
At first sight, these two words do not seem to make sense together - it's what we might call a
'fearful' and 'reassuring'? What do such contradictions suggest about the poet's feelings?
The speaker asks the gods she imagines in the hurricane a series of
(line 13-27), but doesn't answer them directly. She asks:
'Why does the hurricane visit/An English coast?'
Why do 'old tongues' - the winds of the hurricane she remembers from her childhood - appear in new places?
Why is there 'blinding illumination' (lightning) when simultaneously the hurricane causes 'darkness' by blowing down power lines? Is there anything that is also illuminated in herself?
Why does the hurricane cause trees to be uprooted? Is there anything in her own life that becomes 'uprooted' as a result of the hurricane?
In each of these four questions, she is trying to make sense of what is happening. The last question, which has its own line, appears to be the question to which the others have led up to:
This question is a different sort of question from the others. It is much more personal. She is talking
about the effect of the hurricane on herself rather than the effect of the hurricane on the landscape.
, mainly because it's about the effect of wind on the landscape.
(line 23-24) is effective because the huge trees become like whales when the torrential rain that accompanies a hurricane makes the land become almost like a sea.
For example, what do you think the poet means by:
""Come to break the frozen lake in me""
Has the poet been frozen by being away from her own country, so the arrival of the hurricane can help 'break the ice' and allow her to live more comfortably in her new home?
How many can you spot altogether? The echoes create rhythmic patterns, and contribute to the musical (or 'lyrical') voice of the poem. What is the effect of these echoes? Do they help us to imagine the power of the gods that seem to be part of the hurricane, as if the woman is reciting a spell or a prayer?
towards the end also help us to understand how the woman is feeling and contribute to the tone of this poem. She becomes excited, even ecstatic, at the power of the storm and the thoughts that it rouses in her:
The final two lines of the poem read:
""That the earth is the earth is the earth.""
What do you think the poet means by that? Is there any sense in which the questions asked in lines 13-27 are answered in those final lines?
Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. 'Attitude' can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
How do you think the poem should be read?
In an excited way, to show how thrilled the woman is by the hurricane and the effect it has on her?
In a mournful way, to emphasise how much she misses the place of her birth?
In a grateful way, because the storm has reminded her of where she came from and helps her to realise that the same forces are at work in England?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
Although the hurricane was very violent and destructive, it has created something
inside the woman. She finds it liberating as well as disturbing: she 'rides the mystery' of the storm, and feels that a 'frozen lake' inside her is being broken up. Her heart is 'unchained' by the storm.
I feel at home now both in Guyana and in England. When I'm in Guyana, or another part of the Caribbean - because I see myself as coming from the wider Caribbean also - I feel I belong there because I spring from that landscape. But partly because I have children in England, I also feel at home in this culture, with their dreams and aspirations. So I embrace both. England is where I live, where I make my living, but when I'm in England, I'm always looking back. Both as a writer and as an individual, I'm always looking at both worlds.

When writing about two poems, you should try to end by making a
between the two. In what ways are the poems similar - in the style of language, or in ideas? In what ways are they different?
Grace Nichols describes the storm as a hurricane and a howling ship and a dark ancestral spectre. She calls it Huracan, Oya, Shango, and Hattie. She says the storm is like an old tongue and a blinding illumination. It makes the trees fall heavy as whales. In line 27 she says Tropical Oya of the Weather. The storm is a mystery to her.
lots of close quotation of relevant phrases, which is good
no hint of why these phrases are significant
a few connections or explanations would much improve this paragraph
The way Grace Nichols describes the storm shows what it means to her as a Caribbean woman living in England. On the one hand, she emphasises all the destruction which it causes. The wind is 'raging' angrily, it's as if it has come to take revenge for something. She seems to feel sorry for the ancient trees which have been uprooted. All this makes the wind 'fearful' to her, as to any inhabitant of the 'English coast'. But at the same time, to her it is 'reassuring' because it is from 'back home', something old from the past, an ancestral spectre which reminds her that the other part of her life, the Caribbean is still there, still important to who she is. The last part of the poem becomes excited in tone, the way she feels she is 'riding the storm', as if the power of the wind has become her power. Something in her had been frozen over in England, like a 'frozen lake', but it's now been 'unchained' by the hurricane.

Ranching first started in Texas, with ranches mostly manned by Mexican cowboys called
In 1836 Texan ranchers drove many Mexicans out, and claimed the cattle left behind.
The Civil War started in 1861, and Texans went off to fight. The cattle
as huge herds grew up. On returning home, the Texans started rounding them up and driving them to sell in places such as New Orleans and California.
1865-1870: The 'long drives' - first 'open range' ranch
Realising that there was a great demand for beef in the north of the USA, the Texans drove their cattle north on a
to Sedalia in Missouri, where they were loaded onto trains for Chicago.
Two Texas ranchers, Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving, pioneered a second trail, to Denver in Colorado, where they sold their cattle to gold miners.
In 1868, a rancher named John Iliff (the 'cattle-king of the northern plains') won the contract to supply beef to the Sioux, who had been forced onto a reservation in the Black Hills.
A safer drive (the Chisholm Trail) was established to Abilene. This was set up by Joseph McCoy as a 'cow-town', with railroad stockyards (and numerous saloons where the cowboys could spend their wages).
John Iliff was the first rancher to set up an 'open range' ranch - in Wyoming in 1867.
A Cowboy looks out onto the Plains
There were huge areas of 'open range' - unfenced land which was free for anyone to use.
Charles Goodnight is reputed to have invented the

In spring 1886 there was a drought, followed by a scorching hot summer (up to 43C). This was followed by a winter storm in January 1887, in which the temperature dropped to -43C. Half the cattle on the plains died in a single year.
More and more homesteaders were coming onto the plains, and fencing off their farms with barbed wire (patented in 1874).

Khrushchev explains that the missile sites are ""solely to defend Cuba against the attack of an aggressor"".
Twenty Russian ships head for Cuba. Khrushchev tells the captains to ignore the blockade. Khrushchev warns that Russia will have ""a fitting reply to the aggressor"".
The first Russian ship reaches the naval blockade. It is an oil ship and is allowed through. The other Russian ships turn back. Secretly, the US government floats the idea of removing the missiles in Turkey in exchange for those in Cuba.
Russia is still building the missile bases. In the morning, Kennedy considers an invasion of Cuba. It seems that war is about to break out. But at 6pm, Kennedy gets a telegram from Khrushchev offering to dismantle the sites if Kennedy lifts the blockade and promises not to invade Cuba.
However, at 11am Khrushchev sends a second letter, demanding that Kennedy also dismantles American missile bases in Turkey. At noon on the same day, a U2 plane is shot down over Cuba. It looks as if a war is about to start after all. At 8.05pm, Kennedy sends a letter to Khrushchev, offering that if Khrushchev dismantles the missile bases in Cuba, America will lift the blockade and promise not to invade Cuba - and also dismantle the Turkish missile bases (as long as this is kept a secret).
Khrushchev agrees to Kennedy's proposals. The crisis is over.

Character 3 and two friends are driving along (stage this with two characters standing in a spotlight with the third character leaning into the space between their heads and shoulders). They are laughing and shouting. The 'car' stops and the two friends exit leaving 3 alone. The action freezes, and the lights go up on the other side of stage.
Character 1 is shouting off-stage, having an argument with her husband. She crosses the stage, grabbing her car keys as she goes.
Character 2 is at home, when the sound of a crash outside is heard. He goes to the 'window' and looks out. He mimes picking up a phone, and gives details of the scene he can see outside. He says he's a doctor and will go to help. Blackout.
When the lights come on again, the sound of loud music is heard and two bodies are seen, lying awkwardly - one on the ground the other on the chairs as if in a car. Character 2 approaches the bodies and leans into the 'car' to turn off the radio. Silence.
Character 2 looks at the two bodies, and bends down to check for signs of life. He starts making the accident victims more comfortable. Character 3 starts moaning, character 2 tells him that the ambulance will soon be here. Freeze.

, the characters 1 and 3 are drivers of cars made up of the other actors. Each 'vehicle' faces the audience, and each is lit by a spotlight, with the rest of the stage in darkness. The actors making up the vehicles can make the sound of the cars, gear-changing etc.
Character 1 is angry and driving badly. She talks about her husband and their argument this morning. She makes angry comments about other drivers on the road. She jumps a red light, saying 'No-one will be around this time of the morning'.
Character 3 is playing music (perhaps rap style performed by a member of the cast forming his car.) He sees character 1 crossing his path, and shouts, 'I can't stop!' Character 1 shouts, 'Oh no! Another car - I'm gonna hit him!'. Sound effects can be used here to create the skidding noises, engine noises and sound of breaking glass. The lights go out. Silence. General lights come back up to reveal two bodies lying on the 'road'.
Voices are heard saying things such as:'She drove straight through the red light!' 'The other driver didn't have a chance!' 'She was going too fast!' 'Are they still alive?' Everything sounds confused and chaotic. Eventually a siren is heard as the lights fade down.

Two protons and two neutrons  the same as a helium nucleus
You need to know the effect of alpha and beta decay on the nucleus. The nucleus of an atom can be represented as:
A = atomic mass (number of protons + neutrons)
Z = atomic number (number of protons)
X = chemical symbol (as shown on the Periodic Table)
When an alpha particle is emitted from a nucleus the nucleus loses two protons and two neutrons. This means the atomic mass number decreases by 4 and the atomic number decreases by 2. A
is formed that is two places lower in the Periodic Table than the original element.
Radon decays into polonium when it emits an alpha particle. Here is the equation for that radioactive decay.
In Beta decay a neutron changes into a proton plus an electron. The proton stays in the nucleus and the electron leaves the atom with high energy, and we call it a beta particle.
When a beta particle is emitted from the nucleus the nucleus has one more proton and one less neutron. This means the atomic mass number remains unchanged and the atomic number increases by 1.
Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon. (It's a carbon atom with 8 neutrons instead of the usual 6.) Here is the equation for the beta decay of carbon-14 into nitrogen.

Look back over Caoimhe's answer. It included:
Two things she doesn't like about school
Details about her plans for next year
Caoimhe used a wide range of verbs from the past, present and future tense. She also added some verbs in the negative which shows excellent grasp of verb tense.
N dhearna m / bh s / d'fhan m / n raibh muid balta
Faighim / Tosaonn / N chrochnaonn / Bm / Bonn / Slim / nuair a thim
danfaidh m / nuair a fhgfaidh m / beidh
Caoimhe used a lot of nice vocabulary that added interest to her article eg.
some complex sentences and a range of structures
- there are a few things that I don't like
- we're not allowed to wear jewellery
T rn agam teacht ar ais anseo
- I plan to come back here
Caoimhe added more information when relevant e.g. couldn't go outside at breaktime because of weather / what job she would like etc
ideas and opinions that are developed and justified
Ba mhaith liom bheith i mo chuntasir nuair a fhgfaidh m an scoil agus mar sin de, beidh tortha maithe de dhth orm.
She would like to be an accountant and therefore needs good results
Caoimhe gives her opinion several times -
n miste liom / t sin amaideach / i mo bharil fin
Caoimhe has written an interesting and accurate article.
There is evidence of development of tasks - extra information added when appropriate.

2552,"Oral contraceptives allow couples to choose the time they start a family, and choose the time they stop having children.
However, some women who take the pill may suffer from changes in weight, mood and blood pressure, as a result of the hormones in it. There is also a chance of an increased risk of developing blood clots. On the other hand, there is evidence of a decreased risk of developing cancer of the uterus or ovaries.
Fertility treatments increase a woman's chance of becoming pregnant, although the treatment may not always work. On the other hand, because the treatment boosts the production of mature eggs, multiple conceptions sometimes occur, with twins or triplets being expected. This increases the risk of complications in pregnancy and childbirth, and may lead to premature or underweight babies.
If a couple are having difficulty conceiving a child because the quantity or quality of the mans sperm is poor then in vitro fertilisation - or IVF - can be used. This is where the egg is fertilised outside the womans body and then implanted back into her uterus. As FSH can also be used to encourage the production of several mature eggs at once, it is used as part of IVF to increase the number of eggs available for fertilisation.
Some people worry about the ethical implications of IVF, and are concerned that couples may only want fertilised eggs with 'desirable' qualities. For example, they may want a girl if they have lots of boys in the family, or they may wish to avoid producing a baby with an inherited defect.

The areas you could be asked to write about are: description of place or person, importance of culture, importance of language and the feelings of the poet.
All essay questions expect you to comment on the areas covered in
. This means you must write about the use of language, the effect of language and form and how it makes you feel.
A good comparative essay is like a multi-layered sandwich:
- How one of your chosen poems illustrates this point.
- How your other chosen poem illustrates this point.

How can you link the neighbours with the charnel house description in 'Vultures'?
What tone or attitudes do you detect in this stanza?
What devices or vocabulary would you choose to support your point?
The following essay section covers this plan, but we have muddled up the order. Try to sort them out so that they flow more logically.
The descriptions of places and people in these sections of the poems are highly descriptive and thought-provoking. In the mud hut, the help offered by the neighbours is unwanted and the poet feels it is pointless and intrusive. The atmosphere is busy and irritating. In the charnel house description, there is an atmosphere of calm and ordinariness. Both these descriptions are surprising in the Night of the Scorpion you might think that the help would be welcomed; in the charnel house you are surprised that love is so calm and serene in such abnormal circumstances.
The mud hut is alive with activity and pressure to do something. In contrast, the charnel house of the second stanza in Vultures is surprisingly calm. Again a surprising image because even the word charnel conjures up images of death and in the context of this poem, violence. Even more surprising is the personification of love in the charnel house tidying up. This stanza begins with one word, strange set alone on a line it causes the reader to pause and evaluate. It is strange, not that love exists in a charnel house - death does not mean that we stop loving people - but that her behaviour is so ordinary: she tidies up, chooses a corner and goes to sleep, her face turned to the wall!. Why? There are implications here that after death we tidy up our memories of people, perhaps make them cleaner, but in the end, the idea of death is a hard thing to face and we try to avoid it, turn away from it. So, ultimately, perhaps this idea is not strange at all.
This repetition of more also helps the audience to feel that the neighbours are relentless and irritating as they try to help and pray for the bitten mother. The lack of sympathy from the poet can be heard in the repetition of they said. He has disassociated himself from their behaviour, which seems to him to be superstitious and unhelpful. In their prayers, they imply that the mother has sinned in a previous life. The poet seems unhappy about this implication; to use they said so many times is to register the fact that he does not agree with them. Most of the lines in this section begin with may, which makes what the neighbours say sound like a prayer or incantation and the poet finds these incantations and superstitions silly and pointless. His descriptions make the mud hut sound claustrophobic; it is full of lanterns and candles and shadows and clicking tongues and it continues to rain. The repetition of and helps to build this feeling of pressure and tension. We can see why the scorpion would want to escape the hut and we feel that the poet would like to as well.
Both poets use descriptions of places and the activities carried out in them to develop the ideas explored in the poems.
In 'Night of the Scorpion', the description of the activity of the neighbours leads us to feel irritated by them, even though they have arrived to help the mother; they are described in a way that makes them seem annoying, like flies: 'The peasants came like a swarm of flies' This simile is continued, they 'buzz' and fuss and 'click'. This irritation is surprising because the neighbours are trying to help. They bring equipment with them: 'More candles, more lanterns, more neighbours,'
The correct order of paragraphs is 4, 3, 2, 1.
The father and the Commandant - the plan
So far, we have explored the descriptions, ideas and attitudes of the scorpion, the vultures and the neighbours and charnel house. We now need to move on to the description of the father in 'Night of the Scorpion' and the Commandant in 'Vultures'.
Use the plan below to write four paragraphs.

In terms of description and attitude of both the fathers and the poets, what are the similarities and differences?

Another point of similarity between these poems is that they both describe fathers. At first glance, the Commandant in 'Vultures' has nothing in common with the father in 'Night of the Scorpion', but closer inspection reveals more.
The father in 'Night of the Scorpion' is described as 'sceptic, rationalist'. The simple sparse use of these two words reflects his nature. He is logical and thoughtful, probably a man of few words and the poet seems to admire these qualities in his father. But when faced with the possible death of his wife, he becomes illogical and desperate. The following list of all the things he tries to do to help his wife is a sharp comparison with the usual 'rationalist' approach to his life. We suspect that the poet is not impressed at this point. The reason for his sudden change of character is because he loves his wife. He wants to help, but does not know how. He is helpless and children do not like to see that in their parents. We sympathise with the poet's disappointment with his father.
The Commandant similarly loves his children, although described as an ogre; a man who 'roasts' other human beings, he is also referred to as 'Daddy'. This childish word reminds us of his home life as a father who wants to buy a treat for his children on his way home from work and we understand how his children feel about their father. We can see from the rest of the description that the poet has no respect for this man. In fact, his description leads the reader to hate him. He buys treats for his 'tender offspring', while he can still smell the equally tender people he has committed to death that day.
The two fathers from these poems are alike in some ways. The descriptions of them show that they are loved and admired, but also that they are capable of things that are not admired. Again, the descriptions in the poems develop sudden and contrasting elements to their personalities.
A strong conclusion to an essay will always leave an examiner with a positive attitude to your work. What would you write in your conclusion that draws all the threads together about description in the poem and most importantly your feelings and attitudes about the poems and what they have to say?
Try writing your conclusion now. When you have finished, click 'Next' to see the completed essay in full.
In 'Night of the Scorpion' and 'Vultures', the use of description is both vivid and surprising. The descriptions often lead the reader to expect a certain conclusion or tone and then the poets' use of description changes and this changes the reader's anticipation of how the poems might develop; this is what makes the poems thought-provoking and surprising.
The title 'Night of the Scorpion' sounds like the sort of name a horror film might be given. This is misleading because this poem is not like a horror film at all. Instead of the scorpion being the enemy, the poet 's description of the scorpion's circumstances leads us to feel sympathy for it. He has been 'driven' into the hut by 'ten hours of steady rain'. The use of the word 'driven' suggests that this is a last resort for the scorpion. He really does not want to be there, but he's desperate to be dry and quiet, so he crawls 'beneath a sack of rice'. At this point, we do not see the scorpion as an object of fear or horror as the title of the poems suggests. Ezekiel's sympathy for the scorpion is contrasted with the moment that the scorpion stings his mother - 'flash' reflects the sudden and shocking moment of the sting. His tail is described as 'diabolic' and the neighbours call the scorpion 'the evil one'; the repetition of the alliteration 'parting with his poison' helps the reader feel the sudden and dangerous nature of the sting because the P sounds quick and harsh.
Similarly, the title of the poem 'Vultures' leads the reader to make assumptions about what the poem is about. In fact, the poem is not really about vultures at all. The vultures are a symbol for an idea that the poet wants to explore: the idea that love can be found in unexpected places. The description of the vultures is harsh and the imagery is of death and violence. The opening alliteration helps set a tone that sounds negative - the dawn is described as 'despondent' and drizzly. The hard sound of the D rings through these opening lines - the vultures sit on a 'broken bone of a dead tree'. Sunrise is 'sunbreak' and it's grey. There is no anticipation that this will be a happy or sunny poem and yet, unexpectedly, the vulture inclines his 'bashed in head' to nestle affectionately against his mate. This one description of love is immediately followed by more images of the repulsive and macabre as the eating habits of the birds are described vividly and stomach turningly.
Both poems use unexpected changes of mood to engage the reader with the ideas of the poems. We start off feeling sympathy for the scorpion, but are left thinking perhaps this really is a diabolical creature. With the vultures, we feel that they represent something depressing and violent and yet we are surprised by the affection between the two birds. Both poets use description of place and the activities being carried out in them to develop the ideas explored in the poems. Again, these descriptions lead us to question assumptions we might have made about the poems.
In 'Night of the Scorpion', the description of the activity of the neighbours leads us to feel irritated by them even though they have arrived to help the mother; they are described in a way that makes them seem annoying, like flies:
'The peasants came like a swarm of flies'
This simile is continued: they 'buzz' and fuss and 'click', this irritation is surprising because the neighbours are trying to help. They bring equipment with them:
This repetition of 'more' also helps the audience to feel that the neighbours are relentless and irritating as they try to help and pray for the bitten mother. The lack of sympathy from the poet can be heard in the repetition of 'they said'. He has disassociated himself from their behaviour, which seems to him to be unhelpful. Many of the lines in this section begin with 'may', which makes what the neighbours say sound like a prayer or incantation and the poet finds these incantations and superstitions pointless. His descriptions make the mud hut sound claustrophobic. It is full of lanterns and candles and shadows and clicking tongues and it continues to rain. The repetition of 'and' helps to build this feeling of pressure and tension. We can see why the scorpion would want to escape the hut, and we feel that the poet would like to as well.
The mud hut is alive with activity and pressure to do something. In contrast, the charnel house of the second stanza in 'Vultures' is surprisingly calm. Again a surprising image because even the word 'charnel' conjures up images of death, and, in the context of this poem, violence. Even more surprising is the personification of love in the charnel house tidying up. This stanza begins with one word - 'strange'. Set alone on a line, it causes the reader to pause and evaluate. It is strange, not that love exists in a charnel house - death does not mean that we stop loving people - but that her behaviour is so ordinary; she tidies up, chooses a corner and goes to sleep, 'her face turned to the wall!' Why? There are implications here that after death, we tidy up our memories of people, perhaps make them 'cleaner', but in the end, the idea of death is a hard thing to face so we try to avoid it and turn away from it. So, ultimately, perhaps this idea is not 'strange' at all.
The descriptions of places and people in these section of the poems are highly descriptive and thought-provoking. In the mud hut, the help offered by the neighbours is unwanted and the poet feels it is pointless and intrusive. The atmosphere is busy and irritating. In the charnel house description, there is an atmosphere of calm and ordinariness. Both these descriptions are surprising. In the 'Night of the Scorpion', you might think that the help would be welcomed; in the charnel house, you are surprised that love is so calm and serene in such abnormal circumstances.
Another point of similarity between these poems is that they both describe fathers. At first glance, the Commandant in 'Vultures' has nothing in common with the father in 'Night of the Scorpion', but closer inspection reveals more.
The father in 'Night of the Scorpion' is described as 'sceptic, rationalist'. The simple sparse use of these two words reflects his nature. He is logical and thoughtful, probably a man of few words and the poet seems to admire these qualities in his father. But when faced with the possible death of his wife, he becomes illogical and desperate. The following list of all the things he tries to do to help his wife is a sharp comparison with the usual 'rationalist' approach to his life. We suspect that the poet is not impressed at this point. The reason for his sudden change of character is because he loves his wife. He wants to help, but does not know how. He is helpless and children do not like to see that in their parents. We sympathise with the poet's disappointment with his father.
The Commandant similarly loves his children. Although described as an ogre; a man who 'roasts' other human beings, he is also referred to as 'Daddy'. This childish word reminds us of his home life as a father who wants to buy a treat for his children on his way home from work and we understand how his children feel about their father. We can see from the rest of the description that the poet has no respect for this man. In fact, his description leads the reader to hate him. He buys treats for his 'tender offspring' while he smells of the equally tender people he has barbarically committed to death that day.
The two fathers from these poems are alike in some ways - the description of them shows that they are loved and admired, but also that they are capable of things that are not admired. Again, the descriptions in the poems develop sudden and contrasting elements to their personalities.
Finally, both poems explore the many facets of love. 'Night of the Scorpion' looks at the love a son has for his father and a husband for his wife, but, ultimately, the love a mother has for her children. The final three lines of the second stanza of 'Night of the Scorpion' reveal this point. After all the fuss and worry of the neighbours and the father, the mother finally says something. Having been silent throughout the poem, she thanks God that she was bitten and not her children. It is a simple and calm thanks set aside from the frantic activity of the rest of the poem by the use of a new stanza. The conclusion of 'Vultures' is more ambiguous. The last stanza raises many questions about love. It asks if it is a hopeful sign that a vicious and evil man can love his children, that there is a 'tiny glow-worm' of love and compassion in him. But it also asks if that is enough - the ogre can love his children, the vulture can love his companion, but if love is only felt for family members then it means that acts of cruelty and violence can be carried out against everyone who is not in the family.
For me, the conclusion of 'Vultures' is rather negative. The whole tone of the poem and the use of imagery is negative and depressing. I don't think the poets feel there is much hope that the world will love everyone enough to end violence and acts of atrocity. The message of 'Night of the Scorpion' is simpler - time heals and love is a plain simple thing that does not announce itself, it just is. For this, this conclusion is positive, but rather less thought-provoking than that of 'Vultures'.

3591,"As with long multiplication, you do not have to use the traditional method here. The two methods are:
This is a similar method to 'short' division, but, rather than writing the remainder at the top each time, we work it out underneath.
First, set the sum out as shown:
We work out 74 divided by 51, and write the answer (1) above the 4.
1  51 = 51, so we write this underneath 74.
Subtract 51 from 74 to get the remainder (23).
We now bring down the next digit (8) and write it on the end of the 23. This is the same as writing the remainder at the top:
We now work out 238 divided by 51, and write the answer (4) above the 8. You use estimation skills here: 51 is roughly 50 and 4  50 = 200. You can work out 51  4 = 204 separately.
We write 204 underneath the 238 and subtract to find the remainder. There are no more digits to bring down, so we have our answer:
A farmer has 630 eggs. They are to be placed in trays. Each tray holds 48 eggs. How many trays can be filled?
You need to divide 63 by 48; subtract to get 15; then divide 150 by 48, and then subtract to get 6.
If your answer was incorrect, perhaps you need to practise subtraction, or estimation? Here is a worked solution. Compare it with yours to see where you went wrong.
In this method, to calculate 748 divided by 51, we keep subtracting multiples of 51 until we cannot take any more away. We keep a note of how many lots of 51 we have taken away. This gives us our final answer.
To make life easier, we can begin by working out two easy sums. These should both be easy enough to do in your head:
We have 748, so we are able to subtract 510 from this. Notice that we write 10  51 on the side.
We are left with 238, so we cannot subtract 510 again. But we can subtract 102. Notice we write 2 x 51 on the side.
This leaves us with 136, so we can subtract another 102, writing 2  51 on the side:
This leaves 34. We cannot subtract any more lots of 51, so we have reached the end. The numbers we wrote at the side were 10, 2 and 2. Add these together to get 14. So our answer is: 14 remainder 34.
A farmer has 630 eggs. They are to be placed in trays. Each tray holds 48 eggs. How many trays can be filled?
You subtract 10  48, 2  48 and 1  48.
If your answer was incorrect, you may need to practise subtraction, or multiplying by 10 and 2.
Here is a worked solution. Compare it with yours to see where you went wrong:
10 + 2 + 1 = 13   630  48 = 13 remainder 6

Most of the evidence for evolution comes from the

One of the problems with the fossil record is that it contains gaps. Not all organisms fossilise well. And many fossils are destroyed by the movements of the Earth, or have simply not been discovered.
Evolution is difficult to observe because it usually occurs over many years. This is one reason why the theory of evolution is

Before the Industrial Revolution in Britain, most peppered moths were of the pale variety. They were camouflaged against the pale birch trees they rested on. Moths with a mutant black colouring were spotted easily by birds and eaten. This gave the white variety an advantage, making them more likely to survive and reproduce.
Airborne pollution in industrial areas blackened the birch tree bark with soot. This meant the mutant black moths were now camouflaged, while the white variety became more vulnerable to predators. It gave the black variety an advantage. They were then more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, the black peppered moths became far more numerous in urban areas than the pale variety.

By collecting a lot of this data, scientists can compare the results with conventional ideas about how organisms have evolved. What they found was that DNA data supported the conventional theory of evolution.
You need to be able to provide an explanation that links together things that were previously thought to be unrelated. For example, DNA data being used to support the theory of evolution. Also people had noticed that there was a wide variety of different things living on the planet.

341,"Discussing themes in your work shows that you are no longer just thinking about Hamlet as if it was a true story. Instead you are looking at the play and thinking about Shakespeare's choices. The four main themes in Hamlet are revenge, madness, deception and family and sexuality.
Laertes challenges Hamlet to a duel to avenge his father's death
is the initial motivation for Hamlet's transformation into anger and madness.
In Shakespeare's time, ""Revenge Tragedies"" were a popular form of entertainment for theatre goers. The Bible explicitly
revenge but human instinct often wants it.
Hamlet strongly desires revenge for his father's murder, but other concerns cloud the issue. For example, Hamlet has the chance to kill Claudius when he finds him apparently knelt in prayer. Hamlet hesitates because he fears that if Claudius dies while he is praying, he might go to heaven. Hamlet is determined that Claudius should go to hell for his betrayal and deception.
about the nature of the old King's death also confuses the matter. Hamlet feels unable to take revenge unless he is absolutely sure of Claudius' guilt. Hamlet fears that the Ghost is not his father but an evil spirit sent to tempt him to Hell.
Laertes' sense of revenge is much stronger than Hamlet's and Shakespeare
the two. Laertes does not need to be convinced of Hamlet's guilt to take revenge. On hearing Hamlet's explanation for Polonius' death, Laertes declares that he is
. By this he means that he understands Hamlet's actions, but it does not stop him from fighting Hamlet in a duel with a poisoned and sharpened sword.
After speaking to the Ghost, Hamlet decides to
, meaning he is going to feign
Hamlet hopes that by pretending to be mad, he will be able to study the King's behaviour without arousing suspicion. Ironically, Claudius declares that
""madness in great ones must not unwatched go""
and Hamlet ends up being more closely watched than ever.
Hamlet's apparent madness also has the effect of
himself. Ophelia, in particular, suffers from this. She was once loved by Hamlet, but in his madness he frightens her and claims not to have ever loved her. There are different reasons why Hamlet may have done this:
His mother's unfaithfulness and incest could have caused him to lose trust in all relationships. His treatment of Ophelia is perhaps a sincere attempt to persuade her against marriage (
Or perhaps Hamlet wants to remove any love from his own life to be in the right frame of mind to kill Claudius.
Ophelia is driven mad during the play
. As a loyal daughter and would-be wife, the loss of her father and lover prove too much and she descends into madness. Perhaps Shakespeare wants to show the effects of a corrupt, disordered world on a pure and innocent soul. Some critics suggest that Ophelia's madness is a result of the pressure on a woman in a male-dominated world.
both have been apparently spurned by a loved one.
Ophelia, however, doesn't have the intellectual capacity to understand the corruption around her and she suffers terribly as a result.
Hamlet decides to pretend he is mad
Deception causes many of the play's events. Claudius claims the throne from the old King by
His position is therefore false and this is what spurs Hamlet to seek revenge. However, the audience's knowledge of this murder comes from the spirit of the old King - and it is possible that the Ghost is
of deception. He secretly desires revenge, and plots and schemes behind others' backs. He feigns madness and puts on a play for the purpose of trapping Claudius.
As well as hiding his murder of the old King, Claudius is deceitful on other occasions:
He sends for Hamlet's friends, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, to spy on his stepson and discover what he knows about the murder of the old King.
Also, he sends a letter to the English court to ask them to execute Hamlet.
Finally, he plots with Laertes to poison Hamlet.
None of these acts of deception result in what the characters intend.
Hamlet's madness causes his beloved Ophelia's suicide.
Claudius' poison ends up killing Laertes, Gertrude and himself.
Hamlet is disgusted with his mother's marriage to his uncle and sees it as an act of
. His revenge is motivated by the loss of
Ophelia is dominated by her father and brother
with his mother's infidelity. He insults her crudely and basely and fails to properly account for Claudius' role in events. His cruel treatment of Ophelia seems to be the result of this loss of faith in his mother, rather than due to any fault on Ophelia's part.
Ophelia also suffers because of her family. She is
by her brother and father, neither of whom show any interest in her true feelings.
Both Hamlet and Ophelia feel duty-bound to carry out their father's wishes and this bears heavily on them both.

 domestic workers were not used to the needs of the factory and had to be trained.
The famous economist Adam Smith argued that
children had always been employed in the domestic system

Titus Salt argued that it was better for a child to work in a factory and earn a wage that would give them food and clothes, than to stay outside and starve or freeze to death.
The work in factories (eg pulling levers, tying threads) was less onerous than manual work and did not harm the children.

for over 30 years. She remains fascinated with the creative process and likens the way clay can be transformed to a spirited, colourful and glazed vessel through firing to the growth of a tree from a seed.
Her passion for ceramics was strengthened at high school, and experimentation with other art mediums strengthened her conviction that pottery was her natural vocation.
The work Kate creates ranges in size from intricate palm-sized pieces to exuberant, bold pots large enough for children to sit in. She also creates a variety of work from public fountains to gallery installation pieces.
Kate has become well known for her use of
on her work. The crystalline glazes produce crystal growth on the surface (as seen on 'Queen Pineapple').
The glazes can almost be bad taste as they are so glitzy and clever, like 80s disco wallpaper or jazzy wrapping paper. I myself enjoy kitsch and aim to sometimes offset crystal bad taste with kitsch  thus marrying form and surface. At other times crystals can be gentle and extraordinarily delicate making them a fabulously versatile friend to have in the often difficult glaze department.
Key influences on Kate's work are the
natural world, fertility and the magic of growth
, which she refers to as the ""life force"". Positive symbolism, fun and humour are also key to her work.
Although most of Kate's pieces are based on
, such as fruit and vegetables, she cites fashion designers
as inspirations for the way she ""dresses up"" her pots.
Kate on the creative processes involved in ceramics:
I prepare my clay very soft. I use T Material which usually arrives pretty hard, so I slice up a bag, make rows of wells in each slice, fill those with water, wait a few days and then wedge.
I adore coiling. I think it is my favourite part of the whole of making ceramics ... except the anticipation and excitement of opening the kiln door. The slow process of the evolution of a form suits the way I work and think. When I have a concept for a pot I usually start a few pieces, making one of them follow my original idea, the others started are then free to change during the coiling of the form. It is these pieces that are so full of surprises and unsure excitement.
I roll coils using both hands. I concentrate by closing my eyes and feeling the coil and reacting to it through touch alone. When I meet students who admit to not being able to roll a prefect coil I tell them to do it blindfold and get good reports back. You can not really see anything below your hands so you do really have to rely on touch alone to roll a coil. I adore rolling perfect soft long coils.
The artist on the subject of glazes:
I mix [glaze] very thick. I apply using a variety of brushes. I try to create forms that will work with the fluidity of the glaze, create pools for crystals to grow in, and shoulders and round rims and gulleys and valleys for them to slide off and show their trail of movement.
I often use three to six different glazes on one surface and blob and layer them together in a series of patches. These overlap in areas and create other effects. I keep a record of the order in which I apply the different recipes as effects change if the order changes.

3087,"All products have a limited life both for the consumer and the producer.
This Revision Bite will help you understand what the product life-cycle is and why it is important in marketing.
When we buy a product we need to know how long it will last. Perishable goods, like fruit and vegetables, have a short lifespan. Durables like a car have a longer lifespan. Different products last for different lengths of time but their life-cycles have elements in common and follow this curve:
The product is tested and developed before it is launched. Initial sales will be low until the consumer starts buying. At this point, production costs are much higher than the revenue from sales.
As sales increase production becomes more profitable. The early development costs can be recovered. The success of the product can lead to
Choosing and continuing to buy your favourite brand.
Customers returning to buy from the same business.

As new models and designs come out, or fashions change, a product may become
A product that is outdated or one which has been replaced by another.
. Sales fall, as does revenue. It is no longer profitable to produce it.
Applying the product life cycle to the marketing mix
Marketing teams watch for changes in the business environment and react to them. They respond to consumer needs, the actions of competitors or government and use the following strategies during each stage of the product life cycle.
To make the target market aware of the new product it is important to heavily
use advertising and publicity to increase the sales of a product
This is usually a one-off price which is used as a promotionary tactic to gain customers attention and so to increase sales. Later the price will rise.
As sales and profitability increase, the selling price may be reduced to make the product more attractive. Continued advertising around the brand name will help to sustain sales. The marketing team may consider expanding its distribution, to reach more consumers.
Competitors will usually have entered the market at this stage. If their products are as good but cheaper the company may lose some of its market share. The pricing strategy must be reviewed. Marketers may also put
onto their product, by offering accessories or insurance, for example.
Marketing cannot save a product at this stage, but targeting a different and smaller segment can prolong its life.
Hard PC, a computer engineering company, has developed a new processor that is ten times more powerful than existing ones. Their product has sold very well, but is now passing from its growth stage into its maturity stage. Competitors have already entered the market. As a member of their marketing team, suggest two promotional activities Hard PC might use. Give your reasons.
When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page.
Most exam questions in this subject are based on a case study that provides a setting for business theory. Look carefully at your case study to see what information is given about the product life-cycle. Think about the different stages and the marketing strategies that can be used.
We need to promote our product. I would suggest that we offer free accessories to increase sales. We could also try advertising our new promotion.
Jill's answer shows the right kind of promotional activities for this situation but not the reasons for them. This kind of promotion would not necessarily be used to 'increase sales'. She has also only given one reason. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade.
There is a lot of competition so we need to promote our product. I would suggest that we offer free accessories. This would make our product more attractive than our competitors' products. We could also try advertising to remind consumers about our brand and the new promotion we have on offer. This might encourage more sales.
Luke's answer showed he understood the subject, and his reasons were good. He could have been more thorough, and used business terms. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade.
The market will soon reach saturation point because of competition. We therefore need to promote our product to lengthen its life. I would suggest that we try to add value to our product by offering free accessories. This is because we want consumers to find our product more attractive than our competitors' products. We could also try advertising to remind consumers about the existence of our brand and the new promotion we will have on offer. We may already have developed some brand loyalty amongst our customers so this might encourage repeat sales.
Tess's answer was very detailed, and she was able to apply her knowledge of business to the case study. She was able to use the correct terms, like saturation point, add value, brand loyalty. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.

Originating in Vienna, during the 19th Century the waltz became popular all over Europe. A father and son, both called Johann Strauss, composed a huge number of waltzes. Johann Strauss(the son) was called The Waltz King.
The Waltz always has three beats in the bar and has a bass note on the first beat. Waltzes can be identified by the 'um cha cha, um cha cha' that forms the backbone of the music.
They commonly feature a low pitched accompaniment and a higher series of elegant melodies.
The speed of the waltz is usually fairly quick and lively.
Waltzes usually contain a string of seven or eight different melodies with an introduction and a coda (ending passage).
Waltzes were written for string orchestras, full orchestras including woodwind and brass, and for solo instruments such as the piano or guitar.
The Polka originally came from the area around Czechoslovakia and was a craze in the 1840s. Everyone was dancing the Polka and so it spread around Europe like an epidemic.
The Polka is a very quick dance with 2 beats in the bar.
Like the waltz, polkas were written for any combination of instruments. This one is played by a brass ensemble:

For example, iron ore is used to make iron and steel. Copper is easily extracted, but ores rich in copper are becoming more difficult to find. Aluminium and titanium are metals with useful properties, but they are expensive to extract. Most everyday metals are mixtures called alloys.

Thus the method of extraction of a metal from its ore depends on the metal's position in the reactivity series:

Pip is both the hero and narrator of the story, looking back reflectively on the lessons life has taught him. He is critical of the mistakes made by his younger self.
Dickens starts with Pip weeping for his dead family in the churchyard, establishing him as an orphan for whom we feel sorry and protective.
Pip is a good person. He steals a file and food for the convict, but feels guilty about it. He helps Herbert Pocket to get a job. He helps Magwitch, even though it means the end of his dreams of being a gentleman.
Pip's efforts to be a gentleman almost destroy him - he says horrible things to Biddy and is ashamed of Joe. But he maintains our sympathy because he hates himself for it.
Pip's 'training' to be a gentleman was merely learning to eat properly and wear the 'right' clothes - showing that at the time he mistakenly thought that being a 'gentleman' was about surface wealth and manners (when really it was about inner character and worth).
Two things 'save' Pip. Firstly, luck dashes his dreams. Secondly, those who love him stick by him.
In the end, Pip finds happiness in hard work, 'sufficient' income, and doing the decent thing. Pip is an autobiographical projection of Dickens himself. By 1860, Dickens' marriage had failed, and he had worries about his children, and his business. In
he tells us the conclusions of an older, wiser man with experience of setbacks - that happiness is not about being successful, but being good.
In the novel, Magwitch is a father-figure to Pip. (Remember that Dickens' own father was imprisoned.)
Although Magwitch is a convict and 'a fearful man', he is decent enough to take the blame for Pip's theft (which in those days was a hanging offence). This reflects the novel's theme that a real gentleman is not someone who has money and manners, but someone who does good.
In the churchyard where Pip begins his recollections, Magwitch - also an orphan - is first made 'aware of himself' stealing food. It is suggested to us that his poor start in life condemned him to a life as a criminal.
Because Magwitch is a criminal, Pip feels he cannot keep his money, so Magwitch's return means the end of Pip's fortune.
Although he is horrified to meet him at first, Pip comes to love Magwitch as a good and noble man. In the end, he brings the dying Magwitch happiness by telling him Estella is his daughter and that he (Pip) loves her.
Magwitch's story carries the social message of
: that poverty creates crime, and many criminals are decent people who are just unlucky.
is as much Magwitch's story as it is Pip's.
Miss Havisham is a mother-figure to Pip, but taunts and abuses him. (Remember that Dickens disliked his own mother.)
Miss Havisham is a purposefully 'unreal' character. Time has stood still for her: she wears fantastic clothing and looks like a waxwork. Many writers describe
as a 'fairy story', in which Miss Havisham plays the part of Pip's imperfect fairy god-mother.
Miss Havisham also supplies the 'silver fork' element of the novel - stories about rich people that fascinated the poor.
Miss Havisham is a connecting thread for the storyline:
She was swindled by Compeyson, which condemned his partner, Magwitch, to jail.
She adopted Magwitch's daughter, Estella, but encouraged her to break Pip's heart.
Her employment of Pip gives him his yearning to be a gentleman. But she pays for Pip to be apprenticed to a blacksmith, which is the cause of his dissatisfaction.
It is at Satis House that Pip first meets Jaggers, and it is this which leads him to guess, wrongly, that Miss Havisham is his secret
Someone that helps or supports a person or group, usually by offering financial aid.
In Chapter 38, Estella rejects not only Pip's love but also Miss Havisham's, and breaks both of their hearts.
At the end of the novel, Miss Havisham sees she has hurt Pip because she was hurt, and seeks his forgiveness.
In the end, Miss Havisham is consumed by fire (a Christian image of cleansing, as well as punishment).
Although she harms Pip, the reader forgives her because she is clearly psychologically damaged, repents of her actions and dies such a horrific death.
Her name means 'star' - which is associated with beauty and love, yet at the same time is cold, distant and unobtainable. Pip, in his desire to be a gentleman, is 'reaching for the stars', but doomed to fall short.
Perhaps Dickens associated Estella with his teenage, starlet lover Ellen Ternan (the 'ell' of Ellen is picked up in the name Estella). Did this give special vibrancy to his descriptions of Pip's yearning love?
Estella is beautiful and rich, but these are her only qualities. She is otherwise shallow and cruel.
Biddy is the opposite to Estella, who represents the shallowness of money and manners.
tells of how Pip is at first beguiled into wanting Estella, but discovers that Biddy is better.
The reader can forgive Estella because, like Miss Havisham (who trained her to hate men), she too is psychologically damaged. Also, she warns Pip from the start that she has a cold heart and will never love him. Pip's
In the final chapter, after Estella's unhappy marriage to the brutal Bentley Drummle, she tells Pip she has learned good character: ""I have been bent and broken but - I hope - into a better shape.""
On the advice of friends, and to make the book more popular, Dickens rewrote the ending to read: ""'I saw no shadow of another parting from her"" - allowing Pip and Estella to stay together.
Orlick is the irredeemably evil element in
- giving it a Gothic atmosphere of threat and foreboding.
Orlick's favourite phrases are: ""I'll be burned"" and ""I'll be jiggered (meaning 'caught on a sharp hook')"" - conjuring up violent and frightening images.
After Joe (who represents pure good) defeats Orlick in a fair fight, Orlick later creeps back and attacks Mrs Joe from behind (a cowardly and brutal act).
Orlick earns Pip's disgust when he 'dances at' (that is, makes eyes at) Biddy, which frightens her.
Throughout the story, Orlick resents and bullies Pip.

is cold, ruthless and unfeeling. He washes his hands continually (like Pilate in the Bible) to try to cleanse himself of the bad things he is doing. Dickens' portrayal of Jaggers shows he saw being a lawyer as a dirty business.

1042,"The story is set by a large US lake, by an old mill town. The first three paragraphs of the story describe first how Hortons Bay used to be a bustling mill town, turning timber into planks. Then the supplies of timber dried up, the mill stopped work, and gradually the town faded away. Nick and Marjorie are fishing by the old mill ten years later, which is the closest we get to a specific date.
It is never made explicit how the setting links to events in the Nick and Marjorie story. But both deal with endings and loss of some kind.
The description of the setting takes up about a fifth of the whole novel, which suggests it is important. What do you think it mirrors in the break up of the human relationship? Look at:
The way everything that can be got out of the mill is taken away - can you link this to how Nick feels about his relationship with Marjorie?
""there was nothing of the mill left except the broken white limestone of its foundations"" - what state is their relationship in at this stage? Do they both know it?
Nick and Marjorie react to the mill differently: she makes it romantic 'like a castle'; he can barely remember when it was a mill. How is Hemingway using this to show their different feelings?

In the first 20 years of the 20th century, British society underwent profound changes.
There was growing awareness that more would have to be done to protect the weakest and poorest members of society.
A series of laws was passed which attempted to deal with the problem of poverty. The foundations of what became known as the 'welfare state' were laid.
An Act of 1918 gave many women over the age of 30 the vote. Finally, women could play a full part in national political life.
[Meanwhile,] it was the trade unions who did the most to bring a new political party for the workers into existence [and] help Labour candidates to stand in Parliamentary elections.

7340,"is often described as a novel of 'manners'. Put simply, it's about how people interact, and how the feelings you show in public can often be very different to your true feelings.
Jane Austen originally called the novel '
'. This is because the two main characters, Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, form very strong opinions of each other based on their first impressions, and these affect the way they act.
The Bennet family (Mr and Mrs Bennet and their five daughters: Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia) live in Longbourn, Hertfordshire. They discuss the expected arrival of Charles Bingley, a rich young man who'll soon be living at a nearby estate called Netherfield. Mrs Bennet wants her husband to go to meet him, as he might make a good husband for one of her daughters. Marrying them off is her main concern in life.
Mr Bennet visits Bingley, but doesn't let his wife know and teases her about it. She becomes annoyed, before being pleased when he reveals he's spoken to him.
Bingley brings some friends from London to attend a ball at his house. Fitzwilliam Darcy is a close friend and impressive figure, especially as he's even wealthier than Bingley. Darcy will only dance with Bingley's sisters (Mrs Hurst and Miss Bingley).
Bingley, who's been dancing with Jane Bennet, tries to get Darcy to dance with others, and points out Elizabeth. Darcy coldly and arrogantly rejects the idea, saying Elizabeth isn't good looking enough for him. She overhears this but laughs it off with her friends.
Elizabeth and Jane talk about the ball and the Bingleys. Jane likes everyone, but Elizabeth is suspicious of the Bingley sisters. Bingley likes his new neighbours - Darcy doesn't.
We meet the Lucas family. Elizabeth is close friends with the daughter, Charlotte. Mrs Bennet is still very happy about Bingley liking Jane, though still angry about Mr Darcy's rudeness.
The Bingley sisters are nice to Jane, but not genuine. Jane meanwhile doesn't want to show her true feelings for their brother. Charlotte thinks it will help if she does, but Elizabeth explains that she isn't like that.
The Lucases have a party and Sir William Lucas tries to get Darcy to dance with Elizabeth. Darcy is put on the spot and agrees, but Elizabeth coldly refuses. This surprises Darcy - and he becomes attracted to her.
We learn that the Bennets' property is '
', meaning that because there's no male child in the family it will be handed down to a distant relative on the event of Mr Bennet's death.
Lydia and Kitty have been socialising with soldiers in nearby Meryton. The Bingley sisters invite Jane to dinner. Mrs Bennet makes her go by horse, which means if it rains she'll have to stay overnight. Jane gets soaked, catches a bad cold and has to stay. A worried Elizabeth walks three miles to visit her. Darcy is impressed. Elizabeth agrees to stay with Jane.
Miss Caroline Bingley and Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy
Elizabeth can tell the Bingley sisters don't really care about Jane. When Elizabeth leaves the room, Miss Bingley criticises her. But Mr Bingley defends both Elizabeth and Jane.
Darcy briefly says the walk made Elizabeth's eyes look nice. However, he also says that because of her relatively lowly status she and her sisters will find it difficult to marry well.
Mrs Bennet visits Jane and makes obvious

s about her daughter and Bingley. A discussion about 'character' takes place, with Elizabeth explaining that she studies people. Darcy makes a point that she can't have much opportunity to do this in the country. Mrs Bennet loudly disagrees and embarrasses herself - and Elizabeth.
Elizabeth and Darcy engage in a heated discussion. He watches her closely as Miss Bingley plays the piano. Elizabeth thinks he's finding fault with her, but because she doesn't like him she doesn't care. He asks her to dance but she again refuses, thinking it's a trick. Miss Bingley (who likes Darcy) is becoming jealous of Elizabeth and makes comments about her and her family to try to put him off.
Miss Bingley tries to get Darcy's attention, although he isn't really bothered. She even walks around in front of him and, when this doesn't work, asks Elizabeth to join her. Darcy then becomes interested. He and Elizabeth engage in some more verbal sparring, and discuss each other's faults. She feels he hates everyone; he feels she deliberately misunderstands people.
Jane and Elizabeth return home, much to their mother's disappointment. Darcy is relieved, as he's starting to like Elizabeth more than he feels he should. He's also realised that Miss Bingley likes him, so resolves to put her off by not having much to do with her.
Mr Bennet tells his family to expect a visit from his cousin, Mr Collins - the relative who'll own the house after he passes away. Collins wrote him a
letter a month ago, mentioning a proposal. From his letter, Elizabeth believes he must be a strange man, and her father even hopes he will be. Collins arrives and acts very formally.
Collins gradually reveals himself to be a strange sort of social climber - very humble with regards to his patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, but full of himself. He's a ridiculous figure, although he tries to be nice.
Collins' character is developed further: he lacks common sense, and his education hasn't helped. He liked Jane at first, but switches to Elizabeth, which shows he lacks real feelings.
The girls walk to Meryton with Collins, and on the way they meet a soldier, George Wickham. Darcy and Bingley pass them and it's apparent that Darcy knows Wickham but they aren't friends.
Elizabeth meets Wickham at her aunt's house and he mentions Darcy, saying they were boyhood friends but Darcy cheated him out of a career in the Church. Elizabeth willingly believes the tale, especially as Wickham is attractive and well mannered. He confirms Darcy is a proud man. We also learn that Collins' patron, the very wealthy and upper-class Lady Catherine, is Darcy's aunt. She wants Darcy to marry her daughter.
Jane doesn't believe Wickham's story. She's invited to a Netherfield ball and asks Collins to go with her, not expecting him to agree. He does, and asks her for the first two dances; she wanted to dance with Wickham. Collins is interested in Elizabeth.
Wickham doesn't turn up and Elizabeth blames Darcy. She's annoyed further by Collins' poor dancing. Darcy asks her to dance and she is so surprised she agrees. But she's

against him, so mentions Wickham. Jane and Bingley are getting on well, but her family embarrass her in various ways.
Collins, encouraged by Mrs Bennet, proposes to Elizabeth. She refuses. Collins is surprised but not totally downcast, because he believes it's all part of the 'game'.
Mrs Bennet is angry with Elizabeth for refusing Collins, but Mr Bennet is pleased. Charlotte Lucas arrives and spends time with Collins.
Collins hardly speaks to Elizabeth, who then goes to Meryton, where she meets Wickham. He tells her he didn't go to the ball because of Darcy.
Jane receives a letter from Miss Bingley saying her family are moving away and not coming back, hinting that Bingley will marry Darcy's sister. Elizabeth believes these are Miss Bingley's wishes rather than her brother's, and tells Jane he loves her.
Collins proposes to Charlotte, who accepts, not out of love or even respect, but because he can look after her financially. Elizabeth is shocked.
Mrs Bennet is upset by the news. And we discover that Charlotte and Elizabeth aren't as close as they were. Meanwhile, Bingley's continued absence starts to worry Elizabeth.
Jane receives another letter from Miss Bingley that's similar to the last one. Jane's devastated, but still tries to be positive and speaks kindly of Bingley. Darcy's supposed treatment of Wickham is now widely known in the area; only Jane defends him.
The Gardiners visit the Bennets. Mr Gardiner is Mrs Bennet's brother. He's more sensible and intelligent, though. Mrs Gardiner is a friend to Jane and Elizabeth.
Mrs Gardiner tries to persuade Elizabeth not to fall in love with Wickham, as he has little money. Wickham turns his attention to Miss King, a wealthy heiress. Charlotte marries Collins. Jane, at Mrs Gardiner's invitation, goes to London, and sees Miss Bingley isn't really her friend.
Elizabeth sets out to visit Charlotte in Kent, and visits her aunt in London on the way. Her aunt criticises Wickham's behaviour with Miss King; Elizabeth defends him.
Elizabeth arrives at the Collins' home. He shows off, as if to make Elizabeth see what she missed out on. She just feels sorry for Charlotte. Miss de Bourgh passes by to deliver an invitation to dinner, but won't come in and is rude, making Charlotte stand out in the cold. Elizabeth notices Miss de Bourgh looks weak and thinks she'll make a good wife for Darcy.
They all dine at Rosings, the De Bourgh's residence. Lady Catherine is very arrogant and opinionated. However, Elizabeth, unlike others, isn't overawed. Lady Catherine is surprised at her independence.
Elizabeth discovers Lady Catherine rules the parish. Darcy arrives with his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam.
Colonel Fitzwilliam enjoys talking to Elizabeth, but Lady Catherine butts in to make herself the centre of attention again. Elizabeth sings and impresses. She criticises Darcy for not dancing at the first ball they went to. Although he defends himself, he's more polite than before, not that Elizabeth notices. He praises her singing. Elizabeth notices he isn't really bothered about Miss de Bourgh.

when Darcy calls. She asks him about Bingley. Darcy says only that he might not return. He then makes a bold statement, saying Elizabeth can't always have been at Longbourn, meaning he thinks she's better than her relatives and neighbours. Charlotte comes in and he goes quiet. Elizabeth and Charlotte try to understand Darcy's motives. The reader can see (though not Elizabeth) that Darcy is falling in love with her.
Elizabeth keeps 'bumping into' Darcy. Fitzwilliam, although attracted to Elizabeth, tells her he must marry into money. He also says that Darcy recently saved someone from an unwise marriage. Elizabeth believes he means Bingley and Jane. Elizabeth becomes upset when alone. She hates Darcy for ruining her sister's hopes, which she feels is all because of his sense of pride.
Elizabeth is on her own and reads sad letters from Jane, which make her even more angry and upset. Darcy comes in and seems nervous. He says he's struggled against his feelings but can't help himself - he loves her. He expects to be accepted and goes further, saying he's had to overcome the thought of her socially
family. Elizabeth replies harshly, and doesn't even thank him. Enraged, he asks what he's done to deserve such harshness. She blames him for Jane's unhappiness and Wickham's poverty. They argue in a heated but formal way, then he leaves.
Darcy takes a letter to Elizabeth. He explains he didn't think Jane loved Bingley, and again mentions the embarrassing relatives - not including Jane or Elizabeth. He apologises. As for Wickham, he'd asked Darcy for money instead of going into the Church and Darcy had given him it. When he'd spent it all, he came back to ask for the Church job and Darcy had refused, as he knew Wickham was immoral. Also, last summer, Wickham had tried to run off with Darcy's sister, Georgiana, who was only 15. He signs off
After reading the letter several times, Elizabeth realises she's been prejudiced against Darcy. She feels ashamed.
Elizabeth thinks more favourably of Darcy, but less so of her family, whom she starts to resent for their behaviour.
Elizabeth leaves Charlotte, and feels sorry for her. Elizabeth meets Jane again in London.
Elizabeth and Jane return to Longbourn to news that Wickham's regiment is moving to Brighton. Lydia behaves in a foolish manner, and even suggests going to Brighton.
Elizabeth tells Jane about Darcy's proposal and the truth about Wickham. As he's leaving anyway, they decide not to tell anyone. Jane still misses Bingley.
Mrs Bennet and the younger daughters want to go to Brighton, but Mr Bennet says 'no'. Lydia is invited by a friend. Mr Bennet allows it, saying no one will be interested in her because she has no money. Elizabeth pleads for the family to be seen with dignity. She sees Wickham and tells him she now appreciates Darcy more after seeing him recently. Wickham says Darcy is still proud.
We find out about the Bennets' own marriage. Mr Bennet fell for his wife's looks, although his feelings for her soon wore off after marriage. This, along with the Collins marriage, teaches Elizabeth a lesson.
She was going to the Lake District with the Gardiners, but the plans change and they only go as far north as Derbyshire. Mrs Gardiner suggests a visit to Darcy's estate, Pemberley, and Elizabeth agrees, as Darcy is away.
Lyme Park in Cheshire, the setting for Pemberley
The housekeeper shows them around Pemberley. Elizabeth thinks how nice it would've been to live there. Then again, her family wouldn't have been allowed to visit, due to Darcy's pride.
The housekeeper praises Darcy in every regard, saying how kind and generous he is to everyone, even servants, although he's naturally quiet. This makes Elizabeth feel even more warmly towards him. On leaving, they meet Darcy and the atmosphere is very uneasy. He's very polite and Elizabeth is affected by this. Darcy meets them in the park later and is very gracious. He invites Elizabeth to meet his sister.
Georgiana Darcy is shy. Bingley appears. Elizabeth sees that Miss Bingley was lying when she said her brother was in love with Darcy's sister. She sees that Bingley regrets leaving Netherfield. Darcy's kindness extends to inviting Elizabeth's family to Pemberley. Elizabeth feels grateful that Darcy doesn't resent her.
Mrs Gardiner and Elizabeth visit Georgiana. Things are awkward because she's very quiet. The Bingley sisters are there, and rude. Miss Bingley jealously tries to stop any relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy by mentioning Wickham. She doesn't know about Wickham and Georgiana; Darcy and his sister are embarrassed. When Elizabeth leaves, Miss Bingley criticises her, but Darcy says he thinks the opposite.
Elizabeth receives letters from Jane telling her Wickham has ran away with Lydia, and Mr Bennet is going to London to look for them. Elizabeth is very upset and tells Darcy she should have realised Wickham was bad. Darcy is silent; Elizabeth believes he now thinks less of her. Elizabeth and the Gardiners set off home.
The Gardiners try to persuade Elizabeth that Wickham might intend to marry Lydia. Elizabeth knows this isn't the case and tells them the truth about him. Elizabeth arrives home to find her mother depressed, and reads a letter Lydia has written to Mrs Forster that simply reflects how foolish she is.
Everyone now has a bad opinion of Wickham. Collins writes and says it would have been better if Lydia had died, adding that the girls' marriage prospects were now poor. We learn that Wickham owes a lot of money in Brighton. Mr Bennet returns, but his wife stupidly wants him to fight Wickham.
Mr Gardiner reports that Wickham and Lydia have been found unmarried, but a marriage settlement has been agreed. Elizabeth and her father realise Wickham has been offered a lot of money. They believe it must have been Mr Gardiner. Mrs Bennet's mood changes instantly and she believes it to be a good marriage. Elizabeth is completely fed up with her mother's stupidity.
Elizabeth believes Darcy wouldn't want to marry a Bennet because Wickham has. Wickham is to be sent to another regiment in the north of England.
Lydia and Wickham visit Longbourn; neither are sorry. Lydia is completely unaware of how much trouble she's caused everyone. She even says to Jane that she's now below her in status, as Lydia is married. Elizabeth is furious and knows Wickham has only married Lydia for money.
In telling all about her wedding day, Lydia lets it slip that Darcy was present (this was supposed to be a secret). Elizabeth writes to Mrs Gardiner asking about Darcy and the wedding.
Mrs Gardiner explains Darcy's involvement. Darcy found Wickham and arranged to pay his debts and give him cash if he married Lydia. Lydia had refused to leave Wickham. Darcy and Mr Gardiner arranged the wedding. Darcy said he did it because it was his fault for not exposing Wickham earlier. Mrs Gardiner says he did it for Elizabeth.
Elizabeth is overcome by the news, but still can't be sure if Darcy did this for her. She feels worse about how she treated him in the past. Elizabeth and Wickham have a conversation and he realises she knows all about him.
Mrs Bennet is sorry to see Lydia leave. She cheers up when she hears Bingley is returning.
Bingley and Darcy visit the Bennets. Jane and Elizabeth are uncomfortable. Darcy is mainly silent and avoids eye contact. Elizabeth is ashamed of her mother, and again letdown by her stupidity when she talks and talks about Lydia's marriage. Bingley accepts an invitation to dine at Longbourn.
At dinner, Bingley sits by Jane and they renew their friendship. Darcy sits far from Elizabeth. Instead, he sits next to her mother, who can't hide her dislike of him.
Jane Bennet and Bingley leaving Longbourn in a horse-drawn carriage after their wedding
Mrs Bennet is very obvious when trying to arrange for Jane and Bingley to be alone. Darcy has gone to London; Bingley goes shooting with Mr Bennet. Elizabeth mistakenly interrupts an intimate moment between Bingley and Jane. Bingley goes to get permission to marry Jane from her father. Mrs Bennet then spreads the good news.
Lady Catherine astonishes the Bennets by visiting them and speaks to Elizabeth alone. She accuses Elizabeth of spreading rumours that her nephew, Darcy, is to marry her (Elizabeth). Elizabeth doesn't reply. Lady Catherine then informs her Darcy is engaged to her own daughter, because this has been the family plan for years. Elizabeth tells her it's up to individuals to make their own choices.
Lady Catherine makes it clear Elizabeth is a social nobody and orders her not to get engaged to Darcy. Elizabeth refuses, and says her life has nothing to do with her. Lady Catherine leaves in a foul temper.
Elizabeth is unsettled by the argument and believes Lady Catherine will persuade Darcy not to marry her. Mr Bennet reads her a letter he's received from Mr Collins, congratulating him on his daughter's proposed marriage to Darcy but trying to persuade him against agreeing, as Lady Catherine would be displeased. Mr Bennet laughs at the ridiculous idea of the marriage. Elizabeth joins in, but is hurt inside.
Darcy and Bingley again visit Longbourn and go for a walk with Elizabeth, Jane and Kitty. Elizabeth is left alone with Darcy and thanks him for all his efforts with Lydia and Wickham. He says it was meant to be a secret and that he did it for her. He says his feelings and wishes are still the same. Elizabeth says her feelings have changed, and that she accepts his proposal. Both apologise for their past behaviour. Darcy admits he was proud, but says Elizabeth changed him. Elizabeth says she changed after reading his letter. Darcy admits he persuaded Bingley to see Jane again.
As Mrs Bennet wants Jane and Bingley to be alone, she sends Elizabeth out to walk with Darcy, apologising for doing so. In the evening, Darcy goes to get permission for the marriage from Mr Bennet. Mr Bennet talks with Elizabeth as, not knowing the truth, he still believes Darcy to be proud. His daughter soon clears things up. Of course, Mrs Bennet's opinion of Darcy changes immediately when she finds out he wants to marry Elizabeth.
Darcy explains the reasons for his love for Elizabeth and says he was quiet earlier because he didn't know how to deal with his strong feelings. Lady Catherine's actions simply encouraged him to ask again.
Bingley and Jane leave Netherfield after a year and move to live 30 miles from Pemberley. Lydia receives money from Elizabeth; Darcy helps Wickham in his career. Georgiana grows close to her sister-in-law. Mr Bennet and the Gardiners visit Pemberley often, and even Lady Catherine goes there too.

In what kind of environment will the events take place? You need to use words to

Will your story be set in the present, past or the future? While this affects the tense that you write in, it could also help to create atmosphere and drama and add to your setting. If your story is set in the distant past you might have to do lots of
to make the details (like your characters' clothing) convincing.
What kind of a person or group of people will be the main focus of your story? What makes your characters interesting? Get to know them by thinking about their
. What makes them sad, happy, angry or scared? Think about how they dress and why. Do they have any strange habits? Will your story require your character to have a friend or sidekick to help them in their adventure, or an enemy or villain to thwart them? Perhaps you want your main character to fall in love!
A problem that the main character or hero must overcome gives drive to your story. This could also be a central question that is answered as the story unfolds. Think about the possibilities of what might happen to your characters in this setting that means they have to
. For example, if your character faces a difficult or dangerous situation the reader will be
about what happens to him or her in the end.
Beware - the worst stories are the ones where the reader can guess the ending before having read very far! To keep your reader curious, the main character must go about solving this problem in an unexpected way. You might want to add a
to your story which will make your reader think about the characters or setting in a different light.
The point in your story at which the problem can no longer be avoided is called the climax. Through danger, tension, excitement, or all three, your reader should be on the edge of their seat, unable to put down your story until they reach the climax. If you were on a roller coaster ride, the highest part of it would be the climax. Your story might be similar to riding the big dipper!
The reader needs to feel a sense of satisfaction and
when they reach the end of your story (this is when they get off the roller coaster). Does your main character finally reach safety? Does he or she slay the villain and go home to a heros welcome?

Sample question: How does Shelley create sympathy for the Monster?
Remember, you are advised to spend 45 minutes on this part of the paper, so divide your time up like this:
Sample question: How does Shelley create sympathy for the Monster?
Most people who have not read the novel believe the Monster is evil, committing numerous crimes against humanity. However, Shelley (
Use of authors name shows awareness of the writer at work.
) carefully makes the reader aware that the Monster can in part be excused for these crimes, and is at heart a decent, kind and good creature. Sympathy is created through its speech, its actions, and the mistreatment it suffers. Shelley ultimately shows how the Monster should be pitied, rather than criticised. (
The introduction addresses key words in the question, and suggests ways that sympathy is created.
We first see the Monster through the eyes of Robert Walton, who describes it as being ""of gigantic stature"". (
Evidence of knowledge of the whole text, and useful quotation embedded within a sentence.
) This could arouse alarm rather than sympathy, and this alarm is reinforced when it is described in detail in chapter 5. Here, we find Victor call his creation a ""catastrophe"", ""wretch"" and ""miserable monster"" (
More textual evidence and indicating an alternative viewpoint  something that impresses examiners.
). The Monster is hideous to look at and Victor feels he must run away to escape its clutches. All of this seems to indicate that it is, in fact, a true monster, something to be feared and capable of great harm. But Shelley is only allowing us to see it from Victor's biased point of view. When we hear the Monster's story, a very different impression is created. (
The paragraph ends by rejecting alternative viewpoint and indicating a shift to how sympathy is created.
It first speaks in Chapter 10, after Victor has called it ""Devil"" and threatened to kill it. Instead of reacting with similar venom, the Monster states simply: ""I expected this reception."" This is because it has grown used to man showing hatred towards it. Yet its calm acceptance of the fact begins to gain the audience's sympathy. This continues when you look at its language. Shelley gives the Monster a very powerful, persuasive speaking voice. It is highly articulate and shows obvious intelligence.
This is demonstrated in the following quotation:
""You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If you comply I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.""
Here it rightly criticises its maker for threatening death, when he should actually be looking after his 'offspring'. The Monster offers a reasonable argument that if Victor does his duty it will not commit anymore crimes. The vocabulary is very sophisticated (""glut"", ""satiated"") with almost poetic, if chilling, imagery (""the maw [stomach] of death""). The use of a variety of sentence types, punctuation and rhetorical devices reveals an educated being. The fact that the Monster is self-taught also gains our sympathy. (
Detailed analysis of language use, focused on the question, and following the Point, Evidence, Explanation structure for essay writing.
Shelley was very aware of the need for good parenting, since she was brought up by her father alone - her mother died in childbirth. (
) Victor chose to desert his parental duties, a fact the Monster is very quick to point out, meaning he is at least partly responsible for the Monster's actions. Furthermore, we feel sympathy for the Monster because of Victor's continued insults towards his creation (""abhorred devil detested form"") and his later destruction of the Monster's half-built wife before its very eyes.
The Monster begins life without an evil thought in its head. Despite the hardships it suffers - being attacked by townspeople, enduring severe cold and hunger, and being burnt when first encountering fire - it never gives up hope of a better life. Of course, these very hardships create great sympathy, as does its appreciation of beauty, nature, music, and the loving relationships it sees at the De Laceys.
It commits many acts of kindness, especially for the De Laceys, whom it loves. When Felix later beats it, thinking his father's life is in danger, the Monster is moved to tears of anguish and rage. After being forced out of its hovel through no fault of its own, it then rescues a peasant girl from drowning. Its reward for this utterly selfless and kind act is being shot. (
Numerous examples given of how sympathy is created.
) Shelley tells us that only after this do the Monster's ""feelings of kindness give place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth"". Most readers would have sympathy with this, given what the Monster has suffered. (
The paragraph ends by reinforcing the idea of sympathy, using more textual evidence, and by referring to the authors name again.
Although the Monster goes on to commit some terrible crimes, Shelley often gives some justification for them - justification that leads to a feeling of sympathy. (
Acknowledgement that the Monster has an evil side, turned into a point about sympathy being produced.
) Elizabeth is only murdered in revenge for Victor destroying the Monster's hope of future happiness, in the form of the second creature. The Monster knew it could never be loved by a human, only by one of its own kind, so it takes away Victor's hopes of future happiness in return.
The murder of William at first also seemed inexcusable. Yet when we learn that he had insulted the Monster using the same abusive language as his older brother (""hideous monster""), perhaps there is some sympathy for its response.
At the end of the novel, (
A phrase that suggests final evidence is about to be used and introduces the conclusion of essay.
) despite being abandoned and mistreated by its creator, the Monster still feels compelled to grieve over Victor's dead body. This moment of dignified reflection and regretting of misdeeds lends more sympathy to the Monster.
Its final act is to commit suicide in ""the agonies of torturing flames"" rather than live without a father, companion and, worse still, hope of future happiness. This sacrifice is the final means Shelley uses to gain pity for the creature, reinforced by the fact that it is never even granted a name. (
The essay concludes with a further two ways that show how Shelley creates sympathy, focusing on the novel's end and making a final reference to Shelley by name. It's also a short, clear sentence that leaves the reader in no doubt that the question has been fully answered.

We see what happens when a man, Iago, is passed over for promotion. He is determined to get revenge and starts to manipulate everyone around him. Iago's general, Othello, is tortured by jealousy and one small item, a missing handkerchief, leads to distrust, broken friendships, murder and suicide.
The play's themes also seem very up to date - they cover all sorts of things, like the role of women, love, jealousy, ambition and betrayal. However, perhaps the most challenging theme from the play is race - Othello is black and has married a white woman. There are lots of references to this and Shakespeare shows how complex the situation was even in his lifetime.

Alcohol has short-term effects such as sleepiness and impaired judgment, balance and muscle control. This leads to blurred vision and slurred speech. Vasodilation occurs - blood vessels in the skin carry more blood - leading to heat loss.

The poem describes perch apparently 'perching' in the river, just as they did when Heaney was a boy. They seem to stay still and are apparently unchanging, in contrast to the fast-moving world.
The poem consists of one long sentence, formed of ten lines divided into five
Pairs of lines of poetry that rhyme and have the same length and metric pattern.
. The single sentence encourages us to 'flow' swiftly through the poem, perhaps reminding us of the flow of the water.
Think about how the language the poet uses helps to convey his ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title plays on the many meanings of the word
and so does not immediately make clear what the poem is going to be about. A perch can be the branch on which a bird rests, or (more colloquially) a place to rest - or a fish.
The river appears to be very beautiful - the water is
(line 1) and tree-lined, and Heaney refers to its
in line 4 (a body or solid mass of water - but with suggestions also of a human body, 'glorified' by the dappling sunlight).
The fish are the same today as they were when Heaney was a child -
(line 4). Seeing the fish triggers off memories of childhood and makes him think about everything that changes in the world.
We see things not just through the poet's eyes, but through the fishes' own eyes too:
(line 6) is how they see the surface of the river.
The poem ends by describing the perch
""on hold / In the everything flows and steady go of the world.""
against the changing world that flows around them. To Heaney the perch seem to represent things that resist change: they stay still in the water and they are still the same as they were when he was a child. Do you think he is reassured by their apparent permanence?

He uses a military metaphor - the perch are

The strength of the fish is emphasised again in

""In the finland of perch, the fenland of alder""

Well, the poem celebrates both these things - fluidity
stillness. So either or even (if possible) both these tones of voice would be appropriate!
An important idea in this poem (apart from the detailed, powerful description of the perch in the river) is the relationship between permanence and change. Heaney uses the flowing river-water and the stationary fish as a

to the starker language he uses elsewhere in the poem, which suggests his love of the river - perhaps even a religious attitude towards it.
Heaney seems fond of the perch. Although he recognises their strength, he also describes them with gentle humour. Adoze suggests they are sleeping as they swim, while Guzzling is an affectionate word, sometimes used to describe babies drinking.
on hold / In the everything goes and steady go of the world
The world is described in terms of water, flowing on. This suggests that Heaney sees things as always moving and changing. The fish are 'on hold', but they are not fighting the current so much as drinking it, letting it pass through and around them. Perhaps Heaney is suggesting that this is the only kind of permanence that is possible or desirable...

In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other. The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas, and attitudes and tone
Compare Perch with one other post-1914 poem and two pre-1914 poems of your choice that focus on creatures (animals, birds and fish) in the wild. What is the poet's attitude in each poem?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Gillian Clark's Field Mouse, John Clare's Sonnet, and Alfred Tennyson's The Eagle.
What would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing Perch with each of these three poems.
The title of each poem shows the importance of the Field Mouse and the Perch: as we read, we realise that each is a symbol.
The field mouse is a symbol of all things vulnerable to outside attack, while the perch are a symbol of the few things that remain unchanged in today's world.
Clarke emphasises how weak the field mouse is in contrast to man, but Heaney sees the fish as independent and unaffected by man.
So, Field Mouse has a threatening tone, whereas Perch has a lighter, warmer tone.
Both poems celebrate a favourite waterside scene containing trees and wildlife. Clare writes entirely from his point of view, but Heaney manages to show things from his perspective and the perspective of the perch.
Both are written in rhyming couplets. Clare uses no punctuation at all and Heaney uses punctuation sparingly so as not to interrupt the flow of the poem.
The scene in Sonnet is very relaxed, with gentle descriptions of the Moor Hen and insects that sport, but Heaney suggests the strength of the perch too, all muscle and slur.
Again, the title shows the focus of the poems. Tennyson is more precise: he is writing about The Eagle, rather than Perch in general.
Both poets show us the creature's point of view. The Eagle, from his high crag, sees the wrinkled sea beneath him, while the perch see the water-roof above them.
Both creatures are utterly at home in their sphere. This is shown humorously by Heaney - carpets of Bann stream - and majestically by Tennyson - Ring'd with the azure world, he stands.
Both show the power of the creature: Heaney uses military imagery, bluntly holding the pass, while for Tennyson the eagle is like a thunderbolt.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

5266,"A lot of everyday items are made from polymers. Many of these polymers are not biodegradable - microbes cannot digest them and they take a long time to break down. Polymers are usually disposed of by burying them in landfill sites or burning them in incinerators. These methods of disposal cause environmental problems, and waste valuable resources.
The properties of polymers depend on the structure and bonding found in their molecules. Smart materials such as Gore-Tex have more useful properties than other polymers.
Polymers are large molecules formed from many identical smaller molecules (monomers).
. Addition polymers are formed from alkenes. For example:
ethene can polymerise to form polyethene, which is also called polythene
a typical use of polythene is for a plastic shopping bag or plastic bottle
a typical use of polystyrene is for insulation and protective packaging
Some polymers are not made from alkene monomers. These are called condensation polymers. Nylon and polyesters are like this. They can be drawn into very fine fibres and woven into cloth for clothing. Often, natural fibres such as cotton are mixed with nylon or polyester fibres to make a soft but hard-wearing cloth.
One of the useful properties of polymers is that they are unreactive, so they are suitable for storing food and chemicals safely. Unfortunately, this property makes it difficult to dispose of polymers. They are often buried in landfill sites or incinerated - burned.
Waste polymers are disposed of in landfill sites. This uses up valuable land, and suitable sites often fill up quickly.
Polymers release a lot of heat energy when they burn. This energy can be used to heat homes or generate electricity. But there are problems with incineration. Carbon dioxide is produced, which adds to global warming. Toxic gases are also produced, unless the polymers are incinerated at high temperatures.
Polymers have recycling symbols like this one for PVC to show what they are
Many polymers can be recycled. This reduces disposal problems and the amount of crude oil used. But first the different polymers must be separated from each other. This can be difficult and expensive.
Most polymers, including poly(ethene) and poly(propene), are not biodegradable. This means microorganisms cannot break them down, so they may last for many years in rubbish dumps. However, it is possible to include chemicals that cause the polymer to break down more quickly. Carrier bags and refuse bags made from degradable polymers are already available.
Nylon has some desirable properties. It does not let ultraviolet light pass through it, and it is:
Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.
Gore-Tex has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.
Teflon is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.
Gore-Tex fabric is a sandwich of materials
Structure and properties of polymers - higher
Strong covalent bonds join atoms to each other in individual polymer molecules. Weak intermolecular forces attract polymer molecules towards each other. The properties of solid materials like polymers depend on:
the strength of the forces between these molecules
A polymer will melt when the intermolecular forces are overcome. The stronger the forces, the more energy is needed to break them, and the higher the materials melting point.
Many polymers, such as poly(ethene), contain long molecules that lie side by side. These can uncoil and slide past each other, making the material flexible. Long polymer chains have stronger forces of attraction than shorter ones: they make stronger materials.
Cross-linking is where the polymer chains are chemically joined together in places, by covalent bonds. The polymer molecules cannot slide over each other so easily. This makes materials tougher and less flexible, and they cannot be easily stretched. Cross-linking also gives materials high melting points.
Vulcanised rubber has cross-links. Its polymer molecules are cross-linked by sulfur atoms. It is tough but flexible, and used for making tyres.

to pay any short-term debts when they fall due. They plan a budget that:
sets performance targets over a certain time period
Costs the firm has to make ie its spending.
The firm's accountants monitor and record the actual financial performance of the firm against the budget, so that its likely financial performance can be forecast. When the two are compared there will usually be a difference. Adjustments will be made for the next budget or forecast.
Now look at both in detail and try to remember three ways of raising finance from each source.
The board of a public limited company may retain profits for a year rather than share it amongst the owners. The cash can be invested to earn interest.
Assets that are no longer required, like an outdated computer or an obsolete piece of machinery, can be sold.
Stock levels can be reduced and funds made available for other uses.
A sole trader or a small business may be able to borrow money from family or friends without paying interest.
Loans from a bank or a building society can be expensive. An agreed amount is borrowed and repaid over a fixed period of time with interest.
Grants from central or local government will cost the firm nothing.
Firms often lease equipment or machinery to avoid a large outlay of cash. This is useful if a firm needs to upgrade within the medium term as technology advances.

5026,"Storm on the Island: Test (answer hints)
Both poems are written in the first person, but Heaney is more vague - we don't know exactly who is involved, so we don't know whose attitudes we are hearing about.
In October, the weather is less violent than Storm: we hear simply of the Wind in the poplars that breaks a branch. Perhaps the muted weather mirrors Clarke's muted feelings following the death of her friend. For Heaney, the wind is an enemy.
...but for Clarke's this is because the wind's white steps remind her of her own approaching death, whereas for Heaney, the wind contains dangers that are all the more frightening because they seem like a huge nothing.
Both poems are written in the first person
...and both poets use alliteration to create atmosphere.
For Hopkins, the wind is kind and gentle, as if playing with A windpuff bonnet of fawn-froth, in contrast to the danger suggested by Heaney.
Hopkins makes a plea for the wildness and wet to be left, while Heaney accepts the wild weather and tries to cope with his fears.
Again, both poems are written in the first person - but Whitman is actually out in the storm, not protected in a cottage like Heaney.
Both use alliteration to suggest the sound of the wind: spirts of snow fierce slanting (Whitman); Space is a salvo (Heaney).
Both use military imagery: Whitman describes the spray as watchful and firm advancing while Heaney describes the wind as it dives and strafes. What effect does this produce?
Both end with a sense of fear and the unknown - although perhaps Whitman seems more vulnerable on the beach with the savage trinity warily watching than Heaney does in his house.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

Immiscible liquids do not mix together. For example, if you add oil to water, the oil floats on the surface of the water. And if you shake the two together then leave them to stand, tiny droplets of oil float upwards. They join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again. To stop the two liquids separating, we need a substance called an emulsifier.
Emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends:
a hydrophilic end - 'water-loving' - that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils; and
a hydrophobic end - 'water-hating' - that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water.
Lecithin is an emulsifier commonly used in foods. It is obtained from oil seeds and is a mixture of different substances. A molecular model of one of these substances is seen in the diagram.
The hydrophilic 'head' dissolves in the water and the hydrophobic 'tail' dissolves in the oil. In this way, the water and oil droplets become unable to separate out. The mixture formed is called an emulsion.
Mayonnaise and emulsion paints are emulsions, but there are others - such as the two in the table.
bacteria and fungi grow on or in the food
chemical reactions take place in the food, such as fats reacting with oxygen to make rancid products
Modern packaging is designed to control or prevent reactions in food that make it go off. Such packaging includes:
cans that will cool down or heat up their contents
Ascorbic acid - vitamin C - is an antioxidant that is found naturally in foods such as citrus fruits, green peppers, green, leafy vegetables, such as cabbage, and potatoes. As E300, it may be added to food such as meat pies and salad cream.
Bacteria and fungi are living organisms. They need water and oxygen (as well as the food itself) to grow and reproduce. If one or both of these is taken away, the microbes are unable to survive and the food will last longer.
Active packaging improves the quality or safety of the food it contains.
Oxygen can be restricted by packaging the food in plastic, or sealing it in an air-tight container. However, the food itself contains some oxygen, and microbes can still survive in it. The air in modern packaging is often replaced by gases such as nitrogen. This restricts the amount of oxygen available so that microbes cannot grow and reproduce.
There are other benefits to this method:
fats in the food cannot react with oxygen to produce substances with rancid smells and flavours
substances in sliced fruit and vegetables cannot oxidise and turn the food brown
crisps and other easily damaged foods are protected from being crushed
Water can be removed by drying the food. Modern freeze-drying methods allow many food items to be dried so that they last longer. Freeze drying is popular for instant drinks, packet soups and fruit pieces in breakfast cereals.

If the product is effectively segmented a company will be able to promote the right product, at the right price and use the right distribution to reach the place where the consumers are.
Now look at the way the 4Ps are used in market segmentation.
Car manufacturers often produce a range of models to suit different markets
Firms have a range of products that will be targeted at different groups or segments. For example, a car manufacturer will often have a range that includes a family model, an
model and a sports model. Lifestyle segmentation will be used to develop their product line and to target their products.
Price and quality are obviously linked but not everyone can afford to buy the most expensive goods. There is a large range of televisions on the market, for example, each with slightly different features. Within this range of products, there will also be a range of prices to cater for varying disposable incomes.
Studying how a product is advertised can reveal its
the end-user or consumer group to whom the manufacturer aims to sell
. A mobile phone company recently used advertising campaigns that varied for men and women. The male phone was pictured in black and white, and all its features and business applications described. The female phone was in bright colours, and was pictured as a matching accessory to go with a woman's lipstick and handbag. You may not agree with this stereotyping, but it is a good example of gender segmentation.
A firm needs to know where its target market is. For example, a producer of Kosher food needs to identify areas where Jewish people live. The firm would have to consider how best to get its product to these areas. This is an example of cultural segmentation.

4983,"The Liverpool to Manchester Railway was a much needed link between the two major cities in the north-west for factory owners in Manchester and Lancashire. George Stephenson was commissioned to design and build the line, but he encountered a few problems.
Once the line was built, however, it signalled the start of the Age of Railways...
The Liverpool to Manchester Railway completed in 1830 was
to open in Britain. Factories in Manchester and Lancashire were upset at the high costs that it took to transport raw materials from the Port of Liverpool to Manchester using the Bridgewater Canal.
, so applied for an Act of Parliament to build a railway track between the two major north-west cities.
George Stephenson was commissioned to design and build the planned railway line
, but he was faced with a few problems.
The Liverpool to Manchester Railway route, alongside the Bridgewater Canal
The building of the Liverpool to Manchester Railway line was started in 1824.
Stephenson's planned route cut directly through a housing estate in Edgehill and he was told he could not demolish the houses. Instead,
he had to dig a 2,200-yard tunnel under the housing estate
Just outside Liverpool, Stephenson encountered the large rock called Olive Mount. Stephenson did not want to go around it, so he ordered his navvies to complete
a two-mile cutting through the solid rock
The next stage of the route meant taking the railway track over the River Sankey. This meant
a stone viaduct had to be built
The last major problem Stephenson had to overcome was
a 12-mile marsh just outside Manchester called Chat Moss
. Stephenson had to lay a foundation of heather and brushwood to build the track on.
It took six years for George Stephenson to complete his railway track
, which then became the most direct route between Liverpool and Manchester.
Considering it took six years to build and cost the businessmen funding it a lot of money, it was successful.
The Rocket, demonstrated that trains could now travel faster
(at 29 miles per hour) over long distances.
The Liverpool to Manchester Railway lines proved that

During the later 1770s, the number of enclosures in Britain increased because they made it easier for farmers to try out new farming techniques. Farmers could now

The chief character in a literary work.
Victor Frankenstein comes from a wealthy, supportive family, which he neglects when he becomes overly absorbed in his studies at university.
. He is a star student, but wants to use his knowledge to obtain the god-like power of creating life.
Victor often fails to listen to good advice from his friends, family and teachers. If he had, many deaths, including his own, may have been avoided.
He rejects the Monster immediately after its creation, calling it a 'wretch' and leaving it to fend for itself. This shows how irresponsible he is. It is also another example of him neglecting his family, since the Monster sees him as its father.
Victor is scared of owning up to what he has done. Even when his little brother, William, is killed by the Monster, he does not admit to knowing who the murderer is. If he had done this, Justine's life would have been saved.
He is capable of showing sympathy for the Monster. For example, when it asks him to create a wife for it, so as not to be forever lonely, Victor at first agrees. However, he later destroys the half-built creature before the Monster's eyes. This leads to his own wife's murder on their wedding night.
His desire for vengeance is very strong. He chases the Monster from Switzerland to the North Pole, enduring great hardships along the way.
Before dying, Victor says his actions are not 'blameable', and that he still believes he was right to create the Monster. This lack of guilt, and his destructive pursuit of scientific knowledge for personal glory, makes us wonder if Victor is in fact the real monster of the story.
Although Victor selects the Monster's body parts so that it will be beautiful, when it is given life it looks hideously ugly. This leads ordinary people to be scared of the Monster and mistreat it.
The Monster is of good character, and does many kind things (for example, helping the De Laceys to harvest their crops and saving the peasant girl from drowning).
It is turned bad through Victor's and other's mistreatment.
The Monster lacks company and only ever wants friendship. This is why it asks Victor to build it a wife.
It is very clever, learning to speak and read by secretly watching the De Laceys. Its speech is sophisticated and persuasive, helping us to have sympathy for it.
Unlike Victor, the Monster regrets its bad actions at the end of the book.
It also shows love for Victor at the end. Its last action is to commit suicide when it discovers its 'father' is dead.
The main narrator of the story, Walton is an explorer on his way to find the North Pole when he meets Victor. On hearing Victor's story, he records it in a series of letters to his sister.
He is similar to Victor in his passion for scientific discovery, ambition and desire for glory.
He is also largely self-taught, another link with Victor.
At first, Walton seems willing to sacrifice the men on his ship for the sake of his ambition. He is asked by Victor when they first meet: 'Do you share my madness?'
Walton felt very lonely before meeting Victor, and they become good friends in the short time they spend together. He shares this loneliness and need for companionship with the Monster.
When Victor dies Walton feels very sad and thinks about carrying out Victor's wish to find and kill the Monster. But when he discovers the Monster grieving over Victor's corpse he feels sorry for it.
He learns from Victor's story the foolishness of great ambition, and turns back rather than continue his search for the Pole. This shows he is at last aware of other people and their safety, something Victor ignored.
Elizabeth is Victor's foster sister, an orphan brought up by Victor's parents. He calls her his 'more than sister'.
She is beautiful, very caring, and loves Victor completely. She looks after him when he falls ill and acts as a mother figure to the younger children when Victor's mother dies.
She has a great belief in justice and doing the right thing, but this is shattered first by the murder of William and then the execution of Justine.
Her bravery is shown at Justine's trial, when she speaks up for her when other friends refuse to.
When she is murdered by the Monster on her wedding night, her beauty and innocence are emphasised. This takes away a lot of sympathy for the Monster.
Like many female characters in the story, Justine is an orphan who cares for other people before herself.
She is brought up in the Frankenstein family home, and acts as their servant.
She is especially fond of Victor's youngest brother, William, and feels responsible when he is murdered by the Monster.
Justine is very beautiful. This beauty angers the Monster when it finds her sleeping, as it knows it will never be allowed to love anyone so attractive. The Monster then places the locket around her neck, knowing it will lead to her being put on trial for the murder.
She is bullied into confessing by a priest. Her calmness and virtue are emphasised and contrasted with the immorality of those who should know better - like Victor, the priest and the judge.
De Lacey is an old, blind man who is looked after by his son (Felix) and daughter (Agatha). The family inspires the Monster with their love and kindness to each other, and to their exotic visitor, Safie.
De Lacey was once a wealthy man, but Felix caused the family to be exiled from their native France and they now live in utter poverty. Despite this, De Lacey does not feel sorry for himself, nor show any anger towards Felix.
The Monster sees this natural goodness in De Lacey and waits for a time to talk to him alone. De Lacey is the only character to ever show kindness to the Monster, and his blindness means he is not

and pre-judges the Monster. This leads to him beating it out of fear for his father's safety, causing it much distress. The Monster becomes exiled from the one family it thought might accept it. As a result, the Monster tells us: 'Evil thenceforth became my good'.
He follows Victor to university at Ingolstadt, and cares for him when he becomes ill after creating the Monster.
Victor never tells him about the Monster, though.
Clerval is kind and generous, and loved by all who meet him. The Monster murders him, however, to get back at Victor, who has just destroyed its half-built 'wife'.

This is echoed in the structure of the play. For instance, as soon as Romeo is alone with Juliet in the orchard, we are reminded several times of the danger he is in. Love seems to be linked to hatred throughout.
Elsewhere, the play mixes the two aspects for dramatic effect. In Act 2, Scene 4, Romeo is described as 'dead' and 'stabbed', but due to love, not hatred.
The scene at Juliet's tomb shows just how well Shakespeare can switch the mood for his audience. It is worthwhile having a look at this in a little more detail...

So Benedick is described as if he were a ""disease"" which Claudio has caught - he will ""hang upon him"", make Claudio ""mad"" and cost a huge amount of money to ""be cured"". Imagery substitutes one thing for another in three main ways:
- when a direct comparison is made (with 'as', 'than' or 'like'). Benedick says he ""was duller than a great thaw"", while Borachio compares fashion-conscious men to soldiers and priests. These ideas allow us our own interpretations. Is fashion like being in the army and being told what to wear - or everyone looking the same?
- when one thing is called something else, such as Claudio calling Hero a ""jewel"". If he had said she is ""like a jewel"" it would be a simile. But he says she actually is ""a jewel"", so it is a metaphor. Think about the qualities of a jewel: it is valuable, beautiful and rare. Then think about how Claudio views Hero - is she something to admire and possess, rather than someone to love?
- where something is described as if it is human. Beatrice talks about how a ""star danced"", and Leonato says ""happiness takes his leave"".

Loss of biodiversity (a diverse range of wildlife) in rivers  fish species find it difficult to breed because they lay their eggs in the gravel at the bottom of rivers and deposition of sediment smothers the gravel. Eggs that are smothered in sediment do not receive sufficient oxygen to survive.
Roads and footpaths can become slippery, causing a hazard to walkers, motorists and cyclists.
Drains can become blocked with eroded soil causing localised flooding.
Sediment can find its way into water storage reservoirs, reducing storage capacity for water supplies and increasing flood risks.
Phosphates (chemicals from fertilisers) in the soil can cause excessive algal growth in rivers, lakes and reservoirs. If the sediment finds its way to an estuary or is dredged and dumped out at sea it can also cause algal growth in marine water. Algal growth causes damage to ecosystems and can be toxic.
Water quality can be reduced - it may require treatment before it becomes fit for human consumption.
The navigability of water courses can be reduced because of deposition of sediment.
Soil erosion is also a problem in
A Less Economically Developed Country [LEDC] has low levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the southern hemisphere (eg countries in southern Africa, southern Asia and South America) are LEDCs, while more of the countries in the northern hemisphere are More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs].
The soil is exposed and vulnerable to erosion as a result of the removal of vegetation and overgrazing.
Trees, which provide protection from the wind and rain, are removed to be used as
Nomadic tribes have become more sedentary, which puts pressure on the land where they settle.
When soil is blown away the land becomes useless for grazing and crops and causes

Salinisation occurs when the water in soils

of land - when water is brought to land that is naturally dry - can cause
for use by local people. Typically the technology is also
in the manufacture, therefore creating jobs and providing valuable skills for future development. Examples of appropriate technology include using
to pump the water and using renewable energy such as solar power. An example of innappropriate technology would include using fossil fuels, which pollute the atmosphere and are a non renewable energy source.
This solution to soil erosion involves the local community building low stone walls along the contours in the land. This has been done in parts of Burkina Faso. The stones trap both soil and water, which increases yields and prevents soil erosion. It is cheap and sustainable and gives the local community a sense of ownership of the project.
In the 1960s plans were made to increase crop yields in LEDCs by introducing new hybrid strains of plants with
. These plans became known as 'The Green Revolution'.
Ultimately, it was not a success as the crops concerned needed lots of
and farmers' profits fell. However, by crossbreeding traditional and new varieties of crops, there has been some success in improving the yields of rice and millet.
Environmental stewardship in agriculture is where farmers take responsibility for environmental quality. This involves recognising that their actions can affect the environment in both positive and negative ways.
An example of environmental stewardship would be organic farming. Organic farming methods do not involve the use of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides, thereby avoiding any possible negative effects on habitats and food chains. In addition, organic products widen the consumer choice of products available.
Green Yard is one of China's first organic dairies. The cows graze on grass free from pesticides, organic hay from Inner Mongolia and sweetcorn grown on the farm itself.
As a regular dairy farmer, Wang Zhanli faced strong competition from larger dairies. He changed to organic farming in 2004 as he found he was able to charge higher prices for his better quality, organic products. In doing so he persuaded 50 of his neighbours to invest in his business.
China still has a small organic market and most of Green Yard's products are sold overseas. More publicity and marketing are needed to raise awareness in China. However, marketing is costly and many Chinese people cannot afford to buy the more expensive organic products.

Cad  mar at t? Cad  mar at an saol agat? T sil agam go bhfuil t go maith.
T cara nua agam anseo. Sen  Nill an t-ainm at air.
Did you say you had a new friend and give his name?
Nl s iontach ard. T a chuid gruaige dubh agus gairid. T a shile gorm.
Eoghan used a verb in the negative to describe his friend - he's not very tall- this shows very good use of language. He also correctly described his hair and eyes.
Eoghan used some nice adjectives to describe his friend - lively and chatty.
T suim mhr aige sa sprt - is bre leis iomnaocht agus imronn s peil Ghaelach fosta.
Eoghan uses some excellent phrases to talk about his friend's interests - very interested in sport. He also used the present tense to give a bit more information - saying that his friend plays Gaelic football. This is a very good idea.
D'imir muid cispheil leis na buachaill eile inn. Chuaigh muid chuig ceolchoirm sa choliste D hAoine - bh an chraic go hiontach!
Eoin used the past tense correctly to talk about things they had done. He also used ""muid"" - ""we"" because he is talking about what they did - this is important.
Feicfidh m Sen ars mar t s ina chna i nDoire fosta. Rachaidh muid go dt an Club ige am igin.
Eoin used the future tense correctly to say he will see his friend again because he also lives in Derry. Any reason would be fine here. Eoin also gave more information about something they will do - this is a great way to finish off.
Eoghan ended his letter with an appropriate phrase -
/ Bye for now. There are many different ways of signing off eg.
Le gr / Sln go fill / Sln / dh mr

872,"""The railroads were the critical factor in the development of cattle ranching.""
Search out and list all the ways the railroads affected the development of cattle ranching.
Five ways the railroads affect the development of cattle ranching include:
In 1865-1870 beef was transported north on the railroad from Sedalia, causing the opening up of Chicago and the other northern markets.
The long drives were developed solely to get the cattle to the railroads.
The development of 'cow-towns' such as Abilene were to allow the safe loading of cattle onto the railroads.
In 1870-1885, refrigeration cars on trains opened a world-wide market for beef.
After 1885 many homesteaders, who eventually destroyed ranching, were brought to the West on the railroads.
As part of your revision, think about the
cattle ranching spread from Texas further into the Great Plains.
cattle trails and 'cow towns' were set up in the 1860s.
cattle ranching was affected by the railroads.
the 'open range' had come to an end by the 1890s.

3307,"Morphine is a powerful painkilling drug that acts directly on the central nervous system. It is called an opiate because it comes from the opium poppy. It is prescribed to relieve severe chronic pain, such as cancer pain, and after severe injury or surgery. Morphine has side effects such as drowsiness and blurred vision, and it is very addictive.
Heroin is manufactured from morphine and is even more dangerously addictive. But it is useful to treat severe pain in terminally ill patients, and it causes fewer unpleasant side effects than morphine. Both substances are used illegally as recreational drugs, and this is very dangerous.
Cannabis is an illegal drug that can be smoked, producing feelings of well-being. But like tobacco it can cause lung cancer and bronchitis. Unlike tobacco, it can cause permanent damage to the mental health of its users. Research has shown that cannabis has some useful painkilling properties, but it is illegal to prescribe it for this use.
All drugs have the potential to damage our health, because they change chemical processes in the body. Addictive recreational drugs may damage our health indirectly by reducing the amount of money available to buy food, and by placing users in dangerous situations. Injecting any drug with a needle and syringe that someone else has used may lead to a number of diseases from infected blood, including HIV and hepatitis. Users of illegal drugs may turn to crime to pay for their habit, and this affects the lives of other people.
A research report in 2006 classified various drugs according to their health and social risks, without reference to whether they are legal or not. In the report, heroin and cocaine are the most dangerous two drugs, alcohol is the fifth most dangerous and tobacco is ninth.

The number of topics that must be covered varies from syllabus to syllabus. EDEXCEL allows you to choose one of the topics. The other exam boards do not.
What you must be able to do
At foundation tier, the most important thing is to answer all the examiner's questions clearly, so that a German-speaking person would understand. Of course, you should try to be as accurate as possible, but small mistakes will not always lose marks. The best foundation tier candidates will be able to refer to the past, present and future. They will also be able to express personal opinions.
To do well at higher tier, you will need to be accurate and fluent. You will have to produce longer sequences of speech and use a variety of structures, tenses and vocabulary. You will also be expected to express ideas and justify your point of view.
Ask your teacher to show you the standard of work required at different levels. He/she should be able to demonstrate the differences between performance at grades E, C and A.
Most of your preparation will have added value, as it is likely to be useful in your writing exam as well.
Prepare as much material in advance as you can. Take one topic at a time. Your teacher will probably give you some possible questions for each topic.
As well as preparing answers to questions, practise giving a continuous speech on each topic.
Start simple. Later on you will find opportunities to improve your work by adding a few more interesting details. Remember - it is easy to improve a simple piece of work. It is much harder to simplify something that is too complicated!
Do not prepare notes with words or phrases that are too difficult or complicated. If you do, you will not manage a confident, lively conversation and you will get a low mark.
Sometimes you may hesitate in the conversation. Try to do this in German. Don't say ""
"". Instead, prepare some useful German ""fillers"" such as
The better prepared you are, the easier it will be to seem relaxed, fluent and spontaneous in the exam.
Look at the examiner. Eye contact is very important. It will help the examiner to help you.
Avoid making the conversation sound like a rehearsed set of questions with easy answers. One way to do this is to think of each question as a ""trigger"" to help you say as much good German as you can. For example, if your examiner asks you to talk about your family, don't just name the members of your family and wait for the next question. Instead, develop your reply by taking one member of the family and describing their personality, as well as their physical appearance. You could then give your opinion of that person and say whether you get on well together, and why.
Don't panic if the examiner asks you a question you have not prepared. Short answers, as well as complete sentences are both acceptable. Try to be spontaneous and to respond quickly and confidently.
If you don't understand a question, ask the examiner (in German) to repeat it ""
"". If you still don't understand, say so ""
"" and let the examiner move on. Avoid long silences.
Don't worry if things get harder as the conversation develops. Remember, it's the examiner's job to ""push"" you as far as you can go. If everything was too easy, the examiner would be letting you under-achieve.

1206,"This Revision Bite will help you understand the different types of production costs and how to calculate them.
A manufacturing company's production department will need to consider the quality and quantity of a product in relation to cost. If a firm wants to make a profit, it has to know what it is spending as well as what it is earning. Here are some of the costs it needs to know to do this:
Now look at each of these costs in more detail:
These costs do not change however many units of a product are made. Factory rent, insurance premiums and administration salaries stay the same, whether the factory is working at full capacity or producing nothing. The owner of the business may have taken out a loan to buy equipment or refurbish a building. The loan will have to be repaid whether or not the business has customers.
the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process
changes. For example, the amount of raw materials needed varies as the levels of output go up or down.
The employee is paid according to the number of units produced.
wages also fluctuate, depending on the employees' efficiency and the demand for the company's products.
The fixed costs and the variable costs are added together to establish the total costs. The fixed costs remain constant, but the variable costs increase in direct proportion with output.
The amount spent on producing one extra unit. It is the increase in total cost when one more unit is produced.
is a way of measuring how much more it will cost a company to make one more individual item. Here is an example:
A company produces compact discs. It has produced 99 CDs and the total costs have amounted to 999. If the total costs increase to 1,000 when the hundredth CD is made the marginal cost of the last CD is 1.00.
The firm knows that now each CD should cost only 1.00 or less to produce. As the cost per unit usually decreases with a rise in output, it should become cheaper to produce each one. The firm may be able to offer a more competitive price to customers.
The example of the CD shows the benefits of economies of scale, where mass production results in a lower unit cost. The reason is that the fixed costs do not change and are spread across a greater level of output.
The amount spent on producing each unit of output. It is calculated by dividing the total level of cost by the level of output.
helps a firm to monitor its progress, and makes it easier to set prices. It is calculated by dividing total cost by total output.
Using the example of the compact disc firm above:
This might seem expensive, but if the firm produces another hundred units at a marginal cost of 1.00 per CD, its average cost will fall radically:
The firm can use this information to decide whether it is worth accepting a new order for goods.
The examiner will want to see that you understand what the different costs are, how they are calculated, and why it is important for a firm to work them out. You will be expected to apply your understanding to a real life situation.
A company will always incur costs, no matter how efficient it is. Wages,

7359,"The method used to extract a metal from its ore depends upon the stability of its compound in the ore, which in turn depends upon the reactivity of the metal:
The oxides of very reactive metals, such as aluminium, form stable oxides and other compounds. A lot of energy is needed to reduce them to extract the metal.
The oxides of less unreactive metals, such as iron, form less stable oxides and other compounds. Relatively little energy is needed to reduce them to extract the metal.
So, the method of extraction of a metal from its ore depends on the metal's position in the reactivity series.
Reactive metals such as aluminium are extracted by electrolysis, while a less-reactive metal such as iron may be extracted by reduction with carbon. Gold, because it is so unreactive, is found as the native metal and not as a compound, so it does not need to be chemically separated. However, chemical reactions may be needed to remove other elements that might contaminate the metal.

travels as waves and transfers energy from one place to another. All electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum, and they all travel at the same speed in a vacuum.
The electromagnetic spectrum is a continuous range of wavelengths. The types of radiation that occur in different parts of the spectrum have different uses and dangers, which depend on their wavelength and frequency.
White light can be split up using a prism to form a spectrum. A prism is a block of glass with a triangular cross-section. The light waves are refracted as they enter and leave the prism. The shorter the wavelength of the light, the more it is refracted. As a result, red light is refracted the least and violet light is refracted the most, causing the coloured light to spread out to form a spectrum.
Visible light is just one type of electromagnetic radiation. There are various types of electromagnetic radiation, some with longer wavelengths than visible light and some with shorter wavelengths than visible light.
You should know the different types of electromagnetic radiation and their typical uses.
You should know some of the properties and uses of gamma radiation and X-rays.

Gamma radiation is used, among other things, for the following purposes.
to kill cancer cells (note that lower doses of gamma radiation could lead to cells becoming cancerous)
X-rays have a lower frequency than gamma radiation. Like gamma rays, they cannot be seen or felt. X-rays mostly pass through skin and soft tissue, but they do not easily pass through bone or metal.
X-rays are used to produce photographs of bones to check for damage such as fractures. They are also used in industry to check metal components and welds for cracks or other damage.
Lower doses of X-rays can cause cells to become cancerous, so precautions are taken in hospitals to limit the dose received by patients and staff when X-ray photographs are taken.

. We cannot see or feel ultraviolet radiation, but our skin responds to it by turning darker. This happens in an attempt to reduce the amount of ultraviolet radiation that reaches deeper skin tissues. Darker skins absorb more ultraviolet light, so less ultraviolet radiation reaches the deeper tissues. This is important because ultraviolet radiation can cause normal cells to become cancerous.

Infrared radiation is absorbed by the skin and we feel it as heat. It is used in heaters, toasters and grills. It is also used for television remote controls and in

You should know some of the properties and uses of microwave radiation.
Microwave radiation has lower frequencies and longer wavelengths than visible light. Microwaves with certain wavelengths are absorbed by water molecules and can be used for cooking. Water in the food absorbs the microwave radiation, which causes the water to heat up and cook the food. The water in living cells can also absorb microwave radiation. As a result, they can be killed or damaged by the heat released.
Microwave radiation can also be used to transmit signals such as mobile phone calls. Microwave transmitters and receivers on buildings and masts communicate with the mobile telephones in their range.
Certain microwave radiation wavelengths pass through the Earth's atmosphere and can be used to transmit information to and from satellites in orbit.
You should know some of the properties and uses of radio waves.
Radio waves have lower frequencies and longer wavelengths than microwaves. They are used to transmit television and radio programmes. Television uses higher frequencies than radio.
A radio programme receiver does not need to be directly in view of the transmitter to receive programme signals. For low frequency radio waves diffraction can allow them to be received behind hills, although repeater stations are often used to improve the quality of the signals.
The lowest frequency radio waves are also reflected from an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere, called the Ionosphere. This means that they can reach receivers that are not in the line of sight because of the curvature of the Earth's surface.

Yet the arrival of Marco and Rodolpho fires up tensions that have been smouldering under the surface of the family for a while, and the result is tragic. Let's look at the characters in more detail. If you've time, jot down the key things you can remember about each character, then click Next to see if you included all the points we did.
Eddie is 40 years old, an American of Sicilian decent. He is described as

- both Beatrice and Catherine are obviously used to him laying down the rules. He sees this as a 'manly' thing to do and he expects all men to do the same - which is why he cannot accept Rodolpho's more gentle talents.

He is proud of her looks, yet concerned that she will attract the attention of men and is concerned about her new job. He finds it hard to admit that she has become a woman.

As his feelings for Catherine become more
, he does everything he can to prevent Rodolpho from marrying her. - He tries to undermine Rodolpho. For example, he mocks Rodolpho's skills at cooking, singing and sewing, claims he is homosexual and tells Catherine that he only wants her to gain US citizenship. - He tries to get the law involved and is amazed when Alfieri says that nothing can be done. - He tries violence: he 'teaches' Rodolpho to box as an excuse to hit him, then fights with Rodolpho when he knows Rodolpho has slept with Catherine. - He calls the Immigration Bureau is a last desperate attempt to stop the wedding: he cares so much for Catherine that he is prepared to break his code of honour.

""It means you gotta be your own self more.""
She has a no-nonsense, practical approach, makes clear observations and is assertive. At the end, she is brave enough to tell Eddie the truth: You want somethin' else, Eddie, and you can never have her!
She is upset by the conflict within the family that the relationship between Rodolpho and Catherine causes. She continually tries to be the calming influence. At the end, however, she remains loyal to Eddie, choosing to stay with him rather than attend Catherine's wedding. She is rewarded for this with Eddie's dying words -
She is 17 years old, the orphaned daughter of Beatrice's sister Nancy.
- she has never known anything of life outside the Carbone household.
- She wants his approval for everything that she does: right at the start, she is desperate for him to admire her new skirt.
Later we hear that perhaps she is too familiar with Eddie now she has grown up: Beatrice tells her not to wander round the apartment in her slip, which shocks and saddens Catherine - the stage directions say, She is at the edge of tears, as though a familiar world had shattered. She had never before imagined there was anything wrong with her relationship with Eddie.
She is excited at Marco and Rodolpho's arrival - they represent the world outside her own sheltered life. She is attracted to Rodolpho straight away - so she is reluctant to take off her high heels when Eddie tells her to!

She is loyal to Eddie and tells Beatrice that her marriage to Rodolpho would be wrong if Eddie is against it.
: when Eddie spars with Rodolpho at the end of Act1, she rushes to help her lover. (This prepares us for her choosing to marry Rodolpho in spite of Eddie's wishes in Act 2.)

letter a month ago, mentioning a proposal. From his letter, Elizabeth believes he must be a strange man, and her father even hopes he will be. Collins arrives and acts very formally.
Collins gradually reveals himself to be a strange sort of social climber - very humble with regards to his patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, but full of himself. He's a ridiculous figure, although he tries to be nice.
Collins' character is developed further: he lacks common sense, and his education hasn't helped. He liked Jane at first, but switches to Elizabeth, which shows he lacks real feelings.
The girls walk to Meryton with Collins, and on the way they meet a soldier, George Wickham. Darcy and Bingley pass them and it's apparent that Darcy knows Wickham but they aren't friends.
Elizabeth meets Wickham at her aunt's house and he mentions Darcy, saying they were boyhood friends but Darcy cheated him out of a career in the Church.

6488,"Power stations fuelled by fossil fuels or nuclear fuels are reliable sources of energy. This means they can provide power whenever it is needed. However, their start-up times vary according to the type of fuel used.
Nuclear power stations and coal-fired power stations usually provide base load electricity - they are run all of the time because they take the longest time to start up. Oil-fired and gas-fired power stations are often used to provide extra electricity at peak times, because they take the least time to start up.
The fuel for nuclear power stations is relatively cheap, but the power stations themselves are expensive to build. It is also very expensive to dismantle old nuclear power stations, and to store their radioactive waste, which is a dangerous health hazard.
Renewable fuel resources do not cost anything, but the equipment used to generate the power may be expensive to build. Certain resources are reliable, including tidal barrages and hydroelectric power. Others are less reliable, including wind and solar energy.

1851,"The ohm is the unit of resistance. Larger values are measured in kilo-ohms (1000 ohms) and mega-ohms (1,000,000 ohms). Resistors are marked, using a code specified in British Standard 1852, as follows:
. Numbers coming before the R indicate a value more than one. So 1R (or 1R0) = 1 ohm; 47R = 47 ohms; and 4R7 = 4.7 ohms. Numbers coming after the R indicate a value less than one - so R56 = 0.56 ohms.
. Numbers coming before the k indicate a value more than one, while numbers coming after the k indicate a value less than one. So 1k8 = 1.8 kilo-ohms and 5k6 = 5.6 kilo-ohms.
. Numbers coming before the M indicate a value of more than one, while numbers after the M indicate a value less than one. So 2M = 2 mega-ohms, and 2M2 = 2.2 mega-ohms
The resistance value of a resistor is shown by a series of coloured bands.
The first band denotes tens, and the second band units. Each colour stands for a different unit: black is zero, brown is one, red is two; orange is three; yellow is four; green is five; blue is six; violet is seven; grey is eight; white is nine. So the sequence red - red denotes the value 22.
The third band is the multiplier. Black denotes a multiplier of one; brown 10; red 100; orange 1000 and so on. So the sequence red - red - red denotes a value of 22 x 100, or 2.2 kilo-ohms.
The fourth band is the tolerance. Manufacturers of resistors cannot guarantee the exact resistance figure shown by the first 3 bands, so they give a percentage value by which the resistance may be higher or lower than the resistance quoted. A red band denotes a tolerance of 2 percent; gold a tolerance of 5 percent; and silver a tolerance of 10 percent. Thus a 100 ohm resistor of 10 per cent tolerance has an exact resistance value falling somewhere between 90 ohm and 100 ohm.

Ordinary electric lamps contain a thin metal filament that glows when electricity passes through it. However, most of the electrical energy is transferred as heat rather than light energy. This is the Sankey diagram for a typical filament lamp.

From the diagram, you can see that much less electrical energy is transferred, or ""wasted"", as heat energy.
The efficiency of a device such as a lamp can be calculated using this equation:
efficiency = (useful energy transferred  energy supplied)  100
The efficiency of the filament lamp is 10  100  100 = 10%. This means that 10% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy. 90% is transferred as heat energy.
The efficiency of the energy-saving lamp is 75  100  100 = 75%. This means that 75% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy. 25% is transferred as heat energy.
Note that the efficiency of a device will always be less than 100%.

2593,"Ratios can be used to solve many different problems - for example, with recipes, scale drawings or map work. A typical question will expect you to change a ratio - the reverse of cancelling down.
Sam does a scale drawing of his kitchen. He uses a scale of 1:100. He measures the length of the kitchen as 5.9m.
How long is the kitchen on the scale drawing? Give your answer in mm.
You need to convert 5.9m to mm, then divided by 100 to give the answer.
If you did not get the correct answer, remember that the scale of 1:100 means that the real kitchen is 100 times bigger than the scale drawing.
5.9m = 590cm (multiplied by 100) = 5900mm (multiplied by 10)
So the scale drawing would be 5900  100 = 59mm.
Another typical question will give you a recipe to modify for a different number of people.
A recipe to make lasagne for 6 people uses 300 grams of minced beef. How much minced beef would be needed to serve 8 people?

East Germany was the Soviet zone of Germany. In 1949, they set up a Communist-controlled state called the German Democratic Republic.
In the 1945 elections, a Communist-led coalition was elected to power. The Communists gradually took over and in 1947 they abolished the monarchy.
Stalin had promised to set up a joint Communist/non-Communist government at Yalta, but then he invited 16 non-Communist leaders to Moscow and arrested them. Thousands of non-Communists were arrested, and the Communists won the 1947 election.
The non-communists won the 1945 elections with Zoltan Tildy as president. However, the Communists' leader, Rakosi, took control of the secret police (the AVO), and executed and arrested his opponents. Tildy was forced to resign and Cardinal Mindzenty, head of the Catholic Church, was imprisoned. By 1948, Rakosi had complete control of Hungary.
A coalition government was set up and led by the non-Communist Benes. However, the Communists' leader Gottwald made sure they controlled the radio, the army and the police. Gottwald became prime minister and set up a secret police force. Non-Communists were arrested. In 1948, Communist workers went on strike, the non-Communist minister Masaryk committed suicide and Gottwald took over the government.

What is it? How do you know?
What type of publication do you think text 2 is? A comic? A newspaper? A magazine? A web page? A business document?
This one isn't so easy, so let's rule some things out...
: No. Comics are generally brightly coloured and full of cartoons. This isnt!
: No. Newspapers generally use narrow columns, black and white print and the pages are very full when you look at them.
: No. There are no giveaway clues such as 'click here', 'contact us', 'print this page' - so it cant be a web page.
: No. In a magazine, one would expect to see more writing and pictures on each page. This layout is too spacious.
: You are pretty close - text 2 comes from the Environment Agency. This is from the booklet the organisation would give to members of the public if they asked for information about what the Government is doing to protect and improve the environment.
Who is it aimed at? How can you tell?
What do you think gives clues as to who the intended audience is?
This was a bit of a trick question really because
these things help to determine the intended audience.
Both texts have the same intended audience. Which of the following do you think is the intended audience?
The presentation of these articles is not really colourful enough to attract children. The language is too sophisticated and not set out in a child-friendly way - eg short sentences and lots of helpful illustrations.
Not all adults and older children would want to read this. Neither of these two articles came from popular newspapers or were dropped through every letter box in the country. People who have read these documents had to find them first. The language is quite difficult, so a good level of education is needed to understand them. The intended readership is a little bit more precise.
Adults and older children interested in environmental issues
Exactly, these documents came from specialist publications, which implies that you had to be interested enough to find them in the first place. The vocabulary is quite technical in places, so you would need some prior knowledge of the subject. The layout is attractive, but not so eye-catching that it was designed to attract your attention while you were looking for something else.
What does it want you to do? How does it make you do it?
Given that you know this comes from the
and that its intended audience is people who are interested in environmental issues, what would you guess about the purpose of the article?
Most documents have more than one purpose, but there is generally a main purpose. Put this list in order of importance, with the most important first:
to provoke action, eg join a campaign
Check to see if you got the order of importance right:
: This is the most important aspect of this document because it is showing the reader what they could be doing to help the environment.
: This is the second most important aspect of this document because it shows that personal action does help the environment and it is suggesting that the more people who join in the better.
: This document has a little humour in it and the interviews with famous environmentalists should prove entertaining to the intended reader.
: This document provides only a tiny bit of analysis that mostly states peoples opinions without analysing them.
: There is not much explanation in this document. It assumes the reader already knows quite a lot about the subject; it tells us what environmentalists are doing, but does not offer many reasons why.
: There is really no description in this document, so this is the least important aspect of it.
What does it want you to do? How does it make you do it?
What is the purpose of this? Since we know this is a
from the Environment Agency, we know that it was written by the government. Ask yourself; what do governments want?
to be seen acting in the best interests of the population
So, how does text 2 do this?
Which of the following statements about text 2 do you agree with?
""The document is informing the public about legislation""
""It suggests what the Government wants to do to improve the environment""
""This document wants to maintain public support of the Government""

So how can you tell what tone a piece of non-fiction text is written in?
Firstly, and most importantly, you need to assess the

There are certain clues you can look out for to help determine the tone of a non-fiction text:
For example, an article from a broadsheet newspaper or a charity advertisement is likely to be quite serious in tone.
The use of exclamation marks can suggest that the writer is in disbelief about, or astounded by something.

310,"A stationary object remains stationary if the sum of the forces acting upon it - resultant force - is zero. A moving object with a zero resultant force keeps moving at the same speed and in the same direction.
If the resultant force acting on an object is not zero, a stationary object begins to accelerate in the same direction as the force. A moving object speeds up, slows down or changes direction.
Acceleration depends on the force applied to an object and the object's mass.
You should be able to use the idea of the resultant force on an object to determine its movement.
An object may have several different forces acting on it, which can have different strengths and directions. But they can be added together to give the
. This is a single force that has the same effect on the object as all the individual forces acting together.
When all the forces are balanced, the resultant force is zero. In this case:
a moving object keeps on moving at the same speed in the same direction
For example, in the diagram of the weightlifter, the resultant force on the bar is zero, so the bar does not move. Its weight acting downwards is balanced by the upward force provided by the weightlifter.
The longer the arrow, the bigger the force. In this diagram, the arrows are the same length, so we know they are the same size.
When all the forces are not balanced, the resultant force is not zero. In this case:
A stationary object begins to move in the direction of the resultant force.
A moving object speeds up, slows down or changes direction depending on the direction of the resultant force.
In this diagram of the weightlifter, the resultant force on the bar is not zero. The upwards force is bigger than the downwards force. The resultant force acts in the upwards direction, so the bar moves upwards.
In this next diagram of the weightlifter, the resultant force on the bar is also not zero. This time, the upwards force is smaller than the downwards force. The resultant force acts in the downwards direction, so the bar moves downwards.

1464,"Coal was one of the vital elements that contributed to the Industrial Revolution. The mining of coal changed from being a small-scalle operation to become a large-scale operation helped by major technological advances.
The Industrial Revolution would not have happened without coal.
It is sometimes suggested that the key to the increase in coal production was an increase in scale, not a technological revolution. Certainly,
the organisation of the industry changed hugely
, from small-scale adit or bell pits employing about 20 miners, to deep-shaft mines run by wealthy coal magnates such as Lord Londonderry.
However, the reason that coal mining had been restricted to small surface mining was because
working deeper mines had encountered technological difficulties
such as flooding, explosions, chokedamp, roof-falls, and lifting and transporting the coal. By the 19th century, these problems had been overcome by technological changes.
key to the increase in production was the use of the steam engine
. The steam engine was powered by coal, so as the steam engine improved and was used in more industries, this led to an increased demand for coal.
A similar example of industries interacting to cause the Industrial Revolution is between coal and the railways. The first steam trains in the world and the first railway in the world - the Stockton and Darlington Railway 1825 - were built to transport coal to the docks. However,
railways proved so popular and grew so big that they became a major user of coal
in the 19th century, and this increased the demand for coal.

1782,"The aftermath of an earthquake, Golcuk, Western Turkey
The power of an earthquake is measured using a seismometer. A seismometer detects the vibrations caused by an earthquake. It plots these vibrations on a seismograph.
The strength, or magnitude, of an earthquake is measured using the Richter scale. The Richter scale is numbered 0-10:
Earthquakes measuring just one or two on the scale are very common and can happen everyday in places like San Francisco. These earthquakes are so small that people cannot feel them, they can only be picked up by a seismometer.
Earthquakes measuring around seven or eight on the Richter scale can be devastating. The earthquake in China's south-western Sichuan province in May 2008 measured 7.8 on the Richter scale.

Summer, and the long grass is a snare drum.
Down at the end of the meadow,
its wave breaks before the tractor blade.
Over the hedge our neighbour travels his field
in a cloud of lime, drifting our land
The child comes running through the killed flowers,
his hands a nest of quivering mouse,
We know it will die and ought to finish it off.
It curls in agony big as itself
and the star goes out in its eye.
and the children kneel in long grass
Before day's done the field lies bleeding,

frogs, and nest of mice. The wrong that woke
from a rumour of pain won't heal,
All night I dream the children dance in grass
their bones brittle as mouse-ribs, the air
The poem describes hay making in Wales, one summer in the early 1990s. The war in Bosnia was going on at the time. When a field mouse gets injured and dies as a result of the hay making, Clarke is reminded of the war and how the weak and vulnerable become victims of violence.
Gillian Clarke tells us on her website that the fighting referred to in the poem is the Bosnian

4413,"Decay is an essential life process, which helps to digest food and recycle materials. Bacteria and fungi are the main groups of decomposer. They release enzymes to break down compounds, so that they can absorb the nutrients. We can preserve our food, for example by freezing or canning, to remove the conditions needed for decay to occur.
Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another.
Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
Intensive farming practices include growing high-yield crops, using fertilisers and pesticides and keeping animals indoors. Food production is increased but there are unwelcome side effects.
Organic farming bans chemical inputs and has a less harmful effect on the environment but often produces less, more expensive food.
Hydroponics is the production of food using nutrient-rich solution rather than soil.
Leaves enable photosynthesis to happen. Photosynthesis is the process by which leaves absorb light and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrate (food) for plants to grow. Leaves are adapted to perform their function eg they have a large surface area to absorb sunlight.
Plants use minerals from the soil to build the complex molecules they need to survive and grow. Poor plant growth may be due to a deficiency of one or more minerals. Tests can be done to establish which mineral is deficient or a general purpose NPK fertiliser added.
Plants have two different types of 'transport' tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots.
The element carbon is the present in all living organisms. It's recycled through various processes, which are described in the carbon cycle.
Nitrogen is essential for the formation of amino acids to make proteins. The nitrogen cycle describes the ways in which nitrogen is recycled.
Osmosis is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low water concentration through a partially permeable membrane. Osmosis takes place in all living cells.
Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis through their root hair cells. Plants use water for several vital processes including photosynthesis and transporting minerals.
All substances are made from atoms. Each atom is made of a nucleus - containing protons and neutrons - surrounded by electrons.
The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. The elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in ascending order of atomic number.
The mass number of an atom is the total of protons plus neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and hence different mass numbers) are called isotopes of that element.
A covalent bond is formed between non metal atoms, which combine together by sharing electrons. Covalent compounds have no free electrons and no ions so they don't conduct electricity.
The Periodic Table is an arrangement of the elements in order of atomic number. Elements in the same vertical column are in the same group or family and have similar chemical properties.
Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid using electricity. When ionic compounds are molten or dissolved in water the ions are free to move.
When sulfuric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen is produced at the cathode (negative electrode) and oxygen at the anode (positive electrode). Aluminium is extracted from the mineral bauxite using the process of electrolysis.
All matter is made of atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements, and each one has a symbol. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other.
When atoms of different elements join together they make a compound. Compounds are represented by formulae that show how many atoms of each element are in the compound. Formulae can be worked out from the charge of the ions that make up the compound.
Chemical reactions can be written down as balanced chemical equations.
The Group 1 elements in the Periodic Table are known as the alkali metals. They include lithium, sodium and potassium, which all react vigorously with air and water.
The reactivity of the alkali metals increases down the group. Flame tests are used to identify alkali metal ions in compounds.
The Group 7 elements are also known as the halogens. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, which all have seven electrons in their outer shell.
In a displacement reaction a less reactive element is
Ionic bonding occurs between positive and negative ions, which attract each other and bind together to form ionic compounds. For example, sodium chloride consists of Na
Each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions held in place by electrostatic attraction and forming an ionic crystal lattice. The ions in a crystal lattice are very strongly bonded - a high temperature is required to melt the crystal.
The physical properties of different metals make them useful for different purposes. For example, aluminium conducts heat, which makes it a useful material for making saucepans and gold is shiny, which makes it an attractive material for jewellery.
Metal particles are held together by strong metallic bonds, which is why they have high melting and boiling points. The loose electrons in metals can all move together through the metal  creating an electric current.
The elements in the middle section of the Periodic Table are the transition elements. They're all metals with typical metallic properties eg conducting heat and electricity. They often form coloured compounds.
Transition metal carbonates undergo thermal decomposition - a reaction in which a substance is broken down into at least two other substances by heat.
Transition metal hydroxides are insoluble in water. They can be precipitated out of a transitional metal compound solution using sodium hydroxide solution.

3701,"Once you understand how to use the plot and characters, you should move onto the themes. The themes are the basic ideas in
. The major theme of the play is the subject of love, but there are many others, such as jealousy and honour, reality versus appearances, and the different roles of men and women.
Perhaps the most obvious subject or theme in
. However, Shakespeare presents love in different ways. There is Claudio's love for Hero: this is an immature view of romance, a type of puppy love. He does not know her and is falling in love with an idea of what she is like. Later, when he is suspicious of her, he instantly forgets he loved her and is full of hatred. At the end of the play he seems more settled. He has grown up a little and perhaps starts to understand that love is about more than just appearances.
Hero's view of love is also quite simple. She accepts what her father wants and is ready to marry Claudio without knowing him. Even the proposal to marry does not come directly from Claudio. In private, she might have more to say about love, but in public Hero stays silent a lot of the time.
Claudio and Hero's views of love are very different to Beatrice and Benedick's. At the start, the latter both laugh at the idea of love and are determined not to marry. They constantly insult each other, yet are ready to believe the other one loves them. Gradually, though, they both start to show genuine concern and interest in each other.
When they do fall in love, they are ready for any sacrifice. Benedick deserts his best friends to protect the honour of Beatrice's cousin, for instance. However, even when they are ready to marry, they still poke fun at romance, and each other.
Leonato shows a different view of love - as a proud father to his daughter. He is keen on her marriage and wants the best for her. However, he is also very keen on Hero behaving in the correct way. When Claudio accuses Hero of being unfaithful, Leonato is more concerned about the dishonour. He even prefers Hero to die rather than to be 'dishonoured'.
Finally, there is another view of love: as something spiritual and between friends. This is shown with the love Beatrice shares with Hero and the friendships between Don Pedro, Benedick and Claudio. Each of these characters shows a close understanding of the other. They might make fun of one another and criticise each another's choices, but they respect and care for one another.
is another major topic. Messina society is ruled by men. They make the decisions and have the power. Women have to do what they are told, just like Hero. She is silent and passive. Even at the end of the play she does not show her feelings or make decisions.
The men see unmarried women in one of only two ways: as innocent and pure, so ready to be married, or dirty and to be used solely for sex, like prostitutes. The men themselves have very different standards. They might look for sex with a prostitute when they are young, but then expect to marry later in life (and insist on marrying a virgin). The play makes these double standards very clear.
Beatrice is the exception in this society. Her 'honour' is never questioned, but she behaves just like a man in public. She is powerful, jokes, insults people, interrupts others, and takes the lead when she wants to. She is like a modern role model for women.
At the end of the play, though, she agrees to marry. Benedick asks for ""Peace"", saying he will ""stop"" her mouth, meaning he will kiss her to keep her quiet. Does this mean Beatrice is now submitting and suddenly doing what she is told? No-one knows, because the play ends here. It is an interesting idea to think about.
. Status was very important in Shakespeare's time. The male characters are often very concerned by how they will be judged. For instance, Claudio rejects Hero because she is no longer pure in his eyes. And Leonato is proud that Hero is marrying someone important, but then ashamed of her. Benedick rejects marriage at the start because he says he does not want to risk his honour. Even Dogberry is more worried about being called an ass than anything else.
is another theme (perhaps because so many people are concerned about their honour). The most obvious character who is jealous is Don John. He resents Don Pedro and will do anything to get his own back after he lost the war. Other characters are jealous, too. Benedick does not like Hero, and does not want Claudio to marry, while Claudio is ready to believe Don John's rumours. Beatrice is an exception: she does not worry about her status or doubt her friends at all.
. Characters are often 'noting': watching or studying others. For instance, Claudio watches Don Pedro and Hero at the masked ball. Later, he and Don Pedro spy on Hero at night.
Each time, the person watching or listening makes a mistake. An obvious example of 'noting' is when Benedick and Beatrice are each tricked by their respective friends. Both sides are watching the reactions of the other, and both Benedick and Beatrice believe the appearance and not the reality.
There may be other topics you can spot. The play deals with gossip and rumour, family relationships and fragile friendships. It is good to include something about the basic ideas within

Recreational drugs, such as alcohol and tobacco, are taken by people because they like the effects they have on their bodies, but they are addictive. Other change-causing substances, both legal and illegal, include solvents, painkillers, sedatives and stimulants. Opiates (such as morphine) are useful for pain-relief in terminally ill patients, but they can be misused as illegal recreational drugs that are very addictive.

This is used to produce very small amounts or specialised electronic products. This might mean producing a single piece of switch gear for a factory machine. Workers in this type of industry need to be highly skilled in a range of different areas and able to work on a number of aspects of the project.
This is the most common type of production in the electronics industry. It involves making a set number of exactly the same product. Some batches will be small, others could be thousands. Batch production might be used to make PCBs for aircraft controls, for example, or control panels for central-heating boilers.In batch production the operation is sub-divided into a number of separate stages, with each stage being completed by different (often computer-controlled) machines. The stages in an PCB batch production process might be:
checking the board, and mounting it into the product
Printed circuit board being checked after manufacture
This is used when very many identical products are required, such as electronic circuits for cars, washing machines and fridges. The products are assembled as they flow along a production line. The operators tend to be semi-skilled.
In-line production plants are very expensive to set up and thousands of products have to be sold to off-set the capital costs. Production is often difficult to plan and breakdowns are costly.
This is where production is heavily automated and runs 24 hours per day. Continuous-flow production is used in oil refining and chemical processing. A considerable amount of electronic control is used in the running and monitoring of these plants.

An example of environmental stewardship would be organic farming. Organic farming methods do not involve the use of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides, thereby avoiding any possible negative effects on habitats and food chains. In addition, organic products widen the consumer choice of products available.
Green Yard is one of China's first organic dairies. The cows graze on grass free from pesticides, organic hay from Inner Mongolia and sweetcorn grown on the farm itself.
As a regular dairy farmer, Wang Zhanli faced strong competition from larger dairies. He changed to organic farming in 2004 as he found he was able to charge higher prices for his better quality, organic products. In doing so he persuaded 50 of his neighbours to invest in his business.
China still has a small organic market and most of Green Yard's products are sold overseas. More publicity and marketing are needed to raise awareness in China. However, marketing is costly and many Chinese people cannot afford to buy the more expensive organic products.

Shakespeare cleverly uses loyalty as a dramatic device as well - Duncan is in the middle of talking about 'absolute trust' when Macbeth walks in - we know he's already thought about killing Duncan, but for the moment he talks about 'the loyalty I owe' and his 'duties' to Duncan.
Loyalty is also very important to Banquo - he will not desert Duncan. Macbeth, however, has an odd idea of loyalty - he knows he is doing the wrong thing, but he still goes ahead. Early on in the play perhaps it is his wife who is manipulating him, but later on it is Macbeth who makes the decisions. And later on he also starts to show he hates disloyalty, threatening his messengers and servants.

Some gases in the Earths atmosphere absorb
Electromagnetic radiation emitted from a hot object.
. One of these is carbon dioxide. Even though carbon dioxide is only about 0.04 per cent of the atmosphere, it is a very important greenhouse gas because it absorbs infrared well.
The Suns rays enter the Earths atmosphere.
Heat is emitted back from the Earths surface.
Some heat passes back out into space.
But some heat is absorbed by carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, and becomes trapped within the Earths atmosphere. The Earth becomes hotter as a result.
Water vapour and methane - higher only
Other greenhouse gases are water vapour, and also methane. Even though methane is present in trace amounts only, it is a very efficient absorber of infrared.
The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is controlled by the carbon cycle.
Processes that remove carbon dioxide from the air:
photosynthesis is the process where green plants use water and carbon dioxide and sunlight to produce carbohydrates (stored energy) and release oxygen (as a by-product).
Processes that return carbon dioxide from the air:
chemical change that takes place inside living cells, which uses glucose and oxygen to produce the energy organisms need to live. Carbon dioxide is a by-product of respiration
combustion ie burning wood and fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas
thermal decomposition of limestone, for example, in the manufacture of iron, steel and cement
All cells contain carbon, because they all contain proteins, fats and carbohydrates. For example, plant cell walls are made of
A carbohydrate. It forms the cell wall in plant cells.
Decomposers, such as microbes and fungi, play an important role in the carbon cycle. They break down the remains of dead plants and animals and, in doing so, release carbon dioxide through respiration.
For thousands of years, the processes in the carbon cycle were constant, so the percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere did not change. Over the past 200 years, the percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased steadily.
burning more and more fossil fuels as energy sources
burning large areas of forests to clear land, which means that there is less photosynthesis removing carbon dioxide from the air
Although the changes have been gradual, most, but not all, scientists agree that the climate is getting gradually warmer. This is called
Again, most, but not all, scientists lay the blame for this on human activities increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Climate change may make it impossible to grow certain food crops in some regions. Melting polar ice, and the thermal expansion of sea water, could cause rising sea levels and the flooding of low-lying land.
One piece of evidence which supports the view of scientists who blame human activities for global warming has been provided by supercomputers. Computer climate models, based on different amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, produce the same changes as have been observed in the real world.
Ideas about science  correlation and cause
The ideas of correlation and cause are illustrated with the evidence for
Global warming refers to the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's surface. In the last 100 years it is believed to have risen by 0.6 degrees C. There are estimates that in the next 100 years, the global temperatures could rise by as much as 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.
Any process can be thought of in terms of factors that may affect an

Children with bigger feet (factor) are, on average, better readers (outcome).
There is another factor which, in fact, causes both of these. It is age, because older children usually have bigger feet, and older children are usually better readers!
To investigate the relationship between a factor and an outcome, it is important to control all other factors that may affect the outcome.
Another factor that may affect the mean temperature of the atmosphere is the amount of energy given out by the Sun. Most scientists agree that this has not changed in the past 200 years.
There are some scientists who agree that global warming is taking place, but do not agree that carbon dioxide levels are to blame.
Once experiments have shown that there is a definite correlation between a factor and an outcome, it is still not enough to prove that the factor causes the outcome.
For this to be proven, there must be some scientific explanation of how the relationship can happen.
For carbon dioxide and global warming, the explanation is that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It absorbs infrared given off by the warm Earth, and this infrared cannot then escape into space. This keeps the Earth warmer than it would be if the carbon dioxide did not absorb so much infrared.

4306,"Gillian Clarke was born in Cardiff in 1937. She has spent most of her life in Wales - her parents were both Welsh speakers and she speaks both English and Welsh: she uses many Welsh stories and myths in her work. She often writes about nature and her observations of people. Her first poems were published in 1970; she has since written three collections of poetry.
She edited the Anglo-Welsh Review from 1975 to 1984 and has taught creative writing in schools. She now works as a poet, freelance writer and broadcaster and is a lecturer at the University of Glamorgan. She has a daughter (Catrin) and two sons and lives on a smallholding in Wales.

Listen to the poem and watch the slideshow
As I stood in a hot, white
Red rope of love which we both
In the glass tank clouded with feelings
Which changed us both. Still I am fighting
From the heart's pool that old rope,
In the dark, for one more hour.
The poem is about the loving but sometimes tense relationship between a mother and daughter. It deals with two separate confrontations between them - the actual birth, then one night about twelve or fourteen years later, when Catrin wants to go out roller skating after dark and her mother refuses.
Clarke is writing about her own relationship with her daughter, Catrin. She says that she wrote the poem to answer the question,
""Why did my beautiful baby have to become a teenager?""
She seems torn between celebrating the fact that her child is growing up, and resisting her desire for independence. Although it is a very personal poem, it could be about any relationship between a mother and child.
The poem consists of short lines divided into two stanzas. One
A group of lines of poetry that make up a unit - like a paragraph in a piece of prose; a verse.
deals with Catrin's birth, one the skating incident. The pause between them perhaps makes us wonder what took place in the intervening years.
Think about how the language the poet uses helps to convey her ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title simply tells us the name of the child we meet in line 1. Her name is not mentioned again, perhaps to reflect the universality of the poem: it could be about any mother / child relationship. Yet also, since the poem is addressed to the child, you, it may be that the relationship is so close that names are unnecessary.
The first stanza is in the past
The verb formation which describes the time at which the action occurred, eg past, present or future.
, as Clarke remembers the birth of her daughter. The second stanza, however, is in the present tense. This suggests that a struggle is still going on between them - and that their love is still as intense as ever.
She uses very simple language. Perhaps this indicates the simple, intense feelings that the poem conveys.
Gillian Clarke writes that she chose skating in the dark to be the focus of the dispute because it is something that children are likely to want to do and parents are likely to refuse. It is an activity that shows that ""it is beautiful and dangerous to be young."" Perhaps the mother recognises that and would like to let her daughter out to enjoy the experience, while worrying about what might happen if she does...
The poem begins in the labour ward of the hospital: it is 'hot, white' (line 2) and sterile, which seems at odds with the intimate event that is about to occur. Further on it is seen as 'a square / Environmental blank' (line 9) and a 'glass tank' (line 19). Why do you think Clarke places so much emphasis on the hospital building?
Before the actual birth, Clarke looks out of the window at 'The people and cars' (line 4) going about their every day business; she, in contrast, is about to experience one of the most momentous events of her life. Why do you think she mentions 'the traffic lights' (line 5)?
'The tight / Red rope of love' (line 8) is the umbilical cord. It is red because of the blood that flowed between the mother and the child in the womb; but also because red is the colour of passion and love. Red contrasts with the stark, white hospital surroundings.
Mother and child 'fought over' (line 9) the cord. The
A 'doing' word; a word expressing action. 'Walk', 'talk', 'come', 'go', 'eat' and 'sleep' are all verbs.
fought suggests the brutality and pain of childbirth. Perhaps Clarke is marvelling at how love is created through violence.
'I wrote / All over the walls with my / Words' (line 11). Are these words Clarke's shouts and screams of pain, or are they words of a poem she thinks of through her labour? She imagines the words colouring 'the clean squares' (line 13) of the hospital.

'The wild tender circles' perhaps refer to the waves of contractions in the lead-up to the birth. Contractions get closer and closer together as moment of birth nears, as the circles of ripples on a pond are closest to the point where a stone is dropped in. The mother and child shouted (line 16). Was this in pain or joy? Or perhaps both?
Both Clarke and Catrin were changed (line 20) by the birth: Clarke became a mother, someone upon whom a tiny baby depended; Catrin became a child, still dependent upon her mother - but less so than she had been in the womb. However, in some ways nothing changed, because the fight continues: Still I am fighting / You off (line 20).
Catrin has asked to 'skate / In the dark' (line 29). This illustrates Catrin's growing independence, yet perhaps contains other layers of meaning. One student quoted on Gillian Clarke's website points out that In the dark may mean that there are still things that the mother and child have yet to find out about each other; another interpretation suggests it refers to the darkness of the womb. Maybe you have other suggestions ...

of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. How would you read this poem?
with tenderness and warmth, to express the mother's intense love for her daughter?
with frustration and even some bitterness because of the unending conflict entailed in being Catrin's mother?
Well, the poem is certainly about conflict! It begins and ends in
. But it is a conflict inseparable from love; it's an old rope
'Tightening about my life, / Trailing love and conflict'
. There is perhaps some frustration in the poem's tone - but not bitterness. The tenderness is seen as all the more intense
The most important idea in this poem is that of the bonds or ties between parent and child, which are seen as in constant two-way

, binding together and at the same time pulling apart. The bond is imagined now as a rope, now as a struggle.
Have a look at these quotes from the poem, with our suggestions about how to 'read' them:
...the tight / Red rope of love which we both / Fought over.
A visual representation of something; a mental picture; a persona that is presented to the world.
here is of a tug-of-war between mother and baby, which is at the same time a tug-of-love (in a tug-of-war you fight to pull your antagonist toward you). But the Red rope of love is also the umbilical cord, which binds mother and baby together but must be cut at birth - and is therefore an image both of dependancy, and of separation.
Neither won nor lost the struggle / In the glass tank clouded with feelings...
This recalls the tug-of-war image: now one side pulling and the other giving way, now the other way about. There may be real fights, and feelings may run very high on either side - but at the end of the day the struggle between parent and child is not about winning or losing, but about change and growth on both sides.
...bringing up / From the heart's pool that old rope, / Tightening about my life
This is a very rich image. The main image is of a boat in a harbour, tied to the quay by an old rope which is partly submerged - but which is pulled up out of the water as the boat is tugged at by the tide. It comes up dripping from the water - suggesting the way that every struggle between mother and daughter comes trailing deep-felt feelings 'From the heart's pool'. The rope tightens about the mother's life, constricting it - but also holding it safe, like the boat securely tied to the quay side bollard.
In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare

In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other.
The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas and attitudes and tone.
Compare Catrin with one other post-1914 poem and two pre-1914 poems of your choice that include a portrait of a mother. What is each poet's attitude to the mother/child relationship?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Clarke's Cold Knap Lake, Yeats's Song of the Old Mother, and Wordsworth's The Afflication of Margaret.
What would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing Catrin with each of these three poems.
Compare your answer with the hints below:
In both poems, life is magically brought forth
...yet Cold Knap Lake describes a virtual rebirth when the drowned girl is revived, rather than an actual birth.
Both contain conflict, but in Cold Knap Lake it is between the rescued girl and her parents, rather than between Clarke and her mother.
Clarke portrays her mother as a heroine in Cold Knap Lake. We are not told Catrin's feelings for her mother when she forbids her to go skating, but she is unlikely to see her in such glowing terms!
Yeats: The Song of the Old Mother
Both poems deal with the conflict between generations
...but in Yeats's poem there is no love. (Do you think that the struggles that Catrin and Clarke have experienced together actually increased their love?)
Both are written from the mother's point of view.
Catrin has a looser structure, while The Song is tightly structured. What could this suggest?
Both poems are from the mother's point of view and show that motherhood can be painful.
Yet while Margaret laments because she does not know what has happened to her beloved Son; Clarke suffers because of the tension between her and Catrin.
Both compare the child they knew (Margaret's the Young One) with the grown child; both show their pride in their offspring. Margaret's son was among the prime in worth, Catrin has a rosy, Defiant glare.
There is a sense of mystery in Wordsworth's poem, as no one knows the fate of the son; we pity Margaret. We sense the warmth in Clarke's relationship with Catrin, however.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

In 1869, just five years after John Newlands put forward his law of octaves, a Russian chemist called Dmitri Mendeleev published a periodic table. Mendeleev also arranged the elements known at the time in order of
The relative atomic mass is the number of times heavier an atom is compared to one twelth of a carbon-12 atom.
, but he did some other things that made his table much more successful.
He realised that the physical and chemical properties of elements were related to their atomic mass in a 'periodic' way, and arranged them so that groups of elements with similar properties fell into vertical columns in his table.
Sometimes this method of arranging elements meant there were gaps in his horizontal rows or 'periods'. But instead of seeing this as a problem, Mendeleev thought it simply meant that the elements which belonged in the gaps had not yet been discovered.
He was also able to work out the atomic mass of the missing elements, and so predict their properties. And when they
discovered, Mendeleev turned out to be right. For example, he predicted the properties of an undiscovered element that should fit below aluminium in his table. When this element, called gallium, was discovered in 1875, its properties were found to be close to Mendeleev's predictions. Two other predicted elements were later discovered, lending further credit to Mendeleev's table.

Proofreading gives you a chance to make sure no words are missing and the spelling is correct. It is also a good idea to check that punctuation such as question marks, apostrophes, commas and full stops are in the right places.
Proofreading is an important part of the work
During the proofreading stage, you should refer to a dictionary or use the spellcheck and grammar check functions provided in a word processing program. Don't always rely on your computer spellchecker though. It won't pick up errors such as using 'bean' instead of 'been'.
Make sure you leave enough time to proofread because it's an important part of your work.
Many people find it difficult to spot mistakes when reading text on a computer screen, so it's a good idea to print the final copy and proofread it on paper.
It is also a good idea to ask someone else to look over what you have written. A fresh pair of eyes can often spot mistakes you may have missed.

6816,"The ""Golden Age of Farming"" or ""High Farming"" took place in Great Britain between 1840 and 1870. The reason this period is given these two names is because farmers began to use more advanced and scientific techniques on their land for the very first time. These new techniques allowed them to produce higher crop yields, which led to lower food prices.
High Farming was able to take place in Britain for four main reasons:
- from 1801 onwards there was a dramatic rise in the size of the British population and by 1851 there were approximately twice as many people living in Britain as there had been in 1801. These people needed to be fed and many were unable to grow their own food.
- by the mid-1850s most of the population lived in new towns and worked in new factories, so did not have the time or space to grow their own food. Factory owners gave their workers higher wages to spend on food and this made farmers richer.
- the middle of the 19th century also saw an improvement in British transport. For example, there were now 5,000 miles of new railway tracks in Britain, which allowed fresh vegetables, milk and cheese to be moved more quickly around the country. Towns had access to fresh produce for the first time and this encouraged farming.
- British farming benefited from new colleges and institutions being set up to educate a new generation of farmers about new techniques that would give greater yields and more profits. The two most famous educational facilities were the Rothamsted Agricultural Research Station set up in 1842 and the Royal College for Agriculture in 1846.

Bezoar is a stone that grows in the stomach of a goat found in the Middle East. It was thought to be an antidote to poison (the word is Persian, and means 'counterpoison').
The French surgeon-doctor Par tested this in a crude and cruel scientific experiment. He gave poison to a condemned criminal, followed by bezoar, and then observed what happened:
Some years ago, a gentleman boasted before King Charles that bezoar was an antidote for all poisons ... It was an easy matter to make trial of this claim on those condemned to be hanged [and a criminal] had poison administered to him ...
An hour after, I found him on the ground on his hands and feet like an animal, with his tongue hanging out of his mouth, his eyes wild, vomiting, with blood pouring from his ears, nose and mouth. Eventually he died in great torment, seven hours after I gave him the poison. I opened his body and found the bottom of the stomach black and dry, as if it had been burned, whereby I realised that he had been given sublimate of mercury, whose force the bezoar could not stop. Therefore the king commanded: Burn it!

2161,"Seamus Heaney was born in Northern Ireland in 1939, the eldest child in what was to become a family of nine children. His father farmed 50 acres in rural County Derry and was a cattle dealer. Much of Heaney's poetry is centred on the countryside and farm life that he knew as a boy. He won a scholarship to the Catholic boarding school, St Columb's College, Derry, forty miles from home: he was here when his younger brother Christopher was killed, as described in Mid-Term Break.
He studied at Queen's University, Belfast and spent some years teaching. In 1965 he married Marie Devlin, and went on to lecture on poetry at his old university, Queen's, for six years (1966 - 72).
In the 1960s he belonged to a group of poets who, he said, used to talk poetry day after day. He has written many collections of poetry, the first of which was published in 1966. His later works capitalise on his knowledge of Latin, Anglo-Saxon and Gaelic and explore words and their significance. His translation of Beowulf, an Old English

In 1982 he began teaching for one semester a year at Harvard University in the USA. He was appointed Professor of Poetry at Oxford University in 1989 and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1995.
He has lived with his family in Dublin in the Republic of Ireland since 1976.
Listen to the poem and watch the slideshow
We are prepared: we build our houses squat,
Sink walls in rock and roof them with good slate.
The wizened earth had never troubled us
With hay, so as you can see, there are no stacks
Or stooks that can be lost. Nor are there trees
Which might prove company when it blows full
Blast: you know what i mean - leaves and branches
Can raise a chorus in a gale
So that you can listen to the thing you fear
Forgetting that it pummels your house too.
But there are no trees, no natural shelter.
You might think that the sea is company,
But no: when it begins, the flung spray hits
The very windows, spits like a tame cat
Turned savage. We just sit tight while wind dives
And strafes invisibly. Space is a salvo.
We are bombarded by the empty air.
Strange, it is a huge nothing that we fear.
The poem describes the experience of being in a cliff-top cottage on an island off the coast of Ireland during a storm. Heaney describes the bare ground, the sea and the wind. The people in the cottage are extremely isolated and can do nothing against the powerful and violent weather.
The poem consists of nineteen lines of
Lines which don't rhyme, usually in iambic pentameter - 5 two-syllable feet per line.
- unrhyming lines each containing five beats or feet. This
This has two meanings: lines of poetry that form a unit (=stanza), or a broad collective word for poetry.
form (much used by Shakespeare) follows the natural patterns of spoken English, so we feel that Heaney is talking to us.
Think about how the poet uses helps to convey his ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is blunt and explicit. The poem is about a storm on an island. Yet because there is no article ('The' or 'A') before the title, there is a sense that Heaney is not writing about one storm in particular, but about many similar storms. It is an experience he is used to.
The poem is written in the present
The verb formation which describes the time at which the action occurred, eg past, present or future.
A play or other performance in which events and dialogue are portrayed by actors on a stage; from the ancient Greek word for 'acting out'. Can also mean exciting or upsetting events.
and also reinforces the idea that storms happen all the time.
We do not know who is in the cottage with Heaney. He is certainly not alone because he refers to We throughout, but he chooses not to provide us with more details. The wind and waves are the 'characters' in the poem.
The mood or manner of a text or part of a text. The author's 'tone of voice' or way in which they expect to be understood. The emotional load carried by a text.

Heaney speaks in a friendly tone to draw us in. He uses common conversational tags -
(line 12) - to involve us, and reminds us of our own lives:
(line 10). Is he talking to the reader specifically, or to people in general? Do you find that this emphasises how isolated he is on the island?
Many lines are not end stopped but run on from one to another. This is called
Lines in a poem or play that run on from one to another without pause or punctuation.
. Look carefully at the line endings to see the effect enjambment creates. For example:
(line 6/7), which conveys the impression of a gust of wind suddenly 'blasting' in at the start of the line.
, (line 15/16) where the surprise of finding
at the beginning of the line enacts the shock of the cat's sudden change in temperament.
Despite the confident start, by the end of the poem Heaney admits being afraid:
""it is a huge nothing that we fear""
(line 19). Perhaps this suggests that the ultimate power of the storm is that it is an unknown quantity. No one knows what the wind will do and what each storm will bring. Are such fears justified?
(line 3), which at first appears to be a complaint (it is no good for growing crops). However, ironically this turns out to be a blessing as the storm approaches:
""there are no stacks / Or stooks that can be lost.""

during the storm. By telling us what the island lacks (such as haystacks and trees), Heaney emphasises how bare and barren it is. The earth does not seem so considerate now - there is no natural shelter (line 11).
Heaney expects us to imagine the sea

A good way to decide on the

of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
in a solemn, decisive way, showing Heaney's confidence that he will be able to survive the storm?
in a relaxed, chatty way - suggesting that conversation takes his mind off the storm?
in a frightened way, betraying anxiety and fear?
In a way all three tones would be appropriate, because the poem starts off expressing chatty confidence in the island's ability to shrug off the storm. Midway through, however, the use of phrases like 'full / Blast, 'the thing you fear', 'Exploding comfortably' betrays anxiety mixed in with the bravado; while by the end of the poem the storm has become frightening and violent - a spitting cat, a strafing dive-bomber.
The ideas in this poem concern our uneasy relationship to powerful natural forces, and the feelings of vulnerability and fear we feel in the face of the potentially destructive might of a storm. Have a look at these quotes from the poem, and our suggestions about how these ideas are expressed in each of them.
We are prepared: we build our houses squat...
The opening words of the poem suggests a community readying itself to endure wartime bombing or bombardment - an idea which Heaney returns to at the end of the poem.
But there are no trees, no natural shelter.
Heaney seems affectionate towards the island at first, wryly admitting it has never troubled them, yet here the But is significant: it is as if the island has let them down. They are at the mercy of the storm with no natural shelter.
We just sit tight while wind dives And strafes invisibly
Heaney recognises that he is powerless in the storm. There is nothing that man can do but sit tight while the wind attacks. It's like being under enemy fire.
Heaney finds their fears strange because the object of fear is not tangible - it's 'a huge nothing'. So are the fears imaginary or real? Is he afraid of the wind, or doesn't he know what to be afraid of?
In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems describe feelings of vulnerability triggered by aspects of the natural world.
But Clarke is less interested in the actual effect of wind than its symbolic meaning - the windfall branch suggesting death, and the wind in the grass evoking her pen moving across the paper.

descriptions of storms, and both use alliteration and assonance
But while Heaney is indoors, protected against the storm, Whitman is outside in the midst of it.
In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other. The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas, and attitudes and tone
Compare Storm on the Island with one other post-1914 poem and two pre-1914 poems of your choice that describe the power of the wind. What does the description of the wind contribute to each poem?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Gillian Clark's October, G M Hopkin's Inversnaid, and Walt Whitman's Patrolling Barnegat.
What would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing Storm on the Island with each of these three poems.
Storm on the Island: Test (answer hints)
Both poems are written in the first person, but Heaney is more vague - we don't know exactly who is involved, so we don't know whose attitudes we are hearing about.
In October, the weather is less violent than Storm: we hear simply of the Wind in the poplars that breaks a branch. Perhaps the muted weather mirrors Clarke's muted feelings following the death of her friend. For Heaney, the wind is an enemy.
...but for Clarke's this is because the wind's white steps remind her of her own approaching death, whereas for Heaney, the wind contains dangers that are all the more frightening because they seem like a huge nothing.
Both poems are written in the first person
...and both poets use alliteration to create atmosphere.
For Hopkins, the wind is kind and gentle, as if playing with A windpuff bonnet of fawn-froth, in contrast to the danger suggested by Heaney.
Hopkins makes a plea for the wildness and wet to be left, while Heaney accepts the wild weather and tries to cope with his fears.
Again, both poems are written in the first person - but Whitman is actually out in the storm, not protected in a cottage like Heaney.
Both use alliteration to suggest the sound of the wind: spirts of snow fierce slanting (Whitman); Space is a salvo (Heaney).
Both use military imagery: Whitman describes the spray as watchful and firm advancing while Heaney describes the wind as it dives and strafes. What effect does this produce?
Both end with a sense of fear and the unknown - although perhaps Whitman seems more vulnerable on the beach with the savage trinity warily watching than Heaney does in his house.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

3235,"The foremost theory of the origin of the universe is the Big Bang theory. It suggests that the universe began several billion years ago in an explosion that caused it to expand, and to continue expanding. Some of the evidence for the Big Bang comes from studying the red shift of light received from distant galaxies. Telescopes allow us to observe the universe.
Scientists have gathered a lot of evidence and information about the universe. They have used their observations to develop a theory called the Big Bang. The theory states that originally all the matter in the universe was concentrated into a single incredibly tiny point. This began to enlarge rapidly in a hot explosion, and it is still expanding today. This explosion is called the Big Bang, and happened about 13.6 billion years ago (that's 13,600,000,000 years using the scientific definition of 1 billion = 1,000 million).
The Milky Way galaxy is home to planet Earth
Astronomers have even detected a cosmic background radiation that is thought to be the heat left over from the original explosion.
There are two key pieces of evidence for Big Bang theory. These are
You may have noticed that when an ambulance or police car goes past, its siren is high-pitched as it comes towards you, then becomes low-pitched as it goes away. This effect, where there is a change in frequency and wavelength, is called the Doppler effect. It happens with any wave source that moves relative to an observer.
This happens with light too. Our sun contains helium. We know this because there are black lines in the spectrum of the light from the sun, where helium has absorbed light. These lines form the absorption spectrum for helium.
When we look at the spectrum of a distant star, the absorption spectrum is there, but the pattern of lines has moved towards the red end of the spectrum, as you can see below.
This is called red shift. It is a change in frequency of the position of the lines.
Astronomers have found that the further from us a star is the more its light is red shifted. This tells us that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and that the further a galaxy is the faster it is moving away. Since we cannot assume that we have a special place in the universe this is evidence for a generally expanding universe. It suggests that everything is moving away from everything else. The Big Bang theory says that this expansion started billions of years ago with an explosion.
Scientists discovered that there are microwaves coming from every direction in space. Big Bang theory says this is energy created at the beginning of the universe, just after the Big Bang, and that has been travelling through space ever since.
A satellite called COBE has mapped the background microwave radiation of the universe as we see it. Big Bang theorists are still working on the interpretation of this evidence.
A summary of some of the evidence of the Big Bang and its interpretation
The light from other galaxies is red-shifted.
The other galaxies are moving away from us.
The further away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.
The most likely explanation is that the whole universe is expanding. This supports the theory that the start of the universe could have been from a single explosion.
The relatively uniform background radiation is the remains of energy created just after the Big Bang.
Distant stars and galaxies are too far away for us to reach. We cannot go to them to study them. So everything we know about distant stars and galaxies comes from analysing the radiation they produce.
Telescopes are devices used to observe the universe. There are many different types and some are even sited in space.
Optical telescopes observe visible light from space. Small ones allow amateurs to view the night sky relatively cheaply but there are very large optical telescopes sited around the world for professional astronomers to use.
Optical telescopes on the ground have some disadvantages:
they can only be used at night
they cannot be used if the weather is poor or cloudy
Radio telescopes detect radio waves coming from space. Although they are usually very large and expensive, these telescopes have an advantage over optical telescopes. They can be used in bad weather because the radio waves are not blocked by clouds as they pass through the atmosphere. Radio telescopes can also be used in the daytime as well as at night.
X-rays are partly blocked by the Earth's atmosphere and so X-ray telescopes need to be at high altitude or flown in balloons.

from 2005 about the Hubble Space Telescope.
Objects in the universe emit other electromagnetic radiation such as infrared, X-rays and gamma rays. These are all blocked by the Earth's atmosphere, but can be detected by telescopes placed in orbit round the Earth.
Telescopes in space can observe the whole sky and they can operate both night and day. However, they are difficult and expensive to launch and maintain. If anything goes wrong, only astronauts can fix them.

Start by looking closely at the photograph. Write down as many details about it, however small or obvious, you can always eliminate them later.
Also the subject of the source might appear to be obvious, but don't be content with just a glance.
Can you say three things about the photograph?
They are all working together at ploughing a field or cutting corn.
They have been photographed from above so we can see the pattern they make.

In this case, how does the caption affect the
, because it is from the right period?
, because the camera always tells the truth?
, because it is a government photograph?
The date is right, but that does not make it reliable, it just begins to make it useful.
Remember that photographs can be 'set up' to show things that never really happened. The photograph itself can be altered after printing.
This is an important point. The Soviet government may have had all sorts of reasons for putting out this photo as
A type of advertising for an idea or cause, produced by supporters or opponents of that idea or cause. It is usually produced to influence how the people of a nation think.
and therefore it may not be very reliable.
Remember that the question does not ask you about reliability, it asks you about
Having established that the source is not very reliable, how
because it is unreliable? It is Soviet government information and probably biased.
because it tells us what propaganda the Soviet government in the 1930s was putting out?
It is certainly biased information and would not be an accurate record of what was happening on the collective farms, but that does not mean it can be rejected as useless.
The photo may not be reliable as factual evidence of farming practices, but it is very useful as evidence of Soviet propaganda.
How useful is the source as propaganda?
Having established that it is not very reliable as
? Which do you think is the best answer of these?
This evidence is useful for telling us what the Soviet government wanted people to think about what was happening on the farms. Farming was going well; it was mechanised, with lots of tractors.
Soviet agriculture was improving under Stalin's collectivisation plans. They wanted people to think this in order to persuade them to join the collectives, which many peasants opposed.
This answer does not get at the
of the propaganda, which was to persuade the peasants to co-operate in collectivisation.
This is a good answer because it gives the reason for the publication of Soviet government propaganda.
You can see that you have to get past the unreliability of the source and also use your own knowledge of the situation to set the biased evidence in context and so establish its precise usefulness.
A source is never completely useless or completely useful.
Biased, unreliable sources can still be useful.

Bacteria are microscopic organisms that come in many shapes and sizes. But even the largest ones are only 10 micrometres long - 1 micrometre = 1 millionth of a metre.
Hepatitis C virus. DNA are enclosed in a protein coat.
Viruses are many times smaller than bacteria. They consist of a fragment of genetic material inside a protective protein coat.
Viruses cause diseases such as influenza - flu.
Larger fungi include moulds and mushrooms. Microscopic fungi can cause diseases such as athletes foot.
Protozoa are single-celled organisms. Food contaminated with protozoa can cause infections such as amoebic dysentery, of which severe diarrhoea is a symptom.
. These organisms live on, or inside, another organism and cause it harm. Malaria is a disease caused by protozoa that live in the blood. It is passed to a person by an insect vector, the mosquito.
Some diseases are not caused by pathogens. For example:
anaemia is caused by mineral - iron - deficiency
diabetes and cancer are disorders of the body
The body has several defences against pathogens so we do not fall ill with the diseases they cause.
The skin covers the whole body. It protects the body from physical damage, microbe infection and dehydration. Its dry, dead outer cells are difficult for microbes to penetrate, and the sebaceous glands produce oils which help kill microbes.
If microorganisms get into the body through a cut in the skin, the most important thing to do is close the wound quickly so that no more microorganisms can enter. A scab does just that. The blood contains tiny structures called platelets, and a protein called fibrin. A scab is basically platelets stuck in a fibrin mesh. The animation shows how this works:

The respiratory system is protected in several ways. Nasal hairs keep out dust and larger microorganisms. Sticky mucus traps dust and microbes, which are then carried away by cilia - tiny hairs on the cells that line the respiratory system.
Hydrochloric acid in the stomach kills harmful microorganisms that might be in the food or drink that we swallow.

Proteins produced by the body's immune system that attack foreign organisms (antigens) that get into the body.

Pathogens contain certain chemicals that are foreign to the body, called antigens. White blood cells - lymphocytes - carry antibodies - proteins that have a chemical 'fit' to a certain antigen. When a white blood cell with the appropriate antibody meets the antigen, it reproduces quickly and makes many copies of the antibody that neutralises the pathogen. The animation shows how this works:

Once you have been infected with a particular pathogen and produced antibodies against it, some of the white blood cells remain. If you become infected again with the same pathogen, these white blood cells reproduce very rapidly and the pathogen is destroyed. This is

and their existence has been known of for a long time. For example, willow bark was used by the ancient Greeks to help cure fevers and pains. It was later discovered that the active ingredient was salicylic acid. This was modified by chemists into the substance we call aspirin, which is less irritating to the stomach than salicylic acid.
New medical drugs have to be tested to ensure they work and are safe before they can be prescribed. There are three main stages:
The drugs are tested using computer models and human cells grown in the laboratory. Many substances fail this test because they damage cells or do not seem to work.
Drugs that pass the first stage are tested on animals. In the UK, new medicines have to be. But it is illegal to test cosmetics and tobacco products on them. A typical test involves giving a known amount of the substance to the animals, then monitoring them carefully for any side-effects.
Drugs that have passed animal tests are used in clinical trials. They are tested on healthy volunteers to check they are safe. The substances are then tested on people with the illness to ensure they are safe and work.
You may wish to view this BBC News item from 2006 about a drugs trial that left six volunteers very ill.
Most substances do not pass all the tests and trials, so drug development is expensive and takes a long time.
Medical drug trials are not without risk. Sometimes severe and unexpected side-effects occur.
People can be immunised against a pathogen through vaccination. Different vaccines are needed for different
Vaccination involves putting a small amount of an inactive form of a pathogen, or dead pathogen, into the body. Vaccines can contain:
live pathogens treated to make them harmless
a type of natural poison produced by an organism, often as a form of protection
These all act as antigens. When injected into the body, they stimulate white blood cells to produce antibodies against the pathogen.
Because the vaccine contains only a weakened or harmless version of a pathogen, the vaccinated person is not in danger of developing disease - although some people may suffer a mild reaction. If the person does get infected by the pathogen later, the required lymphocytes are able to reproduce rapidly and destroy it.

2728,"The lowland areas across Great Britain, where ancient glaciers have created plains and rolling landscapes and deposited fertile material transported from highland areas, provide an opportunity for different activities.
Lowland areas provide much more suitable locations than harsh highland areas for building villages, towns and cities. Edinburgh, for example, is situated on the site of an ancient glacier.
Towns displace vegetation and wildlife and transform landscapes. They also create problems such as pollution and water and power consumption.
The more fertile lowlands offer much better opportunities for arable and pastoral farming than the highlands.
This creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.
Intensive farming displaces vegetation and wildlife. It also damages the environment through the use of fertilisers, pesticides and weed killers, and may spread disease to animals and humans.
Lowland areas attract tourists who do recreational activities including horse riding, walking, fishing, boating and many others.
Fertile areas are also good for creating golf courses.
Badly-managed tourism can cause damage to the environment through soil erosion, pollution and over fishing.
It can also interfere with local livelihoods (eg those of farmers).

2569,"Charles Darwin was an English naturalist who studied variation in plants and animals during a five-year voyage around the world. He explained his ideas on evolution in a book called
The main features in his theory are that:
individuals in a population show natural variation
individuals with characteristics best suited to their environment are more likely to survive to reproduce
Species unable to compete successfully eventually become extinct.
Darwins ideas caused a lot of controversy, and this continues today. They can be seen as conflicting with religious views about the creation of the world and the creatures in it.
Darwin was not the only person to develop a theory of evolution. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck was a French scientist who developed an alternative theory at the beginning of the 19th century. His theory centred on two ideas:
the law of inheritance of acquired characteristics
His theory stipulated that a characteristic which is used more and more by an organism becomes bigger and stronger. One that is not used disappears eventually. Any characteristic of an organism that is improved through use is passed to its offspring.
These lists summarise the two different explanations for long necks in giraffe.
a giraffe stretches its neck to reach food high up
the giraffe's neck gets longer because it's used a lot
the giraffe's offspring inherit its long neck
a giraffe with a longer neck can reach food high up
a giraffe is more likely to get enough food to survive to reproduce
a giraffe's offspring inherit its long neck
Lamarcks theory was eventually discredited because acquired characteristics do not have a genetic basis. In addition, his theory cannot account for all the observations made of life on Earth. For instance, it would predict that all organisms gradually become complex, and simple organisms disappear. Darwins theory can account for the continued presence of simple organisms.

The first line of defence is the body's natural barriers. These include:
Tiny hairs, which line the respiratory tract. They beat continuously to move mucus and dirt up the bronchi and trachea.

Politicians, who want to appear tough on crime, are in the forefront of this process. They encourage police and schools to treat drug use - which in the majority of instances means possession of soft drugs - in a draconian, inflexibly judgmental manner.

Elizabeth discovers Lady Catherine rules the parish. Darcy arrives with his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam.
Colonel Fitzwilliam enjoys talking to Elizabeth, but Lady Catherine butts in to make herself the centre of attention again. Elizabeth sings and impresses. She criticises Darcy for not dancing at the first ball they went to. Although he defends himself, he's more polite than before, not that Elizabeth notices. He praises her singing.

The housekeeper shows them around Pemberley. Elizabeth thinks how nice it would've been to live there. Then again, her family wouldn't have been allowed to visit, due to Darcy's pride.
The housekeeper praises Darcy in every regard, saying how kind and generous he is to everyone, even servants, although he's naturally quiet. This makes Elizabeth feel even more warmly towards him. On leaving, they meet Darcy and the atmosphere is very uneasy. He's very polite and Elizabeth is affected by this. Darcy meets them in the park later and is very gracious. He invites Elizabeth to meet his sister.
Georgiana Darcy is shy. Bingley appears. Elizabeth sees that Miss Bingley was lying when she said her brother was in love with Darcy's sister. She sees that Bingley regrets leaving Netherfield. Darcy's kindness extends to inviting Elizabeth's family to Pemberley. Elizabeth feels grateful that Darcy doesn't resent her.
Mrs Gardiner and Elizabeth visit Georgiana. Things are awkward because she's very quiet. The Bingley sisters are there, and rude. Miss Bingley jealously tries to stop any relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy by mentioning Wickham. She doesn't know about Wickham and Georgiana; Darcy and his sister are embarrassed. When Elizabeth leaves, Miss Bingley criticises her, but Darcy says he thinks the opposite.
Elizabeth receives letters from Jane telling her Wickham has ran away with Lydia, and Mr Bennet is going to London to look for them. Elizabeth is very upset and tells Darcy she should have realised Wickham was bad. Darcy is silent; Elizabeth believes he now thinks less of her. Elizabeth and the Gardiners set off home.
The Gardiners try to persuade Elizabeth that Wickham might intend to marry Lydia. Elizabeth knows this isn't the case and tells them the truth about him. Elizabeth arrives home to find her mother depressed, and reads a letter Lydia has written to Mrs Forster that simply reflects how foolish she is.

Choose the extract that you like best:
I noticed that there was something strange about the light. The forest had been both dark and bright by turns, but here everything was lit in an unchanging twilight, more like dusk than midday. I looked up, following the trunk of one of the giant trees. The height of the tree alone was breathtaking. Higher up the branches curved upwards across the clearing like gables until they joined with the branches on the other side. But their point of joining seemed too dense and thick, and as I looked harder I began to see that they were coiled around each other, intertwining to form a cavernous ceiling of wood and leaves, hanging with stalactite vines that now became magically appropriate.
They were getting deeper into the jungle now. The light was greyish, with dazzling patches of sunlight. Whichever way one looked ones view was shut in by the multitudinous ranks of trees, and the tangled bushes and creepers that struggled round their bases like a bramble bush extending mile after mile, that ones eyes were oppressed by it. Some of the creepers were huge, like serpents. Flory and Elizabeth struggled along narrow game-tracks, up slippery banks, thorns tearing at their clothes. Both of their shirts were drenched with sweat. It was stifling hot with a scent of crushed leaves. Sometimes for minutes together invisible cicadas would keep up a shrill metallic pinging like the twanging of a steel guitar, and then, by stopping, make a silence that startled one.
The shore was fledged with palm trees. These stood or leaned or reclined against the light and their green feathers were a hundred feet up in the air. The ground beneath them was a bank covered with coarse grass, torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees, scattered with decaying coconuts and palm saplings. Behind this was the darkness of the forest proper and the open space of the scar.
Going up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings. An empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest. The air was warm, thick, heavy, sluggish. There was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine. The long stretches of the waterway ran on, deserted, into the gloom of overshadowed distances. On silvery sandbanks hippos and alligators sunned themselves side by side. The broadening waters flowed through a mob of wooded islands; you lost your way on that river as you would in a desert, and butted all day long against shoals, trying to find the channel, till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for ever from everything you had known once  somewhere  far away  in another existence perhaps.

6369,"Although we eventually discover that Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde are the same person, for most of the novel we are led to believe they are different characters, so we will discuss them separately.
Jekyll is a doctor and experimental scientist.
He has been a sociable person in the past, with a circle of friends including the lawyer, Utterson, and another doctor, Lanyon.
During the course of the novel his behaviour becomes increasingly
His will states that if he disappears he leaves everything to Hyde. His oldest friend, Utterson, knows nothing of Hyde and urges Jekyll to change his will. He fears Hyde has a mysterious, perhaps criminal, hold over Jekyll, and that Hyde might murder him to benefit from the will.
In the last chapter we learn that Jekyll has been carrying out experiments to separate his personality (the 'evil' part embodied in Hyde) from his higher nature. Hyde eventually becomes more powerful and takes over.
He is described as small ('dwarfish') and young.
People react with horror and fear when they see him. But there is no single thing about him that is especially unpleasant; it is as if his spirit affects people.
He is violent, and has no sense of guilt about his crimes. In Chapter 1, Hyde assaults a young girl, and in Chapter 4 he beats an elderly gentleman to death. He has no motive for either of these attacks.
His appearances in the novel are always brief. People only catch impressions of him, before he vanishes into the dark or behind a door.
Utterson is an old friend of Jekyll, and his lawyer.
He is calm and rational, just as lawyers are supposed to be. Rather like a scientist, his approach in life is to weigh up the evidence.
Utterson is 'a lover of the sane and customary sides of life'. Stevenson probably uses him to represent the attitudes of the average reader of his time.
His sense of shock and horror when he first meets Hyde is, by contrast to his normal reaction to things, irrational: 'not all these points together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust, loathing and fear with which Mr Utterson regarded him.'
He spends much of the novel trying to advise and help Jekyll, giving advice about his will and avoiding Hyde, and trying to help him when he shuts himself in his room. Jekyll recognises that he is a good friend, but rejects all his offers of help.
At no stage does he suspect Jekyll and Hyde are the same person. However, he makes observations whereby the reader can, looking back, see the evidence. For instance, he asks his chief clerk, Mr Guest, to look at Hyde's handwriting. When Guest sees that Hyde's and Jekyll's writing is strangely similar, though with different directions of slope, Utterson draws the wrong conclusion: that Jekyll has forged Hyde's handwriting to protect him.
In Chapter 8, Utterson goes home to read the documents found in Jekyll's laboratory and promises Jekyll's servant he will return before midnight. The novel ends with two chapters containing the two documents he goes home to read. The reader never discovers Utterson's reaction to them, or what action he takes. He is left as an uncompleted character. This is perhaps Stevenson's way of showing that sensible, rational people do not always have all the answers.
He and Jekyll were once close friends and went to medical school together.
Lanyon is respectable and conventional. He follows all the rules and obeys the law.
He believes in science and the world of real, material things.
He is a big contrast with Jekyll, who likes to live dangerously and experiment with the
He disagrees with Jekyll's ideas and calls them 'scientific
'. In Chapter 2, Lanyon has not seen Jekyll since he started to become 'too fanciful' and 'wrong in mind'.
Dr Jekyll, on the other hand, regards him as 'hidebound' (conventional and unadventurous) in his attitude to medical science.
Lanyon is the only person to actually see Hyde transforming into Jekyll, something that does not fit the laws of science. When he sees the change, he cannot cope with the fight between his common-sense view of the world and what Jekyll's experiments reveal. ""I ask myself if I believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots."" Not long after he becomes mentally and physically ill, and dies.
A distant relative of Utterson, Enfield is a well-known man about town and the complete opposite to Utterson.
Poole appears briefly in the novel from time to time, notably when Utterson goes to visit Jekyll.
In Chapter 8, he goes to Utterson's house to report the strange goings on in Jekyll's house. He helps Utterson to break down the door.
Sir Danvers is a distinguished elderly gentleman who is beaten to death by Hyde. This is a turning point in the novel.
Mr Guest is Utterson's secretary and a handwriting expert. In Chapter 5, he comments on the remarkable similarity between Jekyll and Hyde's handwriting.

1156,"The Sun provides a stable source of heat and light energy. Photocells transfer light into electricity, and glass can provide passive heating for buildings. Wind turbines transfer kinetic energy in the wind into electricity.
The Sun is a stable source of energy that is transferred to the Earth as light energy and heat energy. We can use this energy.
Photocells are devices that transfer light energy directly into electrical energy. They produce DC -
- electricity. This is electricity in which the current moves in the same direction all the time.
Photocells have no moving parts, and can work in remote locations. For example, they are used to power the lights for some road signs.
The output of photocells depends on the surface area that is exposed to light. For a given light intensity, the larger the area, the greater the power output.
The Hubble Space Telescope uses photocells to generate the electricity it needs - image courtesy of NASA
You may have seen photocells in pocket calculators. Very large panels of photocells are used to power satellites in orbit around Earth.
Photocells produce no power in bad weather, or at night. But sunlight is a renewable energy resource and photocells do not produce polluting waste while they are in use. Here are some other advantages to photocells:
they have a long life and are rugged - little maintenance is required
for buildings. Sunlight passes through the glass and is absorbed by surfaces in the building. It is transferred into heat energy, which is emitted as infrared radiation. This is reflected back into the building by the glass.
Solar panels do not generate electricity - rather they heat up water. They are often located on the roofs of buildings, where they can receive energy from the Sun. The diagram outlines how they work:
A pump pushes cold water from the storage tank through pipes in the solar panel. The water is heated by energy from the Sun and returns to the tank. In some systems, a conventional boiler is used to increase the temperature of the water.
Solar collectors use mirrors to focus the Suns rays onto a small area. In some parts of the world, this idea is used to make simple solar ovens to cook food without using fuel. More complex solar collectors use
to reflect the Suns rays onto a focus point. Motors are used so that the collector moves to track the position of the Sun in the sky.
Wind is produced as a result of giant convection currents in the Earth's atmosphere, which are driven by heat energy from the Sun. This means the kinetic energy in wind is a renewable energy resource: so long as the Sun exists, wind will too.
Wind turbines have huge blades mounted on a tall tower. The blades are connected to a nacelle, or housing, that contains gears linked to a generator. As the wind blows, it transfers some of its kinetic energy to the blades, which turn and drive the generator.
Several wind turbines may be grouped together in windy locations to form
Photocells consist of two types of silicon crystal. When light energy is absorbed by the silicon:
negatively charged electrons are knocked loose from the silicon atoms
the electrons flow freely, creating an electric current
Positive 'holes' are also formed, which move in the opposite direction to the electrons

A battle during the War in the Pacific, between the US and Japan, 1941-45
Here are some points you might have included:
Uncle Frank was waiting to be drafted.
The mother and Uncle Frank talked seriously about German planes and bombs.
There was a Civil Defence sign drawing competition.
The schoolchildren practiced for an air raid.
Sheldon played at being a Nazi, and his uncle was perhaps a prisoner of war.
There was a film about prisoners of war being tortured by the Japanese.
During the tag game, the children could hear the planes across the bay.
Why did Plath include so many references to the war when the story is about a group of children playing in the snow? Think about these points:
At the start, the narrator hardly notices the threat of war because she is so caught up in her own private world of Superman.
The war gradually affects the narrator more and more - her uncle might be drafted, she practices for an air raid - but she does not seem worried (despite the fact that the adults are).
She is physically affected when she sees the horrific way the Japanese treated their prisoners of war. After that experience, she cannot dream of Superman again, so we know her childhood is beginning to fade.
The group of children have their own mini 'war' when Paula blames the narrator for spoiling her snowsuit. The narrator is the innocent victim and everyone else becomes her enemy. She is scarred for ever by the experience.
As World War Two rages on, the narrator gradually becomes more aware of its horrors - and has to fight her own 'war'.

though, and overcame their difficulties with great energy.
Problems and solutions on the journey West
On their trek to the Great Salt Lake the Mormons faced many problems, all of which they had to overcome:
In Spring 1846, mobs looted Mormons' workshops, forcing them to leave Nauvoo before they were ready for their long trek to Salt Lake.
Brigham Young (Mormon leader) sent advance 'pioneers' ahead, to plant crops, build houses, set up staging posts for the travellers.
The Mormons faced a journey of 2,250km, which made them 'weary and footsore'. They endured 'stormy weather' in winter; and 'excessive heat' in summer.
On the journey 15,000 Mormons faced accidents, breakdowns, mouldy food, fever, lack of medical facilities, Native American attacks.
Young taught Mormons how to manage a wagon train, and how to defend themselves against attack at night.
Some Mormons preferred Oregon. Another suggested California, and said 'nobody on earth' would want to live at Salt Lake.
""If there is a place on this earth that nobody wants, that's the place I'm looking for.""

This is a still-image of our work when we were
the abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison. We were trying to communicate that the prisoner was being intimidated by two US soldiers, and that this was a harrowing experience for the prisoner.
I feel we should have arranged the image better, so that the proxemics could more easily show what was happening. If the prisoner had been placed facing the audience it would have been easier to see his expression, and if the two soldiers had been placed a little upstage on each side of the prisoner, we could have shown the expressions of everyone - and the face of one soldier character would not have been hidden by their hair.
The prisoner should have looked more intimidated than is shown in the actor's body language - she looked too relaxed to communicate the terror the prisoner must have felt.
The candidate has written well about the image, and has included some evaluative remarks that point out the shortcomings of the group's work. It is clear that the candidate realizes how the work could have been improved, and this demonstrates understanding of the process.
Student example: using an image in the 'Development' phase
Students acting a scene set in Abu Ghraib prison
During the phase of the work when we were
scenes to show the abuse in Abu Ghraib prison, we were working to show how the soldiers were intimidated by their own superior officers, because of the abuse that they were investigating.
We wanted to show how by making the officer stand behind the soldier, with the soldier too scared to turn around, we were able to show the status of the officer.
We could also show the way in which he could signal his feelings to the audience, without the prisoner seeing any facial expressions.
This would also leave the soldier able to show his own anxiety in the situation, through his body language and facial expressions. The actor here was able to signal this well.
Here the image is commented on by the candidate, and it is clear that the proxemics are such that the candidates were able to heighten the sense of anxiety in the scene, and to show this to the audience. The candidate has explained well the reasons for their staging of this sequence.
Student example: using an image in the 'Evaluation' phase
Students acting out a scene set in a care home
This image shows our work at a point when we, the staff in the care home, were taking the old lady away from her room to clean her up after she had spilled her food.
We wanted to show that the staff can be harsh in their treatment of the elderly residents of the home and that they don't treat some of their residents as they state in their brochures.
As it is shown here, the staff members look as if they are not caring, and I think that this would be clear to an audience. I think we were able to show that the old woman looks scared and that the staff look uncaring about her fears.
The girl playing the old lady is showing through her facial expression and body language that she is scared and we planned that the audience would be shocked by this treatment of her.
The comment by the candidate has first been put into context, so that the situation is more understandable. The evaluation and reflection on his / her work illustrates some strong aspects, and others where the candidate feels that improvements could be made. This indicates that the candidate has a good level of knowledge and understanding.

George is not lonely during the novel, as he has Lennie. He will be lonely afterwards, without his best friend.
George and Lennie share a dream - to own a little patch of land and live on it in freedom. He is so set on the idea that he even knows of some land that he thinks they could buy.
Lennie is the only character who is innocent enough not to fear loneliness, but he is angry when Crooks suggests George won't come back to him.
George and Lennie share a dream - to own a little patch of land and live on it in freedom. Lennie's main desire is to tend the soft-haired rabbits they will keep.
She is married to a man she doesn't love and who doesn't love her. There are no other women on the ranch and she has nothing to do. She tries to befriend the men by hanging round the bunkhouse.
She dreams of being a movie star. Her hopes were raised by a man who claimed he would take her to Hollywood, but when she didn't receive a letter from him, she married Curley.
When Candy's ancient, ill dog was shot, Candy has nothing left. He delayed killing the dog, even though he knew deep down that it was the best thing, as he dreaded losing his long-time companion.
Candy joins George and Lennie's plan of owning a piece of land. His savings make the dream actually possible to achieve.
Crooks lives in enforced solitude, away from the other men. He is bitter about being a back-busted nigger. He is thrilled when Lennie and Candy come into his room and are his companions for a night.
Crooks dreams of being seen as equal to everyone else. He knows his civil rights. He remembers fondly his childhood, when he played with white children who came to his family's chicken ranch, and longs for a similar relationship with white people again.

The interior and exterior angles add up to 180 (a straight line - eg, a + f = 180), and
The sum of the exterior angles is 360 (a + b + c + d + e = 360).
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 120. Calculate the number of sides.
The interior angles are 120, so the exterior angles are 180 - 120 = 60. The exterior angles add up to 360, so if we divide 360 by 60 we find there are 6 exterior angles. Therefore, there are
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 150. Calculate the number of sides.

Methods of diagnosis changed massively during the course of the 19th century.
(France: 1816) invented the stethoscope and started the practice of 'auscultation' (listening to the patient's chest).
(France: 1834) argued that symptoms were irrelevant, and that what was happening inside the body was much more important when it came to diagnosing illness. As a result, doctors made diagnoses on the basis of a full clinical examination of the 'signs' made by the disease on the body.

(France: 1906) developed the BCG injection against TB.
(Germany: 1913) developed an anti-toxin against diphtheria.
(Germany: 1890s) reasoned that, if certain dyes could stain bacteria, perhaps certain chemicals could kill them. He set up a private laboratory and a team of scientists. By 1914 they had discovered several 'magic bullets' - compounds that would have a specific attraction to disease-causing microorganisms in the body, and that would target and kill them. These were methylene blue (for malaria), trypan red (for sleeping sickness) and Salvarsan (for syphilis) - although Salvarsan was more effective than the other two.

In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.

Sujata Bhatt: from Search For My Tongue
The poem is written in three sections:
The poet expresses how hard it is for her to know two languages, but neglect the one she feels most belongs to her.
She then translates her thoughts for us into English (so lines 31-38 mean something similar to lines 17-30), showing that although her 'mother tongue' dies during the day, it 'grows back' in her dreams at night, becoming strong and producing 'blossoms'.
How many meanings does the word 'tongue' have in the poem? Consider these:
It is a part of the body - the part you speak with.
It has also come to mean the language that you speak.
The phrase 'lost my tongue' (line 2) is used in a
sense to mean that someone is tongue-tied and does not know what to say.

we saw how you could use short quotations as evidence.
We might want to say Tybalt is an aggressive and angry character. We can support this view by looking at his language. He asks Benvolio to look upon his death, he says he hates the word 'peace', and when he sees Romeo at the party he asks for his 'rapier' or sword and says he will 'strike him dead'.
Here we are using two ways to provide evidence. Words that are directly from the play are put in quotation marks, for example, 'I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.' The second way is to describe what is said in your own words, for example, Tybalt tells Benvolio how much he hates him.
It is often good to combine these methods, perhaps quoting just one word from the play. For instance, Tybalt calls Benvolio a 'coward'. The one thing you should avoid is using a long quotation. Many students write out whole chunks of the play. This is just like retelling the story - there is no reason for it and you will get no marks for it.

And the children may have been brought up in the city and grown up as migrants, but the mothers will probably remember that in the village they came from, they would have to walk miles with pots to get to a well, to the closest water source. So it really is very precious. When the water comes, it's like a god.

Earthquakes can destroy settlements and kill many people. Aftershocks can cause even more damage to an area. It is possible to classify the impacts of an earthquake, by taking the following factors into account:
economic impacts (the impact on the wealth of an area)
environmental impacts (the impact on the landscape)
People may be killed or injured. Homes may be destroyed. Transport and communication links may be disrupted. Water pipes may burst and water supplies may be contaminated.
Shops and business may be destroyed. Looting may take place. The damage to transport and communication links can make trade difficult.
The built landscape may be destroyed. Fires can spread due to gas pipe explosions. Fires can damage areas of woodland. Landslides may occur. Tsunamis may cause flooding in coastal areas.
Disease may spread. People may have to be re-housed, sometimes in refugee camps.
The cost of rebuilding a settlement is high. Investment in the area may be focused only on repairing the damage caused by the earthquake. Income could be lost.
Important natural and human landmarks may be lost.
Effects are often classified as primary and secondary impacts. Primary effects occur as a direct result of the ground shaking, eg buildings collapsing. Secondary effects occur as a result of the primary effects, eg tsunamis or fires due to ruptured gas mains.

He is sensible: it was Ralph's idea to have a chief, establish rules and build a signal fire so they can be rescued. He speaks wisely.
He is a good leader. He knows that it's important to keep Jack on his side and speaks to Piggy with the directness of genuine leadership. Later on he feels the weight of being chief as a personal hell - but he doesn't give up.

4489,"We have already looked at one aspect of language - in the section on
we saw how you could use short quotations as evidence.
We might want to say Don John is an aggressive and angry character. We can then support this view by looking at his language. He says that if he had a mouth he ""would bite"", and that he only has his unhappiness to make use of.
Here we are using two ways to provide evidence: words that are directly from the play are put in quotation marks, for example, ""I am a plain-dealing villain."" The second way is to describe what is said in your own words, for instance, Don John plans to stop Claudio's marriage to Hero. It is often good to combine these methods, perhaps quoting just one word from the play. For instance, Don John despises Claudio and calls him a ""start-up"" (an 'upstart' in modern English).
The one thing you should avoid is using a long quotation. Many students write out whole chunks of the play. This is just like retelling the story - there is no reason for it, and you will not get any marks for it.
We can also deal with language in
by looking at the techniques Shakespeare used. Some of these techniques (and names) might seem difficult at first. If that is the case, just think about what the play would sound like if the technique was not used. For instance, when Claudio is rejecting Hero at the church, imagine he says to Leonato:
Well, yes, it is easy to understand, but it is not unusual or interesting. And it does not show how bitter Claudio is. So instead, he says:
""Give not this rotten orange to your friend""
The ""rotten orange"" is Hero. Claudio is talking about her as if she is beautiful on the outside but decayed inside - she has turned bad but no-one has seen this yet. Claudio's words are unusual, but the audience can immediately relate to them and remember his ideas. So if you are not too sure of a technique, remove it and compare the two versions - what effect does Shakespeare's technique have on you?
. Imagery is when we might talk about one thing in terms of another. So Benedick is described as if he were a ""disease"" which Claudio has caught - he will ""hang upon him"", make Claudio ""mad"" and cost a huge amount of money to ""be cured"". Imagery substitutes one thing for another in three main ways:
- when a direct comparison is made (with 'as', 'than' or 'like'). Benedick says he ""was duller than a great thaw"", while Borachio compares fashion-conscious men to soldiers and priests. These ideas allow us our own interpretations. Is fashion like being in the army and being told what to wear - or everyone looking the same?
- when one thing is called something else, such as Claudio calling Hero a ""jewel"". If he had said she is ""like a jewel"" it would be a simile. But he says she actually is ""a jewel"", so it is a metaphor. Think about the qualities of a jewel: it is valuable, beautiful and rare. Then think about how Claudio views Hero - is she something to admire and possess, rather than someone to love?
- where something is described as if it is human. Beatrice talks about how a ""star danced"", and Leonato says ""happiness takes his leave"".
. A lot of jokes are puns: a play on words using words that sound similar but have different meanings. So, when Beatrice says Claudio is ""civil as an orange"", she plays on the similarity between 'civil' and 'Seville'. He is either polite or bitter (like the oranges from Seville).
is when characters give quick, witty replies. We see this most often with Beatrice and Benedick. For instance, when they argue in Act 1, Scene 1, they are able to twist the other person's words around. And both want to have the final word.
. Repeating a word or phrase draws attention to it. For instance, in Act 5, Scene 2, Beatrice says:
""Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath""
The word 'foul' is repeated six times in just three lines. This is not by accident. Shakespeare is drawing attention to how unhappy Beatrice is. Another way of repeating ideas is to use
, such as Benedick in Act 3, Scene 2 talking of a Dutchman, Frenchman, German and Spaniard.
are also used frequently. They highlight the conflicts in the story between men and women, truth and lies, or being single and getting married. There are lots of examples. One of the clearest is Beatrice's explanation for not getting married (in Act 2, Scene 1):
""He that hath a beard is more than a youth: and he that hath no beard is less than a man: and he that is more than a youth, is not for me. and he that is less than a man, I am not for him""
Another way of looking at the language of
is to examine the lines. Shakespeare used different patterns of lines for different effects. Some are written in
, so they have ten syllables which are organised in five pairs. The first syllable is weak, the second stronger. So if we look at a typical line, we traditionally show the weak or unstressed syllable with an 'x' above it, and the stressed syllable with an '/' above it. In this example Claudio is saying goodbye to Hero:
x / x / x / x / x /
But fare thee well, most foul, most fair, farewell
Reading it like this, we can hear an obvious beat. We can also see that the key words tend to be stronger and carry more meaning. They also seem to sum up Claudio's contradictory views of his rejected bride: fare - well - foul - fair - well.
Most tasks allow you to write or talk about how language is used in the play. So imagine your title is: 'How does Beatrice change during the course of
?' There are all sorts of references you can make to language:
When we first meet Beatrice, she seems to be a clever, independent woman. She speaks openly, not waiting to be asked, and seems to like making fun of Benedick in particular. She compares him with ""a disease"", and her repartee makes even the messenger afraid of her. Throughout the play she uses puns, such as saying Claudio is ""civil as an orange"". This shows her witty nature, because she plays on the similarity between ""civil"" and ""Seville"": he is either polite or bitter (just like the oranges from Seville).
This combines much of what we have covered so far. It starts to answer the question without filling up the page with irrelevant facts, plot details and fancy technical terms. Remember, you do not have to tick off the language terms like a trainspotter. Instead, show you appreciate some of the techniques Shakespeare used, and the effects they have on his audience.

6802,"A real challenge with any religion comes when people ask, 'Why do you believe?' The answer is not often very easy to give as an undeniable 'truth', but that's because there is a difference between religious belief and other beliefs.
People talk about truth in five different ways.
This is the sort of truth that we can find in pictures, novels or films. We are not saying that what we are looking at, reading or watching is actually true. However, we might say that it is 'true to life'. By this we mean that it is believable - it could happen - although it is not actually true itself.
This is quite straightforward. We can say that we 'know' that something happened in the past even though we were not there and did not see it for ourselves. We know that it happened because we have seen
, such as archaeological or films or documents, and from this evidence we can know that certain things happened.
When we talk about moral truth we mean that we 'know' that something is right or wrong. This is almost like an
. We know that it is wrong to steal or to kill people. We may also know that we will be punished in some way if we do this but we are saying that we know
that this is wrong anyway. This sort of truth is linked with the moral argument for the existence of God.
Scientists can only say that something is true if they can prove it by
; they have to be able to show that each time they conduct the experiment the same thing happens. When the same result is obtained from an experiment that is repeated over and over again, this is known as
evidence and is the basis of scientific truth.
This is the sort of truth which we find in religion. This sort of truth deals with
. People may say that they 'know' God but they cannot prove it in a scientific way and, unlike some of the other sorts of truth, it is very difficult to persuade other people if they are sceptical or do not believe themselves.
People who follow a particular religion may say that by doing so they are
the 'real truth' about life and about God. This definition of truth is linked with the argument from experience.
One of the problems is that often people from different religions claim that they have the truth and that other people do not. This is a difficult situation because it may be almost impossible to convince other people that you are right.

People should contribute to the public wealth according to their ability, but receive according to their needs.

If you worked through the Revision and Test Bites, you will have spotted lots of advice about how to answer questions. Can you remember what was said? Doing well in examinations is not just about learning the subject, it's also about making sure that you understand the questions and write good answers. So what should you do if you are going to do as well as possible in an examination? Here are some tips:
Make sure that you arrive in good time for the examination. Get everything that you need ready in advance. There's nothing worse than having to rush.
Check the starting time and how long the exam will last. Do not get taken by surprise. You can get this information from your teacher at school.
Make sure you know how many questions you have to answer and how long you can afford to spend on each.
Make sure that your watch is working. Put it on your desk where you can see it, rather than wearing it on your wrist where you will have to stop and look at it.
Always have at least two pens and make sure that they are working. They must be blue or black - but check this with your teacher first.
If you like to draw diagrams, have a pencil handy and sharpen it.
Make sure that you have everything else that you need. A picture of your pet or something that makes you laugh will help you feel positive in your exam.
Make sure that you understand where you have a choice of questions. You usually do on history papers. Check back through some Revision Bites to see some example questions if you are not sure what they will be like.
Always read the question carefully and spot the key words,
, etc. Usually the two papers will have different types of questions. One will be
. Make sure you know which is which.
Plan your answer before you start writing. It helps just to jot down a list of points and then cross them off when you write your answer. This is really important in order to make sure you do not forget to include all your points.
Make sure that you are answering the
and not the question which you hoped would be on the paper! This is the commonest mistake made in examinations.
It counts for half the marks lost by candidates in examinations
If the question is made up of sub-questions, read through all of them first. This will help you to decide if you can answer the question. It will also help you to work out how long to spend on each question.
Sometimes one sub-question will lead on to another. Try to make sure that you do not put the two answers together.
Check the number of marks for each sub-question. The more marks available, the longer the answer should be normally.
SPG stands for Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar. How neat your handwriting is does not count but it helps if you try to keep it in order.
There are an extra five marks available for correct SPG. To get five marks you will need to spell accurately and express yourself clearly. You will need to use correct historical terms. Here are a couple of examples:
The Prime Minister of Germany is called the Chancellor.
When talking about after 1924 Russia should be called the Soviet Union.
Make sure that you use capital letters for all names of people, countries, cities, towns etc.
Copy words carefully from the question paper, particularly names like Czechoslovakia.
Put full stops after every sentence and make sure that each sentence makes sense.
Check through your answers if you have time.
Remember that your answers will be marked by someone who does not know you.
The examiner will not be able to understand your answer if you do not explain things properly.
Make your answers as clear as possible. Do not try to be funny.

The ability of a battery to supply electrical energy is called its
. The capacity of a battery is measured in amp-hours. This unit has the symbol
. You might also see battery capacity shown in milliamp-hours -
, especially on rechargeable batteries for mobile phones.
Here is the equation for working out a battery's capacity:
capacity = current supplied  length of time supplied
So, a battery that can supply 2 amps for 4 hours has a capacity of 2  4 = 8 Ah.
It is helpful to know how long a given battery should be able to supply electrical energy for. To do so, we re-arrange the equation above like this:
length of time supplied = capacity  current supplied
How long can a 10 Ah battery supply 2 A of electricity?
length of time supplied = 10  2 = 5 hours
How long can a 4 Ah battery supply 8 A of electricity?
length of time supplied = 4  8 = 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes)
There are two main types of battery: non-rechargeable batteries and rechargeable batteries.
Ordinary 'dry-cell' batteries are non-rechargeable. As the reactants inside them become used up in chemical reactions, the output from these batteries gradually falls. Once all the reactants have been used up, these batteries go 'flat' and cannot supply electrical energy anymore.
Rechargeable batteries usually maintain a constant output until just before they go flat. They contain reactants that can be made again just by passing electricity through the products. Once the battery has gone flat, it can be connected to a recharger. This uses electrical energy to reverse the chemical reactions that happened in the battery while it was in use.
Car batteries are rechargeable batteries - they are constantly recharged while the car is moving, so the lights and horn will always work.
Mobile phones, many MP3 players and other portable devices use rechargeable batteries. They must be recharged at regular intervals. It is usually recommended that such batteries should almost be flat before recharging. This allows the battery to be fully charged again.
Advantages and disadvantages of rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries
expensive to use in the long run as more are needed (high cost / performance ratio)
cheap in the long run as they can be re-used (low cost / performance ratio)
disposal of many batteries creates a lot of chemical pollution
disposal of fewer batteries creates less chemical pollution
Technology has improved over time. These are some of the devices that have improved during the last few decades:
rechargeable batteries - smaller, higher capacity, faster recharge times
microprocessors or computer chips - smaller and faster
computer memory chips and disk drives - smaller, faster, higher capacity
The number of transistors on a single computer chip has increased hugely over the past 30 years or so
All these devices have also become cheaper as a result of improvements such as these:
computers have become small enough to carry around, instead of occupying a whole room
mobile phones have reduced in size and weight, remain on for longer and have more features
many household appliances are controlled by microprocessors
new devices have been invented, including digital cameras and MP3 players

In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other.
The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas and attitudes and tone.
Compare I've made out a will.. with one other post-1914 poem and two pre-1914 poems of your choice that are written in sonnet form. Why do you think the poets decided on this form for these poems?

1043,"into perspective, you'll need to know a little about William Shakespeare, the city of Venice during the 16th century, and attitudes towards Jews in Shakespeare's England.
William Shakespeare was born in Stratford upon Avon in 1564. His father was a glove merchant and a prominent local dignitary. William, one of eight children, was the oldest son. He was probably educated at the local grammar school.
He married Anne Hathaway in 1582, aged18; his wife was eight years older than him. They had a daughter, followed by twins two years later. Their only son, Hamnet, died aged 11.
Nobody knows how Shakespeare began to write or when he entered the theatre. At some point he joined an acting company called the Queen's Men and then became a leading member of the Lord Chamberlain's Men. They developed into London's top theatre company, performing at the Globe Theatre from 1599 and becoming the King's men when James I came to the throne in 1603.
Shakespeare probably began writing plays in the 1580s and went on to write more than thirty. These would all have been performed by his theatre company: he may have acted some of the roles himself and certain parts would have been written with particular actors in mind. Certainly his work was very popular: by 1597, Shakespeare was wealthy enough to buy New Place, the grandest house in Stratford! The Merchant of Venice was written between 1596 and 1598 and first published in written form in 1600. He also wrote poems, including many love

was famous as an important Mediterranean trading centre for goods from the Far East. Silks, spices, jewels and other expensive items were bought and sold there - including slaves. It had the reputation of being full of fashion, culture and sophistication. It would have been a very exotic location for an Elizabethan audience.
Venice was run by a Duke, or Doge, and a Council of Ten, who ruled with an iron fist. All Venetians were encouraged to do whatever they had to for the security of the state, even spying on other ports. People who were seen to have committed a crime against the state were often killed without trial and their bodies were left in the street to serve as a warning to others.
Because of Venice's position as a centre for trade, it was full of people of many different nationalities, religions and races. The Christian leaders were keen to quell the activities of the Jews, and so created one of the first Jewish ghettos, forcing the Jews to live in a particular area. Yet the Jewish community continued to flourish in spite of the prejudice shown against them.
, Portia's home, is an imaginary setting. All we know about it is that it is two days' sail away from Venice. It seems to be a beautiful, rich country estate.
Although Jesus Christ himself was born a Jew, there have been battles between Jews and Christians for 2000 years. This is because the Romans who then ruled the area where they lived - now known as Israel - tried to crush the Jewish faith. Many Jews moved away to escape persecution, taking their customs and cultures with them. Through their hard work and consequent success in business, Jews were often resented in their new homes, especially in Christian countries. Terrible crimes were committed against them.
In England, when Shakespeare was writing, Jews had been banished for the past 300 years. Shakespeare's audience would not have known any Jews; their knowledge of Jews would have been based solely on rumour and prejudice. They would have enjoyed the verbal insults and racist jokes against Shylock, and would probably not have questioned the treatment Shylock receives as we do today.
The worst ever persecution of Jewish people occurred comparatively recently, before and during World War II (1939 - 45). The Nazi party convinced the Germans that the Jews were responsible for the country's economic problems and so began the Holocaust: 6 million Jews were killed in Germany and other European countries, many in gas chambers at concentration camps. The Diary of Anne Frank will give you some idea of the horrors of that time.
And, unfortunately, Jews are still being persecuted in different countries around the world today.

the number of electrons in the outermost shell is the same as the group number.
Each element in a group therefore has the same number of electrons in its outer shell.
to this rule, since although it comes after Group 7 it is not called 'Group 8'; and it contains helium, which has only two electrons in its outer shell.
Working out electronic structure from the Periodic Table
Here's how to use the Periodic Table to work out an electronic structure:
Find the element in the Periodic Table. Work out which period it's in, and draw that number of circles around the nucleus.
Work out which group the element is in and draw that number of electrons in the outer circle - with eight for Group 0 elements (except helium).
Fill the other circles with electrons (remember: two in the first, eight in the second and third, 18 in the fourth).
Finally, count your electrons and check that they equal the atomic number.

Photosynthesis by green plants increased the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere, until it reached the level seen today - 21 per cent.

Sedimentary rocks are formed from sediments, which have settled at the bottom of a lake, sea or ocean, and have been compressed over millions of years. The sediment comes from eroded rocks carried there by rivers or ice, and from the skeletons of sea creatures.

1692,"Beer and wine are alcoholic drinks made by fermentation reactions that use yeast to convert sugars into ethanol. There are harmful effects and social problems because of ethanol in drinks.
Intelligent packaging keeps food fresh by removing water from the food, or stopping it reacting with oxygen.
Emulsifiers have a 'water-loving' head and a 'water-hating' tail. These substances allow oil and water to mix so they can become emulsions such as mayonnaise.
Ethanol is the type of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks such as wine and beer.
Sugar from plant material is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide by fermentation. The enzymes found in single-celled fungi - yeast - are the natural catalysts that can make this process happen. Here are the word and balanced formulae equations:
sugar    ethanol + carbon dioxide
Fermentation usually works best at around 37C. It is a slow process and several weeks or more are usually needed to produce an acceptable alcoholic drink.
The sugars for beer-making come from boiling barley in water. Hops are added to adjust the flavour of the beer.
The sugars for wine-making come from grape juice. Different varieties of grapes are used to produce wines with different flavours. Wine contains a higher proportion of ethanol than beer does, because grape juice contains a higher concentration of sugars than barley in water.
Ethanol is a depressant - it slows down signals in the nerves and brain. Small amounts of alcohol help people to relax, but greater amounts lead to a lack of self-control and loss of judgement. Drinkers may put themselves in dangerous situations, and may not realise how much they are drinking. They may fall ill, or become unconscious.
Ethanol is also toxic. Yeast are actually killed by the ethanol they produce. Long-term effects of drinking excessive amounts of alcoholic drinks include damage to the liver and brain. It may also cause weight gain, and is addictive.
People suffering from 'hangovers' after drinking alcoholic drinks may be unable to function normally the next day. This puts strain on their family and their colleagues, and can lead to family problems, lost work and missed business.
Ethanol causes damage to the liver, and leads to a risk of stroke or heart disease. This causes problems both for the drinker, and for those around them. Such diseases require the resources of the Health Service, which means it has less to spend on treating other illnesses.

vandalism, fighting and other forms of anti-social behaviour
bacteria and fungi that grow on or in the food
chemical reactions that take place in the food, such as fats reacting with oxygen to make rancid products
Food is also spoiled if it gets damaged or crushed.
Bacteria and fungi are living organisms. They need water and oxygen - as well as the food itself - to grow and reproduce. If one or both of these is taken away, the microbes are unable to survive and the food will last longer.
Water can be removed by drying the food. Modern freeze-drying' methods allow many food items to be dried so that they last longer. Freeze drying is popular for instant drinks, packet soups and fruit pieces in breakfast cereals
Oxygen can be restricted just by packaging the food in plastic, or sealing it in an air-tight container. However, the food itself contains some oxygen, and microbes can still survive in it. The air in modern packaging is often replaced by gases such as nitrogen. This restricts the amount of oxygen available, so microbes cannot grow and reproduce. There are other benefits to this method, too:
fats in the food cannot react with oxygen to produce substances with rancid smells and flavours
substances in sliced fruit and vegetables cannot oxidise and turn the food brown
crisps and other easily damaged foods are protected from being crushed
Immiscible liquids do not mix together. For example, if you add oil to water, the oil floats on the surface of the water. And if you shake the two together then leave them to stand, tiny droplets of oil float upwards. They join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again. To stop the two liquids separating, we need a substance called an emulsifier.
Emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends:
a hydrophilic end - water-loving - that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils
a hydrophobic end - water-hating - that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water
Lecithin is an emulsifier commonly used in foods. It is obtained from oil seeds and is a mixture of different substances. A molecular model of one of these substances is seen in the diagram.
The hydrophilic 'head' dissolves in the water and the hydrophobic 'tail' dissolves in the oil. In this way, the water and oil droplets become unable to separate out. The mixture formed is called an emulsion.
Mayonnaise and emulsion paints are emulsions, but there are others - such as the two in the table.

A simple example of two things that are in the same proportion is the amount of apples you might buy and the amount you pay for them. If you buy twice as many apples as your friend, you pay twice as much.
We can write the connection between the cost and the amount as an equation:

Megan and her friends laugh and joke together, talking about what they've done. Freeze. One of the characters steps out of the scene, leaving Megan and the remaining actor. Megan is now in trouble with a teacher for having bullied the younger child. The teacher questions her, then asks her how she feels. Megan speaks of her shame and how her parents will be horrified. She says she should make amends for her actions and that she deserves punishment.

1083,"The structure of folk music was usually relatively simple. It was performed by amateur musicians at village gatherings for entertainment, to dance and have a good time to.
Morris dancing is in compound or 6/8 time, also known as a jig.
Other common dances include the reel, the strathspey and the rant, all in 4/4, or common, time; the waltz in 3/4 time; and the slip jig in 9/8 time.
Typical subjects of folk songs and ballads are everyday life, love, the seasons, the world of work, and battles and wars.
Songs are usually in strophic form, ie in verses or stanzas, with each stanza having the same melody.
The most common stanza form is made up of four lines, with the same number of sung syllables in each line, usually with rhyming line ends.
The rhythm in folk songs is related to the rhythmic structure of the verses.

Arrests of thousands of people terrified opponents.
The Propaganda Ministry worked hard to ensure that people were persuaded to adopt the Nazi point of view:
People's radios were sold very cheaply, but broadcasts were controlled.
Films were controlled to make films that glorified war and pilloried the Jews.
Loudspeakers in public places blared out Nazi propaganda.
Cult of personality - Hitler's picture was everywhere, and he was portrayed as Germany's saviour.

Most readers will probably feel that the tone should be mainly triumphantly, showing Robin's delight that he is free of Batman at last, yet it could be read thoughtfully.
Robin is mocking the fact that the 'good' Batman had an affair with a married woman and exclaims about it in an over-exaggerated way, using a comically inappropriate phrase for sex.
Batman always had Robin close by him, like a shadow, but Robin also felt as insignificant as a shadow. Now that the shadow is gone, Batman seems almost unreal - only ghosts leave no shadows...

The alkali metals are soft, reactive metals. They react vigorously with water and become more reactive as you go down the group.
The halogens are reactive non-metals. They become darker as you go down the group. Their reactivity decreases as you go down the group and their boiling points increase. A more reactive halogen will displace a less reactive halogen from solutions of its salts.
The noble gases are unreactive non-metals, which exist as single atoms.
The elements in group 1 are called the alkali metals. They belong to the left-hand column in the periodic table. They are very reactive and must be stored in oil to avoid contact with air or water.
The alkali metals have the following properties in common:
they have low melting and boiling points compared to most other metals
they are very soft and can be cut easily with a knife

Vaccination involves putting a small amount of an inactive form of a pathogen into the body. Vaccines can contain:

a type of natural poison produced by an organism, often as a form of protection
Foreign organisms that get into the body, and trigger an immune response.
. When injected into the body, they stimulate white blood cells to produce antibodies to fight the pathogen.
The vaccine contains only a weakened or harmless version of a pathogen, which means that the vaccinated person is in no danger of developing the disease. Some people, however, may suffer a mild reaction. If the person later becomes infected with the pathogen, the required

Vaccinations in early childhood can offer protection against many serious diseases. Sometimes more than one vaccine is given at a time, like the MMR triple vaccine against mumps, measles and rubella.
Sometimes vaccine boosters are required because the immune response memory weakens over time. Anti-tetanus injections may need to be repeated every ten years, for example.
There is often a conflict between a persons right to decide what is best for themselves and their family, and what is best for society as a whole. For example, some people used to think the MMR vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella could cause autism in children. They decided not to risk letting their child have the vaccine and just hope they would not catch measles, mumps or rubella. But this meant that, as less and less children were vaccinated, the three diseases began to spread more easily and the number of cases began to increase. Therefore, a decision originally taken by a single individual had big implications for society as a whole.
Vaccinations can never be completely safe because side-effect levels vary. So, when making a decision, these are some of the factors that should be considered:
When fewer people are vaccinated, the number of cases of the disease increases.
The chance of falling seriously ill or dying from the disease may be far greater than the chance of experiencing a serious side-effect.
Using a vaccine may be much cheaper than treating a very ill person.

God made birds and fish on the fifth day and animals and humans on the sixth day
So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
This is a much earlier account. It describes how
the Lord God first of all created a man by taking some soil from the ground and breathing life into him
God placed the man in a garden in Eden, and made beautiful trees grow there. God said to the man:
You may eat the fruit of any tree in the garden, except the tree that gives knowledge of what is good and what is bad. You must not eat the fruit of that tree; if you do you will die that same day.
The Lord God took soil and formed the animals and birds; the man named them, but none was a suitable companion for him. The Lord God put the man into a deep sleep, and while he slept he took one of the mans ribs and formed a woman out of it.

. This means that knowledge of hormones can be used to decide to increase, or reduce, the chances of fertilisation and pregnancy.
The oral contraceptive ('the pill'), greatly reduces the chances of a woman producing mature eggs, and therefore her chances of becoming pregnant. The pill contains oestrogen, or oestrogen and progesterone. These hormones inhibit the production of
Follicle Stimulating Hormone, which stimulates oestrogen production and the growth of follicles (egg-sacs) in the ovary. It is secreted by the pituitary gland.
, which in turn stops eggs maturing in the ovaries.
Although the pill is useful in helping avoid unwanted pregnancy, some women who take it may suffer from changes in weight, mood and blood pressure, as a result of the hormones in it. There is also a chance of an increased risk of developing blood clots. On the other hand, there is evidence of a decreased risk of developing cancer of the uterus or ovaries.
Some women have difficulty becoming pregnant because they don't produce enough FSH to allow their eggs to mature. 'Fertility drugs' contain FSH, which stimulates eggs to mature in the ovary.
Fertility treatments increase a woman's chance of becoming pregnant, although the treatment may not always work. On the other hand, because the treatment boosts the production of mature eggs, multiple conceptions sometimes occur, with twins or triplets being expected. This increases the risk of complications in pregnancy and childbirth, and may lead to premature or underweight babies.
If a couple are having difficulty conceiving a child, because the quantity or quality of the man's sperm is poor, in vitro fertilisation - or IVF - can be used. This is where the egg is fertilised outside the woman's body and then implanted back into her uterus. As FSH can also be used to encourage the production of several mature eggs at once, it is used as part of IVF to increase the number of eggs available for fertilisation.
Some people worry about the ethical implications of IVF, and are concerned that couples may only want fertilised eggs with 'desirable' qualities. For example, they may want a girl if they have lots of boys in the family, or they may wish to avoid producing a baby with an inherited defect.

Darwin studied the wildlife on the Galpagos Islands - a group of islands on the equator almost 1,000 kilometres west of Ecuador. He noticed that the finches - songbirds - on the different islands there were fundamentally similar to each other, but showed wide variations in their size, beaks and claws from island to island.

- lines of broken, unemployed men, rows of shabby housing - and
- new washing machines, automobiles, electricity and cinemas.
In 1929, the Wall Street Crash plunged the USA into economic depression. The Americans were alarmed, so they called in their loans to other countries and put up customs barriers to stop imports of foreign goods. This created a depression across the rest of the world.
Unemployment in Britain rose to 2.5 million (25 per cent of the workforce) in 1933. Worst hit were the areas of heavy industry (eg coal, iron, steel, shipbuilding) in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the north of England. These industries were already struggling because they had not modernised after the war and had been badly affected by competition from other countries. The Depression meant that now these industries crumbled. For example, when the coal mine, the steel works and Palmer's shipyard closed down in Jarrow in the north-east of England, every single man in the town was made
laid off from work because they are no longer needed
The people of Jarrow organised a march to London - a crusade to seek help from the government, but they were told to go home and work out their own salvation'. In fact,
the government did not have a clue how to cope with the Depression

of the Depression was the Wall Street Crash, but other factors also helped to create the Depression out of the Crash. To understand them, you need to understand that the
of an economic depression is a reduction in spending, and that the way to end a depression is to get people to buy things:
- Import duties discouraged trade, which harmed the economy. The reduction in trade particularly hit the shipbuilding and railway industries if there was no trade, there was no need for transport.
- when there is unemployment and uncertainty, people cut back on spending and save 'for a rainy day'. This then makes businesses go bankrupt and causes the unemployment they feared.
- unemployed people have no wage and cannot buy things, which causes more businesses to go bankrupt and creates more unemployment.
Outdated practices - British heavy industry was out of date
and labour-intensive. When orders dried up, the only way they could cope was to lay off workers.
made the depression worse: - The increase in unemployment meant the government was faced with a vastly increased expenditure on benefits. So in 1931, it raised income tax and cut unemployment pay by 10 per cent and introduced the means test. These measures reduced the amount of money people had to spend and made the Depression worse. - The Import Duties Act (1932) was designed to protect British industry, but this merely reduced trade and made the Depression worse.
Cutting unemployment pay by 10 per cent.
Adding import duties to goods from abroad.
Where the total currency in a country is equal in value to the amount of gold that the country owns.
- this allowed the government to increase the amount of money in circulation.
Reduced interest rates - this reduced people's debt payments and made more money available to spend, but also encouraged them to take out loans to spend more.

Imprinting lets young animals recognise their mother from a young age. They can follow her for food and protection.
Imprinting is useful if the first moving object they see really is their mother. But ducklings will imprint on people, balls and even cardboard boxes if these happen to be the first things they see.
Geese, chicks, and other baby birds that can walk around shortly after hatching, also show imprinting behaviour. Konrad Lorenz (1903 to 1989) was an Austrian scientist who studied animal behaviour.
He discovered that if he reared geese from when they hatched, they became imprinted on him. They followed him around and preferred to be near him even when they had grown into adult geese. Lorenz won the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine because of his experiments on animal behaviour.

Love is an excellent subject for poets. Romeo enjoys using lots of different poetic devices to explore the idea of love.
The idea of love seems to be making Romeo's brain ache. He comes up with a list of oxymorons (pairs of opposite words eg 'loving hate') to try and find the right definition of love. He makes up some vivid metaphors for love, but comes closer with his descriptions to lust. He thinks love is a kind of madness or even a poison. He thinks that he loves Rosaline. He compares her to a Roman goddess and complains that Cupid keeps missing her heart with his arrows. He focuses on her beauty and talks about his problems getting her to love him back as though it is a kind of battle.
At this point in the play, Romeo doesn't seem to understand what true love is. It is possible that he has got some of his romantic ideas from stories. He likes talking about love, but some of his opinions don't sound very loving. We never meet Rosaline in the play, but you may think to yourself that she is wise not to encourage Romeo's advances. They don't sound respectful or honourable. In fact, it could be argued that Romeo's ideas about love are funny or silly, and show him up to be immature and shallow.

Individuals of the same species can reproduce to make more individuals of the same species. Two individuals belonging to different species cannot normally reproduce together. If they do, their offspring is usually infertile and unable to reproduce.
For example animals called ligers are produced when a male lion and a female tiger reproduce. But a liger cannot have offspring. This means that lions and tigers are different species.
All people are human. They belong to the same species. Your friends and classmates may have different eye colour and hair colour. Some will be boys and some will be girls. Some will be tall and some will be shorter. The presence of differences between living things of the same species is called variation.

The following article has appeared in your local paper:
Ashfield Park is threatened with closure next month as a local business has applied for planning permission to turn the area into a car park. Local residents have begun a fierce campaign to save the park, which is a popular walking spot for young children and the elderly, as well as home to the War Memorial and many wildlife species.
Write to your local paper, arguing that the park should be preserved.

There are lots of ways of planning - some of them are fancy, some of them are simple, but the most important thing is to write your ideas down. If you don't, you could easily forget them.
Let's have a go at using the question about the park. The simplest plan is just to write down a list of all the points. Look again at the question, think of a list, then compare yours to ours.
If you are writing an argument, and we are in this question, we can make two lists - one is the positive side - which supports your view, the other is the negative side - which goes against your view. Have a go, then compare your lists with ours.

Writers like to draw you into their text and get you involved. It's up to you to make your mind up about a character, just as it is when you meet someone in real life.
The clues you need to make up your mind about a character are all in the text. Look for the following:
Take another look at one of the extracts from 'Holes'. Stanley has just arrived at the prison camp. What can you tell about the character of Mr Sir, the man in the cowboy hat, from reading between the lines? Some important phrases have been put in bold to give you a few clues.
A man was sitting with his feet up on a desk.
He turned his head when Stanley and the guard entered, but otherwise didn't move. Even though he was inside,
he wore sunglasses and a cowboy hat
. He also held a can of cream soda, and the sight of it made Stanley even more aware of his own thirst.
He waited while the bus guard gave the man some papers to sign.
""That's a lot of sunflower seeds,"" the bus guard said.
Stanley noticed a burlap sack filled with sunflower seeds on the floor next to the desk.
,"" said the man in the cowboy hat. He had
a tattoo of a rattlesnake on his arm
, and as he signed his name, the snake's rattle seemed to wiggle. ""I used to smoke a pack a day. Now I eat a sack of these every week.""
On the surface, this extract doesn't tell us much about Mr Sir, but you've probably begun to
about him. If we read between the lines, we can tell that he likes to make an impression and wants to be seen to be in charge. He is sitting ""with his feet up on a desk"" and has made his appearance even more striking by wearing sunglasses and a cowboy hat indoors.
Sometimes people who act like this can like power a bit too much, and can be bullies. Could Mr Sir be a bully?
When we consider the can of cream soda, we can say that the fact that Mr Sir fails to offer either Stanley or the bus driver anything to drink after their nine-hour, cross-desert journey suggests that he is a
man. That he keeps his own drink in full view of Stanley and the bus driver further suggests that he is cruel and likes to see other people's discomfort.
We learn that Mr Sir stopped smoking recently. We could then expect him to be bad- and short-tempered. The tattoo of a rattlesnake, a dangerous reptile that is supposed to have a bad temper, adds to this impression. The sunflower seeds are, we are led to believe, there to help him as an alternative to cigarettes, but we don't get the feeling of optimism that they'll be successful.
So there we have it; Mr Sir is a bad-tempered, selfish bully!

577,"> The Tempest Summary - Drunken clowns
Ariel brings Ferdinand (the King's son) to Prospero's cave. Ferdinand thinks he's the only survivor from the shipwreck. Miranda, who has seen no other man but her father during her time on the island, sees Ferdinand and thinks he must be a spirit - while Ferdinand thinks Miranda is a goddess. The two young people fall in love, but Prospero is not pleased, and makes Ferdinand his prisoner.
On another part of the island we discover one of the groups of shipwreck survivors. They begin to wake up. They're surprised that their clothes seem fresh and new.
Ariel's magical song puts them to sleep again - all except Sebastian (the King's brother) and Antonio (Prospero's brother). Antonio convinces Sebastian that they should kill the King (Alonso) so that Sebastian can take his place. Fortunately everyone else wakes up again, before they can carry out their plan.
Elsewhere on the island, Trinculo, a jester who was on board the ship, comes across Caliban. Trinculo's drunken friend Stephano turns up, and gives Caliban strong alcohol. This makes Caliban believe that Stephano is more powerful than Prospero (who Caliban hates).
Meanwhile, Ariel, who has made himself invisible, watches the three drunken clowns. He causes havoc by whispering the accusation ""thou liest"" in Caliban's ear, then Stephano's. They become confused and fight.
Caliban reveals his plans to destroy Prospero and take over the island. Stephano drunkenly agrees. Caliban is delighted that Stephano has agreed to his plan and they sing to celebrate. Ariel plays a tune to accompany their singing which frightens both Trinculo and Stephano.
Caliban tells them not to be afraid in a moving speech that describes the beauty and magic of the island. Stephano, Trinculo and Caliban follow the sound of the music.

The Tempest second key extract - Characters
If you get a question about characters in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with the answer.
Question: What do we learn about Miranda in the two extracts?
In the two Key Extracts we learn that Miranda is young and inexperienced, but not necessarily weak. She has a pure heart and sees the best in Ferdinand and even defends Prospero. In the First Key Extract she must do what her father says, even though his behaviour is questionable. In the Second Key Extract, she knows her own mind and goes behind her father's back (or thinks she has) to ask Ferdinand to be her husband.
Miranda can be read as a strong female character. Even though Prospero is a controlling father, Miranda shows from the beginning of the extract that she is beginning to test his power over her.
She relies on her own judgement and questions her father's actions. She stands up for Ferdinand against her father and is on the receiving end of Prospero's ugly temper. She replies with dignity and even tries to excuse her father's bad behaviour to Ferdinand. However, throughout the first extract, she is being unwittingly manipulated by Prospero.
In the second extract she openly defies her father (although it is part of Prospero's plan that she does this). She demonstrates that she is Ferdinand's equal by offering to share his workload. She claims that she is not worthy of him, but then shows her independence by proposing marriage.
Miranda pleads with Prospero to see the best in Ferdinand, but perhaps her father, who is more experienced, is wise to test Ferdinand's love for his daughter. Miranda is open about her feelings for Ferdinand, but in doing so believes that she is betraying her father's wishes. Miranda is sometimes weak and sometimes strong. She is a complex character.
Throughout the two extracts we see Miranda's growing independence. The truth is, however, that although she thinks she is rebelling against her father by following her own heart, her actions are part of Prospero's plans.

More on equations - Equations when x is negative
If the value of x is negative, tackle the equation in the same way - aim to get all xs on one side of the equation.
5x - 2 = 12 - 2x
Your aim is to get all the unknown x terms on one of the equation side only, so start by adding 2x to both sides: 7x - 2 = 12
Next add 2 to both sides: 7x = 14
And finally, divide by 7 to give
As always, you can check your answer in the original equation. So substitute x = 2 back into 5x - 2 = 12 - 2x
(5  2) - 2 = 12 - (2  2)
10 - 2 = 12 - 4
This makes sense, so the value x = 2 is correct.
Add x to both sides to give 5x = 10.
To find x, divide both sides by 5 to get x = 2
Solve the equation 4x + 1 = 2x + 5
Start by subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation to give
Then subtract 1 from each side to give

The Montagues and Capulets have just had a fight in a public place in Verona. Prince Escalus stopped it and warned that if it happens again, those involved will be punished by death.
The first set scene begins with Montague asking Benvolio how the fight began.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
Benvolio tells him that servants from both families were fighting and that when he tried to stop them, Tybalt turned on him.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.
After that, lots of other people joined in until the Prince came and stopped the fighting.
Lady Montague is worried about her son, Romeo. He wasn't involved in the fighting but she wonders where he is. Benvolio explains that he saw him skulking about before dawn. Montague says that this is not unusual behaviour for Romeo: people have seen him crying and sighing on his own before daybreak before.
The audience finds out a lot about Romeo before he even walks onto the stage. What are your first impressions of Romeo?
Montague says he has tried to talk to his son, but he won't open up to him.
Parents and children - You might be able to sympathise with Romeo not wanting to talk about his feelings with his father.
He says he is like a flower that never gets to open because it has been stopped from blossoming by a worm that has eaten into it.
This is a simile to show that no one can get near to Romeo whilst he is in such a bad mood.
When Romeo arrives, Montague and Lady Montague leave Benvolio to try and find out why he is in such a bad mood all of the time.
- Time - There are lots of references to time in this play. The events in this play take place in just less than one week. Romeo and Juliet both feel that time drags whilst they are apart from one another.
Romeo tries to explain that he is in love with a girl who doesn't love him back. He doesn't make himself very clear though and Benvolio has to work hard to get him to tell him about it. Romeo comes up with lots of confusing descriptions of love to try and explain how he feels.
The list of opposites in Romeo's speech ('loving hate', 'heavy lightness', etc) are called oxymorons. They give us an important clue to his character. His confusing speech shows us how confusing the world is to him as a young man. It also shows us that Romeo likes to play with language.
""Here's much to do with hate, but more with love""
- Love and Hate - Romeo is commenting on the street brawl that has just happened: it's about hating an opposing family and feeling love and loyalty towards their own. Taken on its own, the line sums up the play as a whole: it's about two families that hate each other, but more about the love between Romeo and Juliet.
Romeo speaks in rhyme to try to describe how he feels.
Romeo's speeches are often in rhyme. He also likes wordplay, metaphors and similes. Romeo loves to talk about love, but does he really know what love is at this point? You could say that Romeo, at this point is 'all talk and no action'.
He says that love is like smoke made from the hot breath of lovers and that the flames are the sparks in their eyes. But if it doesn't work out, love is a sea of tears. He also describes love as a kind of madness and a poison.
- Love - The language that Romeo uses to describe love gives us an idea of what Romeo believes love to be at this point. For him it's about desire, which sounds like lust rather than true love.
Benvolio brings Romeo back to earth with a straightforward question: who is the girl he is in love with?
Whilst Romeo is pouring his heart out, Benvolio's responses could be performed in a number of ways- sympathetic, impatient, humorous. All three work.
Romeo still won't give him a straight answer though.
Romeo and Benvolio are good friends. We can see this through the way they banter with one another.
He tells Benvolio that the girl is very beautiful but she doesn't want to fall in love. It seems that she is very pure and Romeo says that because she isn't interested in men, her beauty will be wasted!
- Love - We never meet Rosaline in the play and only have Romeo's description of her to go by. It's hard to tell whether she really is a very good girl or whether she simply doesn't fancy Romeo!
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste
Benvolio says that the best thing to do is to forget her. He advises Romeo to look at other attractive girls. Romeo swears that he can never forget her; he'll never find anyone as beautiful as her. Benvolio bets that he will.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.

Meanwhile, a nobleman called Paris visits Capulet to ask him if he can marry Juliet. Capulet asks him to wait two more summers, but suggest he romances his daughter and invites Paris to a party that evening. He gives his servant a list of names of people to invite.
The servant can't read. He bumps into Benvolio and Romeo and asks them to read the list for him. Rosaline's name, amongst others, is on the list. The servant doesn't know that Benvolio and Romeo are Montagues and invites them to the party, too.
Lady Capulet is sent to tell Juliet about Paris's proposal. They aren't very close so she asks Juliet's Nurse to stay and listen. Juliet will be fourteen on Lammas-eve, 31st July. Juliet tells her mother that she has never thought about marriage, but promises to take a look at Paris.

Formal and informal writing - Formal Language
Using formal language doesn't mean that you have to sound boring, you can still use words imaginatively in formal writing. News reports use formal language, but the words are rich and stimulating to keep the audience interested.
Q1. The two sentences below both use formal language to give us the same information. Which sentence do you think is best and why?
a) The bomb broke the windows of nearby buildings.
b) The blast shattered the windows of nearby buildings.
Q2. Which of the following should NOT use formal language?
b) A letter to the local paper
c) A speech to teachers or parents
d) A newspaper article aimed at adults
A1. Sentence b is better. Blast and shattered are far more descriptive than bomb and broke.
A2. Example a) should not be written with formal language. You wouldnt use formal language when writing to a close friend.
Tips for making your writing more formal
Make your writing clear and to the point.
Include some complex sentences in your writing. Try using semi-colons if you feel confident about using them correctly.
It's good to use figurative language if you think it fits in with the purpose and audience of the task. Metaphors and similes work well in speeches.
Don't use 'Well' or 'You know' or 'Anyway' or 'Like I just said' or any phrase that sounds like you are having a friendly chat.
Avoid using: 'And', 'But', 'Because' or 'So' at the beginning of a sentence.
Words like 'nice' and 'a lot' have no power. Try to think of more descriptive words eg 'delicious' or 'endless'.
Clichs are colourful phrases that people use all the time in speech. So often, in fact, that they seem worn out and boring in writing. Avoid phrases such as 'pretty as a picture', 'big as a house', 'skinny as a rake'.

The idea of presenting a speech might make you nervous but some people make speeches every day as part of their jobs. Think about your teachers - they regularly stand up before you and present to the class.
You might notice that some teachers are more interesting to listen to than others. It is not necessarily what they say that keeps you interested, but often how they say it. What do your teachers do to keep your attention? Make a list then compare it with the tips below.
Your listeners will switch off if they can't hear you. Use a loud and clear voice, and if you're unsure if your audience can hear you at the back - just ask ""Can you hear me at the back?""
If you speak too quickly, you won't be clear. If you speak too slowly, your audience is likely to go to sleep. Vary your pace for effect and use dramatic pauses where appropriate.
If you speak like a robot, in the same boring tone, your audience will quickly drift off. Speak naturally and use the pitch of your voice to show your emotions.
You don't have to gurn at your audience! But if you don't look like you're interested in what you have to say, your audience won't be either.
Again, keep it natural, but if you stand like a statue, you won't be very interesting to watch or listen to. On the other hand, too much arm flapping and leg hopping will distract your audience from the point you're trying to make.
Use them, but use them effectively. They need to be big enough to see, interesting to look at and relevant to what you are talking about. Don't be tempted to make a big poster to hide behind!
Choose words that are interesting, descriptive and appropriate to your audience. Don't baffle your audience with jargon or slang or lots of big words that are too difficult for anyone else to understand.
If it's appropriate to your audience and task, try to use Standard English. You don't have to be too formal or put on a silly accent, just speak in a way that is easy for everyone to understand.
Most people feel nervous about speaking formally in front of other people. Here are some tips to help you conquer your nerves:
Write your speech out in full and read it several times - this will help you gain confidence in the content.
Prepare small cards with key points of your speech. By now you should be familiar with your speech so these points will help you keep to your structure. Avoid the temptation to read your speech in full - the idea is to test your speaking skills, not your reading skills!
Practice your performance before the real thing. Try practicing at home on your own, and then in front of family or friends. If you have visual aids, be sure to practice using them.
On the day, take a deep breath, smile and try to enjoy it.
Improve your public speaking and maybe you'll be TV Presenter one day. But it's not all bad!

447,"The extract comes from a book called 'Face' by Benjamin Zephaniah. Natalie is a Year 9 student and lives in East London. She is out with her boyfriend and his friends. They have stopped to chat with some boys from school. Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. You can use the bullet points to help you.
After a couple of minutes she realised that her every move was being watched by a group of three girls and she couldn't help noticing how tough they looked. All three were wearing dark blue baggy jeans. She was pretty sure they were Londoners born and bred but thought they could find a job working for the Jamaican tourist board, not simply because of their dark skin but also because of their clothing. One had a T-shirt saying 'I love Jamaica'. Another wore a T-shirt that was a Jamaican flag and the third just had a West Ham football shirt on, but she, like the others, was adorned with yellow, black and green bangles, badges and necklaces. Natalie thought they looked good, but dangerous.
Natalie shifted nervously. She didn't know quite where to look but she had to put on a front. The other three girls made no attempt to hide the fact that they were on Natalie's case. They began to whisper to each other and smile as they stared at her. Natalie felt illuminated in her green satins and began to wish she had chosen clothes which weren't so loud. What are they grinning at? she wondered. Is it my clothes? My shoes? My hair? Do I look too innocent? Suddenly the three girls began to walk toward Natalie. Her heart began to race, the palms of her hands began to sweat. She felt like falling apart but she held herself together.
'You from round here, den?' said the big girl wearing the Jamaican flag.
'Yeah, I wanid to go there but they wouldn't let me, said I had ta go ta Lonsdale Park, said it was nearer. What ya doing here?'
The other two girls continued to look her up and down. Natalie expected trouble and in her mind she cursed the boys for bringing her there and for the way they had got lost in their silly conversation about football and cars.
'I'm just hanging around with my boyfriend and his mates.'
At this point the girl wearing the West Ham shirt reached into her back pocket. Natalie swallowed hard as the girl pulled out a couple of leaflets. After separating one from the other she handed one to Natalie. 'Dat's the place to be, check it out, good vibes, good music. Ya like rap?'
Natalie wanted to kick herself. She had completely misread the situation. They weren't out for a fight, they wanted to find out if she liked clubbing. They wanted to find out if she was one of them, an Eastender.
'Yeah,' Natalie replied, feeling a sense of relief. 'Yeah, rap's cool...' She began to wonder if she sometimes looked threatening and if she herself had been misjudged in the past. For people to be friendly, did they have to have permanent smiles on their faces?
How does the writer show Natalie's thoughts and feelings changing during the extract?
her first reactions to the girls she sees
the way she acts just before, and when, they speak to her
her thoughts at the end of the passage.
Just before the girls speak to her, Natalie seems even more anxious. She is used to being out on the streets of London and feels she needs to 'put on a front' and look tough. She is afraid they may be laughing at her clothes or hair, which makes her seem insecure about herself. However, when the girls come up to speak to her she hides her nerves and answers their questions. The way she uses short answers like 'Yeah' suggests she does not want to give too much away about herself or get into a fight.
When she realises the girls are actually being friendly and want to give her a flyer for a club, Natalie's feelings change completely. She is ashamed of being suspicious and feels like 'kicking herself'. She realises the girls are Eastenders just like her. The writer shows how this makes her think about her own image. She wonders if people think she looks threatening, too. At this point she comes across as an intelligent, thoughtful girl who wants to learn how to judge people fairly in the future.

A moving and romantic extract that contrasts with the scene before it which is full of Mercutio's rude jokes.
Montague and Benvolio describe how Romeo has been behaving, before he actually appears on stage.
Whereas in the first extract, Romeo talks about love, in the second extract we see how he behaves when he is in love.
The movement of characters is less obvious - it's just two characters having a chat. The director has to make sure that this is interesting to look at on stage.
Again, in the second extract, two characters are talking. The director has to think creatively so that the action is interesting to watch.
The potential for humour comes from the banter and word-play between Romeo and Benvolio.

A force meter is used to measure forces.

Food chains - Getting carbon dioxide, light and water
Remember that the equation for photosynthesis is:
carbon dioxide + water (+ light energy)
Let's see how plants get the carbon dioxide and water they need for this process.
Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves. The carbon dioxide
through small holes in the underside of the leaf called stomata. (One of these holes is called a stoma. The plural is stomata.)
The lower part of the leaf has loose-fitting cells, to allow carbon dioxide to reach the other cells in the leaf. This also allow the oxygen produced in photosynthesis to leave the leaf easily.
A leaf usually has a large surface area, so that it can absorb a lot of light. Its top surface is protected from water loss, disease and weather damage by a waxy layer.
The upper part of the leaf is where the light falls, and it contains a type of cell called a
. This is adapted to absorb a lot of light. It has lots of chloroplasts and is shaped like a tall box.
Turgid plant that's watered regularly and a flacid plant without enough water.
Plants get the water they need for photosynthesis through their roots.
The roots have a type of cell called a root hair cell - these project out from the root into the soil. Roots have a big surface area and thin walls, which allow water to pass into them easily.
Note that root cells do not contain chloroplasts, as they are normally in the dark and cannot photosynthesise.
The water absorbed by the root hair cells passes through the plant in
tubes, and eventually reachers the leaves. If a plant does not absorb enough water, it will wilt or go floppy. Without water it may also not photosynthesise quickly enough, and it may die.

265,"> Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
When you are persuading people, you usually use a different style. You don't need to show both sides - all you have to do is present your ideas. For instance, imagine you had to persuade people to buy a certain toothpaste. You could write about the great taste, or how clean your teeth feel or how white they are. It doesn't really matter what you find to write about as long as you get them to buy it.
But you wouldn't write about other makes of toothpaste. You don't persuade like this, because it sounds like you aren't sure. So the first thing to remember is:
- if you are writing about how great chips are, keep repeating the idea. Convince yourself how good they are - they might even be a healthy option, because lots of doctors are bound to like them and chips wouldn't be so popular if they weren't really great, would they? Once you have convinced yourself, it's much easier to convince others. So next you need to remember to...
- it's always better to hear how good your idea is rather than how bad other people's are. So write about the things that show your ideas in the best light. For instance, aren't chips just great for a quick snack? Why were chips voted the most popular option in our school at lunchtime? And finally don't be frightened to...
- If you don't seem too sure, or if you can't make your ideas stand out, then you aren't really persuading as much as you can. And if that is the case, you need The Persuaders' Toolkit.
- don't worry about saying the same thing again and again - people forget, so repeat yourself and they will remember. Even when you think they might remember, you can always repeat yourself another time.
- using words such as ""we"" or ""I"" always sounds a lot more convincing. We all know that, don't we?
- why would you use questions? Well, they make people think. They also get your readers involved in what you are writing. So will you use them when you persuade? If not, why not?
- words are your ammunition. In seconds, they can make your friends laugh, or your teacher angry, so why not use them properly to persuade your readers?
For instance, don't just write ""the pressure of doing school work"", because there is no real feeling there. Instead, how about: ""the endless trauma, the desperation and the mindless suffering that school work inflicts on students"".

There are lots of references to freedom and slavery. Prospero promises to free Ariel; he threatens to ""manacle"" Ferdinand. Ferdinand doesn't mind being a slave as long as he has Miranda to love.

Find 1% of the quantity by dividing it by 100.
Find x% of a quantity by multiplying 1% of the quantity by x.
Rakesh has a box containing 60 pens. 20% of the pens are red. How many is that?
You need to find 20% of 60.
1% of 60 is 60  100 = 0.6
So 20% of 60 is 0.6  20 = 12
Find x% of a quantity by multiplying that quantity by x/100
This combines the division and multiplication of Method 1 into one sum.
Q1. In a class of 25 pupils, 24% live in a flat. How many pupils live in a flat?
Q2. Last year Sam earned 20,000. This year her pay has increased by 8%.
a) By how much money has Sam's pay increased?
24% of 25 = 24/100  25 = 6

Food chains - Toxic materials in the food chain
Toxic materials are poisonous. Some quickly break down into harmless substances in the environment. Others are

Mercury compounds were used until quite recently to make
(chemicals that kill the insects that damage crops) and special
that stop barnacles growing on the hulls of ships.
Unfortunately, when it gets into the food chain mercury damages the
of mammals, including humans. The diagram shows how mercury can accumulate in the food chain.
Tiny plankton in the sea absorb the mercury compounds. When the plankton are eaten by small fish, the mercury they contain stays in the fish. As the fish need to eat a lot of plankton, the concentration of mercury in them becomes higher than its concentration in the plankton.
The small fish are eaten by larger fish, and these are eaten by still larger ones, such as tuna fish. This creates a high concentration of mercury in the tuna. People eating contaminated tuna may get mercury poisoning. Mercury is now banned from many chemical products and mercury use in industry is carefully regulated.
DDT is an insecticide that can pass up the food chain from insects to small birds, and then from the small birds to birds of prey, like hawks. It can accumulate in the birds of prey, giving them a large amount of DDT. Concentrations of DDT in birds causes weakness in their eggs, and reduces their population. DDT is now banned because of this.

Stanley didn't have many friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.
What does this extract show us about the main character?
Stanley is another big male, but it is clear that the writer wants us to react differently to him than we did to Jim Wellings in the earlier extract.
Stanley is a lonely boy, because he ""didn't have many friends at home"". He is bullied and teased, even by adults. The fact that the teacher causes him ""embarrassment"" by showing him up in front of the class proves that he feels uncomfortable about his weight.

Universal indicator is a mixture of several different indicators. Unlike litmus, universal indicator can show us
how strongly acidic or alkaline a solution is. This is measured using the pH scale. The pH scale runs from pH 0 to pH 14.
Universal indicator has many different colour changes, from red for strong acids to dark purple for strong bases. In the middle, neutral pH 7 is indicated by green.
Universal indicator shows how acidic or alkaline a solution is
These are the important points about the pH scale:
acidic solutions have pH values less than 7

Every reader is, of course, different too, and sometimes a text will affect you in ways a writer didn't imagine, or you might notice depth in it that others won't. This is particularly true if the text matches your personal experience. A story about your home town might interest you more than one about somewhere else, or a text about smoking might affect you more if you know somebody who is trying to give it up.
Remember, you get marks for noticing the intended effect on the reader. Even if something doesn't interest, horrify, amuse or persuade you, you need to spot what the writer meant to do. It's usually better not to mention your personal opinion unless you are asked to.

Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.
For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.
By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.
You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:
Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:
In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:
To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:
Divide both sides by 2, to give:
a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7
b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7
When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers.
For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7.
7 + 5 does equal 12, so your answer is correct.

There is a simple laboratory test to see if a gas is hydrogen. A lighted wooden splint goes pop if it is put into a test tube of hydrogen. This is because the flame ignites the hydrogen, which burns explosively to make a loud sound.

Read through the following extract. How does the writer create an atmosphere of cold and loneliness?
Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness - a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.
The extract describes a cold, empty landscape.
The text states that the trees have been ""stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost"".
The land is described as ""desolate"" and it contains ""a laughter more terrible than any sadness"".
This suggests that the place is completely isolated.
The fact that it seems to be full of terrible laughter suggests it is a very cruel area, which would be hard to explore.
If you are going to use quotations from the extract in your answer, remember to set them out properly. Here are some points to remember:
Quotes of three words or less can be used in the sentence you're writing - for example ...when the writer talks about the ""futility of life"" he means...
Longer quotations need to be included on a line of their own and with a space before it (known as an indent) - for example ...the writer describes the landscape as a ""desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold"" he creates a picture that...
Short, well-chosen quotations are better than long, vague ones.

Romeo is impatient to have a physical relationship and does not want to wait for Rosaline.
Romeo gets over Rosaline quickly and falls for Juliet suddenly. Juliet falls in love just as quickly with Romeo.
Having spent one evening together they are planning their wedding for the next day.

If there is one digit after the decimal point in the question, there will be one digit after the decimal point in the answer.
If there are two digits after the decimal point in the question, there will be two digits after the decimal point in the answer.
a) There were two digits after the decimal point in the question (4 and 3), so you must have two digits after the decimal point in the answer.
b) There was one digit after the decimal point in the question, so you must have one digit after the decimal point in the answer. The answer is therefore 12.0, but this can then be given as 12.
Check that you have a sensible answer by finding an approximate solution.
In the above example you were asked to calculate 2.4  5.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - Language
Think about how language is used in the two Key Extracts - for example, where it seems the same in both, and where it seems different.
When Montague talks about how Romeo is in a bad mood and avoiding sunlight, he uses lots of imagery to do with darkness.
When Romeo describes Juliet he uses lots of words and imagery to do with light. Even the night imagery involves brightness with stars and the moon.
The metaphors and similes used by the characters in the first extract (especially Romeo) are quite complicated. Benvolio and Romeo enjoy using puns to make jokes together. Language is used in clever ways.
Romeo still uses language skillfully, but Juliet wants honesty rather than clever poetry. When Romeo starts to swear by the moon, she won't let him finish his clever metaphor. Juliet uses imagery to make her thoughts clear, eg Romeo is like a rose; Juliet's love is as deep as the sea.
Much of the first extract is in rhyme. In the scene between Romeo and Benvolio, this helps to bring out the humour in their banter.
Romeo and Juliet both speak in blank verse: they are talking about love in a much more sensitive way than Romeo did when he was talking to Benvolio. Juliet's final line in the scene finishes Romeo's to make one line of blank verse. (Blank verse is unrhymed and has lines that have 10 syllables each). This shows how close they have become.
If you get a question about language in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with your answer:
How is love described in the two extracts?
Love is described in many different ways in the two extracts. By the second extract, love is described in a more positive light.
In the first extract, Romeo uses oxymorons because he is confused about his feelings for Rosaline. Romeo compares love to poison and madness.
In the second extract, Romeo uses words to do with light and heaven when describing his feelings for Juliet. Juliet talks about love in terms of truth and promises.
In the first extract, love means many different things to Romeo. Love is confusing to Romeo and seems to have a dark side that he has no control over. Love is ruining his life. By the end of the first extract, you might think that Romeo has confused his feelings of lust for love. In the second extract, love is related to light and heaven for Romeo. Perhaps when he meets Juliet, he realizes what true love is. For Juliet, love is about truth and honesty. She is almost overwhelmed by her feelings for Romeo. For both characters, love is a powerful and wonderful force.

Explore, imagine and entertain - Original ideas
There's no formula for having a brilliant idea. What you really need is an idea to start with. Then you need to make this idea a little different. This is the creative part, taking something that appears very ordinary and turning it into something unusual.
For example, you may be asked to write a description of a coastline. You might start to think straight away about a crowded beach - children playing, deck chairs, sun shining, happy sounds. But if you stop for a moment, you realise that's been done before. It's OK, but it's not very creative.
What about turning that on its head - not crowded, but deserted? Not summer, but winter? Not lovely and inviting, but covered in oil and polluted? It's not a pretty picture, but it's original - and that gives impact.

When people talk to each other, they may stand or sit in a similar way, and copy each others movements. Scientists think that this happens so that the speakers feel more at ease with other.
Some chimpanzees have been taught sign language by imitating people.
Imitation helps us to learn how to do new things. Your teachers often show you how to do something new, and then guide you as you try to repeat what they did.
Some scientists think that humans are the only animals that copy each other. Other scientists have observed chimpanzees and other primates imitating each other.

""The eyes were the worst. It was not my imagination. They were in truth like the eyes of a dead man, not blind, but staring, unfocused, unseeing. The whole face, for that matter, was bad enough. It was vacant, as if there was nothing behind it. It seemed not only expressionless, but incapable of expression. I had seen so much previously in Haiti that was outside the ordinary normal experience that for the flash of a second I had a sickening, almost panicky lapse in which I thought, or rather felt, ""Great God, maybe this stuff really is true..."".
This is how William Seabrook described his encounter with one of the most horrifying creatures ever to step from the realms of the supernatural. For Seabrook was face-to-face with a zombie - a walking corpse. And in that moment he was prepared to believe all that he had heard about zombies since he first arrived on the island of Haiti.
The zombie's fate is even worse than that of a vampire or werewolf. The vampire returns to his loved ones. He may be recognised and laid to rest. The werewolf may be wounded and regain human form. But the zombie is a mindless automaton (robot), doomed to live out a twilight existence of brutish toil (animal-like labour). A zombie can eat, move, hear, even speak, but he has no memory of his past or knowledge of his present condition. He may pass by his own home or gaze into the eyes of his loved ones without a glimmer of recognition.
Neither ghost nor person, the zombie is said to be trapped, possibly forever, in that ""misty zone that divides life from death"". For while the vampire is the living dead, the zombie is merely the walking dead - a body without soul or mind raised from the grave and given a semblance (appearance) of life through sorcery. He is the creature of the sorcerer, who uses him as a slave or hires him out - usually to walk on the land.
From 'The Book of Great Mysteries' edited by Colin Wilson and Christopher Evans.

271,"> Preparing, planning and checking - Punctuation
The most important thing with punctuation is to make sure your sentences are correctly marked at the start and end:
The starts are easy; they should all have capital letters.
The endings have full stops (or the equivalent, such as question marks). However, endings cannot have commas. Commas are only used inside sentences, never right at the end of one.
One quick way to check is to read your work to yourself (it doesn't have to be aloud). If you 'run out of breath' or need to pause in your reading to add emphasis, ask yourself whether a comma or a full stop is needed. If so, put one in.
Other areas which often cause problems are:
If you have included the actual words that somebody speaks, make sure you put them inside speech marks. Remember to close the speech marks as well as open them!
Always use question marks when writing a question whether it is direct or rhetorical. Look out for rhetorical questions in persuasive texts eg ""How long will it be until all our countryside is destroyed?"". Writers use rhetorical questions to emphasise a point and they do not expect the reader to genuinely answer the question.
Be careful when using exclamation marks as overusing them can spoil a text. They should be used only to show excitement, surprise, shock or humour eg ""Stop the car!"" she yelled.
To show when a letter has been missed out:
Remember: ask your teacher for some advice if you feel unsure about any aspect of punctuation.

Taking part in drama doesn't always involve learning lines from scripts - often you'll be asked to improvise. Usually you will work in groups or pairs to devise a piece of drama from your own imagination. You'll need to be able to think on your feet and become a different character.
This might sound difficult, but you've probably improvised before without realising it - in games you used to play as a child. If you've ever played pirates, nurses or superheroes when you were younger, you were improvising - although don't think running around your classroom with a tablecloth for a cape pretending to be Superman will impress your drama teacher - it probably won't!
As with any English work, you need to think about your audience when you devise drama. Your drama needs to entertain them and keep their attention. Your drama also needs to be believable - your audience is likely to become disconnected if your story or characters are too far fetched.
The story of your drama begins with your character. Ask yourself: what does my character feel, think and react?
Here are two ideas for a character:
You are a journalist who has uncovered a story that will have big consequences and you're about to tell the world. Would your character be confident or scared?
You are a global superstar - singer, actor and producer - and paparazzi follow your every move. You live a glamorous and privileged life, but what are the secrets behind the smiles?
When you have decided on your character, you need to create a scene.
Here are some ideas for a scene based on the characters above. Can you think of any more?
You're about to appear on the most popular morning TV programme and expose your discovery when you suddenly receive a startling phone call. Who is on the phone? What do they say? How do they make you feel?
You've landed a part in a popular soap but you don't get on with the other actors. Should you tell the press the truth or pretend that you all get along?
You've been working late in the library just double checking a few facts for your article when you notice a menacing looking man watching you. Does your character panic or keep calm? Do they run or confront the man? Maybe they are being paranoid?
The press have published some false rumours about you and you're really upset. Your agent has secured a slot on a popular chat show to give your side of the story. Do you accept the offer or decide to lie low? How do you feel?
Your article has been published and has been a massive hit. You're receiving job offers from high profile newspapers and magazines and your life is about to change for the better. How do your family react? What do you decide to do?
You've found out that one of the other band members is planning to leave the group and go solo. You confront them - can you persuade them to stay, or would it be better for everyone if they left?
When you have a rough idea of your character and scene, you can think about what your character might say. If you're given time to prepare you should write a short script. If working in pairs or a group, you could improvise the scene first to get more ideas.
You may be allowed to use props to make your scene more realistic and interesting. Only use a prop if it is relevant, otherwise it could end up distracting you and your audience. If you decide to use props and costumes, always practice with them first.

Nevertheless, it remains true that junk food is popular and easy to produce. If students start going off site they may get injured or into trouble, and the school could be held responsible. Therefore, it seems impractical to ban junk food altogether. But is there another answer? I believe there is: the canteen could offer a wider selection, including healthier options, for one term, and see whether it is successful. If it is, and we see more students using the canteen and eating the healthy options, the canteen could make this change permanent.
This detailed paragraph begins to suggest the solution. Formal connectives are used ('nevertheless' and 'therefore') to signal that the argument is coming to an end. She returns to a personal expression, 'I believe there is...' because she is summing up her findings.
In conclusion, the solution seems clear: if a good selection of food is provided then everyone will be happy - and the canteen will almost certainly gain more customers. Thank you for your time.
The final paragraph is short and direct. It sums up the main conclusion of the speech in a positive way: 'everyone will be happy' and 'the canteen will almost certainly gain...' which leaves the audience with a clear picture of her final point of view. Rather than trying to persuade people one way or the other, the speech has tried to suggest a solution where everyone gains. This isn't always possible, but it can be a helpful way of concluding without sitting on the fence and telling the audience to make up their own minds. As you can probably guess, this is an excellent answer.

Prospero is a controlling character who seems to be obsessed with power and status. Ferdinand is a prince, but he has no status on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero pretends not to believe that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne of Naples and insists on taking him prisoner. He calls him a ""spy"", a ""traitor"", and an ""impostor"". He accuses him of lying. He threatens to ""manacle"" him and starve him. He uses his magic powers to prevent Ferdinand from defending himself. He also has control over Ariel and even talks about how his daughter will have ""control"" over Ferdinand when he falls in love with her.
Prospero is only pretending to be cruel and unwelcoming to Ferdinand as part of his plan, but it seems as though he is enjoying himself in the process. Even Miranda is alarmed at his behaviour.
The extract seems to suggest that Miranda and Ferdinand's love for each other will turn out to have a power that is stronger even than Prospero's magic.

b) Immediately start sword fighting your friend with a ruler.
c) Pack away your pens and books and prepare to get into character.

b) Run really fast round the room, punching your friends.
c) Shed your embarrassment in case you're asked to do something unusual and prepare to focus.
3. Your teacher asks you to bring in a costume and some props. Do you:

b) Stuff some balloons up your jumper.
c) Bring in a couple of hats and your little brother's plastic sword and hope that you can come up with something by sharing what you've got with your friends.
4. Your teacher asks if anyone is prepared to be hot seated. Do you:
a) Jump up and down with your hand up shouting ""Me! Me! Me!""
b) Nudge your friend and giggle as you pretend your bum has been burnt.
c) Avoid the teacher's eye as you'd rather it wasn't you.
5. Your group has been chosen to show the rest of the class their improvisation. Do you:
a) Take over. Your group is nothing without you. In fact, they'd be better off sitting down and letting you get on with it.
b) Laugh so much that no one can see the good work you were doing before the focus was placed on you.
c) Swallow your shyness, keep your nerves steady and try your best to work as a team.
6. Your group is reading out a play together. Do you:
a) Insist on the biggest role, perhaps even two or three roles. You could play them all brilliantly and better than anyone else.
b) Keep losing your place and laughing, then read in a silly or monotone voice to hide your embarrassment.
c) Offer to narrate or read the stage directions, although secretly you'd love to take a big role.
7. You are asked to help design the set for the school play. Do you:
a) Get out your paintbrushes, start creating an artistic masterpiece, and then ask what the play is about.
b) Take the chance to muck about. It's really good fun being behind the scenes.
c) Find out what the play is about and how the actors intend to use the space, then help design something suitable.

b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.

Before this scene, Prospero and his slave, Caliban have exchanged cross words.
The First Key Extract begins with Ferdinand hearing Ariel's song.
Ariel's song calms the stormy waters. In 'The Tempest', music is linked closely to magic and illusion.
He wonders where the sounds are coming from.
Illusion - Ferdinand does not know where the sound is coming from. He assumes that it is magic and tells us that the music not only calmed the storm, but also made him feel better.
He follows the sound, and when the song begins again, it suggests to Ferdinand that his father has drowned.
When Miranda sees Ferdinand approaching, she can't believe her eyes. She doesn't think that Ferdinand is real.
Illusion - Ferdinand is a living human being, but Miranda is convinced that he is a magical creature. In 'The Tempest', things are never quite as they at first seem.
Prospero explains that he is a man, not a spirit and that he is looking for other survivors of the shipwreck. Prospero feels excited that Miranda and Ferdinand seem to like each other: it was his plan all along
Power - Prospero claims that he has used magic to make Miranda and Ferdinand fall in love. Prospero likes to control and manipulate people through his magic.
, and he promises to reward Ariel with his freedom for helping to get them together.
Ferdinand asks Miranda if she is an ordinary girl or a goddess.
Miranda can't believe that Ferdinand is an ordinary mortal. She thinks he's a 'spirit'. She calls him 'divine' and 'noble'. Ferdinand refers to her as a 'goddess'. The language they use suggests that they worship one another.
He is shocked when she speaks his language. When he hints that he is the King of Naples, Prospero challenges him.
Prospero likes to be in control. As soon as Ferdinand suggests that he has any sort of power, Prospero tries to undermine him. Prospero's questions are sarcastic and mocking in his attempt to show Ferdinand who is boss.
Ferdinand sadly explains that he believes that his father, the King of Naples, has drowned in the shipwreck along with the Duke of Milan and his son. Prospero watches Ferdinand and thinks to himself that he will be able to manipulate him easily now that Ferdinand is in love with his daughter.
Think carefully about what kind of man Prospero is. Is he a caring father who will do anything to get the best for his daughter? Is he manipulative and controlling? Love is a powerful emotion. Should people use love to control others?
Miranda can't understand why her father is being so abrupt with Ferdinand. She has fallen in love at first sight with Ferdinand.
Love - Miranda admits that she has feelings for Ferdinand. It is the first time she has ever felt this way. Do you think that she would have fallen in love with Ferdinand even without Prospero's magic?
She wishes that her father could see things from her point of view.
When Ferdinand offers to make Miranda his queen, Prospero steps in. He is worried that his plan won't work if Ferdinand wins Miranda's heart too easily.
Prospero says: 'But this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning/Make the prize light'. He means that he can't let Ferdinand think that it was too easy to get Miranda to be his girlfriend, because he might not treat her well if it's really easy to make her love him.
He says that Ferdinand is lying about being a king and accuses him of being a spy.
Power/ Illusion - Prospero wants to manipulate Ferdinand. He will make him suffer and work hard for Miranda's love. When Ferdinand claims to have some power of his own as the heir to the throne, Prospero takes this power away by accusing him of being a spy and taking him prisoner. Prospero knows that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne. 'The Tempest' is all about the confusion between what is true and real, and what is illusion.
Miranda tries to speak up for him
You might think that Miranda is brave to speak up for Ferdinand. Apart from being a powerful magician, Prospero has quite a temper! Her speech also shows us how innocent she is. She can't believe that anyone who looks so lovely on the outside can be anything other than lovely on the inside. In 'The Tempest', Shakespeare shows us that things are not always as they first seem.
but Prospero tells her off and threatens to imprison Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Ferdinand a 'traitor'. He threatens to 'manacle' his neck and give him sea water to drink and acorn shells to eat. Prospero doesn't mean any of these threats, but in making them he shows that he has power over Ferdinand and could make him a slave just as he made Caliban his slave. Throughout the extract, Prospero uses words like 'usurp', 'traitor' and 'impostor' which all seem a bit strong when referring to Ferdinand. When Antonio took Prospero's place as Duke of Milan, he did 'usurp' him, and in doing so, he was a 'traitor' and in calling himself the Duke of Milan, Antonio is an 'imposter'.
When Ferdinand draws his sword, Prospero uses magic to make it impossible for Ferdinand to move.
Miranda tries desperately to stop her father but he won't listen. Ferdinand comes to the conclusion that all his problems - his father's death, the shipwreck, Prospero's threats - mean nothing, as long as he can see Miranda once a day, even if he is in prison.
Love/ Illusion - Ferdinand suddenly doesn't mind being Prospero's prisoner, as long as he has Miranda to love. He says it's all like a 'dream'. Does love have that kind of dream-like power to overcome difficulties? Or is it another one of Prospero's spells?
Prospero is pleased that his plan to make Ferdinand fall in love with Miranda has worked. He praises Ariel
Love/ Illusion - When Prospero tells Ariel that he has done well, this suggests that Miranda and Ferdinand's attraction towards one another is not true love, but a magic trick, an illusion, that Ariel has conjured.
Prospero promises Ariel that he will be free
Freedom and Slavery - Just as Prospero has made Caliban a slave and threatened to imprison Ferdinand, he has the power to set Ariel free. When Prospero arrived on the island, Ariel was trapped in a pine tree and Prospero set him free, so he has a debt of gratitude towards him. Also, Ariel is gentle whereas Prospero has a temper. It could be that Ariel is a little afraid of his master.

One advantage of compound sentences is that a writer can build more detail into their writing. However, one problem is that some writers can get carried away and write long rambling sentences:

Did you spot the problem? Remember, care needs to be taken with connectives. Two in a sentence is usually enough, and they don't need to be used in every sentence.
Writers sometimes don't use full sentences. Fragments often help to emphasise a point, create drama or show surprise:
She looked as carefully as she could, but found nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Imagine this. You're trapped. It's dark. It's cold.
Repeating a word or phrase can emphasise a point, or make sure it's fully understood:
His head was drooping as if it weighed a ton, but it was held up by a sharp band around his throat that was almost choking him. He tried to reach up and tear the band away, but there were sharp bands round his wrists as well. He tried to move his feet, but there were more cold, sharp bands around his ankles.
Westall refers to the bands around Ralph's body four times. This isn't because he couldn't think of another phrase. He is emphasising how tightly Ralph is trapped to create a sense of fear and tension. He also allows us to build up a picture gradually, just like Ralph does as he is regaining consciousness. Bit by bit, both Ralph and the reader realise that every part of him is tied up - there is no chance of escape.

Romeo and Juliet first key extract - Characters
If you get a question about characters in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE (see page 2) to help with the middle part of your answer:
Do you think Romeo knows what love is?
Romeo is obviously a very sensitive young man. He seems to be exploring the idea of love. He may well long to be in love. Some of his ideas about love are confused and confusing.
Romeo does not join in with the street brawl and is sad that the violence takes place. He says that he understands that the violence is more to do with love and loyalty towards family than it is to do with hatred. He has been unhappy for some time and his family is worried. When Romeo talks to Benvolio, he finds it difficult to make himself clear. He is more interested in using language cleverly. When he uses oxymorons like 'heavy lightness' it is as though he isn't really sure what love is. When he talks about Rosaline, he focuses on her beauty. He says he loves her, but he is annoyed by her virtuous personality.
Romeo lives amongst people who will kill others and risk their own lives for the sake of their own family, so he knows about passion. The fact that he won't talk to his father about why he is unhappy isn't very loving. Romeo talks about love in an abstract way. He likes the idea of love, and he might have been influenced by what poets have said about love. It could be argued that if Romeo really loved Rosaline, then he would respect her wishes to remain a virgin. Towards the end of the extract, Romeo seems more interested in sex than true love.

Antibiotics are helpful to treat diseases caused by bacteria, such as tuberculosis and food poisoning. They do not harm viruses, so antibiotics cannot treat diseases such as colds and flu, which are caused by viruses.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - Characters
In the First Key Extract, Romeo claimed to be in love with a girl called Rosaline. By the early hours of the very next morning, in the Second Key Extract, Romeo is exchanging ""love's faithful vows"" with Juliet.
It could be said that when it comes to relationships, Romeo isn't very faithful. On the other hand, perhaps he has found his soul mate in Juliet.
Romeo seemed to be in love with the idea of love, perhaps even more than he was in love with Rosaline. Apart from saying that she was beautiful, he wasn't very complimentary about her personality.
Romeo is besotted by Juliet; the fact that she is beautiful plays a big part.
Romeo loves the language of love. His speeches are full of confusing imagery as he tries to work out just exactly what love is.
Romeo tries to impress Juliet with his poetic descriptions about love. Juliet's words somehow seem more heartfelt than Romeo's clever poetry.
Montague and Benvolio discuss how moody Romeo has been lately. When he enters the scene, the audience can see for themselves how his mood can swing from despair to humour and back again.
Juliet is a deeply emotional person and is open about her feelings from the start. Romeo seems to get caught up in that wave of her emotion. They go from being complete strangers to committed lovers in a matter of hours.
Romeo stubbornly swears that he could never love anyone other than Rosalinebut as we see in the Second Key Extract, by the very next morning he is planning his wedding to Juliet.
Both characters make decisions quickly and take risks lightly. Romeo and Juliet could both be described as impulsive in their actions.

change from hot weather in the summer to cold weather in the winter
change from long hours of daylight in the summer to shorter days in the winter
change from lots of vegetation in the summer to bare trees and snow-covered ground in the winter
Let's look at two examples of how organisms are adapted to such changes.
If you have ever been to the seaside and looked for creatures in rock pools, you are likely to have seen lots of limpets on the rocks.
When the tide is in, limpets move over sea-covered rocks, scraping off tiny bits of seaweed. When the tide goes out, limpets clamp themselves very tightly against the newly exposed rock. This makes it difficult for predators to pull them off the rock to eat them. It also stops the limpets losing water, or being washed away by waves.
The snowshoe hare lives in Canada and other parts of North America.
The snowshoe hare has brown fur during the summer, to help camouflage it amongst the earth and plants. Its fur is white during the winter, to help camouflage it in the snow. This adaptation makes it more difficult for predators to see the snowshoe hare, whatever the season.

In a scale drawing, all dimensions have been reduced by the same proportion.
A model boat is made to a scale of 1:20 (1 to 20). This scale can be applied to any units, so 1mm measured on the model is 20mm on the actual boat, 1cm measured on the model is 20cm on the actual boat, and so on.
a) If the 1:20 model boat is 15cm wide, how wide is the actual boat?
b) If the boat has a mast of height 4m, how high is the mast on the model?
The scale is 1:20. This means that every cm on the model is equivalent to 20cm on the boat.
a) 1cm on the model = 20cm on the boat, so:

If you are travelling from Manchester to Newcastle, for example, and need to know how far it is, it would be very difficult to work this out if the map does not have a scale.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. A distance is measured as 3cm on the map.
How many cm, m and km is this equivalent to in real life?
1 cm on the map represents 50 000cm. Therefore, 3cm on the map represents 150 000cm.
To convert from cm to m, divide by 100.
To convert from m to km divide by 1000.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. What distance on the map will represent 5km?
5km = 5000m = 5000  100 cm = 500 000cm
We want to know what distance on the map represents 500 000cm in real life.

But at their first taste, Ariel appears to them. He accuses the ""three men of sin"" (Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian - plotters all) of their crimes. They are warned that they will suffer a nasty death unless they are truly sorry and live a ""clear life"" in the future. Only Alonso will admit what he has done.
A little way away, Prospero tells Ferdinand that he will no longer punish him, but instead will give him his daughter's hand in marriage.
Prospero makes a beautiful illusion of a party appear, to celebrate.

Prospero tells Ariel to lead most of the other survivors on the island to him. But remembering Caliban, Trinculo and Stephano's plot against him, Prospero tells Ariel to keep them away from him. Ariel leads them on a wild goose chase ending up in a smelly pool. They are soon attacked by spirits in the form of dogs.
Prospero is pleased with Ariel, and promises he'll soon be free.

Romeo and Juliet first key extract - Performance
When you write about performance, mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:
haracters and how you respond to them
anguage used - the detail about love, for example
ssues and ideas - like time, love and hate
Once you understand how the audience should feel, you can decide how you might direct a particular scene. Remember, there are lots of different ways to perform the same scene. A good answer depends on how well you explain yourself.
Here is an example of an answer to a question about performance. Think about how you might answer the same question.
How should an actor playing Benvolio behave?
Benvolio's replies to Romeo could either show that he is a good listener who wants to understand his friend's problems, or that he is amused by what Romeo has to say because he knows that his friend is not serious about this girl.
When Benvolio speaks to Montague, the mood is serious. When Romeo arrives, he has to ask lots of questions because Romeo is evasive. Some of Benvolio's comments could be said in a sarcastic or sympathetic way. The jokes that the two characters share show that they are good friends. Benvolio gives advice at the end of the scene that shows that he doesn't believe Romeo's love for Rosaline is serious.
The way Benvolio behaves towards Romeo shapes the way the audience perceives Romeo. This is important because Romeo is the main character. The audience has to like him and worry about him for the tragedy to work. If the actor playing Benvolio speaks his lines in a patient and sympathetic way, it makes Romeo seem like a young man who finds the world confusing. If Benvolio's lines are spoken humorously, the comedy in Romeo's speeches will be brought to life.

Prospero has Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian in his power. He has them imprisoned, with other survivors (except Trinculo and Stephano who are still with Caliban) in a trance, by his cave.
He tells Ariel to fetch them to him. He says that although it would be understandable if he took revenge on them, he would forgive them if they were sorry for what they had done to him.
He also tells Ariel that he will soon be free, and tells him he will miss him.
Ariel leaves to fetch the group. Prospero, alone, declares that he will give up his magic, break his magic staff and throw his magic books into the sea as soon as this business is over.
When Ariel brings the men back, Prospero places them in a magic circle. After telling them off for the wrong things they have done, he releases them from his spell, so they can now wake up. In order that they will recognise him as they awaken, Prospero sends Ariel to fetch his Duke's clothing and sword.
The men slowly start to come to their senses. They recognise Prospero, but are amazed to see him in such a strange place.

A simple sentence generally has one main verb and communicates one idea. For example:
There can be several words in the verb, so
- has two words in the verb.
- has three words in the verb.
However, in each example there is just one main verb and idea. This is the simplest type of sentence and usually it's very easy to understand.
A compound sentence generally joins two simple sentences together. We typically use words like 'and', 'or' and 'but' to join the ideas. For example:
It was cold but we still went to town.
It was raining and we stayed indoors.
This makes the two ideas equal in the sentence - if we take away one part of it, we are left with a simple sentence again. These are very common when we are speaking and they are not difficult to understand.
A complex sentence communicates more than one idea, so it's like a compound sentence in a way. However, the ideas are not equal. This is because one part is like a simple sentence, so it can stand on its own. The other part can't - it needs something else to support it. For instance, look at this sentence:
You can't persuade me to go to town, no matter how hard you try.
We can take away the first part, but then we are left with:
Now this is not a simple sentence and it doesn't stand on its own - it needs something else to make sense.
We use complex sentences a lot when we speak, but it's important to use them in our writing too. In fact, these are the most difficult sentences to get right.

We say that unlike poles attract, and like poles repel.
How can you test if a piece of metal is a magnet. Seeing if it sticks to a magnet is not a good test, because unmagnetised iron, steel, cobalt and nickel objects will be attracted to either pole of a magnet.
So you can't test for what it is attracted to. But you can test what it repels:

Here is the opening paragraph of a text about boxing:
Boxing, amongst other hand-to-hand fighting, has been with us for thousands of years. Originally it was nothing more than bare fist fighting between two willing, and sometimes unwilling, competitors for the entertainment of others. Some people argue that it is a relatively safe, disciplined, highly skilled and technical sport that brings enjoyment and employment to a great many people. Others claim that it is a dangerous and barbaric spectacle that has no place in the civilised world. This article will explore each side's claim in more detail.
Why is this an effective opening for the text?
It is totally in keeping with the title.
It uses a formal, impersonal tone, which is appropriate for an argument text.
It gives a summary of both sides of the argument.
Let's consider some alternative beginnings and see if they are suitable. Decide what you think of each one and then read our comments below.
This article will talk about the damage that can be inflicted when two men stand face-to-face with the sole intention of knocking each other out with their fists. It will go on to argue that boxing, or legitimate assault, has no place in the twenty first century.
This extract certainly gets straight to the point. Although this beginning is quite formal, it is certainly not impersonal as the writer lets the reader know exactly what they think about boxing. The reader can be sure about what the answer to the question in the title will be from the first sentence.
The bell goes and the two warriors approach each other. They are quick. They are strong. They are hard. They are ready to hurt and be hurt.
A left fist launches and connects with a nose. The crowd are on their feet. Cheering. Wanting more. Wanting blood.

The Second Key Extract takes place outside Prospero's cave. Ferdinand is carrying logs. He thinks to himself that he doesn't mind the hard work because he is doing it for Miranda,

Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
Miranda comes to see him. Neither of them realise that Prospero is watching them from a distance.

Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
but he says he has too much to do, so she offers to carry some logs for him.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
He says he would rather break his back than see her work. Miranda insists again that she should help him.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Looking on, Prospero sees how much Miranda is in love with Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Ferdinand asks Miranda her name and when she tells him, she remembers that in doing so, she has broken her promise to her father.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand admits that he has liked lots of different women in the past

, but they have always disappointed him with some fault or other in the end.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
However, Miranda, he says, is perfect. Miranda, on the other hand, hasn't met any men except for her father, or any women, except for herself. Even so, she says that she can't imagine liking anyone more than she likes Ferdinand.
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand tells her that he is a prince, possibly a king (although he hopes his father isn't dead). He wouldn't usually put up with having to carry logs like a slave
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
but he knew as soon as he saw Miranda that he'd do anything for her. When Miranda asks him if he loves her, Ferdinand says he loves, prizes and honours her more than anything else in the world. This makes Miranda so happy that she cries. As Prospero watches them together, he is moved.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Ferdinand asks Miranda why she is crying. She says she thinks she isn't good enough for him
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!
but realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else. Ferdinand happily agrees to marry her. They say goodbye and part.
Prospero is happy for them, but he claims that their engagement is no surprise to him as it was all part of his plan. He goes to get his magic book because he has lots of work to do before supper time.
Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!

97,"> Drama - Showing moods and emotions
Being able to recognise changes in mood and emotion in a script is important as you need to convey this to your audience.
Using these methods, decide how you would express the emotion of anger.
What happens to your face, body and voice when you feel angry? How do you walk when you're in a bad mood? Which gestures do you use to show someone you're angry with them?
Frown, tightly clenched jaw, a tight mouth or even bared teeth.
Tense shoulders, a swift and purposeful walk almost like a march.
Strong and forceful gestures. Perhaps even clenched fists.
Either very loud and out of control or very quiet and menacing.
Maybe if you're very angry you won't pause often, you'll talk very quickly without giving the other person a chance to talk. Or the pauses might be long - a deafening silence!
Now try this with other emotions, eg surprise, excitement, happiness, sadness. See how your body, face and voice change with each emotion.
Another way to practise emotions is to do mood walks - put all the elements together to develop a walk that represents each emotion, then greet (or growl at) people with the appropriate tone of voice.

The Tempest first key extract - Performance
When you talk about the performance of a play, you should think about how people in the audience feel as they watch it. For instance, the beginning of the first extract is magical and romantic. The tone changes in the middle to one of conflict.
Prospero has lots of asides (thoughts spoken aloud) in the first extract. His role in this scene is made more complex because his character is pretending to be something he is not. The director has to decide whether he wants us to see Prospero as a good father who wants the best for his daughter or a manipulative control freak.
Prospero also speaks to Ariel who is invisible to the other characters on the stage.
When Ariel appears, the director must decide how to present the 'illusion'. Ariel is invisible to the other characters. But it does not necessarily follow that he must be invisible to the audience, too. Try to imagine as many interesting and unusual ways to present Ariel - the 'invisible' sprite - as you can.
When you write about performance, you need to mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:
The characters and how you respond to them
The language used - the detail about freedom and slavery, for example
The issues and ideas - like love, magic and power
The performance instructions, such as stage directions

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The party
Romeo and his friends decide to gate-crash the party. Romeo has a bad feeling about the outcome of this evening, but decides to let fate take its course.
Capulet is having a great time at his party. People are dancing. Romeo and his friends arrive wearing masks. Romeo spots Juliet. He thinks to himself that he didn't really know what true beauty was until he saw her. He doesn't know that she is a Capulet. Tybalt recognises Romeo from his voice and threatens to kill him because he is a Montague, but Capulet stops him. Romeo and Juliet flirt and finally kiss. The Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet and he is dismayed. He leaves with Benvolio. Juliet is distraught when the Nurse tells her who Romeo is.
The Chorus recaps events for us: Romeo has forgotten Rosaline and is now in love with Juliet. Juliet feels the same way.
Romeo runs away from his friends. Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline.
Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom. Juliet doesn't know that he is there at first and, talking to herself, declares her love for him. She is shocked and embarrassed when he replies. They have only met that evening, but they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and what time their wedding will be! They find it difficult to part.
Romeo goes to see Friar Lawrence, the priest, who is worried that he has spent the night with Rosaline. When Romeo says that he wants to marry Juliet, Friar Lawrence tells him off for falling in love so easily, but agrees to the wedding because he thinks that it might be a solution to the rift between the Capulets and the Montagues.

Using laboratory techniques scientists can alter the genetic code within the DNA of a living organism. They can add genes from a different species to an organism's DNA
For example, GM can be used to alter the DNA in a bacterium so that it produces insulin. This is a human hormone and valuable to people with diabetes. Bacteria reproduce quickly, so a lot of insulin can be made quickly and used to help people suffering from diabetes.
Some people are concerned that there may be negative aspects to GM.
For example, there are people that believe GM is unethical and should be banned.
Other people are concerned that there may be unexpected long term problems of using GM, producing changes that could not be reversed. Such changes could create new pathogens or ""superweeds"" by the GM organisms breeding with other species. This could cause the natural balance of living organisms in the environment to be upset.
Scientists, society and individuals need to think about the advantages and disadvantages of genetic engineering.

When you describe, you need to give lots of detail and make the words interesting for others to read. For example, if you wanted to describe your home, you wouldn't just write lots of facts, like this:
My house was built in 1972 of red brick with a pitched concrete tiled roof. The house was extended in 2003 with a small UPVC conservatory and an adjoining patio area of approximately 8 square metres...
This gives lots of facts, but these are the types of facts that someone buying a house might need. Most people would find a description like this boring. So what should you do?
The first thing is to think about what you want to show other people. Do you want to concentrate on the roof tiles or the types of bricks used? Or do you want to tell them about the fence panel your brother broke when he was chasing you last summer?
You could also write about the time Stephanie threw a tennis ball and it got stuck in the guttering - it's still there - and when it rains really hard the gutter overflows. You might even have a gnome in the front garden, which your grandad bought - it looks stupid, but you won't move it in case you offend him.
Each of these details is far more interesting than roof tiles or measurements. So, when you are describing something, think of drawing a picture or taking a photograph. You focus on a certain point, write a paragraph about it, then move to the next point and the next.

""He jests at scars that never felt a wound""
He watches Juliet as she stands on her balcony thinking out loud. He thinks that she is like the sun
Romeo uses lots of words and images that relate to light when he describes Juliet.: 'sun', 'stars' 'brightness'.
and that the moon is jealous of her because she is so beautiful. He says that her eyes are like two stars that are so bright that they would stop night-time from being dark if they were in heaven, and the birds would sing because they would think that night was day.
Romeo uses more words and images to do with light to describe Juliet.
He idolises her and compares her to an angel.
When Romeo says that Juliet is like an angel from heaven, on the one hand, he is saying how lovely she is. On the other hand, you could say that he doesn't really see her as a flesh and blood person. He idolises her. Do you believe that he can really love her when he doesn't actually know anything about her? Or do you believe in love at first sight?
Juliet, not realising that Romeo is hiding in her garden, imagines what she would say to Romeo if he were there. She says out loud that she wishes he wasn't a Montague, but says that it doesn't really matter because she loves him anyway, and hopes that he loves her. After all, a name is just a word; it doesn't really mean that much.
If we used another word for a rose instead of the word 'rose', eg 'poo', the rose would still be a rose, it wouldn't smell like poo just because we used that word. In the same way, Romeo is still lovely even though his name is Montague.
When Juliet is thinking these things aloud on her balcony, she doesn't know that anyone else is watching. Have you ever practiced saying something to someone, even though you know that you would never be brave enough to say it?
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet
When Romeo replies, Juliet nearly jumps out of her skin.
""My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself""
When Romeo calls her 'dear saint', Juliet realizes who he is. Romeo called her 'dear saint' at the party.
Juliet is very worried for Romeo's safety; he is a Montague on Capulet property. Romeo uses very poetic and exaggerated language to describe how he managed to climb over the walls.
Romeo has been quite brave and perhaps foolish to break into Juliet's garden. He likes to takes risks and doesn't think clearly about the seriousness of his actions. He uses poetic language to exaggerate his bravery.
He declares that he'd rather die than live never having the opportunity to love Juliet.
Juliet admits that she is embarrassed that Romeo heard the things that she was saying about him. She asks him if he loves her too, but she doesn't give him the chance to answer.
Juliet is worried that she has shown herself to be too keen on Romeo. In Shakespeare's day, nice girls weren't supposed to show that they were interested in boys.
Juliet's speech is very long! Is she nervous or embarrassed? Is she a chatterbox? Is she so excited about her new love that she can't stop talking about it?
Romeo begins to use poetic language about the moon to describe how much he loves her, but Juliet won't let him finish.
Time - Juliet won't let Romeo finish his sentences! Poor Romeo! We already know how much he loves to speak! Juliet's mind is working very quickly. She is excited, but also worried about how suddenly they have fallen in love.
She says that if he swears by the moon, he might turn out to be just as changeable as the moon (the moon changes its shape throughout the month).
She worries that they have fallen in love so quickly.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.
She tries to say goodnight, but she is excited and passionate about her feelings for Romeo and can't seem to stop talking about it.
""My bounty is as boundless as the sea.
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite""
Juliet's use of imagery seems more heartfelt than Romeo's: her love is as deep as the sea, and the sea never runs out. That's passion!
Juliet's Nurse shouts to her from inside the house. Juliet asks Romeo to wait. As she goes into her bedroom, Romeo thinks to himself that their love seems like a dream.
Love - Is this true love? How could it have happened so quickly? Do you believe in 'love at first sight'? Remember, that same evening that he met and fell in love with Juliet, Romeo was moping about saying that he would never love anyone as much as he loved Rosaline! Romeo might argue though that he didn't really know what true love was until he met Juliet.
Juliet comes back out onto the balcony and tells Romeo that if he is serious about her, she will send a messenger out to him tomorrow to find out where and what time they will get married!
Time - events happen very quickly in this play. In less than a week, Romeo and Juliet fall in love, get married and die.
She says goodnight to him as her Nurse impatiently tells her to come inside.
Romeo finds it hard to say goodnight to her.
Romeo said that he was in love with Rosaline in the first extract. Less than a day later, he claims to be in love with Juliet. Has he really thought about the consequences of marrying Juliet. Perhaps, when you are in love, nothing else matters. What do you think?

383,"Humans show many of the same types of behaviour as other animals. But human behaviour is often more complex because we are more intelligent and aware of ourselves.
Humans have instincts, but it is possible for us to overcome natural urges to follow a certain behaviour. For example, a hungry person might want to start eating immediately when they sit down at the dinner table, but they have learned that good manners mean they should wait until everyone is seated and ready to eat.
Most people start smoking before they are adults
People often imitate each other. This can help them learn something new and useful, such as new skill in lessons, sport or at work. It can also lead them to show less useful behaviour. For example, young people may start smoking, drinking alcohol or taking drugs as a result of copying each other to fit in.
Conditioning can be used to change the behaviour of people. Advertisers are very skilled at this. They use pictures of their products which make the them look glamorous or exciting, often by using famous actors or sports people.
By associating the product with attractive images the advertisers are trying to set up a conditioned response to their product. People will respond positively and buy the product.

171,"> Explore, imagine and entertain - Short-stories
A short-story is easy to write if you:
Have only one or two main characters. It's a short story and you don't have time for any more.
Use people's words and actions as much as possible. Don't try to give lots of background information - let the reader use their own imagination. Remember - creative writing means creative reading too!
Make your characters and plot realistic. How do people really speak and act? Remember, most writers base some of their characters on people they actually know, so who can you use to improve your story? Would your granny make a good secret agent or your uncle a confident contract killer?
Get straight to the point. Don't worry about long openings or lots of detail. Instead, launch right in, hopefully in the middle of some action, like in the example below.
Steve held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - he was too shocked to speak. One moment he had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next he was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
You will also have to decide whether to write in the first person (using ""I""), or in the third person (typically, using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they""). Using ""I"" makes it easier to write about thoughts and feelings, but using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they"" lets you move from person to person, or from place to place. You can choose whichever you feel happiest with. For instance, we can swap the opening of the story into the first person, like this:
I held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - I was too shocked to speak. One moment I had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next I was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
The only thing you shouldn't do is swap the person - dont start with ""I"" and then switch to ""he"", or you'll spoil the story.

Another top style tip is to avoid being boring. It sounds obvious, but many writers put in far too much information. In fact, some even write most of the question out again when they start their answer. So what should you do?
At the beginning, don't waffle, get straight to the point. Don't just repeat things in your conclusion. Put yourself in the reader's shoes - which of these two starts to a school magazine article do you prefer?
Do you know someone who is being bullied right now? Don't know what to do? Well we decided to send Stuart Smith (Year 8) around the school to find out just how bad bullying is, and to come up with some ideas about what we can do to stop it.
Bullying is when people are cruel to other people. It can be hurting them, like kicking them, or hurting them using horrible names. It could be other things too. My article for the school magazine is about bullying. I am going to start by saying what the problem of bullying is and then...
The first one is much better - it gets straight to the point and you want to read on. The second version repeats parts of the question, but for no reason. People who are reading the school magazine don't have to be reminded in each article that it is the school magazine. We also know the article is about bullying from the first sentence, but Stuart's definition is poor and the whole article is slow to get started.
You've got tone and style. Work it!

395,"> Inform, explain and describe - Informing
The key thing about writing to inform is that you stick to the information. You shouldn't really show many of your own feelings, and you definitely don't want to tell your audience how they should feel. Instead, when you inform you make the facts easy to understand, with a clear structure.
Write an information leaflet for Year 6 pupils, telling them about the school day and what they need to know when they start your school in September.
It's important to structure your answer well. Think of the answer in terms of a drawing, like this:
This is a timeline - the arrow is time moving forwards and the four lines are different events in order. Now, you can think of the school day as the arrow, and plan the different events in a typical day. For instance, you could have registration, then an assembly, then two lessons followed by break. It should be easy to add information and detail. The structure also makes it easy for the Year 6 pupils to follow your information. Another way to inform is by subject, as in the diagram below:
These are points linked together. It is not in order of time, but in order of subject. So you could have PE at the centre with all the information connected to PE in the little circles around. For instance, you could have different types of PE kit, the different sports, the sort of exercises you do. Once you have written about PE, you can move on to look at other areas of the school.

The two equations cannot be solved on their own. Each one by itself has infinitely many solutions.
For example x + y = 10 has infintely many values for x and y for which this is true, like x=1, y=9
together to make one equation that has only one solution. The x and y values of this solution will solve both of the original equations at the same time. This is why they are called simultaneous equations, because you are trying to solve them both with the same values for x and y.
One way to solve them is using the

This gives you the value of x, but what is the value of y?

You can check your answer in the other equation (in this case,
This is right, so the values are correct.
The solution of the equations is therefore
Use the substitution method to solve the following simultaneous equations:
Substitute the value of y from equation (1) into equation (2)
2x + (x + 2) = 11
To find y use this x value in equation (1): y = x + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5
Check in equation (2): (2  3) + 5 = 11 (which is correct)
So the solution is x = 3, y = 5

Some persuasive texts aim simply at persuading us to do something, particularly charity leaflets, holiday brochures and adverts. Others may try in more subtle ways; newspaper and magazine articles may try to persuade us to agree with a certain view.
Try to convince us to do or agree with something, such as spending money or agreeing with a certain belief.
Contain a mixture of fact and opinion.
Emphasise key points by using subheadings, repetition, memorable phrases and emotive language.
Often use a personal style so that the text seems to speak directly to the reader.
Show clear links between points, such as ""if you donate 20 you will be helping a sick animal"" or ""using our deodorant will attract women"".
Stories can also be persuasive as well. A writer may want you to like or dislike a character. The way that they describe a character can persuade you to do either of these. Look at this extract from 'Jane Eyre':
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at the table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye with flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mamma had taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate health'.
How does Charlotte Bront try to persuade, or convince, us that John Reed is an unpleasant character in this paragraph?
She makes him sound unattractive, with his ""dingy and unwholesome skin"" and ""heavy limbs"".
She suggests that he is greedy as he ""gorged himself habitually at the table"". She suggests that this is why he is so unhealthy, so that we don't feel sorry for him.
She makes him sound spoilt because his mother is keeping him home from school, even though his so-called ""delicate health"" is his own fault.

Take a look at the final paragraph of the article about boxing.
In conclusion, both sides of the debate have solid foundations. As has been shown, the arguments for and against have been put forward since boxing began. And, it would seem, the argument will continue for at least the foreseeable future, as compromise seems unlikely. Both sides do agree, however, that the debate is better held whilst boxing is licensed and controlled rather than unlicensed and uncontrolled. The latter would make it, in my opinion, neither sport nor spectacle.
As you can see, the writer clearly signals that the end is approaching by using the connecting phrase ""In conclusion"". It maintains the impersonal approach it set out with by stating that the argument will continue and that ""compromise seems unlikely"". The last sentence is a statement of the writer's own opinion, but this doesn't alter the fact that it is, or has been, a discursive text.
So, when answering how effective the beginning or ending of a text is, here's a quick checklist you might find helpful:

So early walking did I see your son.
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood.
I, measuring his affections by my own,
Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Being one too many by my weary self,
And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
I neither know it, nor can learn of him.
Have you importuned him by any means?
Both by myself and many other friends:
Is to himself  I will not say how true 
But to himself so secret and so close,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.
See where he comes. So please you, step aside.
Ill know his grievance or be much denied.
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, lets away.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeos hours?
Not having that which, having, makes them short.
Out of her favour where I am in love.
Alas, that Love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Alas, that Love, whose view is muffled still,
Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Heres much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs:
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers eyes;
Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.
What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.
This is not Romeo: hes some other where.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will 
A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.
A right good mark-man! And shes fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Well, in that hit you miss. Shell not be hit
With Cupids arrow. She hath Dians wit,
And in strong proof of chastity well-armed,
From Loves weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide th encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
O, she is rich in beauty  only poor
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
Be ruled by me: forget to think of her.
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
To call hers  exquisite  in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing fair:
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who passed that passing fair?
Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.

It can be observed and measured, and experiments can be designed to test how it works.
Human behaviour is affected by many variables. It can be more difficult to study than the behaviour of other animals.
Fieldwork does not always mean you have to work in a field. It means investigations that take place outside the laboratory.
Some scientists spend many hours watching and studying the behaviour of animals. They may be interested in how the animals live alone, group into families or form large groups such as herds.
Scientists can tag sharks to study their behaviour.
Animals can signal to each other. For example, they may call to each other to warn of danger. Some scientists are interested in such signals. They record and study them to try to work out what the signals mean.
Some animals migrate over large distances to find food or nesting sites.
Animals can be tagged by attaching tracking devices to them. Tagging lets scientists follow the journeys the animals make.
The work of Lorentz and Pavlov has been mentioned in this Revision Bite. These scientists studied animal behaviour under controlled conditions.
The behaviour of woodlice is often studied in schools. Several woodlice are put into a choice chamber with four different conditions:
The woodlice are left on their own for a while, and then the number of animals in each quarter is counted. Woodlice prefer dark and damp conditions. The quarter of the choice chamber with these conditions contains most or all of the woodlice.

People often confuse mass and weight. Remember that weight is a force, and is measured in newtons. Mass is measured in kilograms (kg).
The mass of an object is the

A 100 kg object has a greater mass than a 5 kg object. Remember an object's mass stays the same wherever it is.
All objects have a force that attracts them towards each other. This is called
. Even you attract other objects to you because of gravity, but you have too little mass for the force to be very strong.
Gravity only becomes noticeable when there is a really massive object like a moon, planet or star. We are pulled down towards the ground because of gravity. The gravitational force pulls in the direction towards the centre of the Earth.
""Down"" is towards the centre of the Earth, wherever you are on the planet
Weight is a force caused by gravity. The weight of an object is the
between the object and the Earth. The more mass the object has the greater its weight will be.
Weight is a force, so it's measured in
. On the surface of the Earth an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 10 N.
The mass of an object stays the same wherever it is, but its weight can change. This happens if the object goes somewhere where gravity is stronger, or weaker, such as the Moon.
The Moon has less mass than the Earth, so its gravity is less than the Earth's gravity. This means that objects weigh less on the Moon than they do on the Earth.
The Moon's gravity is one sixth of the Earth's gravity. A 120 kg astronaut weighs 1200 N on Earth. On the Moon they would weigh only 200 N. The astronaut's

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to advise
Once you can argue and persuade, it should be easy to advise. The trick is to be gentle - it's no good pushing your ideas at your readers, or trying to impress them. Instead, you should come across as friendly, as someone who just wants to help.
For instance, imagine you're writing to advise someone in Year 9 who is moving house and has to change schools. We know that it won't be easy - they'll have to make new friends and cope with all sorts of changes. So you need to be sympathetic and give some ideas you think could help.
The first thing might be to plan each main idea in a separate paragraph because it's easier to follow like this. Then think about how you want to present your ideas. It might be fine to give some information as an order, such as:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone.
You can add information to this - perhaps explaining why and giving an example of what to do, so now your paragraph looks like this:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone. Most people will be glad to help and it's the quickest way to make friends. You can ask a teacher, but it might be better to ask one of the other pupils. Choose a friendly face if you can, and don't be shy - it might be their first day too.
It is not just the information that makes this a good piece of advice, it's also the style. It includes words like ""might"" and ""can"". These make the ideas softer - they are not in your face and pushing you to agree, they just guide you. And they are very simple to use, so make sure you include words like ""should, can, could, might, ought to and may"" - each one turns an idea into a piece of advice.

Explore, imagine and entertain - Ending short-stories
The other problem some writers have is ending the story. It doesn't matter if it's a happy ending or not, but it has to make sense. There are lots of ways of ending, such as:
, where we have to wait until the final moment until we know. For instance, the spy who manages to stop the bomb two seconds before it explodes.
, where we are fairly sure about something, but in the final part everything changes. For example, we then learn that this is a fake bomb, and the real one is hidden somewhere else and will explode in five minutes.
, where the story stops, but we aren't sure what has actually happened at the end. For instance, the bomb is defused and everyone is safe. But then an army commander reports the theft of another bomb... only this time twice as powerful.
However, there are two endings to avoid:
, where a bomb will inevitably explode and as it does, the narrator wakes up - it was all a dream. Some English teachers don't mind this sort of thing, but others hate it. You have been warned.
, where the secret agent suddenly stops worrying about the bomb, retires, and goes off to play golf. This is even worse, and no-one likes it because the ending has nothing to do with the story.
Whatever kind of story you write, decide on your ending and include it in your plan.
Writing that explores, imagines or entertains depends on being creative. You need to experiment a little and not be frightened to try something new.

Dave and Lisa win 500 between them. They agree to divide the money in the ratio 2:3.
The ratio 2:3 tells us that for every 2 parts Dave receives, Lisa will receive 3 parts. There are 5 parts in total.
500 represents 5 parts. Therefore, 100 represents 1 part.
Dave receives 2 parts: 2  100 = 200
Lisa receives 3 parts: 3  100 = 300
It's important to notice what order the parts of the ratio are written in. 2:3 is not the same as 3:2.
In the example, the ratio of Dave's money to Lisa's was 2:3. If we swap the order to 3:2 then Dave would get more than Lisa.

Formal and informal writing - Informal writing
Writing is informal when it reads as though someone is chatting to the reader. In the right situation, it makes your writing seem more friendly and natural.
Which of the following would you NOT write using informal language?
b) An essay about a Shakespeare play
c) A talk aimed at students your own age or younger
e) A story written from the point of view of a character (in the first person)
b) An essay should always be written using formal language. All of the other situations would suit a more informal style.
Tips to make your informal writing more effective
""Dear reader, I'm really glad you've found the time to open this letter.""
2. It's okay sometimes to use the kind of words that are more usual in speech than writing:
""You don't have to put up with bullying. We'll stick together and make it stop.""
3. Contractions sound more natural in certain types of writing eg a talk to fellow students:
""It's good to know that we're all going to work together on this.""
Don't baffle your reader with too much slang.
Think carefully about structure - informal writing is different to speech and needs carefully planned paragraphs to keep it clear and easy to read.
Sometimes there is opportunity to break the rules of Standard English and use English in unexpected ways. Two good examples of writers who achieve this are poet Benjamin Zephaniah and writer Andrea Levy in her book Small Island.

The population of each organism in a food chain can be shown in a sort of bar chart called a pyramid of numbers. The more organisms there are, the wider the bar. The producer in the food chain always goes at the bottom of the pyramid of numbers.
Clover is a plant and it is the producer in this food chain. Its bar goes at the bottom of the pyramid:
Energy is lost to the surroundings as we go from one level to the next, so there are fewer organisms at each level in this food chain. A lot of clover is needed to support the snail population. A thrush eats lots of snails, and a hawk eats lots of thrushes, so the population of hawks is very small.
Sometimes the pyramid of numbers doesn't look like a pyramid at all. This could happen if the producer is a large plant such as a tree, or if one of the animals is very small. Remember, though, that whatever the situation, the producer still goes at the bottom of the pyramid.
An oak tree is very large so many insects can feed on it

If the question asks you to comment on how the theme of power is explored, consider these points:
In the first extract, Ariel's songs calm the storm and make Ferdinand believe that his father is dead. This puts Ferdinand in a weak position which makes it easier for Prospero to manipulate him. Ariel's magic powers are responsible for much of what happens in the play.
Ariel only performs his magic so that he can win his freedom. Prospero has power over Ariel because Ariel owes him a debt of gratitude.
It could be argued that Prospero's assertion of power and authority over Ferdinand is unnecessarily harsh.
Prospero is obsessed with power and authority having had his title taken from him by his brother Antonio.
As a prince, Ferdinand's royal power becomes redundant on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero sees Miranda and Ferdinand's love as a power that he can use to manipulate Ferdinand.
Miranda seems powerless under her father's control on the island. She rebels against him, but even her rebellion was part of Prospero's plan.

368,"A debate is an organised argument. You might think you've never taken part in a debate before but you probably have without realising it! When you discuss topics in class or at home, and put forward different points of view - this is debating. Debating allows you to discuss your ideas and find out what other people think about a particular topic.
If you're asked to take part in an organised debate at school, this is likely to be a more formal discussion and follow a set of rules.
Here are some simple rules for formal debates:
First of all, you need two teams: the proposition team and the opposition team.
Then you need something to argue about. This is called a motion.
The proposition team starts. Their first speaker has to tell everyone what the motion is all about.
The opposition team goes next. Then the teams take it in turns until everyone has had their say.
The last speaker on each team has to sum up their team's main argument.
Your team will need to do plenty of preparation - writing out the main points of your argument. During the debate, your team is allowed to pass notes to each other so that you can add or change things as you go along. The most convincing team wins the debate. Try to guess in advance what your opposing team might argue to avoid being caught out.
Use these tips to make your arguments as convincing as you can:
Use facts - it's hard to argue against a fact so use as much evidence and as many statistics as possible.
Use opinion too - debating is all about getting your opinion across and persuading others to agree with you, so use a good balance of fact and opinion.
Listen to the other team and comment on what they have said. You then have a chance to convince the audience of the other side of the argument.
Structure your argument - as if you were writing an essay, you need a clear introduction, a middle and a conclusion.
Arguing isn't about shouting the loudest - present your arguments in a clear controlled voice. Don't lose your temper or get too emotional about the arguments.
Improve your public speaking and maybe you'll be TV Presenter one day. But it's not all bad!

is the chemical reaction used to release energy from glucose. It is called aerobic because oxygen from the air is also needed.
Here is the word equation for aerobic respiration. Energy is put in brackets because it not a substance:
Notice that the word equation for respiration is the reverse of the word equation for photosynthesis. Check back if you are not sure of this.
Plant cells respire, just as animal cells do. If they stop respiring, they will die. Remember that respiration is not the same as breathing, so take care - plants do not breathe.
As we can see from the word equations respiration and photosynthesis are opposites. Respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and produces oxygen.
So what happens to a plant overall? This depends on whether it is in the dark or the light, and how bright the light is.
Plants respire all the time, whether it is dark or light. They photosynthesise only when they are in the light.
Neither gas is taken in or given out, as each cancels the other out
Photosynthesis usually results in a net food gain (net glucose gain), once respiration has been accounted for. This means that there is an increase in the biomass of the plant.
Plants that lose their leaves in winter store food produced during the summer by photosynthesis. They store enough food to last them over winter, and to provide energy reserves for new growth in the spring.

These are the things that plants make by photosynthesis:
We can show photosynthesis in a word equation, where light energy is shown in brackets because it is not a substance:

Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves, and water from the ground through their roots. Light energy comes from the sun.
The oxygen produced is released into the air from the leaves. The glucose produced can be turned into other substances, such as starch, which is used as a store of energy. This energy can be released by

Ray, the main character in this extract, has stolen a motorbike and caused an accident that killed someone. He has told nobody, but knows that he can't hide for much longer. He is about to get on a bus, but realises that the one person who can link him to the crime is the conductor of that very bus. Before he can run off, he bumps into Mrs Fitzroy, his best friend's mum.
Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. Write one paragraph for each bullet point.
He hung back, groping wildly for some excuse to prevent him getting on, but the bell rang and the engine increased its impatient rumble and his legs carried him upwards on to the platform, and he felt Mrs Fitzroy clamber on behind. The bus began to move. He turned towards the stairs, but she caught hold of his arm.
""Let's go downstairs. I don't like the smoke."" Again he felt her hand guide him, and he ducked his head and began to walk along the aisle. ""Yeah"".
""This'll do,"" she said, and he turned back and sat beside her - the less fuss he made, the less obvious he was, the better. As he settled, he kept his face bent low, aware of the conductor walking towards them. He brushed past, and, noticing things with a total clarity, Ray saw the dark blue uniform that he was wearing and noted the heaviness and thickness of the material. He heard him clumping up the stairs, and he wondered, absurdly, if he was wearing heavy boots, too.
Mrs Fitzroy was opening the bag which she had on her lap, and Ray felt in his pocket for his fare. If he had the right change, he could just hand it to the conductor without looking up. Yes, he had a ten and two pence piece. He glanced at Mrs Fitzroy and saw to his dismay that she was taking out a pound-note from her purse. That would mean a delay while she got her change - plenty of chance for him to be recognised. Could he offer to pay her fare? It would seem strange, but anything was better than being seen.
What kind of atmosphere does the writer create in this extract and how do they do it?
Ray's thoughts and actions as he gets on the bus
how the writer uses language to create the atmosphere.
In this text, the writer creates an atmosphere of fear and tension. Ray's thoughts and actions at the start of the passage show that he is under a lot of pressure. He tries to think of an excuse to 'prevent him getting on' the bus, but knows that this will just make Mrs Fitzroy suspicious. When he tries to go upstairs, she insists they stay downstairs. Nothing seems to be going his way, and this leads us to believe he may well be spotted by the conductor.
As the conductor approaches, Ray's fears increase which creates more tension. He keeps his face 'bent low' to avoid being recognised, and also notices things 'with a total clarity'. This shows that he is very scared and alert, ready for something to go wrong. When he realises Mrs Fitzroy has no change, he feels 'dismay'. The reader is kept on the edge of their seat waiting for the conductor to come along.
The writer uses language, as well as events, to create tension. The phrase 'groping wildly for some excuse' shows Ray's panic and gives the impression that he feels he has no control over events. The way he notices the 'heaviness' of the conductor's uniform, and wonders if he was 'wearing heavy boots as well' might mean that he is afraid of the man. Ray asks himself 'Could he offer to pay her fare?'. This shows he is tense; he is running through possibilities in his mind. The writer uses Ray's fears to create an atmosphere of tension for the reader.

In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood
She would be as swift in motion as a ball:
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
But old folks, many feign as they were dead -
Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.

It can add to your marks in a test if you show a plan of how you are going to answer a long question.
A writer will usually plan not only what they are going to write, but also how they are going to write it. For example, how would a writer plan a magazine article about the benefits of health and fitness?
Imagine you are writing a plan for a magazine article about fitness and health.
Beginning: do people need to be fit?
Health angle  unfit people can need more health care
Ending: get fit and eat healthy food and you will benefit

Let's take a look at what those pieces are and how they fit together to make a sentence.
First, we have words. Words are the smallest meaningful bits of sense.

A phrase is a short, single piece of information:

A clause is a larger word group that includes a little more information. It consists at least two phrases - one is a noun phrase known as the subject, and the other is the verb.
In this clause, the noun phrase is
This now takes us to the sentence.
If we put a capital letter at the beginning of the clause we've used, and a full stop at the end, we have a sentence.
. A simple sentence consists of one clause that has a subject and a verb. A simple sentence puts across one simple idea.
A complex sentence is used to put across more
ideas. A complex sentence contains one main clause that can make sense on its own, and one or more minor clauses that are linked to it.
The main clause is the 'big dog barked' because it has a subject and a verb and makes sense by itself.
The minor clause is 'When I arrived'. Although it is a clause with a subject and a verb, it doesn't make sense on its own, it needs a main clause.
We can add more minor clauses to make a more complex sentence.
We can even split the main clause with a minor clause and still have a complex sentence.

If you are asked how many days there are in a week, you would find the answer easy - there are 7. How about the number of days in two weeks? Again, the answer is fairly straightforward - there are 14.
What happens when you are asked how many days there are in three weeks, or four or five? If you know the formula you could work this out.
1 week is 1  7 days = 7
2 weeks is 2  7 days = 14
3 weeks is 3  7 days = 21
4 weeks is 4  7 days = 28
So, the formula to work out the number of days is:

. In very basic terms you can think of the difference between informing and explaining in terms of answering a slightly different set of questions:
Explain = What? When? Who? Where? How? Why?
This difference is reflected in the question you will be asked, so our question about the leaflet might look a little different now:
Write a leaflet for both the pupils and their parents, outlining some of the main features of school life in Year 7 and beyond. In particular, explain why pupils have several teachers each day and why the detention system is used.
This is a little harder than the earlier version, but it's still about your school. Therefore, you still need lots of information about the classes, the organisation and the timetable. So you could still use our two basic approaches, timelines and topic centres, like this:
However, you can also put these together, like this:
Now, we can see a number of topics, so perhaps the three big circles represent registration, lesson times and detentions. They occur in that order each day, but the reasons for them are very different. So the smaller circles answer how and why as well as what, when and who. For instance, what are detentions? When do they take place? Who is in charge of them? How do pupils get put in detention? Why does the school use detentions?
This approach gives your answer a very clear structure. The writing deals with a number of subjects in turn and each subject should be in its own paragraph. You can add details and explanations as you write out each paragraph. It makes it easier for you to write and easier for your audience to read or listen to.

The extract below is from a leaflet about passive smoking.
. Passive smoking is breathing in other people's tobacco smoke. Other people's tobacco smoke is sometimes called environmental tobacco smoke.
. Only 15% of the smoke from a cigarette is inhaled by the smoker - the rest goes into the surrounding air and other people can breathe it in. Breathing air which contains tobacco smoke can be bad for your health. This is because the tiny particles and gases in tobacco smoke contain over 4000 chemicals, many of which are harmful - at least 60 are known to cause cancer. The gases also contain carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas that comes out of car exhausts.
Q. What is the effect on my health?
. Breathing other people's smoke is uncomfortable and can cause:
nose, throat and chest irritation and breathing difficulties
From a Health Development Agency Passive Smoking Information Leaflet
The following questions will draw on all the skills you have revised so far. Note down your answers then compare them with ours.
Q1. What, according to the leaflet, is ""passive smoking""?
Q2. How much of the smoke from one cigarette is inhaled by the smoker?
Q3. Name one effect that passive smoking can have on our health, according to the extract.
Q4. Who do you think is the target audience for the leaflet?
Q5. Give one reason why you think this.
Q6. Look at the second answer that the writer has given in the leaflet: the one beginning ""Only 15% of the smoke..."". Explain two ways in which the writer has used language to persuade the reader that passive smoking is dangerous.
Q7. Why has the writer phrased each heading as a question?
Q8. Explain two ways in which the writer has used layout to make the text more effective.
A1. Passive smoking is 'breathing in other people's tobacco smoke'.
A2. 15% is inhaled by the smoker.
A3. Coughing. (You could name any of the effects listed in the bullet points.)
A4. The target audience could be teenagers, or a broad audience. It is the reason that you give in the next answer that is more important.
A5. Reasons are: the language used is quite simple; sentences are mainly quite short and simple, many only contain one or two ideas; the information is broken up into short sections; the headings make the information easy to follow. All these would make the text accessible for many readers, including young people.
A6. There are three main ways: the simple statement that it is 'bad for your health'; the fact that tobacco smoke contains 'over 4000 chemicals', many of which are harmful; the mention of carbon monoxide which is 'poisonous'.
A7. The headings are phrased as questions to draw the reader into the text.
A8. Layout has been used in several different ways: the 'Q' and 'A' format is eyecatching; the short paragraphs are easy to follow; the bullet points at the end of the extract make the facts easy to read.

Ivan Pavlov (1849 to 1936) was a Russian scientist who investigated conditioning. He discovered that dogs produced extra saliva when they were offered food. This is a natural response to a stimulus - food makes a dog's mouth water. The saliva produced is needed to start digesting food and to make swallowing food easier.
Pavlov noticed that they also did this when the person who fed them came into the room, even if the person had not brought any food. Pavlov went on to ring a bell at the start of feeding time, and eventually the dogs produced extra saliva when they heard the bell, before any food was brought in.
A dog salivating when it hears a bell is not a natural response. They would not do this without being conditioned to do so. The behaviour has been learned. It's called a

Atoms and elements - Metals v non-metals
Remember that most elements are metals, rather than non-metals. The table summarises some differences in their properties.
Solid (except mercury, which is a liquid)
About half are solids, about half are gases, and one (bromine) is a liquid
High (they feel heavy for their size)
Low (they feel light for their size)
Brittle (they break or shatter when hammered)
Poor (they are insulators, apart from graphite)
They make a ringing sound (they are sonorous)
Notice that metals and non-metals have opposite properties to each other. It is usually easy to tell metals and non-metals apart, but some tests are more reliable than others
For example using a magnet is not a good test to see if an element is a metal. That's because only three metals are magnetic, not all of them.

As well as solving simultaneous equations algebraically, you can solve them by rearranging them into the form of y = mx+c so that you can plot as straight line graphs. When you have plotted the graphs, you can work out the values of x and y that solve the equations.
To refresh your knowledge of straight line graphs, look at
Use the graphical method to solve the simultaneous equations:
Start by rearranging the two equations to get them in the form:
In this case you only need to rearrange the second equation. The two equations are now:

Variation and classification - Continuous & discontinuous
Some of the features of the different organisms in a species show continuous variation, and some features show discontinuous variation.
Human height is an example of continuous variation. Height ranges from that of the shortest person in the world to that of the tallest person. Any height is possible between these values. So it is continuous variation.
For any species a characteristic that changes gradually over a range of values shows continuous variation. Examples of such characteristics are:
If you record the heights of a group of people and draw a graph of your results, it usually looks something like this:
The more people you measure, and the smaller the categories you use, the closer the results will be to the curved line. This shape of graph is typical of a feature with continuous variation. Weight and foot length would give graphs similar in shape to this.
Human blood group is an example of discontinuous variation. There are only 4 types of blood group. There are no other possibilities and there are no values in between. So this is discontinuous variation.
A characteristic of any species with only a limited number of possible values shows discontinuous variation. Here are some examples:

Different planets take different amounts of time to make one complete turn, so they have different lengths of day.
The Sun lights up one half of the Earth, and the other half is in shadow. As the Earth spins we move from shadow to light and back to shadow and so on. It is daytime in the UK when our part of the planet is in the lit by the Sun. And it is night-time in the UK when our part of the planet is facing away from the Sun.
During the day, the Sun appears to move through the sky. Remember that this happens because the Earth is spinning on its axis. In the UK if we look south and follow the path of Sun in the sky during the day, it looks like this:
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west

Weeping again the King my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air. Thence I have followed it 
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.

And that you will some good instruction give

Upon this island as a spy, to win it
Theres nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.

Children usually look a little like their father, and a little like their mother, but they will not be identical to either of their parents. This is because they get half of their inherited features from each parent.
Each egg cell and each sperm cell contains half of the

Here are some examples of inherited variation in humans:
Gender is inherited variation too, because whether you are male or female is a result of the genes you inherited from your parents.
Characteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle. For example, if you eat too much you will become heavier, and if you eat too little you will become lighter. A plant in the shade of a big tree will will grow taller as it tries to reach more light.
Variation caused by the surroundings is called

flower colour in hydrangeas - these plants produce blue flowers in acidic soil and pink flowers in alkaline soil.
Some features vary because of a mixture of inherited causes and environmental causes. For example, identical twins inherit exactly the same features from their parents. But if you take a pair of twins, and twin 'A' is given more to eat than twin 'B', twin 'A' is likely to end up heavier.

Decimals - Place value and ordering decimals
We use a decimal point to separate units from parts of a whole (like tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc).
0.1 is a tenth, 1/10 of a unit
0.01 is a hundredth, 1/100 of a unit
0.001 is a thousandth. 1/1000 of a unit
In 52.13, the value of the figure 1 is 1/10 , and the value of the figure 3 is 3/100.
When ordering numbers, always compare the left digits first.
Eg Which is greater, 2.301 or 2.32?
Both numbers have two units and three tenths, but 2.301 has no hundredths, whereas 2.32 has two hundredths. Therefore, 2.32 is greater than 2.301.
Another way to look at it is to add a zero to the end of 2.32 (this doesn't change its value as it's after the decimal point).
The two numbers are now 2.320 and 2.301 and it is quite easy to see that 2.320 is bigger (just as 2 320 is bigger than 2 301).
Q1. In the number 3.546, what is the value of the figure 4?
Q2. Place the following numbers in order, smallest first: 3.2, 3.197, 3.02, 3.19
A1. The value of the figure 4 is 4/100.
A2. Did you get 3.02, 3.19, 3.197, 3.2?
All the numbers have three units, so start by comparing the tenths. 3.02 has no tenths, 3.197 and 3.19 have one tenth, and 3.2 has two tenths. Therefore, 3.02 is the smallest and 3.2 is the largest.

If we combine these ideas and sentences, we have an interesting and varied piece of writing. All we need to add are some connectives, like 'and', 'but', 'so' or 'because'. Now we have writing that makes a real impact and which can offer advice as well as persuading people, like this:
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now? Why don't you talk to someone at school about it? Because bullying is far more common than many people think. And it is far more serious than many people imagine. In fact, it is one of the main reasons for pupils missing school. But the worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone. So don't suffer in silence, tell your family about it and do something now.

Q1. Round 7.2648 to 2 decimal places (d.p.)
Q2. Round 8.352 to 1 decimal place
To round to two decimal places, look at the number in the third decimal place. It's a 4, so round down.
To round to one decimal place, look at the number in the second decimal place. It's a 5, so round up.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places then the answer must have that number of decimal places, even if you have to add some zeros.
For example, rounding 3.40021 to two decimal places gives 3.40 (2 d.p.).
You need to write both decimal places, even though the second number is a zero, to show you rounded to two decimal places.

A planet's year is the time it takes to make

We've seen already that that different planets take different lengths of time to orbit the Sun. That means their years are different lengths. Mercury has a year of just 88 Earth days, and Neptune has a year of 164 Earth years.
The Earth's axis is the imaginary line through the centre of the Earth between the South and North poles. This axis is
slightly compared to the way the Earth orbits the Sun.
We get different seasons (winter, spring, summer and autumn) because the Earth is tilted. This is how it works:
When the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun it is summer in the UK.
When the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun it is winter in the UK.
When it is summer in the northern hemisphere, it is winter in the southern hemisphere.
Because of the tilt of the Earth's axis the Sun moves higher in the sky in summer, when we tilt towards it, than in winter.

If you ride your bike over a bump in the road, you will be pleased that gases exert

The particles in a gas move quickly in all directions, but they don't get far before they bump into each other or the walls of their container. When gas particles hit the walls of their container they cause pressure. The more particles that hit the walls, the higher the pressure.
This is why the pressure in a tyre or balloon goes up when more air is pumped in.
Gas particles hit the walls of their container and cause pressure
. They hit the walls of their container harder and more often. This increases the pressure. Sometimes the pressure gets so great that the container bursts.
This is why balloons and tyyres burst if you blow them up too much. It's also why deodorant spray cans carry warning signs to tell you not to leave them in the sunshine. If they get too hot they explode.

It is possible to balance the see-saw again if someone else gets onto the other end and sits in the correct place. This is because the turning forces are balanced. We say the moments are equal and opposite.
, we need to know two things:
the distance from the pivot that the force is applied.
This is the equation for working out a moment:
Imagine that a force of 10 N acted on a see-saw 2 m from the pivot. This is how we would work out the moment:
Notice that the unit of moment is
(newton metre). Don't get confused with a 'newton meter', which is another name for a forcemeter.
Here is an example of balanced moments. 10N at 2m from the pivot is balancing 20N at 1m from the pivot. The objects create moments of 20Nm that are equal and opposite, so the see-saw is balanced.
A see-saw will balance if the moments on each side of the pivot are equal. This is why you might have to adjust your position on a see-saw if you are a different weight from the person on the other end.
If a nut is difficult to undo with a short spanner, a longer spanner will help. This is because there will be a bigger moment on the nut, when the same force is applied further from the pivot.
Using the same principle you can increase the moment applied by a lever or a crowbar, and this can help you move heavy objects more easily.

Food chains - Changes to food webs
Let's look at the food web again and ask some questions about its predator-prey relationships, with some possible answers.
What would happen if the grass died?
The grass is the producer, so if it died the consumers that feed on it - rabbits, insects and slugs - would have no food. They would starve and die unless they could move to another habitat. All the other animals in the food web would die too, because their food supplies would have died out. The populations of the consumers would fall as the population of the producer fell.
What would happen if the population of slugs decreased?
Slugs, rabbits and insects all eat grass. If there were fewer slugs there would be more grass for the rabbits and insects. With more food the populations of rabbits and insects would increase. However, the thrushes would have to eat more insects to maintain their population, so it is also possible that the population of insects could decrease. This is turn may reduce the populations of voles and frogs.
What would happen if the population of insects decreased?
There would be more food for the rabbits and slugs, so their populations would increase. However, there would be less food for the frogs and voles, so their populations would decrease. This means less food for the foxes and hawks. However, there are likely to be more rabbits and thrushes for them to eat, so their populations are likely to stay the same.

This was the worst nightmare yet. He was standing with his back pressed against a smooth wall cold as ice. The cold nibbled at his buttocks and legs; it ran up and down the knobbles of his spine, making him shiver; it invaded his lungs so he could hardly breathe; he felt he had been shivering a long time.
In the extract, the writer intends to create a very creepy, sinister atmosphere. The way that he describes Ralph's imprisonment makes it sound very unpleasant. He is ""pressed"" against a wall that is ""cold as ice"" and the cold is creeping into every part of his body, making him shiver. Ralph also feels as if he can ""hardly breathe"" because of the cold.
. The simile; ""a smooth wall cold as ice"", helps the reader relate to Ralph as they will know what ice feels like. The writer also uses personification; the cold ""nibbled"" at Ralph, it ""ran up and down"" his back and ""invaded"" his lungs. This makes the cold sound as if it were alive, running over and into Ralph, trying to eat away at him. This adds to the feeling that he has been overpowered and is in danger.

It wouldn't even be enough if you wrote about all the good things in the park. That would be
as you haven't thought about any other views.
A good argument presents both the good and bad aspects of keeping the park. For instance, the park might protect nature, but cost a lot to keep clean. It might be a good place to walk, but few people actually go there. An argument depends on bringing these ideas together. Use connectives, like ""because"" or ""however"" or ""although"". These words give your argument a logical structure and help make the contrasts clear.
Once you have worked through these ideas, you come to your conclusion - saying whether they should keep the park or not.

Ariel tells Prospero what has happened to the ship and its passengers and crew. He tells how he appeared on the ship as a flame (he is after all a magic spirit), and frightened the passengers so much that they had jumped in to the sea. Only the crew remained on the ship.
Prospero wants to be sure that the crew and the passengers are safe. Ariel tells him how he saw to it that the passengers were washed up on the island in separate groups. He made sure the ship was safe, and that the crew were sleeping peacefully. He had sent the rest of the fleet back to Naples, with everyone believing that their king's ship had been sunk, and its passengers drowned.
Ariel now changes the subject, and says he's getting impatient. He reminds Prospero there is a time limit on how long he had to be Prospero's servant, after his release from Sycorax's spell. Ariel wants his freedom, and reminds Prospero that he's been a good servant.

Prospero, in reply, reminds Ariel of the horror he was released from. He tells him that he needs him to work for two more days and then he will be free. Prospero sends him off to keep watch over the washed-up passengers.

Analyse, review and comment - Writing to analyse
This is one version of the speech. You will find comments beneath each paragraph, explaining what the writer has done well.
I'm sure you've all heard the saying ""we are what we eat"". Have you been into the school canteen recently? The selection is similar to that in many schools: a main meal which is usually meat-based, a variety of burgers and pizzas, a dessert and, for the health-conscious, jacket potatoes with one or two cold fillings. The question we are here to consider today is whether this is a reasonable selection, or whether changes could be made in Grange High School's canteen.
The speech begins dealing with the problem straight away. It starts with a short, familiar phrase and a rhetorical question, to involve the audience and make them listen to the speech. The current selection of food is outlined to set the scene, followed by the main question to be tackled. The opening is very friendly and easy to follow. This is a great start.
A survey conducted recently by Year 9 students suggested that many students are happy with the food on offer. They stated that the burgers and pizzas were their favourite food and that they were ""tasty, filling, cheap and quick"". These choices, sometimes called ""junk food"", are the best sellers and the canteen staff say the profit from these makes it possible to offer some of the less popular options.
The writer now looks at the evidence for keeping junk food. They've imagined a survey and comments from the canteen staff - this is fine as it's relevant and makes sense.
Some students admit that the junk food in the canteen is the only reason they stay in school at lunchtimes. Although we are not allowed off site during school times, it is well known that some students do sneak out to local chip shops and other takeaways. A substantial number of students who took part in the canteen's survey said they would be more likely to do this if the canteen offered more healthy food.
The final argument for junk food is explained. The writer introduces a rather controversial point, but softens it with the phrase 'it is well known...' so that no one is blamed. Again this keeps things formal and balanced.
So far, the writing looks really good, but it seems like the conclusion will be in favour of junk food. Is there any way of balancing the argument? Go to the next page to see how this is done.

Instincts are useful because they do not have to be learned and they can be complex, like the examples above. Instincts let animals form groups for protection, choose mates, fight to be in charge, and show many other behaviours.
Reflexes are a type of instinct. They happen automatically because of a particular stimulus. For example, if your hand touches something hot by accident, it automatically and quickly moves away. You do not have to learn to do this.

When the school bell rings at the end of break time, the students leave the playground and go to their lessons. People may say that the students are acting on instinct. But they would be wrong.
An instinct is a behaviour that happens automatically without any learning needed. The students have learned that the bell is a signal to do something, so leaving the playground when the bell rings is not an instinct. It is learned behaviour.

, below, sees the light at the window, then realises it is
 But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
Be not her maid, since she is envious:
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
 It is my lady!  O, it is my love!
She speaks  yet she says nothing. What of that?
Her eye discourses. I will answer it.
 I am too bold. Tis not to me she speaks.
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night!
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
O speak again, bright angel!  For thou art
As glorious to this night, being oer my head,
As is a wingd messenger of heaven
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name 
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love
And Ill no longer be a Capulet.
(Aside)Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
Whats Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
Whats in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet.
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name 
And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Call me but love, and Ill be new-baptized.
What man art thou, that thus bescreened in night
I know not how to tell thee who I am.
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of thy tongues uttering, yet I know the sound.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
How camst thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb 
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls,
For stony limits cannot hold love out 
And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet
And I am proof against their enmity.
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
I have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes.
And but thou love me, let them find me here.
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogud, wanting of thy love.
By whose direction foundst thou out this place?
By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot, yet wert thou as far
As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Fain would I dwell on form  fain, fain deny
What I have spoke.  But farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay 
And I will take thy word. Yet if thou swearst
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers perjuries
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
Or if thou think I am too quickly won,
Ill frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo  but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light.
But trust me, gentleman, Ill prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheardst, ere I was ware,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discoverd.
Lady, by yonder blessd moon I vow,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops 
O swear not by the moon, th inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract tonight.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden 
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.
This bud of love, by summers ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Th exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it 
And yet I would it were to give again.
Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?

My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.

By one that Ill procure to come to thee,

And all my fortunes at thy foot Ill lay,

The white sculpture (front) is how the monument will look when it is finished. The brown sculpture (back) is how the monument looks today.
In 1939, a Sioux Indian leader invited a sculptor to carve the famous memorial in South Dakota. What started out as a one-man project has turned into a family affair.

34,"Five California condors died last summer in Arizona's arid backcountry.
A condor's wingspan is 9.5 feet across. That's about as wide as two kids lying down head to toe.
Wildlife experts say the condors did not die from the heat. Instead, the experts believe the huge birds died from lead poisoning. They say the condors had swallowed lead shotgun pellets.
, which means they eat the remains of dead animals. The condors probably ate the remains of an animal that had been shot by a hunter. As they ate the dead animal's flesh, the birds ate the deadly pellets.
If swallowed, lead can make an animal sick or cause death. Lead stops the body from making red blood cells. It can also damage an animal's organs, including the brain and liver.
The five poisoned birds were among 35 condors that have been released in Arizona since 1996. The release program has cost millions of dollars.
After the dead condors were found, wildlife experts recaptured and tested the 16 birds left in the Arizona group. All the birds were healthy and were soon released.
Members of the Peregrine Fund have been releasing and watching the condors set free in Arizona. Jeff Cilek, of the Peregrine Fund, told
that saving California condors is important. ""Condors are good for the environment. They [eat] dead animals,"" Cilek said.
California condors are among the world's largest birds. A hundred years ago, the birds were found in many parts of the United States. Today, the condor is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's list of endangered species. That means the number of California condors is so low they all could disappear someday.
Why are scavengers an important part of the food chain?
Peregrine Fund officials say there are 150 California condors left on Earth. Forty-eight of those birds are living in the wild; the rest are in zoos.

About 567,000 gallons of oil gushed from six gashes in the tanker. The gashes were cut into the tanker
after its engine exploded, causing the ship to run aground, about 60 miles south of New Orleans, Louisiana.
The oil flowed out until the tanker hit the bottom of the river. The river bottom apparently plugged the leaks, explained Virginia Miller, a spokesperson for the ship's operator.
The oil spill is the largest in United States waters since 1989. In that year, the

Emergency crews scrambled to clean up the

Martin Luther King, Jr. at the March on Washington, August 28, 1963.
On a summer day in 1963, more than 200,000 people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to rally for equal rights. There, they heard Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Today, construction of a memorial honoring King is under way about a half mile from the Lincoln Memorial, where King gave that famous speech. The new memorial will be the first on the National Mall to honor an African American.
The groundbreaking ceremony for the King memorial was held on November 13. President George W. Bush, former President William Jefferson Clinton, poet Maya Angelou, and talk show host Oprah Winfrey were among the speakers at the event. ""We give Martin Luther King his rightful place among the many Americans honored on the National Mall,"" Bush told the crowd of about 5,000 people.
King (19291968) dedicated his life to helping others. As a boy growing up in the U.S. South, King witnessed African Americans being treated unfairly. At that time, the South was
or separated by race. Under the law, African Americans were not allowed to attend the same schools as white people and had to sit in the backseats of buses. African Americans also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains.
When King was older, he worked to change those unjust laws. During the 1950s and 1960s, he gave speeches and organized peaceful marches and protests.
Beginning in 1955, King led the famous Montgomery bus boycott to protest segregation. For 381 days, African Americans

King gained national attention from the boycott. As a result of his work, civil rights laws were passed.

The King memorial is scheduled to be completed in 2008. The design uses water, stone, and trees to represent the themes of justice, democracy, and hope. The King memorial will also include a boulder called the Stone of Hope, from which will emerge a 30-foot figure of King. The memorial will contain a circular stone wall chiseled with King's words.
King's dream was for all people to be treated fairly and equally under the law. The design of the memorial is based on a line from his historic ""I Have a Dream"" speech: ""We will be able to hew [cut] out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.""

610,"History in the Making: Japan Invades Hong Kong
War broke out between China and Japan in 1937. An undeclared war was fought until 1941, when China, as well as the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, declared war on Japan, Germany, and Italy. In 1941, Japan invaded the British colony of Hong Kong, which is part of present-day China. Connie interviewed her grandfather, Locksley Siu, who was in Hong Kong during the Japanese invasion.
How old were you when World War II began?
World War II in Hong Kong was from 1941 to 1945. The Japanese army occupied the former British colony when I was 11 years old.
Where did you live, and did you have a car?
Altogether, eight people lived in [an] apartment of 500 square feet. Our apartment was in Wan Chai, on Hong Kong Island. Most people did not have cars. My dad had an old bicycle.
Did you still go to school during the Japanese occupation?
Yes, I continued to go to school for the first year. Later the school was closed because the school ran out of money. During the occupation, students were required to learn Japanese. Japanese teachers taught us Japanese.
Did you have enough food to eat every day?
No, we did not have enough food. We only ate vegetables, beans, and potatoes, but no rice at all. Meat was very costly and in short supply. When we were really hungry, we drank water. Sometimes we had to pick up grass and leaves from trees to eat.
How did the Japanese soldiers treat the Chinese people?
They were rude, and they hated Chinese people. We had to salute the Japanese soldiers when they passed by. Otherwise they would kick [us] in the back.
How was life affected by the occupation?
There was little freedom. The Japanese forbade people to go out after 11 at night. There was no traffic during the curfew. There was a lack of electricity for lighting; instead, we used candles. The only entertainment at night was the radio. The Japanese government took all Hong Kong dollars away. The Japanese government forced us to use Japanese yen. Roads such as Queen's Road and King's Road were changed to Japanese names.
Do you have any comments about the occupation?
More than 60 years after [the end of] World War II, there are still many people  who live in fear, hunger, and poverty because of wars. I hope that you will think more of those less fortunate.
I learned that there was little freedom under the occupation. I should be grateful that I live in a country where I am not forced to do things that I don't want to do. I'm going to do something for the less fortunate, just as my grandpa told me.

Did some of baseball's top players cheat by taking steroids illegally? Among the players appearing before Congress were former stars Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire. Canseco wrote a book admitting to using steroids and accused other players, including McGwire, of steroid use.

spacecraft has spent nearly seven years on a journey into the far reaches of space. During that time, it has covered more than 2 billion miles. In July, the spacecraft finally reached its destination--the ringed planet of Saturn.
You could not stand on Saturn. Unlike Earth, Saturn does not have a solid surface. Saturn is made mostly of gases.
Saturn is light because it is a ball of gas. If you built a HUGE swimming pool, Saturn would float in it. In fact, it is the only planet in the solar system that is less dense than water.
Saturn is windy. The fastest winds on Saturn can reach about 1,100 miles per hour! In comparison, the fastest winds on Earth can reach about 250 miles per hour.
Three other giant planets in the solar system have rings-Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. Saturns rings are the only ones that can be seen from Earth with a small telescope.
""The trip has sort of been like a long car drive, and we cant wait to get out there and explore the sites,"" said NASA scientist Jeremy Jones about the mission. ""In a sense, the tour is just beginning.""
Over the next four years, that tour will include studying Saturn, its rings, and its 33 known moons. Scientists say that Saturn holds clues to how the solar system formed. They think that Saturn and its moons are like a miniature version of our solar system.

Saturn, the sixth planet from the sun, lies between Jupiter and Uranus. Of the nine planets in the solar system, Saturn is the second largest, after Jupiter. In fact, more than nine Earths would fit across Saturn.
The planets rings are not solid. They are made up of particles of rock, ice, and dust. Some of the particles are as tiny as grains of sand. Others are as large as skyscrapers. Although the rings are wide, they are also very thin. The planets rings are only about half a mile thick.
In addition to learning about the rings, scientists are studying Saturns moons. The scientists primary focus is Saturns largest moon, Titan. Titan is larger than the planets Mercury and Pluto.
(HOY-ginz). The probe will parachute through the murky atmosphere of Titan and land on its surface. That will be the most far-reaching landing that a spacecraft has ever made from our planet.
Scientists are interested in Titan because they think it might teach them about Earth. Experts used to think that Titan resembled Earth as it was billions of years ago. They are starting to question that idea.
What do scientists expect to find? ""In many ways, the most exciting part of the journey is about to begin because we dont know what lies ahead,"" said NASA scientist Julie Webster.
Earth and the other planets in our solar system travel around the sun. Saturn is so far from the sun that it receives less sunlight than we get on Earth. The sun also looks much smaller from Saturn.
Do you think it is important for scientists to explore space? Why or why not?

According to scientists in England, cookies pick up moisture as they cool after coming out of the oven. The moisture causes the cookies to expand and contract, which results in cracks. The cracks cause cookies to easily break when they're moved or packaged.
Bakers can use that information to adjust the temperature during the cooling process. Scientists hope the discovery will help keep cookies from crumbling during normal handling.

443,"Children should always wear helmets while riding their bikes.
Eight-year-old Kristina Rauccio from Guilford, Connecticut, wears a helmet each time she rides her bike.
She makes sure she has it on correctly. ""It's important to wear a helmet because if you fall you could get really hurt or injured,"" she says.
Like Kristina, more kids than ever before are wearing bike helmets. A new study showed that 73 out of every 100 kids riding bikes had a helmet strapped to their head.
But there is flip side. The study also reported that most kids are not wearing their helmets correctly. In fact, only 4 out of 100 kids in the study wore their helmet properly. Wearing a helmet incorrectly can lead to injury.
So what is the correct way to wear a helmet?
The helmet should rest on your head in a straight position and should cover your forehead. The chin strap should fit around your ears in a V shape.
Make sure the strap is snug and fastened. If your helmet is rocking forward and backward or from side to side, it's not protecting your head properly.
Health experts say that wearing a helmet correctly when you ride a bike or do any wheel sport--for that matter-- is important. That's because helmets can protect your head and brain from injuries if you should happen to fall. The outside of the helmet is made of plastic, and the inside is lined with a stiff foam to help keep your head safe.
In addition to wearing a helmet, you should remember to protect other parts of your body. Other gear, such as kneepads and elbow pads, help protect you if you should fall or crash. Kristina makes sure she wears kneepads and elbow pads each time she rides her bike. She knows how important it is to put safety first!

Scientists are piecing together clues to solve a puzzle about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. They're trying to determine whether a skull kept at a private location in Salzburg, Austria, belongs to the famous music composer. Austria is a country in Europe.
Mozart was born in Salzburg in 1756 and was buried in Vienna, Austria, in 1791. According to legend, sometime later a gravedigger took the skull, which eventually ended up in Salzburg.
Now scientists have opened a grave in Salzburg that they believe holds the remains of Mozart's father and other relatives. Researchers plan to conduct DNA tests on those remains.
DNA from humans contains information that scientists can use to determine whether people are related to each other. The skull could belong to Mozart if it matches the DNA of his father or other relatives.
Austria has officially declared 2006 the year of celebrations for Mozart. That country will

Most monarchs travel from Canada to Mexico. Others travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north. They are the only insects to make such a long round-trip migration.
Mexican pilot Francisco Gutierrez and a crew of other pilots from Canada and the United States departed from Quebec, Canada, on August 15. The group plans to arrive in Mexico on November 2.
The crew hopes to raise awareness about the monarchs' fragile habitats. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning the forests that protect the butterflies from rain and cold.
No one has ever followed the butterflies in the air for their entire journey. Doing so can teach scientists how the winged insects deal with wind patterns and difficult weather. Gutierrez says, ""It's going to be an adventure.""

337,"Preserving the Past: Saving the Mummies of the Ibaloi
High up in a dense, lush bamboo forest in the Philippines, scientists hike up a steep and narrow trail. (The Philippines is an island country in South-east Asia.)
As the scientists climb higher, they watch out for mud slides and rock falls. Finally, they emerge from under the forest's dripping leaves to face a forbidding black rock. As their eyes adjust to the light, they can see a small, narrow cave near the base of the rock.
Inside that cave, and numerous other nearby caves, is a national treasure. The treasure is not made of gold and silver, however, but of flesh and bone.
The treasure is actually dozens of mummies, some as old as 1,000 years. The Ibaloi people placed the mummies in the caves.
The mummies are the remains of some of the Ibaloi leaders and their families. The descendants of the mummies still live in the Philippines.
The mummies are located in an area called Kabayan in the Cordillera Central mountains. As many as 200 mummies may be located in 50 caves in the mountainous area.
The mummies are important because they tell scientists about past life in the Philippines. The mummies are also
, which means they are important to the religion of the Ibaloi.
Scientists from the National Museum of Manila in the Philippines are scrambling to find and protect all the mummies. The scientists worry that logging, forest fires, farming, or vandals may damage the mummies.
To protect the mummies, the Philippine government is putting up gates in front of the caves. Guards and tour guides are being hired to show people the mummies and to keep vandals away.
According to museum scientists, it took as much as one year to prepare an Ibaloi mummy. The process started when an Ibaloi tribal leader or family member who was near death drank a very salty liquid called
. The brine helped preserve the body.
The body was then strapped to a chair and placed over a low fire, as well as left in the sun to dry, for up to one year. Over time, the body would shrink. The body was then folded and placed in a coffin carved from a pine tree.

Every student in class has a remote control, and the kids are clicking away at the screen. But they aren't changing channels. They're taking a test! Terry Rex's fourth graders at Wings Park Elementary School in Oelwein, Iowa, are using a new kind of classroom technology. Instead of writing with pencils on exam papers, the students use remote controls to take tests.
""It's more fun,"" Courtney Ricchio, 9, told
""I don't have to write, and my hand doesn't get tired."" The remote controls are part of the Classroom Performance System (CPS). When students use CPS to take a test, the questions appear on an electronic screen. Students key in their answers on the remote-control response pad.
Rex is one of the first teachers in Iowa to use CPS. His students use the technology for more than taking tests. They also play learning games with the system. Sam Myott, 9, says his favorite CPS activity is a football game. ""It's a math game with multiplication and subtraction,"" he told
""Since it's on the computer, it's more fun than a worksheet on your desk.""
Some teachers think using CPS to grade a test is more
or a better use of time, than grading a written test. The computer keeps track of the students' answers and prints out their grades at the end of the day. The computer also reports which questions the class found most difficult to answer, so Rex can review them with the group.

Before we got in the tank, we put on special brown overalls called

Boris showed us how the beluga whales respond to different hand signals and touches. He said it takes a few days to teach a beluga a skill like waving its flipper and up to a year to teach a more complicated skill, such as jumping out of the water.
When the belugas followed directions, Boris rewarded them with squid and herring. Those are part of a belugas diet in the wild. We playfully clapped the belugas tongues. Belugas dont use their teeth to chew food. They swallow their food whole.

330,"Wild Weather: Is Global Warming Causing Unusual Storms?
Residents of Barrow, Alaska, are stunned when a severe thunderstorm roars through town. The storm shocks the town; it is the first thunderstorm they have ever seen.
For over 36 hours, a wild blizzard dumps about 100,000 tons of snow on a ski course in Austria. When even the ski lifts stop working, the storm puts a world championship skiing competition on hold.
Those are just two of the many cases of wild weather, such as blizzards, tornadoes, hurricanes, and heat waves, that have been taking place around the world. A recent report from the United Nations (U.N.) says that wild weather may become increasingly common worldwide.
The U.N. report blames the unusual weather on
, or a rise in temperature worldwide.
Certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, settle in Earth's atmosphere. Those gases act like the glass windows in a greenhouse, trapping heat from the sun and causing a rise in temperature.
According to the report, during the next century, global warming will cause average temperatures worldwide to increase by 2 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit.
World temperatures have been slowly increasing at least since 1850, when scientists began keeping records of world temperatures. The 1990s were the hottest ten years on record.
Scientists aren't sure what is causing global warming. Most scientists agree that burning gasoline, oil, and coal as fuel is the most important cause. Burning those fuels releases lots of carbon dioxide.
Some scientists, however, say global warming is mainly caused by forest fires, volcanic eruptions, and other natural events that release carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere.
Craig Idso, from the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, said he doubts that worldwide temperatures will increase much more than they have already. According to Idso, an increase in carbon dioxide may be a good thing, since plants need carbon dioxide to grow. By taking in more of the gas, plants ""will grow like gangbusters,"" he said.
The effects of global warming will vary from place to place, scientists say. In the United States, global warming could cause warmer weather in Alaska, more forest fires in California, crop failures in the Midwest, and longer growing seasons in the Northeast.
In the meantime, many companies are working to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere. For example, automobile manufacturers are developing new fuels that could replace gasoline and limit carbon dioxide emissions.
Michael Glantz, from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that people will learn how to live with global warming. ""Society is more robust than we give it credit for,"" he said. ""People may learn to live more comfortably in a new, warmer world.""

The result is ""Ben's Game""--named after its creator. The game takes place inside the body and stars a boy hero who moves around the screen on a skateboard. The boy is modeled after Ben. The object of the game is to blast cancer cells.
Thanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Ben's idea became a reality. The foundation helped Ben work with a software designer to create his video game. Ben's game is now available free online. To play, visit

472,"Experts hope 2006 will be the year the world is polio-free.
Will polio be declared a disease of the past?
World health groups are fighting a war
with a crippling and sometimes deadly diseasepolio. Their efforts are paying off. Polio has been wiped out in 10 African countries, according to a recent report.
Since mid-2003, nearly 200 children in those 10 western and central African countries were
for life, but no new cases have been reported since last June. When people are paralyzed, they are unable to move different parts of their bodies and may be unable to walk.
The disease raced across Africa and into Asia after people in Nigeria refused the polio
mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think well get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told
She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria.""
Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly
disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havent been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims.
With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world. On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government approved the use of a vaccine that stopped people from getting the disease. Jonas Salk was the doctor who invented the first polio vaccine.
A boy in Africa receives an oral polio vaccine from a WHO (World Health Organization) worker.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world thanks to Salk, it still threatens children in Africa and Asia. Major efforts were recently under way to
or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been
Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door.
To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November.
After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Its uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives.""
Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization.
Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why?
Jonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.
From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Roosevelts death, Salks vaccine was declared officially safe.
In October 2005for the first time in 26 years in the United Statesfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnt at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.

Holding an antenna above my head, Im trying to find a clear radio signal.
Thats it! ""Im getting a radio signal up and to the right,"" I tell my team.
Up the hill we go until we find our targeta gray koala named Abby nestled in a tree. Abby lives in a forest on St. Bees Island, 19 miles off the northeastern coast of Australia.
I am one of eight volunteers visiting this tropical island. We have joined a research team whose members hope to find ways to protect koalas throughout Australia.
Koalas are pictured everywhere in Australiaon cleaning products, on boxes of chocolate, on sports team jerseys. Yet the animals are found only in isolated pockets up and down the east coast.
Koalas were once found throughout the entire range, but farmers cut down many of the forests where koalas lived. Hunters also killed the animals for their fur. By the early 1900s, ""koalas were basically shot out of south Australia,"" says team leader and
Bill Ellis. An ecologist is a scientist who studies the relationships among living things and their environments.
""Here she is!"" yells Jane Stanfield, one of the volunteers, when she spots Abby. Abby is perched in a blue gum, a type of eucalyptus (yoo-kuh-LIP-tuhss) tree. The koalas on St. Bees live and sleep in the trees. Koalas eat a steady diet of eucalyptus leavestheir main source of food.
Although koalas can walk on the ground, they are better suited for life in the
the high cover of branches and leaves in a forest. Whenever we find one of the furry leaf eaters, we collect information about the trees in the area. We measure how tall and how fat the trees are. Then we put tags on their trunks so we know theyve been recorded.
A few days after tracking Abby, our team encounters more koalas, including one named Yellow. Yellow has a baby, called a
We plan to capture the two and give them a quick checkup. My teammates use a long aluminum pole to shake the tree branches on which Yellow sits. ""Were going to bring her straight down,"" says Ellis.
Yellow tumbles into a plastic sheet we hold under the tree, and we gently prod her into the sack. Ellis measures and checks both mom and baby to ensure that theyre healthy. (See sidebar ""
What has Elliss research taught him so far? Compared with koalas in other areas, the St. Bees koala population seems to be healthy. Yet Ellis wonders whether the koalas on St. Bees could be headed for hard times. The island is overrun with wild goats. Ellis thinks the goats are eating the small blue gum trees.
Without those trees, koalas will run out of food in the future. Ellis hopes more research will help him understand how to protect the blue gumsand the koalas that depend on them.

They spend most of their time in eucalyptus trees.
A koala eats about 2 ? pounds of eucalyptus leaves each day. Koalas eat so many leaves that they often smell like eucalyptus cough drops.
Eucalyptus leaves are not very nutritious. As a result, koalas spend up to 18 hours a day sleeping. That helps them store up energy.
Bill Ellis shakes the branches of a tree where a koala named Yellow rests.
As volunteers hold a plastic sheet to catch Yellow, Ellis (in the red-and-blue cap) gently pushes her into a sack.
Volunteers hold Yellow in the sack as they adjust a radio collar around her neck. The radio collar will help scientists track her. They also place a colored tag in her ear to help tell her apart from other koalas on St. Bees Island.

266,"Are Kids' Movies and TV Shows Too Violent?
have in common? Both movies were made for kids and are rated G, which means they are OK for everyone to watch. But two scientists say those movies and many others should be rated ""V"" for their violent content.
The two scientists--Kimberly Thompson and Fumie Yokota--work for Harvard University. They watched 74 G-rated movies and said, ""We were surprised that every single movie had some act of violence."" The violence in the movies ranged from insults to attacks.
One in five TV shows for kids has no educational content, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center.
The two scientists also found that, in 46 of the movies, at least one character was hurt. And they found that, in 37 of the movies, at least one character was killed.
Most of the movies contained nearly ten minutes of violence, the scientists said. The most violent movie the scientists watched was
. That movie has 24 minutes of violence, Thompson and Yokota said.
Violent programs can also be found on TV. The Media in the Home Survey, conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, recently found that more than one-quarter of all children's TV shows had four or more violent scenes in each episode.
Some scientists say that watching too many violent TV shows and movies could make some kids violent. Watching violent shows could make some kids ""think it's no big deal for somebody to be smacked in the head with a hammer,"" said Yokota.
Scientists also worry that kids might imitate the violent acts they see on TV and in movies. Joanne Cantor, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin, said TV and movies usually don't show the effects of violence. Instead, shows often make violence look funny. Kids who think violence is funny might hurt other people without thinking about the pain they're causing.
You can protect yourself from violent TV shows and movies. First, you can limit the amount of TV you watch. The American Pediatrics Association says kids should watch no more than two hours of TV a day. Next, watch TV and movies with your parents. Talk with your parents about what you are watching on TV, and discuss what would happen if the same things happened in real life.
You and your parents can use the Internet, magazines, and newspapers to learn more about TV shows and movies. For instance, you can read TV and movie reviews on the ""Kids-in-Mind"" and ""Screen It"" Web sites.

Our classroom play celebrates Philadelphia's hometown hero. Discover how his hard work helped to improve the lives of all Americans.
Honor the 300th birthday of one of our countrys greatest thinkers, inventors, and statesmen with our classroom play.
Each morning, Benjamin Franklin asked himself, ""What good shall I do today?"" And that is how he lived his life.
His can-do attitude launched him into the history books as one of Americas most famous citizens. Ben was a printer, a writer, an inventor, a community leader, and a founder of our nation.
Ben was born in a cottage in Boston on January 17, 1706. He attended school only between the ages of 8 and 10. Bens education was cut short because his family was poor and needed him to work.
His love of learning, however, stayed with him throughout his life. Ben read all the time. He often went without food to buy books! At 12, he began his lifelong love of printing.
In honor of the 300th anniversary of Bens birth, our three-act play looks at some key events in the life of this great American. Find out how his good deeds helped shape the history of our country.
ACT 1: Ben the Young Man, Boston, 1718-1723
Bens older brother, James, owns a printing press that publishes a very popular newspaper,
In 1718, Bens father decides that 12-year-old Ben should work for James.
At that time, Ben signs a document promising he will work for his brother until he is 21, without pay. In return, his brother is to provide Ben with food and clothes.
Ben likes to read and is a good editor and proofreader. Over the next few years, he learns all about printingand even begins writing letters to the newspaper under a different name. Thanks to Bens sense of humor and clever writing in those letters,
becomes one of the most-read newspapers in Boston.
James finds out that the letters are from his brother and he becomes jealous of Ben. James is furious and vows never to publish any of Bens writing again. He also finds fault with Bens work, even though Ben rarely makes errors.
I know I am a better printer than he is.
You cant leave! You have to work for me until you are 21!
Youll never find a job in this city! Youll come crawling back to me.
But Ben never comes back to his brother. Instead, he leaves in the early morning and runs away to New York City, in hopes of finding work as a printer. After not finding a job there, he heads to New Jersey where he boards a boat to Philadelphia.
The journey is three days long, and Ben is dirty, hungry, and penniless. But Philadelphia is a lively city, and Ben loves it.
ACT 2: Ben the Community Leader, Philadelphia, 1723-1740s
After arriving in Philadelphia, Ben works to establish himself as a printer. In 1728, he opens a printing shop and begins publishing his own newspaper,
A few years later, he also publishes
The book includes weather forecasts, recipes, and jokes. It also contains some of Bens sayings, such as ""Well done is better than well said."" The almanac becomes a best seller and makes Ben wealthy.
Although Ben works to better himself,it is also important to him to help the community. He considers Philadelphia his hometown and works to make life in the city better.
Ben starts projects to pave and sweep Philadelphias streets. He redesigns the citys streetlights so that roads are safe at night.
Ben also helps set up the first public library, hospital, and volunteer fire department. At this time, most houses in Philadelphia are made of wood and stand side by side. When a fire breaks out, it can destroy an entire neighborhood.
Extra! Extra! Fire destroys row houses on Market Street!
We need to train men to fight fires so that this doesnt keep happening.
Ben persuades more than 30 men to form the Union Fire Company.
We nominate Ben as our fire chief.
Ben is appointed fire chief. He makes sure that firefighters are trained to put out fires and rescue people.
(dragging a leather bucket full of water)

The Union Fire Company meets once a month to discuss fire prevention. Ben also publishes fire prevention tips in his newspaper.
Bens ideas for Philadelphia help shape how fire departments, hospitals, libraries, and post offices work in other cities.
ACT 3: Ben the Statesman, Philadelphia, 1776
Along with his work in Philadelphia, Ben helps change the course of American history.
At the time, America is made up of 13 Colonies ruled by Britain. England has passed many laws that the Colonists think are unfair.
Ben works to mend the relationship between the Colonies and Britains ruler, King George III.
Despite his efforts, the Colonies decide to break away from Britain. They fight Britain in the Revolutionary War (1775-1783).
Ben is appointed to the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence. This document frees the Colonies from Britains rule.
We have to decide who should write the Declaration of Independence.
I wont. Many people disagree with my opinions.
I cant. I am not a writer.
I am unsure about independence from Britain.
You must write this very important document. Your writing style is perfect.
When Thomas Jefferson finishes his draft, he shows it to Ben.
Ive made small changes. For example, you wrote, sacred and undeniable, and I changed that phrase to make it stronger.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.
On July 4, a group of representatives from the 13 Colonies approve the Declaration of Independence and some people sign the document.
This for King George, so he can read it without his glasses.
On August 2, Ben and others also sign the document. They know they are risking everything for freedom from Britain.
Seven years later, in 1783, Ben negotiates the treaty that ends the Revolutionary War. In 1787, at age 81, he signs the U.S. Constitution.
Ben Franklin dies on April 17, 1790, at the age of 84. He is buried in Philadelphia. In honor of the 300th anniversary of his birth, people across the country will celebrate the life of this remarkable man.
If you could award a medal to Ben Franklin for one of his achievements, which accomplishment would it be? Why?

689,"Great whites are endangered. They are often hunted for their teeth and fins.
A great white shark cruised across the Indian Ocean in a record-breaking swim. The great white became the first shark known to complete a round-trip journey between two continents.
""This is the first time that an individual fish has been found to go across an entire ocean and come back to the same spot,"" says Ramn Bonfil, one of the scientists who studied the shark. Scientists named the shark Nicole, after Australian actor Nicole Kidman.
Nicole not only set a distance record but also took a bite out of the speed record. The great white clocked more than 12,400 miles on her trip from South Africa to Australia and back. She
or moved between locations, faster than any other marine animal.
The map shows Nicoles route between South Africa and Australia.
Great whites live mainly off the coasts of California, South Africa, and Australia. Nicoles 99-day journey was tracked with an electronic tag placed on her fin.
The tag recorded her movements, including how deep she dove in the water. The results stunned scientists. They discovered that there is more interaction among great white populations in Africa and Australia than had previously been thought.
The new find is helping scientists learn more about how sharks migrate and
(find their way). Why might Nicole have swum so far so fast? Scientists dont know for sure, but they think one of the reasons that she may have made the trip was a search for food. Great white sharks feed mainly on whales, seals, and fish.
And how did Nicole find her way from one continent to another? Although she frequently plunged to depths of more than one-half mile, Nicole spent most of her time swimming on the surface. That led scientists to suspect that great whites might use the sun and the moon to help navigate.
The recent discoveries have excited shark lovers. ""Its clear that we have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg,"" says Bonfil. ""There is still much to learn about great white shark migrations.""
Great whites arent the only big fish in the sea. There are about 370 species, or types, of sharks. Here are some sharks that make a splash.
The whale shark grows up to 40 feet long and weighs about 15 tons. Thats heavier than two elephants!
The dwarf lantern shark is thought to be one of the smallest sharks. It is about 6 inches long.
Although most sharks swim about 1.5 miles per hour (mph), the mako shark is thought to cruise around at 22 mph.
The dusky shark has the most powerful bite. Its jaws clamp together with 132 pounds of force.

87,"Journey to the Center of the Earth
What's under your feet? If you look at the ground, that question is answered easily. But dig a little deeper-about 4,000 miles deeper. That's where you will find Earth's core.
No one has ever journeyed to the center of Earth. However, scientists are trying to figure out what's there.
For a long time scientists believed that Earth's core is made of solid iron and nickel metals. Now, according to a new theory, or idea, a powerful nuclear reactor is located in Earth's core.
Earth may not be the only planet in the solar system that houses a nuclear reactor. Some scientists say nuclear reactions occur at the centers of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
All four of those planets give off, or radiate, more energy than they get from the sun. The scientists say a large energy source must lie hidden deep inside those planets.
Inside Earth's core, atoms, or tiny particles, of uranium split apart. When the atoms split, they give off lots of heat.
Scientist J. Marvin Herndon says the nuclear reaction in the core triggers volcanoes, moves the giant plates of rock that make up Earth's surface, and causes a magnetic field to surround our planet.
Earth has a magnetic field similar to a magnet's. Just like a magnet, Earth has a north pole and a south pole. The north pole has a positive magnetic charge; the south pole has a negative charge.
Earth's magnetic field changes over time. Over long periods of time, the magnetic poles move around. Sometimes the magnetic field completely disappears.
Herndon says the nuclear reaction at Earth's core causes those changes. He says the nuclear reaction changes. Sometimes it gives off lots of energy. At other times, it gives off less energy. And sometimes it stops for a short time.
If there is a nuclear reactor in Earth's core, someday it will stop completely. That would cause volcanoes to stop erupting, Earth's plates to stop moving, and the magnetic field to disappear forever.
The magnetic field protects Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. If the field disappears, life on Earth would end. But don't worry about that. The nuclear reaction in the core will not stop for 2 billion years, Herndon says.

Most U.S. kids go to school for 180 days per year. But is that long enough? Many people don't think so. California's governor, Gray Davis, recently said he wants schools in his state to add 30 days to the school calendar. Across the country, other schools are adding on days and weeks.
Some teachers say they have more to teach than ever before and could use the extra time. They teach more and harder subjects and provide additional information on topics such as safety and ethics.

545,"Should We Go Back to the Moon?
The new spacecraft is like Apollo, ""But bigger.""
NASA hopes to make a giant leapback to the moon.
The U.S. space agency announced its plan to send four astronauts to the moon within the next 13 to 15 years. ""We will return to the moon no later than 2020 and extend the human presence across the solar system and beyond,"" says Michael Griffin, the head of NASA.
The moon is a ball of rock that continually
, or circles, Earth. At 226,000 miles away, it is Earth's closest space neighbor. So far, the moon is the only place beyond Earth that humans have actually visited.
On July 20, 1969, Americans Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin became the first astronauts to land on the moon.
The main mission of the Apollo program was to put Americans on the moon.
The astronauts traveled to the moon aboard the
spacecraft. The main mission of the Apollo program was to put Americans on the moon. When Armstrong became the first person to set foot on the moon, he spoke these famous words: ""That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.""
To date, 12 humans have been to the moon. The last crew visited there on the
NASA plans to develop a new spaceship, by building on technology from the Apollo spacecraft and the space shuttles. ""It's very Apollo-like,"" says Griffin, ""but bigger.""
The new spaceship will take the place of the space shuttle. NASA plans to end the space shuttle program within the next five years.
The first phase of the plan to return to the moon calls for a launch in 2012. The vehicle would bring crews and supplies to the
, a research laboratory in space. Later, the vehicle will carry four astronauts to the moon for a weeklong mission.
'We will ... extend the human presence across the solar system and beyond.'
The moon mission is part of President George W. Bush's long-term space plan. Last year, the president promised to return astronauts to the moonthe first step in an eventual mission to Mars.
The main goal of the mission is to build a research base on the moon where humans can live and work. The moon is very different from Earth. Unlike Earth, there is no air, wind, or weather. The moon's dusty surface is pitted with craters.
While on the moon, astronauts hope to demonstrate that they can ""live off the land."" Learning how to live off the land is important for future human missions to Mars. Because Mars is so far from Earth, traveling there will require humans to stay for long periods of time.
The United States has already begun using robots to explore Mars. Two robotic vehicles,
, are on the Red Planet now. They are searching for signs of water, a requirement for life. Another vehicle, called an orbiter, is on its way. The orbiter is set to arrive in March and will circle Mars, studying the planet for signs of water.
Should We Go Back to the Moon?
Although some space experts and lawmakers praise the plan to return to the moon, others oppose it because of the high cost. The project is set to cost $104 billion.
Some people think that money should be used for other causes, such as helping to rebuild the Gulf Coast after the hurricanes Katrina and Rita. But NASA is quick to defend the space program. ""[It] is a long-term investment in our future,"" says Griffin.
Others say that the public needs to keep being reminded of the ultimate goal. Scientist Louis Friedman says, ""If you don't keep the Mars mission out front, people are going to ask, 'Why are we returning to the moon?' It's got to be because we're extending ourselves into the solar system.""
In 1961, President John F. Kennedy promised to land a person on the moon by the end of the 1960s. It was part of the ""Space Race"" with the then Soviet Union. Each country wanted to be the first to send a human to the moon. The time line shows some famous moon milestones and a vision for the future.

As news of the terrorist attacks spread, people were shocked and horrified by the terrible events.
Throughout the world, people expressed outrage at the attack. ""It's just sick,"" said one firefighter. An airplane expert said, ""This is perhaps the [worst] terrorist attack that's ever happened in the world.""
Like adults, kids were very upset by the attacks. Many of them first learned about the brutal attacks at school.
In many schools, students and teachers comforted one another. Teacher Diane Bulens said the principal at her school in California told the teachers to watch out for the students and then ""told the kids to take care of the teachers.""
Donna Taylor, a teacher in Ohio, said some of the students in her school had friends and family in New York and Washington, D.C.
One student was worried about her father, who was in New York. Taylor offered to let the student use her cell phone to learn whether her father was OK. He was!
Taylor told her students that terrorists wanted ""to disrupt everyone's lives, but we aren't going to allow them to disrupt our day.""
Even though teachers and students looked after one another, many were still fearful that something more would happen. Erin Ricketts, age 11, feared that her state would be attacked. ""I heard California may be next,"" she said. She added that she was worried ""because my mom works in a big building.""
After school, many students went home to talk with their parents about the attacks. Doctors say that in this tragic time, kids, parents, and teachers need to talk to one another. By coming together, Americans will grow and become stronger than ever.

Azerbaijan and Armenia have been fighting over a region called Nagorno-Karabakh. Both countries claim the region belongs to them. Most of the people who live in that region are Armenian, and in 1988, the people of Nagorno-Karabakh began asking for independence or to join Armenia.
In 1991, that request turned into a bloody conflict between the two countries. The fighting lasted until 1994, when a cease-fire was declared. Although the cease-fire continues, the two sides have not settled their differences, and fighting still breaks out.
""The war affects everyone in Azerbaijan,"" Elmira Suleymanova, Farid's grandmother, told
from her home in Baku, Azerbaijan. ""No one can feel safe. One night, an entire community was burned to the ground.""
According to the U.N., the years of fighting have left 1 million people homeless. About 30 percent of those refugees are kids under age 15, said Farid.
No one knows if Farid's petition has had an impact on the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But last month, the leaders of the two countries met to discuss peace.

732,"Now you can take a trip to Mars without ever leaving Earth.
A kid reporter journeyed to Mars aboard Disney's new space ride. Find out how close her ride was to the real thing.
kid reporter Sonia Mia Diaz blasted into space on August 22. This 10-year-old from Florida was on a journey to Mars.
Sonia Mia rocketed to Mars aboard a new ride called Mission: SPACE. She experienced the ride during its opening week at Walt Disney World's Epcot Center in Orlando, Florida.
After her mission, Sonia Mia interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the ride's creators. Sonia Mia learned that Disney worked closely with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to develop the new space attraction. The ride lets people experience what a trip to Mars might be like in the future.
On her journey, Sonia Mia never actually left the ground. The ride gives people the feeling of blasting off and traveling through space. ""We really wanted people to feel as close as they could to what it's like to be an astronaut,"" said Bryan.
Sonia Mia read quotes about space exploration as she waited in line. Information about space history fills the attraction. There is even a moon car called a lunar rover on loan from a museum.
Before boarding the shuttle, Sonia Mia and three other riders were given different roles for the mission. Those roles included commander, pilot, navigator, and engineer.
Sonia Mia was assigned to be the engineer. In real life, Sally Ride, the first U.S. woman in space, performed the same role.
After Sonia Mia strapped herself in, the shuttle moved into launch position. The countdown began, and the shuttle blasted off! During the mission, Sonia Mia and her team used buttons and joysticks to perform the tasks associated with their roles. The ride lasted about 4 minutes.
The mission was as intense as Sonia Mia had hoped. What was her favorite part? The liftoff! ""I liked the intensity of the blastoff and the air pressure on my face,"" she said.
So how did the ride live up to a real space shuttle mission? Weekly Reader caught up with NASA astronaut Winston Scott to ask him that question.
Scott launched into space on two shuttle flights. He tested out Mission: SPACE and gave it a big thumbs up. ""It's a thrill a minute,"" he said.
Although no astronauts have been to Mars yet, Scott said the ride's liftoff was realistic. The feeling of moving up the launch pad and being forced back into your seat were similar to those felt on a shuttle.
However, he points out, there are differences. In an actual launch, astronauts feel about three times the force of
. Gravity is the force that pulls things toward Earth.
The blastoff on the ride was also shorter than an actual liftoff. And, he said, riders don't experience weightlessness. On a real space shuttle, astronauts become weightless because there is no gravity.
For many people, the ride brings to mind the courage of space explorers. As Sonia Mia pointed out, ""Going on the ride made me think about how brave astronauts are.""
Sonia Mia Diaz interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the forces behind Mission: SPACE. Here's what Sonia Mia learned.
Imagineers are people who work for Disney.
In general, Imagineering is about storytelling. We build attractions that put people who visit our parks into different worlds and stories. We also use technology to tell stories.
What was your role in creating the ride?
I'm the senior show producer, which is like being a movie director. A movie director guides people and directs the show, including the lighting, music, artists, and motion you experience on the ride.
Where did your team get the inspiration for Mission: SPACE?
People have always had an interest in space. The time and technology were right to create this new space attraction. We worked closely with NASA to develop the science and technology behind the attraction. No one has ever put people into a ride system like this before.
Before the ride, I was warned not to move my head or close my eyes because of motion sickness. I didn't feel sick, but might a person if he or she does those things?
That could happen if you move your head, because of the technology used to create the ride. We give those recommendations because we want people to feel most comfortable. Some people can move their heads, and it doesn't bother them at all.
How many times have you been on Mission: SPACE?
At last count, I've ridden it more than 400 times!

Why did Singapore stop the sale of gum in previous years? Singapore is known for its extreme cleanliness. In 1992, the country stopped the sale of chewing gum because people were leaving gooey wads on sidewalks, buildings, buses, and subways. How gross is that?

Some coin collectors say U.S. coins should have a greater variety of pictures. For instance, they want to take the image of Abraham Lincoln off the penny. They want to remove the drawing of Thomas Jefferson from the nickel.
""After almost 100 years, even Lincoln himself would probably say enough is enough,"" said coin collector Fred Weinberg.
Weinberg and others say the presidential portraits are boring. Instead of presidents, the critics want to see patriotic scenes.
""I'm not putting down dead dignitaries, but the public wants to see something new to stimulate pride and interest, not just in coins, but in history,"" Weinberg said.
Officials at the U.S. Mint, which makes coins, say they are looking into the possibility of change. The mint could have a new nickel in 2003, a new dime in 2004, a new half dollar in 2005, and a new penny in 2006.
U.S. coins have honored presidents for almost a century. In 1909, President Abraham Lincoln became the first president to be pictured on a coin.
Later, other presidents were pictured on coins. George Washington's image was added to the quarter in 1932. Thomas Jefferson's picture replaced that of a Native American on the nickel in 1938. Franklin Roosevelt's image appeared on the dime beginning in 1946. John F. Kennedy was pictured on the half dollar beginning in 1964.
Not everyone agrees that a change in change is good. Some people want to keep their loose change exactly the way it is.
""We're open to change in color and general design... but we certainly would not be open to just replacing President Lincoln's image with a flower or something else,"" said a fan of the Lincoln penny.
A slippery $20 gold coin recently sold for almost $8 million!
In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had ordered all but two $20 gold coins destroyed. Those two coins were given to the Smithsonian Institution.
Shortly before the rest of the coins were destroyed, ten were stolen. All but one of the stolen coins were later found and destroyed.
The missing coin was found in Egypt in 1954. Before U.S. officials could claim it, the coin disappeared again. The coin turned up in London in the 1990s. U.S. officials brought it back to the United States. This year, it went to auction.

Listening to portable music players, such as iPods, may be fun, but health experts warn that they may harm your hearing. More than 5 million kids and teens suffer some degree of hearing loss from loud noises. And that number may continue to rise.
Since 1971, the number of people in the United States with hearing problems has doubled. Why? Portable music players channel loud sound straight into the ears and don't let it escape.
But it's not just portable music players that are to blame for hearing problems. Everything from noisy rock concerts to loud power tools can harm your hearing.
Loud sounds can damage tiny hairs inside the ear that help you hear. If those hairs are damaged beyond repair, hearing loss is permanent. Extended listening to loud music can also lead to a ringing in the ears called

(BEE-dees), come in colorful boxes and in different flavors, such as chocolate, grape, and strawberry. Michael Eriksen, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said bidis ""are candy-flavored and cost less [than other cigarettes], so they appeal to some kids.""
Bidis are not candy. They actually contain even more deadly poisons than other kinds of cigarettes. The American Lung Association says bidis contain five times more
than other cigarettes. Tar is a chemical that causes disease. Nicotine is a drug that makes people crave cigarettes.
Health experts also say people who smoke bidis have to puff longer and harder than they do with other cigarettes. That means smokers breathe in more poisons.
In every state, it is illegal for kids to buy cigarettes, including bidis. The U.S. government has also banned the importing of bidis because child laborers often make them.
The laws, however, are being broken. Recently, a group of kids in Oregon went undercover to help the police. The kids, ages 8 to 15, were able to buy bidis in some stores.
Health experts say the best way to stop kids from using cigarettes is to give kids the facts about how deadly cigarettes are. Another way to keep kids from smoking ""is to get adults to quit, because they are the biggest role model for kids,"" said health expert Greg Conley.
Smoking kills parts of the lungs that allow a person to breathe. It causes illnesses, such as bronchitis and emphysema.
Smoking blocks vessels carrying blood to and from the heart. It can also lead to heart attacks.

136,"Latest Finds at La Brea Tar Pits
A saber-toothed cat leaps from behind a bush. It moves toward the side of a stream. It's a hot day, and the cat is thirsty. What the cat doesn't see is the shallow pool of liquid asphalt that is covered by a thin layer of sand. As the cat nears the stream, it steps into the sticky black asphalt.
The bones from about 2,000 saber-toothed cats have been pulled from La Brea.
Soon, all four paws are stuck in the muck, and the cat is trapped. Struggling to get free, the cat becomes covered in the asphalt. Several days pass, and the cat, still stuck in the asphalt, dies of starvation.
Now, 35,000 years later, that sandy streamside spot is known as the La Brea (BRAY-ah) tar pits in Los Angeles, California. Last month, scientists finished their annual dig at La Brea's Pit 91.
The scientists unearthed nearly 1,000 fossils and spent time studying those fossils. ""The information we captured will tell us more about what life was like in this area 35,000 years ago than we've ever known before,"" said scientist Chris Shaw. By studying the fossils pulled from the tar pits, scientists are learning more about how Earth's environment has changed through time.
Shaw has been working at the La Brea site for nearly 30 years. ""My favorite part of the job is when I'm actually in the pit digging,"" Shaw told
. He added that he has become used to being covered in dirt and asphalt. ""It's like working in a big sandbox.""
Shaw spends much of his time at the George C. Page Museum in Los Angeles overseeing the huge collection of fossils pulled from La Brea. The museum holds thousands of fossils of prehistoric animals that died in the tar pit.
Some of the animals that fell into La Brea include woolly mammoths, bison, horses, ground sloths, western camels, and llamas. Many of the fossils that have been collected are from about 25,000 to 35,000 years ago.
During that time, Earth was cooler and was just coming out of one of many ice ages.
During ice ages, when Earth's temperature cooled, great sheets of ice, called
, formed at Earth's poles and over huge areas of land.
Digging at Pit 91 has stopped until May 2001. In the meantime, Shaw and other scientists will study the many fossils they have pulled from La Brea.
After 30 years, Shaw still loves his work. ""The coolest thing about doing fieldwork,"" Shaw said, ""is realizing that the fossil you're touching has not seen the light of day for about 30,000 years.""

Sleep experts say that kids who do not get a good night's sleep on a regular basis put their safety at risk. Delaying bedtime for other activities can lead to accidents, such as falling off a bike or getting hurt on the playground.
In addition to preventing injuries, children who get enough sleep on a regular basis tend to get better grades and be in a better mood. ""Sleep is just as important as nutrition and exercise in our overall health,"" says Dr. Carl Hunt, a sleep expert with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Estimates show about 1 out of every 4 adults does not get enough sleep. Sleep experts think that number may be just as high for kids. According to the NIH, children ages 7 to 11 need at least nine hours of sleep each night.
Most kids and families today have busy schedules that can keep them from getting enough sleep. Plus, watching television, chatting on the Internet, and playing video games all compete with valuable sleep time.
Going to bed at the same time each night will help you get a good night's sleep. If you have trouble falling asleep, Dr. Hunt advises you to unwind with quiet time. Reading or listening to soothing music can help bring on sleep.

In 1933, a discovery in Africa excited scientists around the world. They had found a
, or kind, of monkey that they had never seen before--the Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey. Now, only 77 years after it was found, that monkey is extinct, scientists recently announced.
No one has seen a Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey for more than 20 years. In 1988, scientists declared the monkey an endangered species. For the last seven years, scientists searched for the monkey in Ghana and Cte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), two countries in western Africa. They found no sign of the animal.
""If [the] red colobus were present near any of our survey routes, it is likely that we would have seen one,"" said scientist John Oates.
Scientists blame the animal's extinction on hunting and the destruction of the forests where it lived.
Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was the first primate --which includes monkeys and apes--to become extinct in nearly 300 years. But scientists say it will not be the last. They worry that many of the 600 other primate species may die out within the next 100 years. Twenty-five species may die out within ten to 20 years. More than 120 primate species may become extinct before the end of this century, said Ross MacPhee of New York City's American Museum of Natural History.
Endangered primates live in Africa, Asia, and South America. Many of those primates live in areas where people are poor and need to hunt for food to survive.
Scientists fear that unlimited hunting could kill off more primates. ""Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was eaten by people. The last ones probably went into someone's pot,"" said scientist John Terborgh.
MacPhee explained that the best way to help primates is to protect them and the areas where they live. ""As long as there are a few individuals, and as long as humans leave them alone, they'll come back [from near extinction].""

Woodstock was a large music festival held in the rural town of Bethel, New York, in 1969. At that time, the United States was divided over the war in Vietnam and the struggle for civil rights. Adam interviewed Michael Lang, one of the organizers of the concert.
When did you come up with the idea for the Woodstock Music and Art Fair?
In the winter of 1968. I was 23 or 24.
How did you get big stars to come to the concert?
Woodstock sounded like an event nobody wanted to miss, and the name Woodstock in those days was known. It was the home of Bob Dylan, Janice Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and other cultural icons. Initially, it was all about making everyone believe that these people were going to come and that I could get everyone to come. Soon, through word of mouth, bands were calling us.
Did you have any idea that so many people would show up?
In the beginning, we planned on 200,000, but officially we were trying to get a permit for only 50,000. In the end, we had somewhere between 500,000 and 600,000, but more than 1 million who tried to come were turned away. They had to close the [New York State] Thruway and the Canadian border.
Why did you choose Woodstock as the site, and why did you decide to keep the name Woodstock even after you ended up holding the festival 60 miles away, in Bethel?
We had to move to Bethel because we could not find a largeenough place in Woodstock. A lot of people tried to convince me to change the name [of the festival] to Bethel, but I felt the name reflected the spirit of what we were trying to do, which was to create an atmosphere of artistic community. Woodstock always stood for that.
Why are people still talking about Woodstock today?
What made Woodstock unique was how many people came and how well they treated each other. The world was shocked to discover that a crowd of more than 500,000 could live together for three days in a field and treat each other with love and respect. This was set against a backdrop of the war in Vietnam, ... a battle for civil rights and women's rights, and a yearning for peace in the world. The people who came to Woodstock accomplished all of these things, at least for that period of time, so it gave people hope for their future.
The interview taught me that a lot of musicians were activists. I also learned that no matter how prepared you are, you also have to

Spiders may have a bad reputation for being scary, but they are important to us. Bradley hopes his work shatters some

Get caught up on some different types of spiders. Spiders come in all shapes and sizes. Crab spiders, jumping spiders, and orb weavers have made Rich Bradley's Ohio count. Find out more about them and other spiders.
Can you guess how this spider got its name? It may not live in the ocean, but it looks like a crab. The crab spider lives on flowers. It can match its body color to the flower's color. That allows it to sneak up on insects.
What a leap! The jumping spider can jump between 10 and 40 inches. To catch an insect, this hunting spider sneaks up on its prey and pounces.
The trap-door spider lives in a tunnel. The spider, common in the southwestern United States, lines the tunnel with silk and fashions a door made of silk and dirt. It peeks out of the slightly open door and grabs passing insects.
The tarantula is a large, hairy spider found mainly in warm regions, including the southwestern United States. Although the tarantula's bite is painful, it is not very poisonous to humans. Tarantulas hunt insects, lizards, mice, toads, and frogs.
E. B. White's famous spider Charlotte was an orb weaver. The orb-weaving spider spins a wheel-shaped web. When an insect flies into the web, the spider races toward its meal.

Should humans be afraid of sharks, or should sharks be afraid of humans? Debate this issue.
The above incidents took place in Florida during October. After reading such stories, many people might think that they should not swim in Florida's waters. But shark experts say that would be an overreaction. As scary as they are, shark attacks are rare.
The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) says you are more likely to be hit by lightning than be bitten by one of the more than 350 shark species. In fact, each year about 500 people are hurt by lightning in the United States. In 1999, only 58 shark attacks occurred
Scientists say some species of sharks can live up to 50 years.
The largest shark, the whale shark, can be 50 feet long.
Shark skeletons have no bones. The skeleton is made of a tough substance called
Not all sharks are meat eaters. Basking sharks, for example, eat
, tiny plants and animals that float in water. As a result, basking sharks don't have teeth.
Shark Expert Rodney Fox explained, ""Sharks do not like humans; we are too bony. A lot of people who have been bitten by sharks have survived because the shark spat them out.""
One reason that shark attacks may seem more common than before is that more people are using shorelines for recreation, said George Burgess of ISAF.
Sharks that do bite humans have often mistaken people for other kinds of animals. For example, ISAF officials say sharks attack surfers wearing dark-colored wetsuits more often than they do anyone else. To a shark, the wetsuits make surfers look like seals, a favorite food.
Some shark experts say sharks should fear people, not the other way around.
One of the biggest threats to sharks, said Burgess, is
. Finning happens when a fisher catches a shark, cuts off its fins, and tosses the dead fish overboard. The fins are used to make delicacies such as shark fin soup.
Conservation groups are urging governments to protect sharks. During the summer, the U.S. House of Representatives acted to protect sharks when it passed a bill that could prevent finning in U.S. waters. In order for that bill to become law, the U.S. Senate has to pass it, and the president must sign it.
U.S. Rep. Randy Cunningham introduced the bill. ""We must end the harmful and wasteful practice of shark finning,"" Cunningham said.

Libeskind's design includes a tower that stands 1,776 feet tall-a number that has symbolic meaning. It stands for the year the Declaration of Independence was signed and the United States gained freedom from Britain. The tower would be the tallest structure in the world.
The new design will include a memorial to the nearly 3,000 people killed when the twin towers fell on September 11, 2001, after terrorist attacks. The plan also includes indoor gardens that will fill the top floors of the tower.

389,"Smack Down! Is Pro Wrestling Bad for Kids?
""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

268,"Can Iraq's new constitution help bring peace to this war-torn country?
Although the constitution has been approved, Iraqis clash over the countrys future.
Nothing was going to stand in the way of
Zeinab Sahib, a mother of three, as she voted on Iraqs constitution. She cast her ballot at a school in Baghdad, the war-torn countrys capital. ""I came to vote because I am tired of terrorists, and I want my country to be safe again,"" she says.
Sahib was one of 7 million Iraqis who voted to accept or reject the new constitution on October 15. The ballots took days to count by hand, but the constitution passed. Seventy-eight percent of Iraqis voted to make the constitution the countrys new set of laws. ""It is a landmark day in the history of Iraq,"" White House spokesperson Scott McClellan told reporters. ""The political process is continuing to move forward in Iraq, and it is an encouraging sign to see more and more people participating in the process.""
The new constitution marks a step toward establishing a
in Iraq since U.S.-led forces removed Saddam Hussein from power in 2003. A democracy is a type of government in which people vote for their leaders in elections.
Bringing democracy to Iraq has been a challenge. Violent attacks continue throughout the country as
, or rebels, try to prevent Iraq from becoming a democracy. More than 150,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq, helping to bring peace and stability to the country. The U.S. military has also been training Iraqis to protect themselves from insurgents.
Although the constitution was approved, the country is deeply divided. Not all Iraqis agree on how Iraq should be run. Iraq is made up of three major groupsShiites (SHEE-ights), Sunnis (SOON-eez), and Kurds.
Under Saddam Hussein, who was a Sunni, Shiites and Kurds had little voice in the government. The Shiites who live in southern Iraq and the Kurds who live in northern Iraq largely voted for the new constitution. The Sunnis, a minority group, live in the middle of the country and voted against it.
U.S. troops patrol the site of a car bomb explosion in Baghdad, Iraq, in March 2004.
Many Sunnis, who were in control during Saddam Husseins rule, say the constitution favors Shiites and Kurds. The constitution allows the Shiites and Kurds to govern their own areas. Those regions have more oil than where most Sunnis live. The Sunnis worry that the Shiites and Kurds will control most of the oil and leave them weak and powerless.
Along with granting more power to local governments, the new constitution allows Iraqis to vote for leaders every four years. On December 15, Iraqis will vote on a permanent government. They will choose a
, a lawmaking body, like the U.S. Congress. The new government will have the power to revise the draft constitution. If they decide to revise it, voters will have to approve the changes.
As Iraqis begin running their own government, the United States hopes to begin withdrawing its troops. Since the war began three years ago, more than 2,000 U.S. troops have died. Recent polls show that support for the war has dropped and that many Americans want troops to come home. Others warn that the country still faces many obstacles on its path to stability.
In the meantime, President George W. Bush praised the high participation in Iraqs vote. He says, ""The Iraqis are making inspiring progress toward building a democracy.""
Why are the people of Iraq divided over their form of government?
Size: 168,754 square miles (about twice the size of Idaho)
Religion: About 95 percent of Iraqis are Muslims. They practice the religion of Islam. Shiite Muslims make up about 60 percent of Iraqs population. Sunni Muslims make up about 35 percent.

President George W. Bush recently recognized the heroic efforts Americans have made in the wake of this tragedy. In a speech on September 18, Bush said: ""Out of our tears and sadness, we saw the best of America. We saw a great country rise up to help. Tens of millions of dollars and thousands of hours and tons of food and clothing have all been donated to help rebuild shattered lives.""
By flying flags and holding vigils, millions of Americans shared the president's sentiments. ""As Americans, there is a bond between us, no matter how far away we are from one another,"" said Karen Bogart of Pasadena, California.
In the aftermath of the attacks, thousands of heroes offered to help. Those heroes were the volunteers, firefighters, police officers, and emergency crews at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Many of those heroes traveled thousands of miles to help out at ""ground zero,"" the site of the World Trade Center collapse, in New York City. ""We've had fire departments from Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and so many other places help us,"" said New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In addition to their usual jobs, rescue workers looked for pets trapped in deserted apartments or injured in the attacks. Many people who live near the World Trade Center in New York City had to leave their apartments quickly and were not allowed to return--even for their pets.
""Sometimes the owners feel so guilty that they abandoned their pets,"" said Jennifer Olsen of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ""But it is so gratifying to see them when they reunite with their pets after all this time.""
The rescued animals included cats, dogs, birds, and even a
, a kind of lizard. To get to the gecko, named Little Dude, rescue workers had to climb stairs to the 39th floor of a building. Despite that obstacle, Little Dude was reunited with its owner.
Whether rescue workers cleared rubble, looked for and helped survivors, or retrieved lost pets, their heroic efforts made all Americans proud to be Americans. Recently, President Bush also spoke of national pride. ""As president of this great land, nothing made me more proud.""

Ecuador is home to hundreds of types of frogs and toads. But now scientists are worrying about their health.
The mountains and thick forests of Ecuador, in South America, are home to 417 types of frogs and toads. Tiny red-eyed tree frogs hide inside flowers. Bumpy-skinned toads use their sticky tongues to catch mosquitoes and other prey. Colorful poison dart frogs rest on tree branches.

. Amphibians are animals with backbones that spend part of their life in water and part on land. Frogs and toads lay jellylike eggs in water. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, which breathe through gills. As the tadpoles grow into frogs or toads, they develop lungs and live on land.
Like reptiles, such as lizards and snakes, amphibians are
. That means their body temperature depends on the environment. Unlike reptiles, amphibians lack protective scales. Amphibians must live near water so that their skin stays moist.
Over the last 50 years, many amphibian species have become extinct. Two of every five of the 3,046 species that live in North and South America are at risk of vanishing.
Why are these creatures in trouble? Their
is being destroyed as loggers cut down trees to make room for farms and roads. A habitat is a place in nature where a plant or an animal makes its home. Disease, weather changes, and pollution are other causes of the decline in amphibian populations.
Scientists are concerned about the decrease in the number of frogs. The health of frogs is closely linked to the health of the environment. ""Amphibian extinction is an indicator of [a problem with the environment],"" scientist Jonathan Campbell told
Because amphibians breathe through their skin, they easily absorb pollution. They are usually the first to disappear when the environment is under threat. As a result, some frogs are born with
, or wrongly shaped, body parts, such as extra legs and eyes. When frogs with strange body parts are found in an area, it is a clue that the environment is polluted or suffering.
Scientists are fighting to save amphibians. Some scientists believe that South America's poison dart frogs have chemicals in their body that can be used to treat diseases, such as cancer. The scientists want governments to pass laws that will reduce pollution and to create parks that protect the amphibians' habitat.
""Almost half of the extinctions are happening for unknown reasons,"" scientist Robert Kaplan told

The Olympic Games date back more than 2,700 years. They were first held in Olympia, an area west of Athens.
The first known Olympic competition included just one event-a 200-yard footrace. Winning athletes were crowned with a wreath of olive leaves.
Over the years, more events were added, such as wrestling, discus throwing, and chariot racing.

Now, more than a century later, 10,500 athletes from more than 200 countries will go for the gold. The athletes will compete in 28 events, including baseball, gymnastics, swimming, and tennis.

NASA scientists on Earth guided the spacecraft toward the surface of Eros by remote control. Descending at 4 miles per hour, the spacecraft landed after bouncing once.
Thinking that the spacecraft had crashed, scientists were surprised to learn that it was sending information from the asteroid's surface. ""It's working, and we are getting good information,"" said NASA scientist Jacob Trombka shortly after the landing. As a result of the successful landing, NASA continued the mission for an additional ten days.

There may be another 1,000 near-Earth asteroids scientists haven't discovered. Scientists worry that one of the unknown asteroids might threaten Earth. Scientists will use the information they gathered from Eros to protect Earth from asteroids that come too close to the third rock from the sun.

Experts say the UFO seen in October was most likely a meteor, or space rock streaking through Earth's atmosphere. Other UFO sightings, however, remain a mystery.
For years, the U.S government has been studying UFO sightings. Much of the information that the government has gathered on UFOs is top-secret.
Now a new group wants the government to tell everyone what it knows about UFOs. The group is called the Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFI).
""It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the real nature of this phenomenon,"" said John Podesta. Podesta is a former White House official and a CFI member.
The members of CFI asked the government to release information about specific UFO sightings. One such sighting happened in December 1965.
On that cold night, people in western Pennsylvania saw a bright light streak through the sky. The light looked liked it crashed behind some hills.
The mysterious object might have been a rock from space. A space rock that crashes into Earth is called a meteorite. However, several witnesses claimed that soldiers searched the area where the object ""crashed."" They say the soldiers loaded a car-sized object onto a truck, placed a tarp over the object, and drove it away-never to be seen again.
The members of CFI claim that the U.S. government has never released information about the sighting and the object. ""We can't come up with a reason why this information is being withheld. The government won't even acknowledge that the incident took place, but we know that it did,"" said one CFI member.
For now, the exact nature of some UFOs remains a mystery. CFI members hope that the answer lies in secret government papers. They say they are only searching for the truth and they want everyone to know the truth.

285,"At noon on January 20 in Washington, D.C., George W. Bush will be inaugurated as the 43rd president of the United States. This event marks the end of one of the most closely watched and controversial elections in U.S. history.
On Inauguration Day, Bush is scheduled to stand outside the U.S. Capitol before thousands of citizens, the men and women of Congress, and members of the U.S. Supreme Court.
Bush will put his hand on an open Bible held by the chief justice of the United States. Bush will then recite the same Oath of Office that was spoken by the first U.S. president, George Washington, in 1789. The
is the president's promise to lead the country.
After Bush recites the Oath of Office, he will give a speech that may set the tone of his presidency. Many people will be listening carefully to his speech, because the 2000 presidential election was the source of bitter debate.
The first inauguration ceremony was performed in New York City, which was then the nation's capital. On April 30, 1789, George Washington took office. Since then, the ceremony has changed.
Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, walked to the White House after his ceremony in 1801. Bush will arrive at the White House in a long parade of limousines and Secret Service vehicles.
James Monroe, the fifth U.S. president, gave the first outdoor inaugural speech in 1817.
After Andrew Jackson, the seventh U.S. president, was inaugurated in 1829, he held an open house at the White House. The open house got out of control after the crowd, in a rush to see President Jackson, started breaking furniture and china. Jackson was forced to escape through an open window. Although an open house is expected to be held again this year, it will probably be a more controlled event.
""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""

""Volcanoes are just like people--they're awake and active, and they go to sleep,""
. A volcanologist is a scientist who studies volcanoes.
In September, Mount St. Helens began blowing large
, or clouds of steam, thousands of feet into the air. The 8,364-foot mountain is not the only restless volcano in the country. Scientists are also paying close attention to awakened volcanoes in Alaska and Hawaii.

Volcanoes can remain quiet for years and then erupt violently, sometimes without warning. Using the latest technology, scientists hope to better
Mount St. Helens is located in Washington.
Scientists say Mount St. Helens is one of the most closely monitored volcanoes and the most active volcano in the lower 48 states. Mount St. Helens is also among 13 active volcanoes that are located in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. That range is home to several powerful volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier and Mount Hood.
Although scientists say a large eruption at Mount St. Helens is unlikely, they are cautious because of the volcano's history. Officials have sealed off a 5-mile area around the volcano.
Mount St. Helens erupted with tremendous force in May 1980, blowing more than 1,300 feet off its top and killing 57 people. The blast destroyed thousands of acres of forest and scattered ash for thousands of miles. Mount St. Helens continued to rumble until 1986 but has been quiet since that time.
How can scientists tell when a volcano will awaken from its slumber? ""We measure earthquake activity, changes in the mountain, and volcanic gases,"" said Driedger.
Although scientists can't tell exactly when or with what force a volcano will blow its top, they rely on advanced equipment to help them predict eruptions. Special devices called
are installed around volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens to detect earthquakes. Earthquakes always strike before a volcano erupts.
Volcanoes are mountains where hot, liquid rock called magma deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure can cause magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the crater at the top of the volcano and vents, or cracks, along its side. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called lava. Once lava cools, it hardens into rock.
Scientists use special global positioning instruments to measure movements on the slopes of the mountain--a clue to the buildup of
. Magma is red-hot molten rock located inside the volcano. It is called
when it pours out of the volcano.
As magma rises, volcanoes release carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Sensors on helicopters test the air for gases that signal rising magma. ""The gases are like telegrams that tell us what's going on inside the volcano,"" said Driedger.
More than 500 million people around the world live near active volcanoes. Monitoring volcanoes is a dangerous job, but scientists take precautions to stay safe.
""By watching volcanoes, we learn how they work,"" said Driedger. ""The more we know, the better prepared we can be to save property and lives.""
Besides volcanoes, what natural disasters are hard for scientists to predict? Why?

mothers line up at feeding centers with their hungry children in hopes of receiving food and medical care. The people in this western African country are suffering from a hunger crisis after a severe food shortage.
Niger is the second-poorest country in the world. The United Nations estimates that 2.5 million of Niger's 12 million people live on less than one meal per day.
The recent food shortage has put millions of people at risk of starvation. Most of the hungry are children. ""The situation of children in Niger is critical, and we are in a race against time to save their lives,"" says one United Nations Children's Fund official.

around the world. People who live in poverty don't have enough money for food, health care, or school for kids and often lack clean drinking water.
Niger's government also asked richer nations for food aid and money for farmers most in need. Earlier this year, the country received only a fraction of the aid it needed. ""Niger is a forgotten country,"" says one African official.
But now people around the world have started responding to the cry for help. During the past few months, media reports about the food crisis have attracted attention to Niger. Aid is now pouring in from countries around the world.
Government agencies and rescue workers are sending planeloads of food and medical help. Medical workers are treating thousands of
children. When children are malnourished, they have not gotten enough nutrients from food to grow and be healthy.
There is some hope though. An early start to this year's rainy season in Niger has helped crops begin to grow. However, as one person from Niger put it, ""Even if the rains are good this year, the harvest will not be enough.""

The old saying is true-you are what you eat! That's because your health depends on what you put into your body. Here are some nutrients you might find in breakfast foods:
Complex carbohydrates found in foods such as cereal provide your body with energy. Your body stores up the energy and uses it when you need it!
Protein also supplies your body with energy and helps fight infection. Eggs and cheese are good sources of protein.
Vitamins and minerals help the body grow. Milk and other dairy products provide your body with vitamin D and calcium, a mineral that helps build strong teeth and bones. Fruits and vegetables are good sources of vitamins and minerals. You should eat at least five servings of them a day.

Studies show that kids who eat a healthful breakfast learn better, pay more attention in class, and are less likely to miss school. Experts also say that kids who eat breakfast are less likely to overeat later in the day.
That is good news. Along with regular exercise, eating breakfast can lower the risk of becoming
About 9 million kids in the United States are obese. Being overweight can lead to health problems, such as heart disease, later in life.
No time for waffles or pancakes in the morning? Don't worry! We have some quick and easy tips for a healthful breakfast:
Grab that slice of leftover veggie pizza. Eat it cold or warm it up.
Make a breakfast sundae. Top a bowl of yogurt with fresh fruit and granola.
Toast cheese on whole-grain bread. Wash it down with a glass of cold orange juice.
Got milk? Enjoy a cup with a peanut butter and banana sandwich.
Breakfast eaters also have another reason to smile. Eating breakfast in the morning helps keep tooth decay at bay.
A new study found that kids who do not eat breakfast are more likely to have tooth decay than kids who do. Why? Kids who skip breakfast tend to reach for sugary snacks during the day.
Experts say that if you find yourself crunched for time in the morning, don't rule out breakfast. Being creative with your morning routine can help you make time.
You might try planning your outfit the night before or getting up 10 minutes early. Some families even set the breakfast table before going to bed.
Leaving time for breakfast will give you the brainpower you need in school and will keep you going until the lunch bell rings. ""Breakfast really helps to start your engine!"" says Campbell.

258,"The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle's grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles.
The disease attacks an infected bird's brain and spinal cord.
At first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird.
In recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year.
Although the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased.
By the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild.
Wildlife experts are especially concerned because they don't know much about the disease, including what causes it. ""We have some ideas, but we don't have any answers,"" John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said.
Experts also don't know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. ""This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn't noticed,"" Fischer said.
While wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Scientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America's bird--the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn't true in 1782.
Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol.
""I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country"", Franklin wrote. ""He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird"".

The story of Jamestown began on May 14, 1607, when about 100 English men and boys arrived in present-day Virginia. They came seeking gold and other treasures. The settlers, called
built a fort on the bank of a river and named their colony Jamestown, after King James I of England.
or businesspeople, of the Virginia Company to make money in North America. But the settlers faced many problems, including disease, starvation, and conflict with the area's Powhatan people (see ""
At first, settlers stayed close together for protection. ""There were hundreds of people living inside a wooden-walled fort,"" explains Davidson. Living in the fort helped the settlers defend themselves from attack, but it also made hunting for food or growing crops difficult.
Captain John Smith was one of Jamestown's original leaders. He took command of the colony in 1608. When the colony was in danger of running out of food, Smith gave an order: ""He who does not work, will not eat.""
spent five months crossing the Atlantic. The original Godspeed carried 39 passengers from England to Virginia, making two stops along the way. The new Godspeed traveled from Maine to Virginia, stopping along the way to let visitors see the ship.
By 1613, Jamestown had expanded into a successful colony. At about that time, the settlers began to grow tobacco. Tobacco was a
meaning that it could be sold in large amounts to England. In the following years, the settlers pushed the Powhatan off the land and built tobacco
or large farms. Later, the Jamestown colonists bought slaves from Africa to work on the plantations.
Over time, Jamestown grew to become the colony of Virginia. Virginia was one of the 13 colonies that joined in 1776 to rebel against England, starting the American Revolution (17751783).
Much is known about Jamestown, yet more details are being discovered. For more than a hundred years, experts thought the site of the original settlement had been destroyed by the James River. In 1994, archaeologists, or scientists who study the remains left behind by past cultures, discovered what may be Jamestown's original location.
""Visitors can see things being excavated that haven't seen the light of day in 400 years,"" Jamestown spokesperson Mike Litterst told
Scientists are currently looking for the foundation of the first church that the Jamestown settlers built. If found, it will be the oldest English church ever discovered in the United States.
The skeletons of two settlers have already been uncovered at the site. They are on display beneath a glass case, exactly as they were found. Historians believe that one of the skeletons is that of Captain Bartholomew Gosnoll, a member of Jamestown's original ruling council. Gosnoll and Jamestown Settlement will have a lot of visitors in the coming weeks for the 400th anniversary. ""It's the biggest event we've had since 1957, when the [Jamestown] museum first opened,"" says Litterst.
When the English colonists first settled in what is now Virginia, a powerful Native American group had lived on the land for hundreds of years. ""There were about 20,000 Powhatan people there when the English arrived in Jamestown,"" Virginia Indian culture expert Karenne Wood told
She hopes that the 400th anniversary of Jamestown will help shed light on the Powhatan's story.
When Jamestown began, the English and the Powhatan tried to trade with each other peacefully, but soon fighting broke out over land and resources. Beginning in 1614, the fighting stopped for eight years when Pocahontas, a daughter of the Powhatan chief, married Englishman John Rolfe. However, the fighting quickly resumed as Jamestown expanded.
Over time, the Powhatan people lost their land to the English settlers. However, Virginia is home to many Native American descendants today. ""We have changed a lot,"" says Wood, ""but we are still here.""
Organizers at Jamestown are not calling the 400th anniversary a celebration. Why might that be?

The wildfires that recently swept through southern California have been called one of the Golden State's worst natural disasters. The raging wildfires destroyed homes, businesses, and forests. Nearly 750,000 acres burned-an area of land about the size of Rhode Island. ""The whole sky seemed as if it was on fire,"" said one California resident.
Investigators say both people and nature were to blame for the fires. The fires spread rapidly because of the Santa Ana winds, which blow hot, dry air from the desert. Cold and rainy weather eventually rolled in to help quench the flames.
About 15,000 firefighters battled flames that were out of control. Thousands of people had to quickly
, or leave, their homes to escape the fire's destructive path. Many families lost their homes and belongings in the fires. At least 22 people died as a result of the fires.
President Bush declared several southern California counties disaster areas. Governor-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger will work with officials to help homeowners and businesses rebuild.
Government officials say the wildfires will be California's most expensive natural disaster. They estimate rebuilding efforts will cost more than $2 billion.

George Washington and Abraham Lincoln are taking a step out of the history books. Two new presidential museums are using the cutting edge of technology to tell the stories of past U.S. presidents.
A group of students from nearby Rockledge Elementary School recently took a trip to Washington's home in Mount Vernon, Virginia. There, they saw a lifelike statue of Washington mounted on his horse during the Revolutionary War (17751783). The statue is an exhibit in a new museum at Mount Vernon.
""It was cool!"" 10-year-old Jack Eghtessad from Woodbridge, Virginia, told
describing the statue. ""It didn't look fake.""
At the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, students from the city's Iles Elementary School gasped. Lincoln's ghost appeared before them in the museum's library. ""I felt like I was really seeing Lincoln,"" exclaimed Samantha Mackey, 11.
or changing, the way kids learn about presidents. Recently, historians have started using more special effects to tell the stories of famous leaders. The new Mount Vernon museum has been open for only four months, but already it has drawn more than 90,000 visitors. February 19 will be the first Presidents' Day it is open.
Experts used paintings, historical documents, and the latest digital technology to create three statues of Washington for Mount Vernon. One of the statues shows Washington at age 19. Another statue depicts him at age 45, leading the Continental Army in the fight for
or freedom, against the British. The third shows him at 57, when he became the first U.S. president. (See
The museum is also home to a special-effects theater that plays a
or true-to-life movie, about Washington's life. As the film plays, the theater's seats rumble with the cannon fire of major battles. Fake snow even falls from the ceiling as the film shows Washington crossing the Delaware River in a surprise attack on the British military in 1776.
""We are, in a way, definitely on the cutting edge,"" says Ann Bay, the Mount Vernon museum's educational director. ""We were inspired by the Lincoln museum.""
Springfield's Lincoln museum reopened with new special-effects exhibits in 2005. Since then the museum has averaged more than 12,000 visitors a week. Visitors can see a life-size re-creation of Lincoln and his family, use interactive computer stations, and tour the ""ghost library.""
make it look as if ghosts of Lincoln and other historical figures appear in the room. Lincoln historian Thomas Schwartz told
that the special effects draw students into Lincoln's story. In one exhibit, visitors watch as an electronic ticker counts the more than 618,000 Americans who were killed while Lincoln was president during the Civil War (18611865). They see Lincoln's sad reaction to the huge death toll.
""These are real people that had real tragedy, real joy, and real emotion in their lives. People need to understand that,"" Schwartz says. He thinks that special effects help get that point across to visitors.
This life-size model of Washington at age 19 gives visitors a glimpse of the first U.S. president in his youth. Washington was born into a wealthy Virginia family. His first job was mapping out land. He then joined the British army and fought in the French and Indian War (17541763). During the Revolutionary War (17751783), he led the Continental Army against the British to win American independence. In 1789, he was elected the first president of the United States.
Unlike Washington, Lincoln did not have enough money to pay for school. This wax statue shows Lincoln teaching himself by reading between chores. He went on to become a successful lawyer, and in 1860 he was elected the 16th U.S. president. He led the country during the Civil War (18611865) between the states in the North and the South. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation ended slavery in 1863. He was killed in office shortly after the war ended.
In what ways might special effects help students learn history?

Like many 7-year-olds, Demetrio Hernandez Jr. loves to play baseball. But unlike most kids, Demetrio plays without a glove. In fact, Demetrio plays baseball with his feet.

Although Demetrio was born without arms, he has two small hands attached to his shoulders. Demetrio uses his hands to swing a short bat, and he uses his feet to field balls.

Some school officials say putting a stop to contact sports will prevent kids from getting injured at recess. Freedom Elementary School, located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, banned tag because some students slapped or pushed others while playing the game.

Clements and other experts think that kids should be able to play the same kinds of traditional playground games that their parents and grandparents played.

Once every eight days, she wakes up before dawn and treks down a hill from her run-down shack to a pumping station to beg for water. She stands in line with as many as 150 other people. When her turn finally comes, she gets aboard a tanker truck full of brownish, smelly liquid.
The truck then climbs the hill and pours the water into a dumpster and six barrels. Martinez and her family use that water to bathe, clean, and wash. Although the water is free, it is not

Representatives from 148 countries recently met in Mexico City for the fourth World Water Forum in the hopes of making Martinezs dream a reality.

The forum participants met to exchange ideas about how to quench the thirst of the worlds soaring population.

Rocky Mountain moose are on the moveand they're flying firstclass. Wildlife workers are using helicopters to send Utah's moose to Colorado. In exchange, wildlife officials in Colorado are capturing bighorn sheep to send to Utah. The animal swap is part of a plan to keep the moose and sheep populations in both states healthy.
Rocky Mountain moose are on the move.
One of the largest moose hauls took place in January, when a single helicopter team captured 24 of the animals in a day. The moose are now roaming free in the Grand Mesa National Forest in Colorado, where the appearance of calves indicates that the moose population is growing. Colorado workers planned to hold up their end of the bargain by capturing 20 bighorn sheep to send to Utah in February.
""This year was a major group move,"" Stephanie Duckett, a biologist with the Colorado Division of Wildlife, told
Biologists are scientists who study living things. Duckett works at Grand Mesa, which didn't have any moose two years ago. ""So far we have moved 90 moose to the mesa,"" she says. Most of those animals came from Weber County, Utah, where the moose population is in trouble.
The moose in northern Utah are threatened by
That means there are too many animals for the environment to feed and support. Overpopulation can lead to animal starvation and disease. ""It's bad for the population and bad for the environment,"" says Duckett.
Wildlife officials often try to prevent overpopulation by issuing permits that allow hunters to kill more animals during hunting season. That wasn't an option with Utah's moose; many of them live on private land where hunting is
or not allowed. Instead, wildlife officials decided to make a trade.
""Here in northern Utah, we have too many moose, and we've lost a lot of our bighorn sheep population,"" Utah wildlife manager Justin Dolling told
Colorado had a healthy supply of bighorn sheep to send to Utah, and Colorado had plenty of room for Utah's extra moose.
Once they had a plan, wildlife officials had to find a way to safely catch the wild mooseone of the largest animal species in North America. They turned to animalcapture expert James Innes and his experienced team of helicopter ""moose muggers."" A moose mugger is an animal worker trained to capture a moose without harming it. ""We have zero tolerance for
Innes's helicopter chases a moose into a clearing by flying over the forest before dropping a net to catch the animal. Once the moose is down, a moose mugger jumps out of the hovering helicopter and secures the animal's legs. ""You have to use every trick in the book to tie them up,"" says Innes.
Once the moose is secured, it is placed in a canvas bag that hangs from the helicopter and then flown to a base camp. There, a veterinarian, or an animal doctor, gives the moose a checkup before it is placed on a truck and taken to its final destinationGrand Mesa.
Wildlife managers tackled the moose overpopulation problem in Utah by sending moose to areas where they would have enough food. The map shows how moose and bighorn sheep were swapped this year to keep both groups of animals healthy.

Adult moose are too large to be hunted by other animals. Human hunters are their only predator. Half of all moose scalves are killed by wolves, grizzly bears, or black bears.

(veh-SOO-vee-uhss) majestically stands over the Italian landscape. The scenic mountain rises 4,200 feet high southeast of the city of Naples, which is located in southern Italy. But many people living in this region fear Mount Vesuvius. That's because it is an active volcano.
Nearly 2,000 years ago, Vesuvius exploded with tremendous force. Deadly smoke, gases, and rock shot more than 9 miles high in the air. That is about one and a half times the height of Mount Everest, the world's tallest mountain.
A thick black cloud engulfed the region and blocked out the sun. An avalanche of boiling
poured from the volcano at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. Lava is melted rock from a volcano.
The explosion sealed the ancient city of Pompeii (pahm-PAY) under a blanket of rock and ash. A mudslide wiped out the nearby town of Herculaneum (her-kyuh-LAY-nee-uhm). Many people died as a result of the volcano's fury.
Although many eruptions have occurred since then, Vesuvius hasn't exploded with such force since that devastating day. The last major eruption occurred in 1944.
Scientists warn, though, that it's only a matter of time before Mount Vesuvius erupts with tremendous force again. ""It won't be tomorrow, it won't be next month, and maybe it won't be next year,"" a scientist who monitors the volcano told
. ""But [Vesuvius] is overdue [to explode].""
Today, nearly 600,000 people live in the 18 towns surrounding Vesuvius. This high-risk area is known as the ""red zone.""
Officials estimate that they would need two weeks to evacuate all the people living in the red zone. According to scientists, anything within 4 miles of Vesuvius could be destroyed during the first 15 minutes of an eruption.
The volcano's past, however, hasn't stopped people from moving into the area. In fact, Italian officials are concerned about the overcrowding of people in the red zone. To encourage people to move away from this area, they have put a plan in place.
Some families are being offered $36,000 to move to safer locations. The goal is to persuade about 150,000 families to move from the area near the volcano within the next 15 years.

To learn about elephant seals, go to
Until recently, however, those beaches were quieter because elephant seals were almost extinct. But in the last few years, the seals have made one of the most amazing comebacks of any animal.
Nearly a century ago, only 100 elephant seals were left in the wild. Hunters had killed the animals for their

In 1972, the U.S. government passed a law protecting elephant seals. Now, because of that law, more than 150,000 of the seals live in the wild.
Elephant seals spend much of the year swimming in the Pacific Ocean, far from shore. The seals are looking for food, such as fish and squid. They can swim about 35 miles from shore and dive as deep as 5,000 feet below the ocean surface to search for food. (That's about as deep as a whale can dive!)
By December, elephant seals head for beaches in California and Mexico. They hit the beaches to mate and raise their young. When male elephant seals, called
, haul themselves out of the water, they can weigh as much as 4,500 pounds, or two small cars.
Ao Nuevo is Spanish for ""New Year.""
The world's largest colony of elephant seals spends the winter at the Ao Nuevo State Reserve in California. As many as 5,000 elephant seals spend the winter there. Visitors to the reserve can see the giant seals. One visitor said the animals are ""a cross between a beanbag and a Volkswagen bug.""
However, visitors have to watch out for the giant animals. Seals may look fat and slow, but they anger quickly and can move 20 feet in two seconds.
Some visitors are scientists who want to figure out ways to help seals survive.
One way scientists have learned about elephant seals is by attaching radios to the backs of the animals. The radios send out signals. The radios have helped scientists learn how far and how deep elephant seals swim.

174,"Leapin' Lizards! It's TV's Favorite Croc Hunter!
Leaping from his rowboat, Australian crocodile hunter Steve Irwin lands on top of a fierce 12-foot-long crocodile. Covered with mud, Irwin wrestles with the reptile and finally ties up its snout and legs. The out-of-breath hunter then stands in front of the croc and declares, ""She's a beauty!""
Irwin is the star of the hit TV show
. In the United States, 60 million viewers see the wildlife show each week. The show is watched by people in 122 countries around the world.
Irwin, age 38, has been interested in animals and the environment since he was a child. He grew up in a wildlife park in Queensland, a state in Australia. For his sixth birthday, Irwin's parents gave him a 12-foot snake called a scrub python. At age 9, Irwin captured his first crocodile. Ten years ago, Irwin took over the park that his parents had started. Five years ago, his show aired on American TV for the first time.
is about more than wrestling crocodiles, snakes, and other wild animals, Irwin says. He explained that the show is also about making people aware of problems facing many animals.
""We don't run around capturing wildlife for the fun of it,"" Irwin said. ""Our love is to educate and share with the world threatened wildlife. We want to bring animals into your house so that we can share and learn about them.""
For example, Irwin was recently on the Australian island of Tasmania. Irwin was working with the World Wildlife Fund to rescue stranded whales. He wants to call attention to whale hunting in the South Pacific Ocean. ""This practice [whaling] has to stop,"" Irwin said.
Not everyone agrees that Irwin's show is good for animals or the environment.
Kent Vliet does not like ""the haphazard way in which [Irwin] handles snakes and gets bitten."" Vliet is a reptile expert who has worked for the National Geographic Society. Vliet fears that viewers might copy the croc hunter's dangerous moves and get hurt.
Instead of wrestling animals, Vliet said, Irwin should talk more about protecting endangered animals and the environment.
For now, the croc hunter said he will keep on wrestling crocs and snakes and bringing people up close with some of Earth's endangered animals. ""I will continue to put my life on the line to save wildlife,"" he said. ""This is my passion, and it won't stop.""

The NBA has brought back its old ball after trying out a new ball covered in synthetic material.
For the past few months, players had to use a ball covered with a synthetic, or human-made, material. Many players, including O'Neal, complained the plasticcoated basketball was a bad decision. They said the new ball didn't bounce as well as the leather ball. The new ball also cut their hands. ""The new ball is terrible,"" O'Neal, the Miami Heat center, says.
Scientists at the University of Texas at Arlington ran experiments comparing the synthetic and leather balls. The biggest difference they found was in the way the new ball absorbs moisture.
The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture than the leather ball does. That means the synthetic ball doesn't become heavier when it comes in contact with players' sweat. It also means the synthetic ball can become slippery because moisture stays on its surface, scientist Kaushik De, who helped conduct the study, told
The return of the leather ball has many NBA players jumping for joy. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us.""

On October 27, 2004, New York City marked the

Construction began on the subway in 1900 and took 12,000 workers four years to complete. At that time, the population of New York City was 3.4 million and growing. People, horse-drawn carriages, trolleys, and vendors packed city streets.

City officials believed that a subway system would help people get around faster and allow them to move into outer areas.

Republicans and Democrats compete for control of Congress.
The countdown to Election Day has begun. On November 7, Americans will head to the polls to vote in the
Midterm elections happen in the middle of a presidents term in office. (Voters choose a president every four years. The next presidential election is in 2008.)
Members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate meet in the Capitol in what is called a joint session.
Midterm elections give voters a chance to choose people to represent their state in
Members of Congress make up the U.S.
Congress, the legislative branch of government, makes our nations laws.
On Election Day, candidates will compete for 33 of 100 seats in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Elections for governors will also be held in 36 states.
Members of Congress typically belong to one of the two main
in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about government goals. This election will decide whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party controls Congress for the next two years.
Republicans currently have control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Republicans have had the upper hand in the House since 1994. Republicans have also controlled the Senate for most of the past 12 years.
A party controls the House of Representatives or the Senate when its members win a
or more than half, of the seats in it. (See
.) Why is control of Congress so important? The party in power can more easily accomplish its goals and shape U.S. law.
For months, representatives from both political parties have tried to win over voters. Their members have been speaking about important issues, or problems, our country faces. Some of those issues are the war in Iraq, gas prices, and health care. (See
""Our country is facing some serious challenges here and around the world,"" Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told
""At home, our economy has made it harder and harder for working people to make ends meet."" He added that ""the war in Iraq and emerging threats from other nations present new challenges to our national security.""
""Our top priority is to ensure that we continue to keep Americans safe while spreading freedom and democracy abroad,"" Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told
""Republicans will also work to keep taxes and healthcare prices low so that families have more money to spend on things that are important to them.""
Which party will come out on top in this election? Its up to the voters to decide.
Here are some key issues on voters minds this election season.
Recent polls show that Americans support for the war in Iraq has dropped. President George W. Bush and many Republicans say the war is an important part of making the United States safer. Many Democrats say its time to rethink U.S. strategy in Iraq.
Gas prices have been high for the last year. Only recently have they begun to dip. Many voters are worried about the high cost of gas. They want to hear plans for making gas more affordable.
About 45 million Americans dont have health insurance. If they get sick, it will be difficult for them to pay for medical care and drugs on their own. Voters are looking for ways in which the government can make health care more affordable.
Which election issues are most important to you and your family? Why?

The 22-year-old man from Alaska lost the use of his legs seven years ago in a car accident. He is believed to be the first paraplegic to climb Mount Fuji.
""I want to show people what I am able to do,"" Reilly said from the top of Mount Fuji. ""Maybe it will inspire them.""
How exactly did he make his climb? Reilly used a special bike that he powered with his arms. Reilly traveled with a support team of eight people and reached the
, or peak, of the mountain within four days. The climb normally takes about six hours.
Reilly's journey, however, was not without obstacles. His team was stopped by a park ranger who said mountain bikes weren't allowed on the trail. They managed to persuade the park ranger to allow them to continue their journey. Although Reilly's bike was built to climb rocks, the trail was covered with volcanic ash and gravel, making for a difficult ride.
What does Reilly teach people about overcoming challenges to reach their goals?
Mount Fuji is one of the most-climbed peaks in the world. Reilly chose the mountain because he wanted to pick one outside the United States. Since losing the use of his legs, Reilly has also climbed peaks in Colorado and California.
Now that he has accomplished his goal, he has already set his sights even higher. He hopes to climb Mount Rainier in Alaska and the tallest peak in South America. ""I hope to climb one mountain every year,"" he said.

What exactly makes a story a fantasy? Traditionally, a fantasy tells the story of a single character, the hero, such as Harry Potter. Like Harry, the hero is often unaware of his or her power. After crossing into a different world, the hero is faced with a series of tests.
In a fantasy story, a teacher often shows the hero the tricks of the trade. In
, wise Gandalf protects the hobbit Frodo. Harry, too, is taught by Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts.
Fantasy books typically end with a battle between the hero and the villainand the hero ultimately wins. If Rowling sticks to the fantasy formula, will Harry defeat Lord Voldemort in Book 7 of the series?
The fantasy craze has also hit the big screen, with many books being made into films. Fans of
movies turned out in record numbers. This December, a film version of the classic C. S. Lewis book

Scientists were conducting a study of fish at Meadow Lake in New York City. To their horror, they found a fish with a long body, a snakelike head, and razor-sharp teeth. They counted another and another, until there were five in all. At that point, they knew they had a problem.

An invasive species is a plant or an animal that does not belong in the area in which it is living. Many invasive species lack
in their new environments. Predators are animals that hunt other animals. Although invasive species don't damage their own environments, they can cause massive destruction when they invade another area.
Snakehead fish arrived in the United States from China and Korea, most likely as pets. When their owners no longer wanted them, they threw the fish into nearby lakes and streams. Snakehead fish now live in several states, from Maryland to California.
Snakehead fish aren't the only accidental arrivals. In the Great Lakes region, fingernail-sized zebra mussels hitchhiked from Russia in the water tanks of ships. Now the mussels clog pipes that provide drinking water to homes and schools.
In Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, young emerald ash borers have killed more than 6 million trees. These beetles likely arrived from China in wood packing material carried in ships or airplanes.
And in Hawaii, tiny coqui (koh-KEE) frogs are now a huge problem. The frogs hitched a ride to the ""Aloha State"" in a plant shipment from Puerto Rico. The noisy frogs produce a piercing sound that keeps people awake at night.
Scientists in New York are trying to control the snakehead fish population by increasing the salt levels in the lake. Snakeheads can't survive in salty water.

For the past 81 years, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has used Fire Prevention Week to teach people how to prevent fires and how to protect themselves all year long. The NFPA has the following safety tips for you and your family:
. Every family should have a home escape route planned. As part of the plan, identify two ways out of every room, such as a door or window exit. Be sure your plan includes a meeting place outside that is a safe distance from your home. Practice the plan at least twice a year.
. Smoke alarms are often the first signal of a fire. Your home should have a smoke alarm on every level and in or close to each bedroom. Be sure an adult tests alarms monthly and replaces batteries once a year.
. Whenever the stove is on, make sure there is an adult in the room. Keep a ""kid-free zone"" about 3 feet around the stove.

80,"Scientists discovered 106 new species of fish in 2004!
A new study shows that the number of ocean creatures is on the rise.
A gold-speckled and red-striped goby fish stands guard while a snapping shrimp digs a burrow. Both use the burrow for protection. The fish and the shrimp live off Guam, an island in the Pacific Ocean.
The goby fish is among 106 new
, or types, of fish that scientists counted in the world's oceans in 2004 as part of a 10-year study. That means more than two new species of fish were discovered each week last year!
About 1,000 scientists from 70 countries are participating in the ocean count. They will finish their study in 2010.
Water covers about two-thirds of Earth's surface. The five main oceans are the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian, the Arctic, and the Southern.
This map shows the five main oceans.
So far, scientists have discovered nearly 15,500 species of fish in the world's oceans. They are among 230,000 known plants and animals living beneath the ocean's surface.
Scientists believe that they may find up to 2 million life-forms by the time they complete their count. ""We have barely skimmed the surface,"" said one scientist.
Why are scientists conducting the study? They want to learn more about the oceans, which are among the least-known parts of Earth's surface. Scientists say species found below 1,200 feet are 50 times more likely to be new. One scientist involved in the study said that less is known about the ocean than is known about ""the far side of the moon.""
Scientists plan to use the results of the study to prevent people from overfishing. They also want to use the information to protect ocean life.
Scientists have added some new ocean creatures to their growing list.
A previously unknown creature was found that lives near Antarctica. It has eight arms and is related to the octopus.
Coral-like algae were found in the waters off Alaska. The hard red plants look like toy jacks.
An ocean creature related to the jellyfish could be new. It was found in Arctic waters.

Researchers from England say that people may actually be able to scale walls and climb ceilings with gloves made of a special material. However, the researchers who came up with the material didn't get the idea from wall-crawling spiders.
Scientists are developing a sticky tape based on the hairs on a gecko's foot.
. Geckos are little lizards that use their sticky feet to cling to walls and ceilings. They can climb the most slippery glass surfaces and dangle from the ceiling with a single toe.
What's the secret behind their amazing grip? Geckos have millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of their feet. When a gecko comes in contact with a surface, the hairs create an electrical force that lets it cling to a wall or a ceiling.
""If human palms were covered by this [sticky] material, it would support the weight of an average human,"" said one scientist.
Scientists hope the material can be used with robots or in medicine. But they have a way to go before turning their idea into reality. The material is expensive, and it quickly loses its stickiness. Spider-Man would not be pleased to hear that!

185,"As the clock ticks down toward Thanksgiving, the Macy's Parade Studio buzzes with activity. The sounds of saws, drills, and hammers echo through the former Tootsie Roll factory in New Jersey.
The workers have no time to spare. I'm getting a sneak preview as they prepare for the 77th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.
More than 2 million people will line the parade route. Another 60 million people will watch on TV. I meet with John Piper and his talented team, who produce every detail of the huge parade.
Piper is in charge of the studio. His crew designs and builds the floats and giant balloons that appear in the parade.
The 2003 Macy's parade lineup features 15 giant helium balloons and 27 smaller balloons. Also included will be 29 floats, some of which contain cold-air balloons called ""falloons."" Ten marching bands and 30 groups of clowns will spice up the festivities.
""We don't do anything small,"" Piper tells me.
The first giant balloon to fly in the Macy's parade was Felix the Cat, in 1927.
The parade has featured 170 giant balloons in its history. No more than 15 balloons are used each year.
Kermit the Frog stretches 78 feet, making it the longest balloon in this year's parade.
A record six different Snoopy character balloons have appeared in the parade over the years.
In 1957, a massive downpour caused the Popeye balloon to dump gallons of water on spectators below.
To prove his point, Piper leads me up two flights of stairs. Here, Macy's balloon experts-called ""balloonatics""-work their magic. In one area hang models of the parade's newest giant balloons. The balloons include ""Strike
Up the Band"" Barney, Sesame Street's Super Grover, and an all-new Garfield.
Garfield has flown in 15 Macy's parades, but this year he will have a friend-his teddy bear, Pooky.
In a large room next door, I watch as Piper checks the 49-foot-long Garfield balloon for leaks. On Thanksgiving morning, more than 50 Macy's ""handlers"" will steer the balloon 2.5 miles along the skyscraper-lined streets of New York City.
Downstairs, head painter Beth Lucas puts the final touches on an 8-foot-tall eagle. The giant bronze bird will be at the center of the ""Spirit of America"" float.
Nearby, other workers hammer away from atop a wooden frame that will become the ""Bridge to the Future"" float. The float will feature the newest Hess toy truck and race cars.
All the Macy's floats are weatherproof. When folded, they must be no more than 12.5 feet tall and 8 feet wide. That size allows them to fit through the Lincoln Tunnel on their way from the New Jersey studio to New York City.
Piper tells me that working on the parade is a dream come true. ""When I was a kid, my two favorite things in the world were cartoons and things that fly,"" he adds. ""The Macy's parade puts both of them together.""

""I started thinking of them as a family almost immediately,"" filmmaker Martyn Colbeck told
He was talking about wild elephants, not his next-door neighbors. For more than 15 years, Colbeck has filmed a family of African elephants in Amboseli National Reserve in eastern Africa.
airs April 1 on the PBS television show
The new film comes after recent studies found that elephants can recognize their reflection in a mirror. That is something only humans, chimpanzees, and dolphins were thought to be able to do. ""These animals are smart,"" Colbeck says. His documentary shows just how intelligent African elephantsthe world's largest land animalsare.
Colbeck's film follows an elephant family led by a 62-year-old female elephant named Echo. In the wild, African elephants live in herds. They roam long distances to find food. The oldest female elephant, called the
leads the herd. Adult male elephants live separately from the females and the young calves.
Echo guides her family to fresh water and food while staying alert for danger. The young elephants are the most
or at risk of being harmed. Colbeck witnessed that danger when he saw another elephant family attempt to kidnap Echo's calf Ebony. Echo gathered the other adult female elephants in her family to come to the rescue. ""Together they plowed into the kidnappers to recover Ebony,"" Colbeck explained. ""It showed forethought and teamwork.""
During his years of filmmaking, Colbeck observed other signs of elephant intelligence. Elephants communicate with each other through low rumbling sounds that people often cannot hear. Family members also make distinct sounds that other members can recognize.
or customs. After an elephant dies, the other family members cover the body with sticks and leaves and linger near the site for days. The animals often return to the site years later.
Amboseli National Reserve covers about 150 square miles in southern Kenya, near the Tanzania border. The Kenyan government protects the nature reserve's elephants from
or illegal hunting. Elephants have been hunted throughout history for the ivory in their tusks. Humans have used ivory to make jewelry and other objects. Today, elephants are an endangered species.
Since strict anti-poaching laws were put into effect in 1968, the number of elephants in Amboseli has risen from 500 to more than 1,200. When Colbeck began filming Echo's family in 1990, the family had only 14 members. Today it has 30 members.
Although the elephants still face some danger from the local Masai tribespeople, the creatures have become remarkably comfortable around human visitors. That makes Amboseli an ideal place for scientists to study elephant behavior.
""The elephants are totally relaxed about having vehicles in amongst the herd,"" says Colbeck. ""Nevertheless, it is still very important to respect the animals and not disturb them.  That respect develops into a trust, and in that way we have been able to document some extraordinary moments in their lives."" That trust has not only allowed Colbeck to film Echo's family, but it has also made him feel like one of the family.
The elephant families in Amboseli National Reserve are organized alphabetically. Echo's family is the ""E"" family, so every member of the family is given a name starting with
Here's how Echo fits in with some of her relatives.
(age 62): Echo is one of the oldest elephants in Amboseli. She is the leader of her family. You can tell that she is old by the length of her tusks. They are almost touching! Wild African elephants live an average of 60 years.
(died at age 34): She was Echo's eldest daughter. Erin died from a spear injury after she wandered too close to a watering hole protected by the local Masai people.
(age 22): As a young calf, Eliot would to run up and rest her head on researchers' vehicles. Now that she has grown up, Eliot keeps her distance from people.
(age 17): When he was born, Ely couldn't walk. The family waited to move until he stood on his own. Now he lives alone. He left the herd at age 12.
(age 25): Edwina is Echo's first known grandchild.
(age 22): Eleanor helped care for Email after Erin died.
(age 6): Email's mother, Erin, died when he was 2. Now the rest of the family takes care of him.
(age 12): Europa is Echo's first known great-grandchild.
(age 8): Elaine is Echo's second great-granddaughter.
(age 8): Elmo is Echo's only surviving great-grandson.

At the time he read the story, Brandon didn't think he would ever need to use the Heimlich maneuver. But what he learned from the article later helped him save a life.
During lunch on October 3, Brandon looked up and saw a classmate, Joseph Dettwiler, choking and frantically pointing to his throat.

Many animals use camouflage to blend into their surroundings. Some butterflies, for example, have patterns that let them hide among leaves and twigs. Most animals, however, can remain unseen only while they stay very still. Thats why this new dragonfly finding has many scientists puzzled.
The dragonfly uses motion camouflage to fool its prey into thinking that its not moving and not a threat. The dragonflys prey include other insects it feeds on, such as mosquitoes and moths.
Researchers say that the dragonfly carefully changes position again and again as it closes in on its target. The dragonfly appears, to the eye of its prey, to remain in the same place--but in fact its moving. What a clever eye trick!

676,"Hours before giant waves pounded coastlines in South Asia, many animals started behaving strangely. In Sri Lanka, elephants trumpeted frantically and fled to higher ground. Bats and flamingos deserted low-lying areas. Many other animals escaped unharmed.
Wildlife experts are amazed that many animals survived the tsunami. The series of huge waves killed thousands of people in South Asia and East Africa about two months ago. Experts say animals might have sensed the approaching waves and moved to higher ground.
""I think animals can sense disaster. They know when things are happening in nature,"" said an official at the national wildlife department in Sri Lanka.
Elephants' sharp senses may have warned them about the tsunami.
Other stories of odd animal behavior before the tsunami have also surfaced. Giant waves flooded low-lying parts of Yala National Park in Sri Lanka, uprooting trees and killing hundreds of people. Wildlife officials reported, however, that few animals died. The park is home to hundreds of animals, including elephants, monkeys, leopards, tigers, deer, and water buffalo.
In Thailand, elephants carrying tourists from Japan bolted for the hills, and other elephants broke free of their chains. In one fishing village, nearly 1,000 locals escaped safely after birds squawked madly.
Although some animals in South Asia successfully fled to higher ground before the tsunami, other animals were not as lucky. Many dogs and other pets lost their owners in the tsunami and are homeless, sick, and without food or water. Cows, goats, and other farm animals are also roaming aimlessly. Many of those animals are drinking polluted water. Rescue groups have been sending animal food and
to the area. Veterinarians are doctors who care for animals.
Why might animals have known trouble was on the way? Forget special powers. Instead, experts say that animals have better senses of hearing, smell, and sight than humans do. Those sharp senses help warn animals when natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes, are about to happen.
""It doesn't surprise me that animals had an early warning of the tsunami,"" animal expert Michael Dee of the Los Angeles Zoo told
. ""The senses of certain species are far stronger than what any human has."" Dee points out that dogs, for example, have a stronger sense of smell than humans and that cats can see better in the dark than people.
Scientists say that animals might have felt the vibrations from the earthquake that set off the tsunami. In addition, many animals, including elephants, pigeons, and dogs, can also pick up
. That is a sound that is too low in pitch for humans to hear.
""Elephants can hear or feel other elephants grumble up to 2 miles away, so they probably felt the earthquake,"" said Dee. ""Their first
would be to move away from the direction of the sound."" An instinct is a natural, untaught behavior or reaction.
Before the tsunami struck, animals may have started to flee because they saw other creatures running. ""Animals take their cues from other animals,"" said Dee.
How animals sense danger has fascinated people for centuries. Most scientists are quick to point out, however, that nothing has ever been proven.
Will animal instincts be used to create a warning system about natural disasters anytime soon? ""I wouldn't count on [it],"" said Dee.
In the meantime, animals are helping out in other ways. For example, elephants are assisting in the cleanup of areas hit by the tsunami.
Scientists say that elephants can pick up vibrations from earthquakes through their broad feet.
Elephants' toenails are in the skin and not attached to the toes.
Elephants' soles have sensitive foot pads that detect vibrations, such as those from an earthquake. That signals elephants to move to more stable ground.
In what other ways might animals' sharp senses be helpful?

""We thought we might find a handful of new species,"" says Joel Despain, a cave expert for the parks. ""It was amazing to find 27.""
Why had the cave creatures gone undetected? Though it is rare to find unknown animal species on Earths surface, the same is not true for caves. Like the deep sea, caves are difficult to reach and havent been explored as thoroughly as the surface.
Discovering so many unknown species was thrilling for Jean Krejca. She is a scientist with Zara Environmental, the Texas-based group that led the project. ""You get the feeling that youre Lewis and Clark, charting undiscovered territory,"" says Krejca. ""Caves are one of the last frontiers.""
This millipede is one of the less strange creatures scientists find in caves. Creatures are often blind and have no pigment.
The creatures are unique not only because they are found just in caves but also because some are found in only a single cave or a specific part of a cave. ""There are usually more creatures at the caves entrance because there is more food there,"" scientist Rob Myers of Zara Environmental told
""The farther back in a cave, the more you find creatures have adapted to cave life. What you find is more and more strange. The creatures are often blind and have no pigment.""
A creature such as the pill bug, for example, doesnt need pigment in its skin because it doesnt have to protect itself from the sun. And the daddy longlegs probably developed such big jaws to quickly grab prey, which is scarce inside caves.
The next task is to name the new species. Specialists called

Scientists will also study the new species to determine whether their populations are healthy. Cave animals can teach scientists a lot about the environment because the creatures are sensitive to changes in the
An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that interacts with the environment. If cave creatures decline, it could signal problems or changes in the environment.
The recent discoveries have led park officials to plan to protect the caves and the newfound species. ""Now that we know the species are there, we can use them to learn more about cave ecosystems and life on this planet,"" says Myers.
Think Critically Why, do you think, is more food found at the entrance to a cave?

""They are darker than your bedroom gets at night. There is zero light in a cave, so you cant see a hand in front of your face.""
When a spelunker heads into a cave, he or she wears a helmet with a headlamp and carries an extra flashlight. The cave explorer also wears elbow pads and kneepads to crawl along the rocky floor. Many caves are underground, so the explorer slides down on ropes connected to special harnesses.
While there, a spelunker might see the magnificent cone-shaped formations of

179,"""May I stay up just a little longer?"" That's the cry heard from kids every night in many U.S. households. That's because most kids don't want to go to bed.
Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks.
The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8? hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said.
Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said.
In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should.
Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school.
Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep.
Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' ""
If a kid loses one hour of sleep a night, how many hours of sleep does he or she lose in a week? A month? A year?

. Land mines are explosive devices left in the ground from wars.A land mine can explode if someone touches it, killing or injuring the person. Children often mistake the land mines for toys.
Now Rosa's job is to teach U.S. children about the dangers of land mines so they can help fight the problem. I recently caught up with the clever canine at Paradise Valley Elementary School, located in Casper, Wyoming.I watched as Rosa did her job sniffing out some fake land mines. ""She's cool,"" gushed fifth grader Josh Yelton.
Rosa's visit kicked off the Children Against Land Mines Program, also known as CHAMPS. The goal of the program is to raise money to buy, train, and transport mine-sniffing dogs.Wyoming students raised $5,000 in quarters in just a few short weeks, and adults chipped in an additional $8,000. The money will help sponsor a new dog.
A dog's sense of smell and smarts make it the best land-mine locator. In fact, a team of six humans can search about 120 square feet of land in a day. A team of six dogs can search up to 3,000 square feet in a day's time.
The pooch paid for by the Wyoming students will be named Wyoming. That dog will help find buried land mines in Sri Lanka, a country off the southern coast of India.
Land mines not only injure and kill many people, but they also
, or stop, people from moving around freely. For example, the lush fields of Sri Lanka should be filled with crops. Instead, many fields lie unplanted. Farmers are afraid that mines litter their fields. Wyoming's job will be to help get rid of those land mines.
A Sri Lanka government official told me what a huge effect Wyoming and other mine-sniffing dogs will make in his country.
He said, ""The best part of the CHAMPS program will be when all the land mines have been removed.""
In what other ways do dogs help humans?

Al Gore was born in Washington, D.C. on March 31, 1948. As a child, he spent part of his time in Washington, where his father was a U.S. senator.
During summer vacations, Al often had to live with family friends in Tennessee while his parents were in Washington. At those times, the house he stayed in didn't have indoor plumbing, he said.
When Al was in Tennessee, he worked hard on his family's farm. He baled hay, worked with farm animals, and cleared farmland of trees and rocks.
Gore said that he liked to work hard and help out even when he was supposed to be having fun. When he was 9 years old, Al went to a 4-H camp. At camp, he volunteered to work in the kitchen and do the work that was usually given to older boys. ""He was the only camper I ever had volunteer for K-P, or kitchen duty,"" said Jerry Cole, a local 4-H representative.
Although he worked hard, Al also knew how to have a good time. When his parents weren't looking, he recalled, he would sometimes move all the furniture in the living room to make a fort.
Because Al's father was a senator, he got to meet some important people. When Al was 5 years old, he met then Vice President Richard Nixon. ""He put me on his knee and was very nice to me,"" Gore remembered.
Today, as vice president, Gore is still working hard. And now his goal is to become president of the United States.

The teacher didn't find George's prank funny. She marched him to the principal's office. The principal, Mr. Bizilo, punished George by spanking him with a paddle.
Born on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut, George moved to Texas with his family about two years later. As a child, George dreamed of becoming a baseball player.
""All George ever wanted to be was a major-league baseball player,"" said classmate Terry Throckmorton. ""That's all he ever talked about.""
He also collected baseball cards. When George was 10 years old, he began mailing baseball cards to the players pictured on them. He asked the players to sign the cards and return them to him. Many of the best players of the time autographed his cards.
George's teachers remember that he was a good student. ""He was a good, well-rounded young man, and he did his work,"" said George's third-grade teacher, Austine Crosby.
In addition to learning the usual subjects in school, Bush told
that he learned a very important lesson: ""I learned never to pretend that I know more than I know.""
When George was in seventh grade, his classmates remember that he ran against Jack Hanks for class president. Today, his classmates claim that George won the election. ""I voted for George because he was cuter,"" remembered classmate Peggy Porter Weiss.
Bush went on to run in other elections. The people of Texas twice elected him their governor. He is now running for president of the United States.

Here is a slogan that is easy to remember: ""Use Candles with Care: When You Go Out, Blow Out!"" That's the theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week, which begins October 9.
Candles may look beautiful, but they can be a fire hazard. Candle use has increased in popularity. As a result, the number of candle fires in the United States has tripled over the past 10 years.
The National Fire Protection Association, the organization behind Fire Prevention Week, has some tips that will help you use candles safely in your home:
Make sure an adult is always in the room when a candle is burning.
Have an adult put out a burning candle before leaving the room.

The mantle is divided into two parts: the upper mantle and the lower mantle. Most of the mantle is solid rock, but the lower mantle rock is softer.

Griswold, who is a radio traffic reporter by day, runs a ""bat hospital"" in her Connecticut home. While you wont find these little creatures stretched out on hospital beds, you might find one or two of them snuggling up to Griswold.
At her home, Griswold cares for bats that are sick, injured, or orphaned. She has taken care of bats with injuries, such as a broken wing, as well as babies that have lost their mothers.
She has also cared for bats that were stranded in the winter because they had forgotten to travel south during the colder months. With the help of a

But Griswold is no stranger to bats. She grew up on a farm where they were a common sight. So it was no surprise how quickly she took to an orphaned baby bat she found squeaking on the ground outside her house ten years ago. She took the bat in and fed it milk from a goat on her farm.
To her delight, the little creature survived the night. Today, the bat--which she named Poppy--still lives with her. She did not release Poppy back into the wild because it identifies more with humans than with bats.
This bat lady, however, doesnt keep Poppy all to herself. Poppy is one of the winged creatures that Griswold brings with her on school visits. In fact, this Halloween she is speaking at a Connecticut school. Griswold, who teaches kids about bats, is on a mission to change their reputation.
. Many people, she says, are afraid of bats, but theyre actually gentle, shy creatures that are important to the environment.
Bats pollinate plants, spread seeds, and, most important, eat insects. ""There is no animal worldwide that eats more bugs at night than bats do,"" said Griswold, who is full of bat trivia.
However, the number of bats worldwide is in serious decline. They often lose their homes when people cut down trees.
But Griswolds message seems to be spreading. After she spoke to a Brownie troop, the members built bat houses in their town. The project turned into a community effort. ""The kids are making such a huge difference,"" she said.
There are almost a thousand species of bats worldwide. Bats come in different colors, shapes, and sizes. Some have huge ears and unusual faces. In fact, a bats face can teach you about its habits. Read on about some of these creatures.

If you're like most schoolkids, you've recited the Pledge of Allegiance more times than you can remember. But now students in three public school districts in California are no longer allowed to say those historic words.
A federal judge in California ruled that the Pledge of Allegiance is
because it contains the phrase ""under God."" If something does not uphold the rules of the U.S. Constitution, it is considered unconstitutional.
For years, Michael Newdow of California has fought to have the phrase removed from the pledge. He continually argues that because of the pledge's reference to God, his elementary school daughter should not have to listen to it recited daily.
Last year, the case did not make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Given the recent lower court's ruling, it is unclear whether the Supreme Court will now hear the controversial case.

According to the federal court, the phrase ""under God"" suggests that the government supports religion. That violates the First Amendment to the Constitution. That amendment guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and press. People often refer to part of this amendment as the separation of church and state.
Newdow provides the reverse argument for removing the reference to God from the pledge. He says, ""Imagine you send your kids to school every day, and the teachers [make] them stand up and say, ""We are one nation that denies God exists.""
The pledge represents a way for many Americans to express their

or chose, Roberts to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. O'Connor, the first woman justice, had announced in July that she would retire. But on September 3, Chief Justice William Rehnquist died.
Bush then asked the Senate to consider Roberts for the chief justice position. The chief justice is considered the justice with the most influence on the Court.
""One of the most [important] decisions a president makes is his appointment of a justice to the Supreme Court,"" said Bush in his announcement of Roberts's nomination. ""The decisions of the Supreme Court affect the life of every American.""
At press time, the president had nominated Harriet Miers to take over O'Connor's position. If Miers is confirmed, she will be the third woman to serve on the Supreme Court, after O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
John Roberts was born in Buffalo, New York, on January 27, 1955. In high school, he was captain of his football team. He also wrestled, sang in the choir, and edited the school newspaper. After graduating from law school, he assisted then Associate Justice Rehnquist. He is married to a lawyer and has two childrenJosie, 5, and Jack, 4.
The Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., heads the judicial branch, one of three branches of the U.S. government. The other two branches are the legislative branch and the executive branch. Each branch has a different job.
The authors of the Constitution created the three branches to ensure that no branch had too much power. That system is called
The legislative branch makes laws. That branch is also called Congress and is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The executive branch carries out laws made by Congress. That branch is headed by the president. The judicial branch

A case makes its way to the Supreme Court through lower courts. The Supreme Court has the power to overturn rulings made in lower courts. Once the Supreme Court rules on a case, the decision is final. All lower courts must follow its decision in similar cases.
How does a person become a Supreme Court justice?
1. The president nominates a person to serve as a justice.
2. A group of senators, called the Senate Judiciary Committee, asks the nominee his or her opinions about various laws and cases.
3. The Judiciary Committee votes on the nominee.
4. If the nominee is approved by the Judiciary Committee, all 100 U.S. senators vote. (There are two senators for each state.)
5. A nominee is confirmed if he or she receives 51 votes. Roberts was confirmed by a Senate vote of 78 to 22.
Roberts is the youngest chief justice since John Marshall led the Supreme Court more than 200 years ago. At age 50, Roberts is likely to be chief justice for a very long time. The chief justice decides which cases the Court will hear. In many cases, the chief justice speaks first and leads the debate.
During his swearing-in ceremony, Roberts said to President Bush, ""There is no way to repay the confidence you have shown in me other than to do the best job I possibly can do, and I'll try to do that every day.""

is a made-up tale that is often accepted as truth. Now an American scientist claims he has discovered the remains of Atlantis on the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.
According to the age-old myth, Atlantis was a place of great wealth. The ancient kingdom gleamed with gold and silver and was a center for art and learning.
Over time, the people there became corrupt and greedy. As punishment, the gods unleashed powerful earthquakes and floods that swallowed up Atlantis and sank it to the ocean floor.
The only account of this legendary lost land comes from the long-ago writings of Plato. He was an ancient Greek writer who lived about 2,500 years ago. People don't know how much of Plato's text is factual, because he wrote about an event that had happened 9,000 years before his time.
Robert Sarmast, the American scientist behind the recent claim, performed sonar tests of the Mediterranean seafloor. Sonar tests use sound waves to find underwater objects.
Sarmast believes that he has found Atlantis in the Mediterranean Sea, between Syria and Cyprus.
Sarmast says his tests revealed human-made walls and structures that matched Plato's description. ""If you compare [my findings to Plato's description], you will be astonished,"" Sarmast told reporters. ""We hope that future expeditions will bring back physical proof.""

What do those dreams mean? No one quite knows for sure, but scientists are getting closer to solving the puzzle. They are using new technology to study how the sleeping brain works.
Although there are still many mysteries about sleep, scientists know that everyone needs sleep to boost brain power and keep the body healthy. School-age kids need at least nine hours of sleep each night to perform their best in school.
So can a good night's sleep help Christina do her best playing ice hockey and the flute? Can sleep help
""Getting a good night's sleep is good for your brain and body and helps you grow,"" sleep expert David Dinges told
. ""You're less likely to be tired the next day, you're less grouchy, more alert, and perform better in school and in sports.""
While you're snoozing, your brain doesn't shut down. Your brain stays busy and goes through five stages of sleep each night.
, sleep. It gets that name because your eyes move around quickly under closed eyelids. Your brain becomes very active during REM sleep. Most dreaming takes place during that sleep stage. Your body cycles through REM and non-REM stages several times a night. Each cycle lasts about 90 minutes.
Everybody dreamsalthough scientists don't know exactly why. Scientists have different
, or ideas, about why dreams are useful. One theory is that dreams help make sense of the day's events. Some scientists think that dreams help the brain sort and store information.
The latest evidence shows that dreams may help people master new physical skills, such as playing an instrument or riding a bike. Both dreaming and getting a good night's sleep may also help people improve their problem-solving skills. In one study, scientists divided volunteers into groups to solve a math problem. The group that received more sleep solved the problem more often than the group that didn't receive as much sleep.
Why do we remember some dreams but not others? When you wake up affects how vividly you recall your dreams. If you awaken during REM sleep, you're more likely to remember the details of a dream. If you wake up during another stage, you might not remember your dreams as wellor at all.
Whether or not you remember your dreams, it's important to get into a healthful sleep routine. ""The enemies of sleep are staying up late to play video games or watch TV,"" said Dinges.
Like people, all warm-blooded animals dream. Some animals sleep a little, and others sleep a lot. The amount of sleep an animal requires depends on its needs. Take a look at the sleep patterns of some creatures.

""I think [the law] could work to reduce waste,"" said Maine lawmaker Scott Cowger, who cosponsored the bill in Maine's House of Representatives.
Second, a cigarette deposit law would raise money for antismoking education programs in Maine schools. The bill's sponsors admit they expect only a small percentage of people will redeem cigarette butts. But those nickel deposits that aren't redeemed could add up to as much as $50 million for school antismoking programs.
Some people in Maine have problems with the cigarette deposit bill. Annie Loadwick, of Mercer, Maine, runs a bottle and can redemption center. She said she doesn't want to have to handle and count customer's used cigarette butts.
Maine's governor, Angus King, also does not support the bill. He wants instead to place a tax on cigarettes of 26 cents per pack. The tax, King said, would produce up to $36 million for school antismoking programs.

The robot, called Maron-1, is made by a company in Japan. Maron-1 looks like a cartoon copy of R2-D2. It weighs about 11 pounds and stands about 2 feet high. When it goes on sale in Japan next year, the robot will cost about $1,600.
The makers of Maron-1 say their robot is better than the other kinds of robots that you can buy at toy stores. ""Our robot is different from pet robots. It's useful,"" said a representative from the company that makes Maron-1.
Maron-1 can detect whether someone or something is moving in front of it. If it sees"" something moving, it says, ""An intruder found."" It can also call you on a cell phone to tell you about the intruder.
The amazing robot can do many other things as well. It can turn on electronic equipment, such as a TV and a VCR. Maron-1 can move around, but it cannot go up or down stairs.

Kids really can make a difference. Just ask 15-year-old Ryan Hreljac (HURL-jak) of Kemptville, Canada. When he was 6, he learned about the shortage of safe drinking water in some parts of the world. Today, Ryans Well Foundation has raised more than $1.5 million to build more than 200 wells in 11 countries, most in Africa.
During his mission to raise money, Ryan became pen pals with Akana Jimmy, an orphan who lived in Africa. In Jimmys tiny village of Agweo, Uganda, there was no clean water until Ryan raised enough money to buy the village its first well. A new book tells the story of their life-changing friendship
Ryan and Jimmy and the Well in Africa That Brought Them Together.
Jimmy used to wake up before midnight and walk 3 miles to the nearest pond. There, he would fill a large plastic container with
or polluted, water. Jimmy made that trip three times every day before heading to school. ""Because you dont have any choice, you drink it,"" he told
In 1998, Ryans first-grade teacher told the class that polluted water was causing thousands of children to become sick and even die. For Ryan, a lack of clean water was unimaginable. His teacher said the cost of building a well in Africa was just $70. Determined to help, Ryan spent months doing household chores to earn enough money to pay for a well.
Later that year, Ryan proudly took his savings to WaterCan, a Canadian organization that helps provide safe drinking water to impoverished countries. To his disappointment, Ryan was told that the cost of building a well was much higher: $2,000.
or promised, to continue raising money. Word of his mission spread, and soon the media picked up his story. To Ryans astonishment, people started sending him donations. By 2000, Ryan, then 9, had raised enough money to build his first well. With help from Canadian Physicians for Aid and Relief, Ryan chose Jimmys village as the site for the well.
Ryans well changed the lives of the people in Agweo and especially affected Jimmys life. Thats when the two boys became pen pals. They became friends when Ryan traveled to Uganda in 2000 to help complete the well.
In 2003, Ryans family arranged to bring Jimmy to their home in Canada. ""We used to live as friends,"" Jimmy, now 17, says, ""but now we live as brothers.""
The two teenagers hope their book will raise awareness about unsafe drinking water and prompt people to take action to help. ""The situation is difficult, but you have to start somewhere,"" Ryan says. ""We need to work harder to make the world a better place.""
To find out how you can help Ryan and Jimmy bring safe drinking water to countries in need, go to
More than two-thirds of Earths surface is covered in water, so you might think there is enough to go around. You may be surprised to learn that only a scarce, or limited, amount of the water is drinkable. Salty seawater makes up about 97 percent of the worlds water. Another 2 percent is frozen at the North and South poles.
More than 1 billion people around the world dont have access to safe drinking water, according to the United Nations. Why isnt all the freshwater available to people safe for drinking? Chemicals from factories, fertilizers from farms, and untreated sewage pollute the water supply. ""One of our goals is to educate people about the importance of clean water,"" says Ryan.
What are some ways you can help conserve water?

To the spectators below, Bello's stunt looked dangerous-and it was. But Bello knew a secret. He was using science to help keep himself safe.
Bello began performing circus stunts when he was 9 years old. He walked on a thin wire that was stretched 9 feet off the ground.
To stay on a wire without falling, Bello needs to keep his center of gravity low. An object's center of gravity is usually located in the middle of the object. That is where the object's weight is centered.
By crouching and keeping low, Bello keeps his center of gravity low. The lower his center of gravity, the harder it is for Bello to fall.
Bello often carries a heavy metal stick when he performs. The stick bends downward, lowering his center of gravity.
Bello also uses Newton's first law of motion when he performs. That law is named for Isaac Newton. He was a scientist who lived about 275 years ago.
Newton's first law of motion says that a moving object will keep moving unless an outside force acts on it. (The law also says that an object at rest will stay that way unless an outside force acts on it.) Bello uses that law when he rides his
As Bello speeds along on his tiny bike, he sometimes has to stop before slamming into a wall. To stop, Bello uses the bike's brakes. The brakes create

Despite the shortage of flu vaccine, doctors say that there are ways to stay healthy. The flu spreads through the air when infected people sneeze or cough. The virus also can spread on the hands of an infected person. Here's how to stop germs from spreading:
Wash hands regularly with soap and warm water.
Use a tissue to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze. If there isn't a tissue handy, cough or sneeze into your sleeve. Using your hand may spread the germs.
Practice healthful habits, such as eating right, getting plenty of rest, and exercising.

493,"On September 11, terror gripped the people of the United States. Millions of citizens across the country watched in horror as terrorists used hijacked airplanes to attack two of America's most famous landmarks--the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Another stolen plane crashed in Pennsylvania.
The destruction caused by the hijacked jetliners stunned eyewitnesses. ""It was like the building had been hit by an asteroid,"" Marty Singer said of the World Trade Center in New York City.
Another eyewitness compared the attack on the twin towers of the World Trade Center to a terrible storm. ""Giant balls of flame burst out of the walls,"" Hugh Smyser said. ""Glass and aluminum sheathing [outer material from the buildings] came down like a huge snowstorm.""
Although the attacks took place in New York and our nation's capital, every U.S. citizen felt the impact of the attacks. Many states and communities closed public buildings, parks, and monuments. Events, such as baseball games, were canceled. Many businesses and schools were closed, as everyone mourned the victims of the savage attacks.
The flames from the burning landmarks forged a new bond among Americans. Thousands lined up to donate blood for victims injured in the attacks. Firefighters, rescue workers, doctors, nurses, and volunteers worked tirelessly. Millions of Americans sent canned goods, snack foods, bottled water, and money to help the victims and rescue workers.
As Americans came together to help one another out during the crisis, people throughout the world knew that life would never again be the same. ""This is one of the few days in life that one can actually say will change everything,"" said one European leader.
U.S. authorities said soon after the attacks that the terrorists who hijacked the four planes from three airports must have planned their assaults carefully. Here's what happened, beginning at 8:48 a.m. on September 11.
A plane hijacked from an airport in Boston, Massachusetts, crashes into one of the 110 story towers that made up the World Trade Center in New York City. As the building burns, a second plane hijacked from Boston slams into the other World Trade Center tower 18 minutes later.
A third hijacked jet, which took off from an airport near Washington, D.C., crashes into the side Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac River from the capital. The Pentagon houses the offices of most of the branches of the U.S. military.
One of the World Trade Center towers collapses. Fifteen minutes later, a fourth hijacked place crashes in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, about 80 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. The other tower collapses almost 25 minutes later.
Ash and debris from the collapsed towers cover victims and rescue workers.
Rescue workers comb through the rubble of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon looking for survivors. At the same time, law enforcement officials look for clues to find the terrorist who staged the brutal attacks.

232,"The Liberty Bell no longer rings today. During the move, wireless technology will be attached to the bell.
The Liberty Bell is about to get a new home. This fall, it will move from its current location at Liberty Bell Pavilion in Philadelphia to a new building down the street.
Why the change of address? It is part of improvements being made to the area where the bell now hangs.
Moving the bell, which weighs 2,080 pounds, could be tricky. Movers want to make sure that no additional harm is done to the bell's famous crack.
During the move, scientists will attach wireless technology to the bell. That technology will sound an alarm if strain from the move causes the crack to enlarge. Earlier this year, scientists conducted a test using wireless technology, and the crack did not appear to change.
""The bell is fragile because of the way it was [made],"" said one historian. The bell was built mostly of copper.
In 1752, the bell was brought to Philadelphia from England. The bell was rung to mark special events. It became a symbol of freedom in the United States. It was rung to call people to the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence on July 8, 1776. That document was signed on July 4, 1776.
This is not the first time the Liberty Bell has moved. From 1885 to 1915, the Liberty Bell traveled across the country, taking part in several World's Fair exhibits. During those years, it visited more than 400 cities and towns, including New Orleans, St. Louis, and San Francisco.
The last time the Liberty Bell changed location was in 1976.
At that time, it was taken from Independence Hall to its current nearby home. Many people consider Independence Hall the birthplace of the United States. Both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were signed there.
The Liberty Bell cracked the first time it was rung in 1752. However, the bell was rebuilt twice in its early years. The Liberty Bell cracked again sometime between 1817 and 1846. How it cracked remains a mystery. According to one report, its famous split occurred in February 1846 while it was ringing to celebrate George Washington's birthday.

During a recent sleep study, teachers noticed that kids had more difficulty learning when they stayed up an hour or two past their bedtime. ""Getting [to sleep] on time is as important as getting [to school] on time,"" says Gahan Fallone, who helped conduct the research.
Scientists followed 74 students ages 6 to 12 from Rhode Island and Massachusetts for the three-week study. During that time, the researchers tracked the sleeping habits of students. Teachers, who werent told how long the kids slept or which week they stayed up late, rated the students performance in school.
The teachers could tell when students didnt get enough sleep. Students who slept eight hours or less a night were more forgetful, had more trouble paying attention, and had difficulty learning new lessons.
How much sleep do kids need? Health experts from the National Sleep Foundation recommend that students ages 7 to 10 get at least 10 hours of sleep a night.
Teachers and principals have long been aware that students who get enough sleep generally perform better in school, which leads to better grades. At Potter- Burns Elementary in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, school officials send notes home to parents asking them to make sure kids get enough shut-eye before the yearlyachievement tests. ""Definitely there is impact on students performances if they come to school tired,"" says the schools principal, John Haidemenos.

According to the study, which was paid for by the U.S. government, more than 5 million kids, ages 6 to 19, have suffered some hearing loss. That's more than one out of every ten kids. Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss.
Amanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. ""It was assumed in the past that children wouldn't have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage,"" Niskar said.
Niskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a ""problem for children,"" she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems.
Hearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems.
For example, hearing loss ""can influence [a] child's ability to learn in the classroom,"" Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions.
Niskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead.

Fifty years ago, one brave woman's refusal to give up her bus seat changed history.
Honor the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest and the start of the Montgomery bus boycott with our classroom play.
During the 1950s, the law in the South prevented black
people from having the same rights as white people. At that time, the South was
by law. Black people were forced to sit in the back of public buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, drinking fountains, and other public facilities.
Those laws made Rosa Parks angry. She was a well-known leader in the African American community of Montgomery, Alabama. For years, Rosa Parks had stood up to unfair laws against African Americans. She worked courageously with other African American leaders to change them. She also was one of the first women in Montgomery to join the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to fight for
, or equal rights under the law.
Rosa Parks had refused to move from her seat on city buses in the past. Drivers simply forced her off the bus. But 50 years ago, on December 1, 1955, her action changed history. She refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person and was arrested. Her arrest led to the Montgomery
. During the yearlong boycott, African Americans refused to ride public buses. As a result of the boycott and Rosa Parks's courage, the law was changed to provide equal seating on buses. It marked the beginning of the struggle to end segregation.
SCENE 1: Downtown Montgomery, Alabama, December 1, 1955
Rosa Parks, 42, boards a city bus on her way home from work as a seamstress.
At the time, buses are divided into two sections. The section at the front of the bus is for whites only. The section for black people begins five to 10 rows back. Holding her head high, Rosa Parks sits down in the first row of the ""colored"" section.
After the bus grinds to a stop, a few white people get on. They quickly fill the empty seats in the ""whites-only"" section. One white man is left standing. According to a city law, black people are to give up their seats in the colored section if no seats remain in the white section.
There are white people who want to sit down.
You know white people and black people can't sit in the same row. Are you going to stand up?
Then I'm going to have you arrested.
A few minutes later, two police officers board the bus and walk toward Rosa Parks.
Did the driver tell you to stand?
Why do you all push us around?
I don't know, but the law is the law, and you're under arrest.
SCENE 2: Rosa Parks's house, that night
Rosa Parks is released from jail on bail that day. She and other Montgomery civil rights leaders meet at her house to discuss the bus boycott.
For years, civil rights leaders have been planning a bus boycott to fight segregation. They are waiting for the right time and the right leader to spark the boycottand Rosa Parks is that person. They know Rosa Parks has the courage to stand up to segregation. Because most of Montgomery's bus riders are black, the bus companies will lose money if black people refuse to ride the buses.
I know one thing, I will never, ever ride another segregated bus againeven if it means I have to walk to work.
You have to stand up for what you believe in.
Rosa, how would you feel about making your arrest a test case against segregation? We may be able to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.
I don't like being in the spotlight, and I don't want to put my family in danger.
Rosa, this may be our best chance to fight segregation laws.
Good. In the meantime, we're going to boycott the buses.
The next day, community leaders meet to discuss the boycott. At their request, Martin Luther King Jr. agrees to lead it.
SCENE 3: Montgomery courthouse, a few days later
Rosa Parks approaches the courthouse steps with her husband for her trial.
The steps of the courthouse are packed with people. Some bystanders threaten Rosa Parks. Others shout their support.
Your place is in the back of the bus, lady!
Oh, she's so sweet. They've messed with the wrong one now!
After Rosa Parks and her husband manage to push their way into the courtroom, the trial begins. The bus driver takes the stand.
I politely asked her to move to the back, which is required by city law. She refused to listen.
Rosa Parks is not called to the stand. Instead, her lawyers speak on her behalf.
I find Rosa Parks guilty of violating the city law. She must pay a $10 fine plus $4 in court costs.
The crowd of supporters in the courtroom reacts angrily to the verdict.
You haven't heard the last from us.
Despite the boos from supporters, the guilty verdict was exactly what Rosa Parks and her lawyers wanted. Their case eventually made it to the nation's highest courtthe Supreme Court.
Montgomery's black community continued to boycott the buses. On November 13, 1956, their efforts finally paid off. The Supreme Court ruled that Alabama's segregated buses were against the law. After more than a year, the boycott ended.
At the urging of photographers, Rosa Parks boarded a bus on December 20. This time, she sat in the front seat. (See the cover.)

The flag flying over the fort survived the night. Key was so moved by the sight of the American flag that he wrote a poem that was later set to music. In 1931, Congress made the song the official national anthem.

Recent photos taken by Mars Odyssey show that Mars has water. Because it is very cold on Mars, the water is frozen. Most of the water is frozen under the surface of Mars.
Even though lots of ice crystals are mixed in with the Martian soil, Mars doesn't have as much water as Earth has. Mars has lakes of water, not oceans of water. In fact, scientists say that if you collected all the water on Mars, it would fill a lake about twice the size of Lake Michigan.
There is evidence that some of the frozen water locked under the surface of Mars might melt every once in a while. Some of the water is only 18 inches below the surface. Molten rock deep beneath the surface of Mars might heat the ice. The melted ice might mix with salt deposits in the Martian soil and flow down steep canyon walls.

A team of scientists might be ditching the phrase ""oh, rats!"" from their vocabulary. They are experimenting with ways that rats may help find people who are buried as a result of earthquakes or other disasters.
Like dogs, rats have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out survivors. The rodents are also small enough to crawl almost anywhere. Dogs can be limited in their searches because of their larger size.
The scientists trained the rats to recognize the scent of people. To do that, researchers implanted electronic devices into the brains of the animals.
The electronic devices affect the rat's brain so that it picks up the scent of a person and then plans how to locate the person. Signals from the rat's brain are relayed to a radio transmitter that scientists attach to the rodent's back.
Rescue teams then will be able to track those signals and follow the rat's path. That will help rescuers determine where to start digging for survivors. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next nine months.

What does it feel like to walk on the moon?
Aldrin: You knew that you were there, but it was unreal at the same time. It's so different and unusual that it's almost dreamlike.
What was the most memorable part of walking on the moon?
Aldrin: There are two moments that are not recorded on film. They're recorded in my mind. One was just the second or two after we shut the engine down and we realized that the spacecraft was on the moon. That really was the major achievement. When I was outside seeing the Earth, my other thought was that there were only three human beings who were not on Earth. [The third was Michael Collins, who was orbiting the moon in a craft that would take the astronauts back to Earth.]
Your children's book is about following your dreams. Did you dream of being an astronaut?
Aldrin: Well, there wasn't any such thing as an astronaut until about 1958 or 1959.
[the Soviet space satellite] didn't go up until 1957, so thinking of human beings in space was not at all common.
Will returning to the moon have the same impact as it did when you and Mr. Armstrong first set foot on the moon?
Aldrin: No, I don't think there is any way you can replace that competitiveness [to reach the moon first] that existed, that pioneering spirit. The moon is a proving ground in our backyard. We've been there before, but it's preparing us to visit another planet.
You've been a supporter of a piloted mission to Mars. Why do you think it's so important that we send humans to Mars?
Aldrin: Now we can send robots to Mars, but that just wouldn't satisfy the human desire to want to expand our horizons. We've always done that. I can't answer by saying that there is going to be something profitable that will be returned from Mars, other than perhaps storytelling or making movies en route.

The hammerhead suffered the steepest drop-an 89 percent decrease. The number of great white sharks declined by 79 percent.

Sharks are predators at the top of the food chain. A predator is an animal that survives by eating other animals. Sharks hunt, or prey upon, other animals such as seals and tuna. Seals and tuna eat smaller fish. Those smaller fish feed on tiny fish and ocean plants.

361,"The Heat Is On: Will Global Warming Affect Animals?
Polar bears in Alaska are having trouble catching one of their main meals--ringed seals. To get to the seals, the bears often walk across islands of ice floating in the water.
Ice throughout Alaska is melting earlier and faster in the spring than it did several years ago. So polar bears don't have as much time to catch seals before the ice melts. As a result, polar bears are catching fewer seals.
Ice along Alaska's coast is melting because the temperature is higher worldwide. In the last 100 years, Earth's temperature has risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit.
. Global warming is changing the environment worldwide. As a result, many plants and animals are being affected, say scientists from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
As temperatures rise, more and more animals will have to
, or move, in order to survive, said scientist Jay Malcolm of the WWF.
Many plants and animals that can't adjust or migrate will not survive the rise in temperature, said WWF scientists. In some areas of the world, the WWF says, as many as two in ten species of plants and animals will die out by the year 2100.
Here are some examples of how global warming is affecting some animals in North America.
The numbers on the map show where each animal can be found.
The black guillemot (GIL-uh-maht) is a bird that lives on an island off Alaska's coast. It eats Arctic cod, a fish that lives in water under ice. Rising temperatures have caused much of the ice to melt. The Arctic cod has moved to other parts of the sea where water is still covered with ice. The guillemot no longer has enough fish to eat.
The American bistort is a plant that lives in Mount Rainier National Park. The Edith's checkerspot butterfly drinks nectar from bistort flowers. The warming temperatures have caused the butterflies to hatch earlier, before the flowers bloom, so the butterflies don't have enough food right after they hatch.
Global warming is actually helping some animals.
The Mexican vole lives in areas with warm temperatures. It is spreading northward into Arizona and Colorado because of the rise in temperatures there.
For years, red fire ants lived in the warm southern part of the United States. Today, because of rising temperatures, they are spreading northward.
Scientists have learned that global warming is already affecting Earth. ""We should not expect the effects of global warming to take place 50 years in the future,"" said scientist Rafe Sagarin. ""It's happening right now.""
Scientists agree that Earth has been getting warmer for the last 100 years. They don't agree on
Gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming. Carbon dioxide in the air traps heat from the sun, causing Earth's temperature to rise.
Volcanoes and forest fires release carbon dioxide into the air. Some scientists blame the rise in temperature on volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and other natural events.
Other scientists blame human actions for the rise in temperature. They say Earth has always had volcanoes and forest fires, so why is Earth warming now? Those scientists say the carbon dioxide from automobiles and factories is causing the recent increase in global warming.

Why did astronomers give Pluto the boot? For starters, they came up with a new definition for a planet. A planet must be nearly round and must

Since its discovery in 1930, astronomers suspected that Pluto was an oddball when compared with the other planets. New technology has shown that its orbit is oval-shaped. Pluto is also smaller than the other planets. Even Earths moon is larger.
Orbit and size werent the only problems. Pluto is made up of material that is different from that of the other planets. While the others are made up of rocks or gases, Pluto consists mostly of ice.
Pluto appears to be similar to other objects in the Kuiper belt. Its status as a planet began to look bleak when 2003 UB313 was discovered three years ago.

Plutos downgraded title isnt stopping scientists from learning more about the dwarf planet. ""We will continue pursuing exploration of the most scientifically interesting objects in the solar system, regardless of how they are categorized,"" says NASA official Paul Hertz.
Pluto meets only two of the three new requirements:
 It has to be nearly round.
 Its orbit should not cross another planets orbit.
Pluto was discovered in 1930, long after the other planets, by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh (19061997). He wasnt the person to name it, though. Venetia Burney, an 11-year-old British girl, gave Pluto its name. She thought the new planet should be named for the Roman god of the underworld.

More class time can improve test scores, according to a recent report by the research group Education Sector. As a result, schools are experimenting with tacking on an hour or more to the school day.
Elementary and middle school students at Fletcher-Maynard Academy in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have gone to an eight-hour school day. Fletcher-Maynard Academy is just one of 10 schools in Massachusetts trying out the new schedule. Lawmakers in Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, and Washington, D.C., are also debating extended school hours.
People in favor of longer school days say kids need to learn more to stay competitive in today's world. The additional hours enable teachers to spend more time on each subject. Fletcher-Maynard principal Robin Harris likes having the extra hours. ""Teachers can be a little more creative,"" she told
Students aren't just spending the extra time with their heads in a book, though. Harris explains that her students get longer recesses and more snack time. Parent Dawn Oliver says her 11-year-old daughter, Brittany, is an advice columnist for a magazine at her school in Fall River, Massachusetts. ""The kids get so involved in these things because it's not all book work,"" says Oliver.
Critics argue that extended school days could be too long for today's busy kids. And extra school time might prevent students from exploring other interests. Some students have complained about having to stay later. They are concerned that they wouldn't be able to concentrate during the last classes of the day.
Other people point out that longer school days
with, or get in the way of, after-school sports and clubs. ""The day is long enough already,"" student Cameron Villers from Ansonia, Connecticut, told
""After-school activities would be affected. Nobody wants to be at school from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m."" If schools have different schedules, planning athletic games could prove difficult.

How exactly does a new word make its way into the dictionary? It takes about 10 to 20 years for a new word to become a common term used by a lot of people.
Deciding which words make the cut is the job of editors. They spend a lot of their day reading newspapers and magazines to find out what new words and phrases are popular. They also get ideas from the movies and the Internet-and even from slang usage. They enter new words into a computer system.
Noah Webster, America's first dictionary editor, began a similar system. He started putting files of words on cards in Springfield, Massachusetts. There are now millions of words on file. Talk about wordy!

are large sheets of snow and ice that move slowly over land.
Glaciers are found in the polar regions around the world and in mountain valleys. The glaciers in South America are some of the largest outside the polar regions.
Because of the region's rough terrain and harsh weather, scientists have trouble reaching the area by foot. To study the melting of the South American glaciers, scientists recently relied on satellite technology.
Scientists discovered that glaciers in this area are rapidly melting.In fact, they are melting twice as fast as they were just a few years ago. Erik Rignot, an expert who studied the glaciers, referred to the South American ice fields as the ""fastest area of glacial retreat on Earth.""
As the glaciers melt, their water flows into lakes or oceans. As a result, the meltdown is causing sea levels to rise. If ocean levels rise by even a foot, the water could flood the world's coastal cities.
What is causing the glaciers to pull a disappearing act? Warmer temperatures and less snowfall from
are to blame for the meltdown, say scientists. Global warming is the worldwide rise in temperature.
The warmer temperatures cause the glaciers to break off into the ocean as icebergs. That process, called
It's not just that the South American glaciers are on thin ice. Scientists warn that about 90 percent of the world's glaciers are melting from global warming.
Some scientists say that people contribute to Earth's warmer temperatures. Harmful gases are released into the air when people burn certain fuels for electricity or for driving cars.
To help solve the problem, some scientists say people must work to reduce the effects of global warming. ""Once the glaciers have melted, that's it [for them],"" said one scientist.
Glaciers are large sheets of moving ice and snow. As snow accumulates, or builds up, on a glacier, the weight causes the snow underneath to turn into ice. The ice becomes so heavy that it forces the glacier to move.
As glaciers slowly move, they carve out the land beneath them, carrying away rocks and soil. Glaciers erode, or gradually wear away, the land.
What are some ways people can help prevent global warming?
Over hundreds and thousands of years, glaciers create different landforms, such as lakes.

Some of superheated rivers of lava flowed toward towns. In an attempt to stop the advancing lava, airplanes dropped thousands of gallons on water on it. Fearing for their lives, many people fled from their homes.
The volcano also shot thick flakes of hot ash into the sky. Much of the ash rained down on nearby towns. Some of it rose high into the atmosphere. Winds blew the ash up to 400 miles from the volcano.
People in Sicily have lived with Mount Etna for a long time. The first recorded eruption happened about 3,500 years ago. Since then, Mount Etna has erupted more than 250 times. In 1669, an earthquake triggered by an eruption killed nearly 20,000 people.

582,"Tourists Put Pressure on World's Monuments and Parks
Some of the World's most important monuments and parks are being loved to death. Many sites around the world are in bad shape because of a recent sharp increase in the number of tourists worldwide. The causes of damage range from everyday wear and tear to pollution to
, or the destruction of property on purpose.
Each year, hundreds of millions of tourists visit special places around the world. In fact, according to the World Tourism Organization, by the end of this year about 668 million people will have made tourist trips. By 2020, the organization said, that number may more than double, to 1.5 billion tourists!
The problem is that a large number of visitors can damage a monument or park. The thousands of cars and buses that carry tourists to a site create air pollution. Air pollution can discolor and damage monuments made of stone and other materials. Huge numbers of tourists also cause garbage to pile up. And sometimes tourists take pieces of monuments away with them as souvenirs.
These are some of the special places that are suffering from too much attention:
. These are two of the biggest national parks in the United States. Millions of tourists each year crowd into these areas. As a result, air pollution, garbage, and other damage have marred these awesome sites.
. Located in Peru, a country in South America, Machu Picchu is the site of an ancient city in the Andes Mountains. A people called the Incas built the city almost 600 years ago for Incan royalty. Garbage tossed aside by tourists, as well as air and water pollution, are now problems at Machu Picchu.
. The Parthenon is a temple that was built almost 2,500 years ago in Athens, a city in the European country of Greece. Air pollution has pitted and discolored the marble that the beautiful building is made of.
. Located near the town of Dunhuang, in north-central China, these caves are covered with delicate paintings and carvings. However, the breath of the 300,000 visitors who pass through the 492 caves each year is damaging the artwork, which is between 700 and 1,700 years old.
To help preserve such important places, new rules are being written by organizations such as UNESCO, which is a part of the United Nations. UNESCO is working with governments worldwide to limit the number of tourists who visit some special sites.
UNESCO is also working to educate sightseers about how to avoid damaging the places they visit. As one student who works with UNESCO said, ""You have to protect the past to reach tomorrow.""
If you are visiting a monument or national park, here are a few rules the U.S. Park Service says you should always follow:
If you are camping, take your trash and leftover food out with you when you leave.
When visiting a monument, don't touch sculptures, paintings, or other artwork.
Leave any artifacts, plants, stones, or other things where they are.
If you see someone damaging a monument or throwing garbage on the ground in a park, tell a park ranger or another park official.

When you come home from school, does your pet dog run to you barking and wagging its tail? Does your cat purr when you pet it? Many pet owners believe that tail wagging and purring are signs that pets are happy.
Most scientists are not sure that animals feel emotions. They say animals never feel happy or sad. In fact, they say, animals probably don't feel love, anger, hate or other emotions either.
Scientist Joseph LeDoux studied rats to find out whether the rodents have emotions. He found that rats do feel at least one emotion--fear. He also found the part of the brain that seems to control fear in rats. In humans, that part of the brain controls fear and some other emotions.
Even though LeDoux says rats feel fear, he doubts that other animals have emotions in the way humans and other primates do. ""A whale may behave as if it's in love,"" he said, ""but you can't prove what it's feeling, if anything.""
A number of scientists say animals do have a range of emotions. Some scientists who have studied such animals as dogs, cats, elephants, lions, and whales say those animals feel emotions. Scientist Joyce Poole studies elephants. She has written that pachyderms often show grief when a relative dies. She says elephants have ""deep emotions.""
Jane Goodall, studies chimpanzees. She says she has seen chimps playing and chasing one another for fun. Goodall also says chimps feel grief. After Flo, a 50-year-old chimp, died, one of her sons, Flint, refused to eat food. Flint's brothers and sisters tried to get him to eat, but they couldn't. Three weeks later, Flint died. Goodall says Flint ""died of grief.""
More recently, scientist Marc Bekoff watched an elk run back and forth through a patch of snow, jumping into the air as it completed each back-and-forth pass. Bekoff said the animal was feeling the ""joy of life.""
Bekoff said he can't prove that animals have feelings, because animals can't talk. But, he said, animals can communicate feelings in other ways. ""I can't prove that another human being is feeling happy or sad,"" he said, ""but I can [guess] how [he or she is] feeling through body language and facial expressions."" Both people and animals use
-- gestures and movements--to communicate without words.

Supporters also say that the Constitution has been amended in the past. Amendments to outlaw slavery, give women the right to vote, and limit a president to two terms in office were added.
Others say that the requirement is unfair, especially because the United States is supposed to be the land of opportunity. ""You cannot choose the land of your birth,"" said an advocate in a television ad. ""You can choose the land you love.""

Even though the coqui and greenhouse frogs are each only about the size of a dime, they make a huge racket. Instead of making soft chirping or gentle croaking sounds, the frogs chirp as loudly as a lawnmower. ""You'd never believe so much noise could come from a creature that small,"" Stevens said.
Scientists say the frogs in Stevens's backyard recently arrived in Hawaii. They came from islands in the Caribbean Sea, south of the United States mainland. Scientists think the frogs were accidentally shipped to Hawaii in flowerpots.
Since arriving in Hawaii, the foreign frogs have spread to 150 areas. In some areas, more than 8,000 can be found on a single acre of land. Each one is adding to the noise level.
The frogs are more than a noisy nuisance; they are causing other problems, as well. They eat insects that birds and other frogs used to eat. Each night, each thunderous frog can eat at least six insects.
The number of frogs is increasing because no other animals prey on them. If the foreign frog population keeps growing, other frogs and birds in Hawaii might not have enough insects to eat and might starve.
Some officials worry that the frogs might cause some people to leave Hawaii because of the racket. ""We get a lot of complaints from residents,"" said Fred Kraus, a spokesperson for the state. ""Some [have] threatened to leave the state.""
Residents of Hawaii are trying to capture the shrill frogs, which live in trees. Recently, Stevens and some of his neighbors went out looking for the noisy critters. They used ladders to climb into trees and capture frogs. ""We got them all,"" he said.
However, within a few months of the frog roundup, more frogs moved into Stevens's neighborhood. ""It was hopeless,"" Stevens said. ""There were just too many [frogs to capture]. Now they're out of control.""

The Paralympics run from October 18 to 29.
: The Paralympics began in 1960. They parallel the Olympic Games. That's where the name comes from.
: What sports are part of the Paralympics?
: Eighteen sports are included the Paralympics. This year, we have two new sports, wheelchair rugby and sailing.
: Who can compete in the Paralympics?
: This year, 125 countries are sending 4,000 athletes, each with a physical disability.
: Besides the health benefits, sports teach many skills. First, there's the mental discipline involved with sports. You always have to concentrate, think, and plan ahead. Also, sports teach teamwork, leaderships skills, and self-confidence.
: Sports have always been a part of your life. What happened when you were 16 years old that almost ended your sports career?
: When I was younger, I was a skier. I was training in Austria when I fell and severed my spinal cord.
: How did that accident change your life?
: It didn't change anything. I never missed a beat. The accident didn't change my goals. My mind was not touched in the accident. I could do everything after the accident that I could do before it, except walk.
I'm the same person today that I was before the accident.
: Well, one thing changed. I switched sports. I'm no longer a skier. In the 1988, 1992, and 1996 Paralympics, I competed in track and field events, winning four medals. This year, I'm on the basketball team.
: What do you plan to do in Sydney?
: If you could say one thing to the kids of America, what would you tell them?
: Try. And I mean really try. If you want to do something, give it your best effort. If you find a roadblock in your path, take a detour. If you really want to do something, you can find a way to do it.

555,"Dodging Danger: Should Dodgeball Be Tossed Out of School?
For many kids, dodgeball is a harmless game. But gym teacher Neil Williams does not see anything ""harmless"" about the game.
Recently, Williams recalled an accident that happened during his first year teaching. His students were playing dodgeball. Suddenly, the ball slammed into one girl's face, smashing her nose. The girl had to be taken to the hospital.
Soon after that, Williams started a campaign to ban dodgeball from schools. Some schools in several states have already banned the game.
The object of dodgeball is to get other players out by hitting them with a ball. Critics of the game say that it teaches violence. ""The game allows the stronger kids to pick on and target the weaker kids,"" Williams told
Judith Young is the executive director of the National Association for Sport and Physical Education. She told
the game doesn't belong in school. ""I don't have a problem with the game at backyard picnics and parties,"" she said. ""I just don't think it should be used in phys-ed classes.""
Rick Hanetho strongly disagrees. He likes dodgeball so much that he started the National Amateur Dodgeball Association.
Hanetho says dodgeball teaches kids important skills. ""It teaches eye-hand coordination, decision making, concentration, and agility,"" he said.
Hanetho also says that dodgeball does not encourage bullying. ""I don't buy the idea that dodgeball allows some kids to pick on the smaller and weaker kids,"" he said. ""In fact, it's the littler kids who are usually the best players. They are faster and can avoid being hit.""
Here's what some kids have to say about dodgeball:
Isabela, age 11: A dodgeball isn't hard and it can't hurt anyone.
Paloma, age 9: I like dodgeball. You get to run around a lot and that's a lot of fun.
Liliam, age 9: Dodgeball is great because you get to throw the ball at other kids.
Mara: age 10: Some kids don't like dodgeball because they get hit at the beginning of the game. But I like it.

235,"In June, a small car pulled up outside the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad. Three men unloaded a wrapped object from the trunk, handed it to museum officials, and sped off in the mid afternoon heat. No questions asked.
Museum officials were stunned. The men had left a very important vase. Although the vase was in pieces, the good news was that it could be fixed.
""This is one of the most important pieces from the Baghdad museum, and I am delighted it has been returned,"" said a museum official. ""It is reason for people all around the world to celebrate.""
Why, exactly, would the return of a vase be cause for celebration? It was the famous Vase of Warka. The 5,000-year-old
, or man-made object, is one of the world's first sculptures. The images on the vase are important because they link the past to modern times.
Along with many valuable objects, the vase was stolen from the museum after the fall of Saddam Hussein's government in April.
At that time, mobs of thieves and rioters, or
, tore through the museum. They smashed ancient objects. Thieves ran off with prized treasures. Among the lost objects were carvings, jewelry, paintings, and statues.
One museum official referred to the looting as the ""crime of the century."" He said that it wasn't just a loss for Iraq, but that it was ""a loss for all mankind.""
. That means they could never be replaced. Some of the lost objects dated back 10,000 years, to the beginning of civilization.
Many people blamed U.S. troops for failing to protect the museum as Saddam's government fell. They pointed out that U.S. forces had managed to guard the oil reserves. U.S. government officials defended themselves, saying that American troops were focused on taking control of Baghdad.
Officials estimate that about 3,000 pieces from the museum's entire collection of 170,000 items are still missing. The losses were not as large as experts originally thought. Some valuable pieces were hidden in underground vaults. Other pieces were taken by people for safekeeping and then were returned.
Some of the stolen objects are slowly making their way back to the museum. Museum workers are trying to ensure the safe return of other objects. They began a ""don't ask; don't tell"" policy.
The policy allows thieves-like the ones who brought back the vase-to return stolen goods without punishment. Countries around the world are involved in recovery efforts. They are helping to compile a list of the stolen items. However, as one expert pointed out, ""It's going to be a long time before we know for sure what's missing.""
Modern-day Iraq is the site of ancient Mesopotamia. In Greek,
means ""the land between rivers."" There, about 5,000 years ago, the first cities sprang up between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
The area between the two rivers is often referred to as a cradle of civilization. That's because mathematics, science, and one of the first written languages developed there.
Here are some of the Iraqi National Museum's valuable artifacts and their status at the time
This 5,000-year-old stone statue of a woman praying was still missing.
This life-size marble head of a woman is one of the earliest pieces of sculpture. About 5,000 years old, it was stolen during the looting.
How did looters steal from world history when they ransacked the museum?
Originally thought to be missing, this tablet is a record of the world's earliest writing. It was found on the museum's second floor, away from the riots.

What were the most important accomplishments of your presidency?
I think that one of the most important things I've accomplished was helping to strengthen our economy so that more Americans have jobs and more families can afford to buy homes and send their kids to college.
I'm particularly proud of a new program created in 1993 called AmeriCorps, which gives young people a chance to serve their communities while earning money for college.
What advice would you give the new president?
A president has tremendous responsibilities-- from keeping our economy growing to working with foreign leaders and commanding our armed forces. The president is the leader, but he or she can't do the job alone. So my advice is build a strong team, stay focused on your priorities, and make every day count.
Why should kids be proud to be Americans?
We should all be proud to be Americans because this truly is a land of opportunity. Regardless of your background, you can work hard and achieve your dreams. You may face challenges or obstacles along the way, but if you set your sights high, work hard, and stick to your priorities, you can achieve your goals.
What has been the best part of being president?
The best part of being president has been having the opportunity to make America a better place. Every day, I have the chance to make a difference in people's lives.
After being president for eight years, what will you do now?
The first lady and I recently bought a new home in Chappaqua, N.Y., and I look forward to spending more time there. I also plan to spend time in Arkansas putting together my presidential library and launching a new public policy center. I'm sure I'll be very busy, but I also hope to spend more time with my family and friends and to simply relax after what has been eight of the most incredible years of my life.
William Jefferson Blythe IV was born on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas.
In 1962, when Clinton was a senior in high school, he was chosen to go to Washington, D.C., to participate in Boys Nation, a special youth conference. There he met President Kennedy. After that, he said, he knew he wanted to make a difference in the lives of Americans by becoming a U.S. president.
Clinton went to Georgetown University, after which he studied at Oxford University in England. He then went to law school at Yale University.
In 1976, Clinton was elected attorney general of Arkansas. He later was elected governor of Arkansas.
In 1991, Clinton decided to run for president of the United States.

The statues, one 120 feet tall and the other 175 feet tall, were of the religious leader Buddha (BOO-duh), the founder of Buddhism.
Many art and history experts say the statues were historic treasures. ""They were among the most stunning [statues] I've ever seen,"" said. Professor James Fisher of Carleton College in Minnesota.
The Taliban, the religious group that rules most areas of Afghanistan, ordered the destruction of the two statues. (
In 1996, the Taliban seized the Afghan capital, Kabul, and took control of most of the country. The Taliban and a large majority of people who live in the country are Muslims. They practice a religion called Islam.
The Taliban said their holy book, the Koran, forbids the creation or worship of statues. Before the statues were destroyed, a Taliban leader said, ""Because... these statues are there to be worshipped, and that is wrong, they should be destroyed.""
Throughout the world, leaders were outraged after learning that the Taliban planned the destruction of the huge statues. World leaders and officials from the United Nations (U.N.) tried to stop the destruction. Iran, a country where most people are Muslims, asked the Taliban not to blow up the statues. Japan, a country where Buddhism is widely practiced, threatened to withhold money that the country had planned to send to Afghanistan.
Now many people are mourning the loss of the statues. ""It is [horrible] to witness the... destruction of [historic monuments], which were the [history] of the whole of humanity,"" said a U.N. representative.

Historians believe that colonists from England dug the well nearly 400 years ago. Shortly after the well was completed, it dried up. The colonists then used the well as a dump.
The historians have found a piece of old armor in the well. Studying the armor and other ""garbage"" from the well will help us learn about life in early Jamestown.
The history of Jamestown begins in England. On December 20, 1606, three ships sailed from England. The ships were bound for Virginia. After the colonists on the ships landed in Virginia, they built a fort. The colonists arrived in North America 14 years before the Pilgrims.
Most of the colonists came to Virginia to search for treasure. Most did not know how to grow crops to feed themselves. They became so hungry that they ate dogs, rats, and snakes.
Eventually, more people settled in Jamestown. They turned the fort into a town. The colonists began to grow and sell crops. The small fort became the first permanent English settlement in North America.
The ""garbage"" from the well is helping historians better understand how the colonists lived.
""When one stands at Jamestown today, it is hard to imagine how much hope, regret, fear, hatred, hunger, pain, and death were experienced at this place,"" historian Ivor Noel Hume wrote of the fort's earliest colonists.

The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center is located in Cincinnati, Ohio.
What would you do if you were in Kaleb's shoes? Using an interactive exhibit, kids who visit the recently opened National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, can help Kaleb make a decision. They can also learn about the consequences of that decision.
""The exhibit gives kids a sense of the risk and losses that were part of trying to gain freedom,"" museum official Stephen DeVillez told
The new museum opened in August 2004 on the northern bank of the Ohio River. That river once marked the line between slavery and freedom. Historians believe that thousands of slaves who escaped through the Underground Railroad from the South, where slavery was allowed, crossed the Ohio River.
The Underground Railroad was not a real railroad. During the late 1700s to mid-1800s, the Underground Railroad was actually a secret system of safe routes that runaway slaves could use as they fled from the South to free Northern states, Canada, and Mexico.
The Underground Railroad covered hundreds of hidden routes. Most slaves escaped through Ohio, Indiana, and western Pennsylvania. Slaves made their way to freedom any way they could. Most hid during the day and traveled at night.
Along the way, a vast network of black people and white people called
risked their lives to provide escaped slaves with food, clothing, and shelter. An abolitionist was someone who worked to end slavery.

""The Underground Railroad wouldn't have existed if it wasn't for brave people who took a risk to stand up for freedom,"" said DeVillez. ""The museum is a learning center that teaches lessons of courage and the fight for freedom that exists even today.""
Some key people fought against slavery during the mid-1800s.
Harriet Tubman was a former slave who became the most famous conductor of the Underground Railroad. From 1850 to 1860, she led about 300 slaves to freedom. Tubman once said, ""On my Underground Railroad, I [never] run my train off [the] track, and I never [lost] a passenger.""

137,"Standing atop a hill this summer in the dense jungles of Guatemala, a country in Central America, scientist Arthur Demarest felt his feet sink into the jungle vines.
Demarest plunged into a deep, tangled snake hole up to his armpits. Hearing snakes slithering around him, Demarest froze. For half an hour, the scientist didn't move, waiting for the snakes to settle down so he could climb out safely. While stuck in that snaky situation, Demarest looked around and realized the pit was actually part of a jungle-covered three-story building.
As soon as he got out of the hole, Demarest and his team of scientists explored the hill. They found that it was an ancient palace built by the Maya people. The Mayan civilization covered parts of Mexico and Central America, and reached its greatest power between the years 250 and 900.
Demarest's team also discovered a city surrounding the palace. The Maya people called the city
, which means ""place of serpents."" The palace at Cancun was built more than 1,300 years ago by the Mayan king Tah ak Chaan.
So far, Demarest and his team have counted 170 rooms in the palace, which has 11 courtyards and covers an area the size of two football fields. Because of its sturdy limestone walls, the palace is in extremely good condition, Demarest said.
Demarest said Cancun is different from other Mayan cities. Unlike the other Mayan cities, Cancun doesn't have temples or evidence that there was warfare. ""The basis of power among the Mayan [kings] was religion and warfare,"" explained Demarest. ""Apparently, Cancun needed neither.""
The drawing shows an artist's idea of what the Cancun palace might have looked like.
Demarest said the city must have been very powerful. But its leaders were more focused on
, or widespread buying and selling, than on religion or warfare.
Located near the Pasin River, Cancun was a thriving trading center for the Maya. ""That river,"" Demarest said, ""was really the superhighway of the Mayan world.""
Jade, a semiprecious stone, is everywhere at the site, Demarest said. Scientists even uncovered the remains of a woman who had jade false teeth! Finely carved jade statues were found in the graves of workmen.
Demarest estimates that it will take about 10 to 15 years to
, or dig out, Cancun. In his 20 years of uncovering Mayan ruins, he said, Cancun is ""by far the most spectacular.""
The snakes must think so, too. ""A buried palace is exciting to us,"" said Demarest, ""but it's even more exciting to snakes. They love it! This place is full of snakes.""

97,"Hiram Bingham lived for adventure. In 1911, the American explorer trekked through the jungles of Peru. He was searching for clues to explain how the once-mighty Inca Empire had disappeared.
His journey through the Andes Mountains in South America was not easy. Bingham hacked his way through thick forests and climbed slippery slopes. One wrong stop could have sent him plummeting off a cliff.
After crawling up a snake-infested mountain, Bingham stumbled upon one of the greatest finds of the last century. He uncovered ruins from the ""lost city"" of Machu Picchu (MAH-choo PEE-choo).
Until Bingham's discovery, the ruins remained hidden for more than 400 years. Machu Picchu, which lies high atop a peak, is an ancient city that belonged to the Incas. Its name means ""old peak.""
Thanks to a traveling museum exhibit, people in the United States can go back in time to experience Incan life in Machu Picchu. The exhibit, called ""Machu Picchu: Unveiling the Mysteries of the Incas,"" is currently on display at the Chicago Field Museum.
""It is the first exhibit of its kind,"" museum project manager Hillary Hansen told
. ""It is the largest traveling exhibit of Inca objects.""
that Bingham collected are on display--from ceramic jars to copper and bronze jewelry. Artifacts are objects that people made long ago.
Machu Picchu is an ancient city that belonged to the Incas.
The Incas were people who ruled one of the largest empires in South America. Their empire extended from present-day Colombia into western Argentina.
Their vast civilization began to spread in about 1200. It lasted through the mid-1500s.
When Bingham discovered Machu Picchu, he thought he had found the birthplace of the Inca Empire. Since that time,
have learned that the city served as a summer residence for Incan kings. (Archaeologists study artifacts to learn about the past.)
The Incas built Machu Picchu between 1450 and 1470 for the ruler Pachacuti. The royal family would relax, hunt, and entertain foreign visitors there.
Machu Picchu wasn't just a home for nobles. About 500 common people lived in the stone city and worked for the royal family as farmers, artisans, and servants.
The city was abandoned in the mid-1500s, not long after the Spanish
(conquerors) arrived. The Inca Empire collapsed under Spanish rule.
Today, Machu Picchu is a popular tourist attraction. Nearly 400,000 people visit the ancient grounds each year.
Scientists still research the area to unlock more mysteries about the Incas. ""In the scheme of things, we still know very little about Machu Picchu,"" said Hansen.
Machu Picchu, which is located in Peru, was a city of palaces, temples, farms, and small houses.
Many of the buildings at Machu Picchu are made of large stones. The stones are so tightly wedged together that a piece of paper cannot fit between them.
Machu Picchu's farmland was carved into steps because it was hard for farmers to plow up and down the mountain. That allowed farmers to plant crops on the flat parts of the land and prevented rain from washing soil downhill.
The Incas had no writing, no money system, and no knowledge of the wheel. How do you think they created such a large empire?

as she watched heavy rains and high winds rip through her hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana. The 9-year-old had been getting ready to start fourth grade. Her brother, Terren, had arranged his school supplies in his backpack to prepare for his first day of second grade. But Hurricane Katrina prevented schools in New Orleans from opening.
When New Orleans flooded, Tenisha and her family headed 350 miles west to Houston, Texas. They spent five days in a Houston hotel until a local family provided them with shelter. Now Tenisha and her brother are getting used to a new school in Houston. ""I've started making new friends already,"" Tenisha told
Tenisha and Terren are not alone. An estimated 372,000 children from Louisiana and Mississippi have found themselves in new schools, since the hurricane caused damage and flooding in those states. Schools from Maine to California have embraced students like Tenisha and Terren with hugs, smiles, and welcome signs.
Schools in Texas expect to enroll as many as 60,000 new kids. Houston schools alone enrolled almost 2,000 students in the few days following the devastating hurricane.
Two schools in Houston that had closed last spring have reopened. The two schools are now devoted entirely to
children. An evacuee is a person forced to move from a place of danger. School principals are also hiring hundreds of new teachersmany are evacuees from Louisiana and Mississippi.
Being the new kid at school is never easy. Experts say that it's even harder for children
because of the hurricane. Displaced people have been forced to flee from their homes.
Students who have left their homes have to
or get used to, new schools, teachers, and friends, say officials. Schools also play an important role in helping kids from the stricken areas cope with the disaster of Katrina.
Tenisha and Terren are adjusting well to their new schoolMacGregor Music and Science Magnet School in Houston. So far, MacGregor has accepted more than 12 displaced students. ""We want each one of the new children to feel this is home for them,"" the school's principal, Patsy Brown, told
Students at MacGregor have welcomed the new faces. ""We want to make our new classmates feel good because we know they've gone through so much,"" fourth grader James McKethen told
James's sister, third grader Tiye McKethen, agrees. ""It's cool to have new friends. And they get to have fun in a new school and stay in a safe place.""
After just two days, Tenisha and Terren were settling in at MacGregor. ""Our new school is great!"" Tenisha told
But the siblings know that life has changed. Despite the warm welcome, Terren misses playing basketball with his friends in New Orleans. Tenisha, too, misses her old teachers. What's next for the family? They will likely settle down in Texas. Tenisha says, ""I want to stay in Houston.""
I live in Desoto, a town outside Dallas, Texas. My school district has taken in roughly 188 students from New Orleans. I must hand it to the kids; they are adapting pretty fast. It is cool because our school is doing everything to make the new students feel at home. We call it ""Southern hospitality.""
I have seen many acts of kindnesswhether it's letting a kid from New Orleans go to the front of the lunch line or giving a new student a personal tour of the school.
I wonder if I could be as strong if my city went through a disaster such as Katrina. What happens to New Orleans from here, we don't know. But what we do know is that we need to appreciate our family and friends. We need to be thankful for the things that we have because we do not know what tomorrow will bring.

803,"Dan Shaw and Cuddles are an endless source of fascination for onlookers when they're out in public. That's because Cuddles is a miniature guide horse. Shaw, who is blind, said he felt like Cuddles from a television program. Shaw and his wife contacted the Guide Horse foundation in Kittrell, North Carolina. ""Horses make excellent guides,"" said trainer Janet Burleson. ""It is very common in the wild state for a blind horse to bond to a sighted horse that it uses as it' guide.""
Guide horses are usually between 26 and 27 inches tall and weigh between 80 and 100 pounds-about the same size as many guide dogs. However, not just any small horse can be a guide horse, says Burleson. It needs to have the right personality and intelligence level. Like a guide dog, Cuddles has been house trained. She will tap her hoof on the door when she needs to go outside. Unlike guide dog, however, she doesn't sleep in the house. Instead, she sleeps in a small barn.

His worries don't stop at school, however. Cantees is also concerned about the clothes his daughters are wearing to school. ""My wife is even having problems shopping [for clothes] for our daughters in the third and fourth grades,"" said Cantees.
Parents also worry about school clothes. Some of the clothing looks like garb worn by pop stars Madonna, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera. The clothes include miniskirts, stretch T-shirts, and hipster jeans.
For years, stores have sold clothing to teens similar to the styles pop singers wear. Now the stores are selling those clothes to 8- to 12-year-olds.
Roberta Capole, the editor of Tiger magazine, says many kids just want to look like pop stars. ""I don't think it's about trying to look older,"" she said. ""I think kids are just trying to dress like stars they think are fantastic.""
Store officials and clothing designers hope to make lots of money selling the new fashions. Stores say that each U.S. kid spent about $500 on school clothes this fall.

Clothing designers say they have to make the new fashions. ""If I don't make it, someone else will,"" one designer said.
Parents are upset about the new fashions. ""When I take [my kids] shopping, they pick out things that... aren't appropriate for school,"" said one mother.
Teacher Dana Zeman says the new fashions don't belong in school. ""In my class, I'd like to set [a dress code],"" she said.

Knock, Knock? Who's there? The ivory-billed woodpecker, that's who!
For more than 50 years, scientists thought the ivory-billed woodpecker was extinct in the United States. Now bird lovers are flying high. Scientists recently announced that they have evidence the bird still exists in eastern Arkansas. The scientists caught the black-and-white birds in flight on a blurry videotape.
The ivory-billed woodpecker was seen again at Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in Eastern Arkansas.
The rare woodpeckers began to disappear between 1880 and the 1940s when loggers cut down the forests where they lived. The last sighting was in 1944.
The ivorybill is the largest woodpecker in the country. The red-crested bird's body is shiny blue-black. It has white markings on its neck and on both edges of its huge wings. The woodpecker's wingspan extends almost 3 feet. The bird also has a straight bill, short legs, and feet with curved claws.
, or one-of-a-kind, sound. They produce a double knock when their strong beaks strike trees. In addition, they make a call that sounds like the toot of a toy horn.
For people who doubted the videotape of the woodpeckers, the scientists collected more proof. They recorded the bird's double knock.
The recording made believers out of the doubters. ""Hearing [the recording] was very exciting!"" Richard Prum, a scientist from Yale University who studies birds, told
. ""[It is] convincing evidence that the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct.""
What are people doing to help the number of ivory-billed woodpeckers bounce back? Nature lovers are cutting down some trees in a select area of Arkansas. Sound strange? The woodpeckers feed on young beetles that thrive under the bark of fallen trees. With more food for the woodpeckers, bird lovers hope that the ivorybill's double knock will become a common sound again.

456,"On New Year's Day 2001, Irene Alexander and 2,538 other people gathered at Mount Vernon, George Washington's home in Virginia. They came to honor the slaves who had worked there. On New Year's Day 200 years earlier, 123 of George Washington's slaves had been freed.
Washington's widow, Martha, freed her husband's slaves on January 1, 1801. Martha was carrying out the wishes of the country's first president, who had died on December 14, 1799. In his will he had requested that his slaves be freed after his wife's death.
During the ceremony, Alexander, a descendant of a slave who worked at Mount Vernon, told visitors, ""I hope you all feel, as I do, a sense of joy, a sense of sadness but also a sense of hope that the contributions of good people will always be remembered.""
Jennifer Saxon, a spokesperson for Mount Vernon, told
that Mount Vernon couldn't have prospered without slave labor. ""Slaves did most of the work,"" she said.
When Washington was born, many Americans owned slaves. Those people used slaves to plant crops and perform many other duties. Most people thought slavery was OK. When Washington was 11 years old, his father died and left him ten slaves.
During the American Revolution, which began in 1775, some people began to think that slavery was wrong and should be ended. Washington was one of those people. He vowed never to buy another slave.
In his will, Washington wrote that all his slaves should be freed. ""Upon the [death] of my wife,"" he wrote, ""it is my...desire that all the slaves which I hold in my own right shall receive their freedom.""
To make sure Washington's wishes were carried out, Martha freed his slaves in 1801, a year before she died. Martha, however, kept the slaves she owned when she freed her husband's slaves.
Even though Washington freed the slaves he owned, slavery remained legal in some states for another 64 years, until 1865. Slavery did not end in the United States until after the Civil War ended it.

shows that about 17,000 school busrelated accidents occur each year. Thats more than double previous estimates. Those injuries range from cuts to broken bones.
Researchers reported that crashes arent causing all those bumps and bruises. Slips and falls, getting jostled during stops and turns, and roughhousing are other ways kids get hurt. Nearly one-quarter of those injuries occur when kids are getting on and off buses.
Though the numbers are higher than thought, they represent a small fraction of kids. There are about 24 million kids who travel on school buses each year. School buses are still the safest way for kids to ride to school, according to the National School Transportation Association.
The results may prompt stronger arguments for requiring safety belts on buses. But not all safety experts agree. Seat belts wouldnt reduce injuries and wouldnt be worth the added expense for school districts, says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

forest animals in Rudyard Kiplings famous story The Jungle Book. When Kipling wrote his classic childrens book in 1894, more than 40,000 tigers roamed the forests of India. Today, there are only a few thousand left.
Wildlife officials recently started conducting Indias largest
or population count, of Bengal tigers. Last year, India also set up a task force to help save these animals from extinction. Three of the eight types of tigers have become extinct in the last 70 years.
""Its five minutes to midnight for the tiger,"" says Callum Rankine of the World Wildlife Fund. ""This is an issue affecting not just India but tigers worldwide.""
Although most of the worlds tigers live in India, the endangered cats also prowl other countries in Asia. These survivors, too, are under attack. The major threats to tigers include
There is a high demand for tiger body parts in Asia. In China, healers use bones, tails, and other body parts to make traditional medicine. People make clothes and rugs from the animals thick black-and-orange coats. Some people eat tiger meat. Poachers can make more than $70,000 per animal by selling its body parts.
Humans also compete with tigers for land. Millions of people now live in or near areas where tigers prowl. Developers build roads through forests, loggers clear forests for lumber, and farmers use the land for crops. All those practices destroy the tigers habitat.

Wildlife officials are using new computers, hightech cameras, and radio collars to track and count Bengal tigers in India. This state-of-the-art equipment will make sure that no cat is counted twice. The task force will also work closely with the Chinese government to help stop the illegal trading of tiger parts. It plans to educate farmers and ranchers about how to live with the tiger. Smith stresses that people who live closest to the majestic beasts need to help protect them from disappearing. He is involved with projects in several Asian countries where the endangered cats live. Smith says these projects have been successful because wildlife officials work closely with local people.
""This approach is powerful because these village rangers soon become recognized in their villages as experts,"" Smith says. He explains that it motivates people to make good decisions about the tigers future.
Sunita Narain, one of Indias top environmental officials, agrees. ""The country has no choice but to make peace with the communities that share the tigers home,"" she says. ""If not, we will lose the war of conservation, tiger by tiger.""

Weekly Reader sat down with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice the day after Iraq announced its draft constitution. Weeks later, Iraqis voted to approve the constitution. Earlier this year, Rice became the first African American woman secretary of state. She is the highest-ranking member of President George W. Bushs Cabinet, or group of close advisers. As secretary of state, Rice advises the president on foreign affairs and works with world leaders on important issues. WR talked to her about Iraq and her job as head of the State Department.
WR: When Iraq announced its draft constitution yesterday, what role did the State Department play?
We were following the Iraqi constitution very closely. It started with a phone call to our ambassador in Baghdad, and then I talked to [President Bush] about what was going on. I probably was on the phone to Baghdad yesterday six or seven times just following what was going on and seeing if there was anything that we could do back here.
WR: Some people say its a mistake to try to build a democracy in Iraq. How do you respond to critics?
I say shame on anybody who says that people ought to live in
. [That is a type of government ruled by someone unjustly. Rice is referring to Iraqi life under former ruler Saddam Hussein.] When are we going to learn that human beings want to be free? And its not as if theres a choice in between. You either are free or youre not. And the people of Iraq are now free.
WR: Youve traveled more than any other secretary of state in your first six months in office. Did a particular experience stand out for you?
I went to Phuket in Thailand, where the tsunami had taken place. And there were all of these American college students there helping out in the schools. And it reminded me whats really great about Americans.
WR: What is a typical day like for you?
I usually get up about 4:30, and I exercise first. I get into the office about 6:30. I read the newspaper before I leave home, but [my staff] prepares for me reports from around the world. International politics is a 24-hour schedule, because while were asleep, the rest of the world is awake. ... My day [may include] meeting with foreign ministers. I go over to the White House for meetings at least three or four times a week. I talk to the president pretty much every day.
WR: Youve repeatedly said that you dont want to run for president in 2008. Why dont you want the nations top job?
(laughs) I do have a lot of respect for people who run for office. But I think you have to have a kind of fire to want to do that, and I justI dont.
WR: What did you want to be growing up?
I wanted to be a concert pianist. I could read music from the time I was 3 1/2 years old, and so I studied really hard. I still play [today].
WR: As a child, did you believe you could be anything you wanted?
I did. Even though I was growing up in Birmingham, Alabama, at the time when it was segregated, my parents never let me think that there was anything I couldnt do.
WR: You like football. Is your dream still to be commissioner of the National Football League (NFL)?
Well, yes. Now, if the NFL commissioners job comes up sometime soon, then the president and I are going to have to talk.

Mount Everest is 29,035 feet tall and sits on the border between Nepal and China, two countries in Asia. According to many climbers, Mount Everest is one of the hardest and deadliest mountains in the world to climb because of the mountain's height.

. Climbers can suffer from illnesses caused by many things, including the altitude.
sickness occurs when a climber does not get enough oxygen.
The team took more than two months to complete the climb. Weihenmayer spent much of his time moving the team's supplies up the mountain to a base camp, which was located at 17,600 feet. The time spent moving gear helped Erik Weihenmayer get used to the altitude. ""You're letting your body get used to the elevation, the air, the temperature,"" Weihenmayer said.
Weihenmayer, who had already climbed several of the world's highest peaks, had help getting up Mount Everest. ""[People] would walk ahead of me with a bell,"" he said. ""I tried to stay in their footsteps. I tried to stay [close] behind them so I could hear their steps, and I stepped into those places.""
For Weihenmayer, climbing Mount Everest was the toughest but most rewarding experience of his life. When he got to the top, Weihenmayer stopped to think about what he had done.
""I thought about the ground underneath me. I felt these cool flags [at the peak] that were up there in the breeze,"" Weihenmayer said. ""I thought about my family, friends, and about where I was.""

The use of the mountain for scientific research, however, is the source of a debate between scientists and some native Hawaiians. Some Hawaiians believe that the top of Mauna Kea is sacred, or an important place to their religion. They believe that the peak is the home of the snow goddess Poli'ahu.

Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks.
The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8? hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said.
Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said.
In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should.
Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school.
Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep.
Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' ""
If a kid loses one hour of sleep a night, how many hours of sleep does he or she lose in a week? A month? A year?

, scientists who study volcanoes, rushed to the mountain. Mount Etna is on Sicily, an island that is a part of Italy.
The scientists went to Sicily to learn from the 3,000-year old volcano. One of the things they wanted to learn is how to predict when a volcano will erupt.
Dozens of vulcanologists bravely climbed Mount Etna each day. They hoped that the mountain of fire would be a good teacher. ""We will probably learn more about this volcano during this eruption than had been learned in 3,000 years"", said Borris Behnke, a German scientist.
Climbing Mount Etna is more dangerous than climbing some other volcanoes. The scientists risked being burned by the rivers of lava flowing down the volcano. Hot lava flowed from both the top of the volcano and from many
, or holes, along the volcano's sides.
Etna was also hurling huge rocks into the air. ""Some of them are bigger than cars and some might be as big as trucks,"" said Behnke.
Some of the scientists didn't need to climb Mount Etna. Over the past few years, scientists had placed hundreds of sensors on the volcano. The sensors gather data about the lava flow and send the data by radio to scientists located a safe distance from the volcano.
The sensors also record earthquakes. Earthquakes in a volcanic area can mean that the volcano is about to erupt. In the days before Mount Etna erupted, the sensors had picked up more than 2,600 small earthquakes.
Behnke says that lava may erupt from Mount Etna for at least six more months. During that time, he plans to climb the volcano many times, risking his life to learn firsthand what is happening.

Everyone loves pizza, but should it be used as a reward for reading?
Should kids be reading for pizza? A nationwide reading program is drawing criticism for putting pizza front and center. Since 1985, the restaurant chain Pizza Hut has been running the Book It program, which rewards students for reading with personal pan pizzas. Now some people are taking a slice at Book It. They say the program promotes poor eating habits and gives Pizza Hut free advertising in public schools.
""It's clear that Pizza Hut's Book It has no place in public schools. ... It promotes junk food,"" says Susan Linn, a cofounder of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. The group has called for schools to stop participating in the Book It program.
Nearly 22 million children in 50,000 U.S. schools take part in Book It. Since the program began, more than 200 million pizzas have been given away. Each year, from October 1 through March 31, students read books to meet monthly reading goals set by teachers. When students meet their goal for the month, they get a certificate for a personal pan pizza.
""We're really proud of the program,"" says Leslie Tubbs, the director of Book It. ""We get hundreds of e-mails from [past participants] who praise it and say it helped them get started with reading."" In 1988, President Ronald Reagan honored the program for promoting

: Tell us about someone who is a hero to you and why that person is a hero.
: My parents [are my heroes] because they gave me unconditional love when I was growing up. They were great role models for raising my own daughters.
: What was your favorite subject in school and why?
: American and European history [were my favorites]. I believe that understanding the past helps us better understand and deal with situations happening in today's world.
: What do you think is the biggest change between being a kid when you were growing up and being a kid now?
: I think life was simpler when I was a kid growing up in a small west Texas town called Midland. We were outdoors a lot--riding our bicycles everywhere, playing sports, swapping baseball cards, going to barbecues in each other's backyards. Everyone in the neighborhood looked out for each other, and if you did something wrong, then your friend's mom or dad--even the school football coach--would call you on it.
: Your father, George Bush, was president. What is it like to have a former president as a dad?
: My father is a wonderful role model and a loving dad, and his example has inspired me in many ways. My father taught me to appreciate and learn from history. By studying the careers of talented Americans who entered government, I learned that dedicated public servants can help people.

Health officials in Turkey and around the world are alarmed by a dangerous disease called

Turkey has experienced a recent outbreak as bird flu has raced across Southeast Asia and into Russia and eastern Europe. About 100 million chickens, turkeys, and ducks have died of the disease. Officials have killed millions more in an attempt to stop the spread of bird flu.
Sumeyya is among the very few people who have caught the disease. So far, the H5N1 virus has infected about 150 people, killing at least 85 people since 1997. The virus does not usually spread from person to person.
Health officials around the globe, however, fear that the virus could

Although there have been no reported cases of bird flu in the United States yet, the government is working to make sure the country is prepared. In November, President Bush announced a $7.1 billion plan to purchase large amounts of vaccines and medicines and develop new treatments. The United States also recently pledged $330 million to help other countries fight bird flu.

Soft-drink companies are in fizzy competition. Many people in the United States are overweight. In the face of the nation's growing health and nutrition problems, many schools have banned soft drinks and other high-sugar snacks from vending machines.
As a result, the pressure is on for soft-drink companies to find new ways to stay in school. Some companies, such as Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, are introducing new milk-based drinks in different flavors to be sold in schools.
Some experts claim, though, that the milk-based drinks are still too high in sugar. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration won't allow the makers of those products to use the word

As part of a deal with New York City, Snapple will be the only drink company to have vending machines in the city's schools. To meet the city's rules banning high-sugar foods from schools, Snapple had to create four new 100-percent juice drinks.
Not good enough, say some nutrition experts who claim the new Snapple drinks have more calories and sugar in them than soft drinks have. Unlike orange juice and grapefruit juice, the new juices contain only small amounts of nutrients and vitamins. ""The fact is... they are pretty much the same as a [soft drink],"" said one expert.

During the early 1900s, hundreds of the large, light-brown cats roamed the southeastern United States. Today, panthers can be found only in southern Florida. Wildlife officials estimate that only between 80 and 100 panthers are left in the Sunshine State.
What is causing the sharp decline in the panther population? Hunting and habitat loss are mainly to blame. During the mid- to late 1900s, millions of people flocked to Florida for its warm climate and inexpensive land. As people built homes and roads, panthers were squeezed out of their habitat.

A panther is about 10 times as large as a house cat. Adult males can weigh up to 150 pounds; females typically weigh about 70 pounds.
Panthers are skilled hunters. They mainly prey on white-tailed deer and wild hogs but will also eat armadillos, raccoons, and even alligators.
Panthers became Florida's official state animal in 1982.

Scientists say that people can protect themselves from cell phone radiation. One way is to use a headset instead of talking directly into a cell phone. Or, for an even simpler solution, people can make shorter calls.
When the first cell phones were sold, they all had the same ring. Today, most cell phones can be made to ring one of several different tones. But at least one cell phone manufacturer plans to change that.
Nokia plans to start making phones that play pop tunes when they ring. Users could choose tunes by the Spice Girls, Enrique Iglesias, Lenny Kravitz, and many other artists.
By choosing pop tunes instead of the standard ringing sound, cell phone users can program their phones to match their personalities and moods, explained a company spokesperson.

12,"HI! MY NAME IS PAM POLLSTER. This is my pet parakeet, Polly. We live in Polling Place. Polly is a smart bird. In fact, she's so smart, she can count very high numbers. This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
. The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
. A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
. That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
. Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's As Easy As One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
. The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
. The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
. We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.
? Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

In each episode, adult contestants are quizzed on a series of questions from their elementary school days. The grown-ups tackle questions in various subjects, including math, science, geography, and social studies. The player's goal is to answer 10 questions plus a bonus correctlyand then take home $1 million!
But the show has a twist: The players are not alone. Five fifth graders appear on each episode to lend a hand. The kids have their favorite subjects. Ten-year-old Kyle Collier from Los Angeles, California, is fond of math, reading, and history.
The show offers up its share of embarrassment for the grown-ups. If a contestant drops out or answers incorrectly and isn't ""saved"" by a fifth grader, the player must face the camera and say, ""I'm not smarter than a fifth grader."" The program airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

The Mercury missions were the first attempts by NASA, the U.S. space agency, to send a human into space. The rocket missions took place from 1961 to 1963. During the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union competed to build the best space program. That period was called the space race. Tia interviewed her grandfather, Clark Presler, about his role in the 1961 Mercury 3 mission, during which astronaut Alan B. Shepard Jr. became the first American in space.
What do you remember from your experiences in the Navy?
I remember being part of the pickup crew [aboard the U.S.S.
] when the first manned space capsule returned to Earth. It was May 5, 1961. The name of the [rocket] was the Mercury-Redstone 3.
What was the purpose of this mission?
NASA wanted to send a man into orbit and back safely. His name was Alan B. Shepard Jr.
The capsule reached [an altitude of] about 187.45 kilometers, which is 114.61 miles.
The orbit flight lasted only 15 minutes.

How did you pick up Mr. Shepard?
Well, we lifted the capsule up on the chain. Alan was standing up on it, hanging on to the chain. He came out without a single scratch on his body.
At first, I thought this project would be easy, but after the interview I knew I had to learn what this was all about. So later that day I asked Grandpa to explain this to me. After that, it sounded a lot clearer, and it's fun having a member of your family actually do something, well, famous.

Swain recently made history as the first person to swim the entire length of the Columbia River. In July 2003, the Oregon man ended a yearlong journey to raise awareness about pollution in that river. His 1,243-mile trip began in Canada and ended where the river meets the ocean-the Pacific Ocean.
Why did he do it? ""Every waterway needs a champion,"" Swain told
. ""I learned as much as I could about the river so I could see what I could do to clean it up.""
In 1805, explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were journeying west to find a passage to the Pacific Ocean. At that time, they described the Columbia River as clear, free flowing, and teeming with, or full of, salmon.
The Columbia River has changed since the days of Lewis and Clark's journey. Today, it is ravaged by
, or damage, the air, water, or land. Chemicals and waste from factories and towns contribute to water pollution. The pollution has caused a drop in the river's salmon population.
that have been built along the river mean the Columbia no longer flows freely. The dams are water barriers that provide electricity, control flooding, and carry water to farms.
The pollution in the river inspired Swain to take action. Wearing out seven wetsuits along the way and battling several colds, Swain braved water temperatures as low as 38 degrees. Followed by a boat, he swam between 5 and 25 miles a day through the polluted water.
""The Columbia River is a contaminated beauty,"" Swain told
. ""It runs through some of the most majestic landscapes on Earth.""
Despite the pollution, Swain is hopeful about the future of the river. During his journey, he spoke with nearly 13,000 people, including 8,000 schoolchildren, about keeping the river clean.
""With all the affection for the river, we have a chance to turn the [pollution problem] around,"" Swain said. ""Kids know that they want clean water.""
Earlier last year, Swain received the International Earth Day Award for protecting the Columbia River. And he hasn't finished making a splash yet! Later this year, he plans to swim in Lake Champlain, which borders Vermont and New York, the Hudson River in New York, and the Charles River in Boston.
How will Swain celebrate Earth Day on April 22? ""I will be in an East Coast waterway on Earth Day,"" he promised.
Each year, people celebrate Earth Day on April 22. They participate in community activities and care for the environment.
This year, the Earth Day theme is ""Water for Life."" Here are some ways experts say that kids can help protect water:
You can conserve water by turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth.
Organize a beach or river cleanup. Beach garbage, such as plastic rings, can get tangled around sea creatures and injure or harm them.
Make sure to put trash in its proper place-not in the water or down a drain.
What does Swain mean when he refers to the river as a ""contaminated beauty""?

The two wolves are part of a program to bring wolves back to Arizona and New Mexico. Until about 1900, the Mexican gray wolf lived in both states. Some of the wolves ate cattle and attacked people.

The researchers spotted the new species off the coast of Papua, a province on one of the more than 13,500 islands that make up Indonesia. The area, Birds Head Seascape, is one of the worlds most diverse marine regions.
""These Papuan reefs are literally species factories,"" says Mark Erdmann of Conservation International, who led the expedition. Many of the species are believed to be

Birds Head Seascape is part of Asias ""Coral Triangle."" The Triangle covers about 70,000 square miles in the Indian Ocean. It is home to more than 1,200 species of fish and almost 600 kinds of reef-building corals.

Japanese scientists introduced ASIMO (ah-SEE-moh), the world's first stair-climbing robot, in 2000. The 4-foot, 115-pound ASIMO's many talents include walking, holding objects, speaking Japanese, and recognizing faces. ASIMO recently finished a world tour. The tour included several stops in U.S. cities so kids and adults could learn more about it.
Like ASIMO, QRIO (KYOOR-ee-oh), can talk and recognize faces. QRIO, which was unveiled in Japan in December 2003, can also run, jump, throw a ball, dance, and even belt out a tune.
In March, QRIO conducted Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in Japan. Before the rehearsal in front of a live audience, the robot grumbled, ""I'm feeling nervous.""
Today, robots come in all shapes and sizes. Many robots are used in factories. They help build cars, inspect computer parts, and package food. Robots speed up production on assembly lines and help save companies both time and money.
Robots also perform tasks that are difficult or dangerous for humans. Robots have explored the far reaches of space and traveled into active volcanoes.
that when robots were first introduced in the 1960s, they performed only jobs that were ""dirty, difficult, and dangerous."" That, however, is starting to change. Today's engineers hope that the new breed of humanoid robots will improve people's lives.
Many people are excited that humanoid robots may one day be able to lift people confined to beds or wheelchairs. The robots may also be able to help elderly people with chores such as vacuuming and taking out the garbage. Some people, however, worry that robots may take away jobs that are now performed by humans.
Although the humanoid robots have been busy making public appearances, they aren't for sale yet. If you really want a robot that will clean your room and help out with chores, you still have to wait a bit longer.

These findings show that important inventions do not have to be complicated. ""In today's high-tech society, we thought people would be voting for the high-tech inventions,"" said Kristin Joyce, a spokesperson at MIT. ""The results show that simple, low-tech inventions are important to people.""
The toothbrush has a long history, dating back to the 15th century. According to the American Dental Association, the first toothbrush was invented in 1498. To make the brush, a Chinese emperor placed hog bristles in a bone handle.

And they're off! Teams of specially trained dogs are racing to the finish line across one of the toughest terrains in the world.
Along a jagged trail of snow and ice, the teams battle Alaska's below-zero temperatures. They are competing in the Iditarod (igh-DIT-ah-rod) Trail Sled Dog Race, which kicked off on March 6.
The Iditarod is the longest sled dog race in the world. This year, about 90 sled dog teams are running the roughly 1,110-mile route.
The race, now in its 32nd year, starts in the city of Anchorage and ends in the city of Nome. The stretch of land the teams must cross is almost equal to the distance from New York City to Miami.
A team of 12 to 16 dogs tow each sled. It can take more than two weeks for teams to complete the race. In 2002, a record holder completed the race in 8 days, 22 hours, 46 minutes, and 2 seconds.

Not surprisingly, dog mushing is Alaska's state sport. Before mushing became a popular sport, dog teams served as an important form of transportation.
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, miners discovered gold in Alaska. Thousands of people traveled there for the gold rush.
During that time, sled dogs helped people get from place to place and transported gold, mail, and supplies. ""Dog teams were important to settling Alaska during this time,"" race director Joanne Potts told

Troubled waters are ahead for the world's fish. Those finned creatures and shellfish, such as crabs and clams, may be a rare sight by 2048, according to a fouryear study. The study, recently published in the journal
was conducted by a team of 14 researchers in four countries.
If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
The study warns that ocean life is being wiped out because of overfishing and pollution.
Global warming (a rise in Earth's temperatures) and habitat loss are also to blame for the decline in seafood.
Although the world's sea life is in serious danger, it's not too late to reverse the problem, says the study's lead author, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. The researchers have called for measures to protect current fish populations, such as reducing large-scale fishing and pollution. ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we don't change things,"" Worm told reporters.
The loss of ocean life will cause more than just a shortage of seafood. It could spell disaster for ecosystems too. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that work together as a unit to live. A declining fish population would cause a disaster up and down the food chain. Larger animals, such as seals and dolphins, depend on fish for food. Without enough fish to eat, those animals would be in trouble.

If someone tells you that good posture is important, that person is referring to the position of your body when you stand, sit, or walk. Carrying around too much weight in your backpack can force you to bend forward. Slouching over can round your shoulders and cause your upper back to curve.
Over time, the extra stress on your back can create posture problems. Some doctors think those problems may lead to neck and back pain.
Thirteen children, ages 8 and 9, participated in the backpack study. They walked about 1,130 feet. That is about the average length of a child's walk to school. The kids walked with backpacks that weighed 9 to 13 pounds. The children also walked without backpacks.
The study's researchers found that the heavier the backpack load, the more children bent down to support its weight. Afterward, some kids complained that their lower backs and shoulders hurt.
Heidi Orloff, one of the researchers, said that she could tell when the backpacks were too heavy or the kids were tired. ""The kids' chins drop to their chests,"" she told
An estimated 40 million school-age children in the United States use backpacks. Some health groups say that more than half of those students may be carrying backpacks heavy enough to affect their posture.
When worn correctly, backpacks have many benefits. They have lots of compartments that help you stay organized. Compared with shoulder bags, backpacks are a better way to carry around the items you need for school. Your body's strongest muscles-in the back and stomach-support the weight of a backpack. A shoulder bag often puts strain unevenly on your body.
However, most health experts recommend that kids carry backpacks that are no more than 15 percent of their body weight. That means a 70-pound student should wear a backpack that weighs less than 10 1/2 pounds. Orloff also said that spot checks around the country show that many children are carrying backpacks that weigh between 20 and 25 pounds. Now, that's quite a burden!
Below, you'll find some tips to help ease your load. Your back will thank you!
Choose a backpack that is the right size for your body.
Use both shoulder straps and fasten the waist strap to balance the weight evenly.
Adjust the shoulder straps so that the backpack is close to your body.
Pack only what you need and place the heaviest items closest to the center of your back.
What are other ways you can help improve your posture?
That means you should bend at the knees when you pick up your backpack.

President Bush's antiterrorism program has included removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and restoring freedom to the country. He has also worked to stop terrorist groups in Afghanistan.

If you are like many kids, you surf the Internet, write e-mails, and use instant messaging to contact your friends. You probably listen to your favorite songs on a portable CD player. You might even take pictures and send them to otherswith a cell phone!
Would you believe that 25 years ago computers, CDs, and cell phones as you know them didn't exist? In fact, much of the technology you use today was very different then.
A group of technology leaders was organized by the Lemelson-MIT Program. Those leaders recently made a list of the top 25 innovations from the last 25 years. An
is a new invention or a new way of improving something.
The items on the list have improved since 1980, according to the group. Each of the chosen items has had ""a direct impact on our everyday lives and could dramatically affect our lives in the future.""
Can you guess which innovation was crowned ""tech king""? The Internet, of course! The Internet took the top spot because it has provided people with access to a world of information.
Coming in second was the cell phone. In 1980, a cell phone was so large that it barely fit in a purse. Before 1980, some computers, which took third place, filled an entire room!
How much has technology changed in the past 25 years? Take a look at a few of the improvements that have been made.
Cell phones weighed about 2 pounds and were almost a foot long. Very few people had one.
Cell phones weigh less than half a pound and are small enough to fit in a coat pocket.

""Congratulations, Mr. President,"" Senator John Kerry said to George W. Bush in a phone call the morning after Election Day last November. In the close election, President Bush had beaten Kerry, his Democratic opponent.

After the speech, huge crowds will line the streets as the president makes his way along Pennsylvania Avenue in a parade from the U.S. Capitol to the White House. That night, the president and his wife, Laura Bush, will attend festive parties called
The oath is the only Inauguration Day event required by law. Every president since George Washington has taken the oath. On April 30, 1789, Washington was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City, which was then the country's capital.
In 1801, Thomas Jefferson was the first president to be inaugurated in Washington, D.C. In 1809, the first organized inaugural ball was held in Washington, D.C., for James Madison. In 1817, James Monroe's inauguration was the first to be held entirely outdoors. Over the years, inauguration traditions have evolved from simple events to elaborate ceremonies.
Since George Washington's time, presidents have used inaugural addresses to unite the country and inspire people. Abraham Lincoln gave his second inaugural speech in 1865, not long before the Civil War ended. He used his speech to draw the country together.
Other presidents' inaugural words are still quoted today. When Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural speech in 1933, the United States was at the height of the Great Depression. That was a time when many people were out of work. He brought promise with his words ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.""
When John F. Kennedy took office in 1961, he encouraged people to help their country. His speech challenged Americans: ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.""
What message will President Bush convey? He will likely continue the message expressed in his victory speech. ""A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation,"" he said. ""We have one country, one Constitution, and one future that binds us. And when we come together and work together, there is no limit to the greatness of America.""
George Washington's second inaugural speech, in 1793, was the shortest on record. At only 135 words, it lasted just eight minutes.
In 1841, William Henry Harrison gave the longest inaugural address. At 8,445 words, it lasted almost two hours!
In 1925, Calvin Coolidge's inaugural speech was the first broadcast on the radio.
Harry S. Truman's speech in 1949 was the first to be shown on television.
After Jimmy Carter was sworn in as president in 1977, he became the first president to walk the parade route instead of riding in a car.
In 1997, Bill Clinton's inauguration was the first to be transmitted over the Internet.
If you were president, what would you say in your inaugural speech?

Scientist Ken Longenecker is on a missionto figure out what is killing the Hawaiian monk seal. ""These guys are on the brink, honestly,"" he recently told reporters while sorting through a pile of stinky fish bones. The bones were all that remained from the meal of a monk seal.
The 600-pound animals are fast disappearing from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, their main
or natural home. Longenecker and other researchers think the seals are not getting enough food, and they are desperately trying to figure out why. ""The clock is ticking,"" says scientist Jen Palmer.
Between the 1950s and 1970s, the monk seal population plummeted. The major threats were habitat loss and deadly runins with fishing gear. Today, there are about 1,200 monk seals, but experts fear that the population will dip below 1,000 in the next five years. Although the seals habitat is now protected by law, their numbers have failed to rebound.
However, scientists are now looking at the seals diet in the hopes it will give them clues about how to save the animals. Part of Longeneckers job is to figure out what the animals are eating. Other scientists are also tracking monk seals and monitoring their habitat for pollution.

A recent study shows that how kids answer those questions tells a lot about whether they are headed for trouble. The study says kids who spend their free time aimlessly often get into trouble.
The study, called the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, was funded by the federal government. More than 90,000 kids between the ages of 12 and 18 took part in the study. Those kids attended 134 different U.S. schools. The study followed them from 1994 to 2000.
About half of the kids in the study said they were not involved in dangerous activities. But 25 percent said they had tried a cigarette, 26 percent said they had picked up a gun, and 47 percent said they had tried alcohol.
The study found that kids who spend their free time hanging out with nothing to do, who get poor grades, or who don't talk with their parents are eight times more likely to take part in unhealthful activities later on, such as smoking cigarettes or trying drugs.
Kids who hang out with friends who drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or have tried drugs are likely to do what their friends are doing, said Robert Blum. Blum is one of the doctors who conducted the study. In other words, kids tend to act like their friends, Blum said.
""How young people do at school and what they do with their free time are the most important [ways of predicting] risky behavior,"" said Blum.
Kids should get involved in interesting activities, Blum advised. Instead of hanging out with kids who are already trying what the study calls ""high-risk activities,"" Blum said that kids should play sports, read, talk with parents, or do homework.
The National Longitudinal Study finds that kids who are involved in activities usually don't get into trouble. Here's a story written by a
kid reporter about a few kids who know how to spend their time:
There are a lot of good kids. I know three of them who live in my hometown, Lockport, Illinois.
Amanda Clemmons and Heather Grein are best friends. Recently, they celebrated their birthdays together.
The two girls invited about 60 kids to a birthday party. The girls, however, asked their friends to bring pet supplies instead of presents. Their guests brought leashes, paper towels, pet food, treats, kitty litter, and toys to the party. Amanda and Heather then donated the pet supplies to the TLC Animal Shelter in Homer Township.

President Bush has allowed companies to cut down trees in some national parks. He says that will help prevent the number of wildfires.
The president favors oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He says the new oil source will reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East and will lower the cost of gasoline. He also wants car companies to use hydrogen fuel cells, a clean energy source, to power vehicles.

When Franklin died in 1790, he left money to both cities. Franklin chose those two cities because he was born in Boston and lived most of his life in Philadelphia.
Franklin left the money to help people who need it. ""I wish to be useful even after my death,"" Franklin wrote. He knew that his money would grow in value over time if it was invested right.
Before he died, Franklin made sure that the money would not be wasted. He left specific instructions on how the money should be used.
For the first 100 years, the money was used for loans to young people who wanted to learn technical skills. After the first 100 years, the money was used for education and public works. After 200 years, most of the money was given to the state governments that support each city.
Today, the money Franklin left in his will is worth millions of dollars. It has helped pay for education, equipment for fire departments, and the building of a museum.

, which are shifting curtains of colored light.
When the sun is very active, dark spots, called
, dot the sun's surface. Each day, scientists can see more than 100 sunspots on the sun. Sunspots slowly change shape and move across the sun's surface.
Sunspots have a temperature of 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit (F). That might seem hot, but it is cooler than the rest of the sun's surface, which is a sweltering 10,000 degrees F. Because sunspots are cooler than the rest of the surface, they look dark--almost like shadows.
When the sun is very active, huge explosions can rip across its surface. Those explosions, called
, propel solar material into space. About three or four days after a flare erupts on the sun, the flare may collide with Earth's atmosphere.
When a flare reaches Earth, it can damage satellites orbiting Earth, power stations, and electrical equipment. In July, a huge flare interfered with communication satellites.
The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth.
A car traveling at 55 miles per hour would take 193 years to get from Earth to the sun.
It takes a beam of light eight minutes to travel from the surface of the sun to Earth.
When solar flares reach our planet, they can make gases in Earth's atmosphere glow. The glowing gases form the northern lights.
The northern lights can be many different colors: red, blue, green, or a combination of colors.
Scientists say the best time to see the northern lights is when the sun is active. People in many parts of the United States should be able to see the northern lights in the night sky this fall. People who live in the northern part of the United States have the best chance of seeing the dancing lights. To see them, the sky must be very dark.
senior editor Fran Downey once saw an aurora (the northern lights) while visiting Washington state. ""It began as a dull green light and got brighter and brighter, until it lit up the sky,"" Downey said. ""In the distance, I could hear coyotes howling at the aurora. It was beautiful.""

As if grades weren't enough to worry about, some students now have weight on their minds too. The number of overweight children in the United States has more than doubled in the past 20 years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Being
or severely overweight, can lead to health problems later in life.
As a result, schools in several states, from California to Pennsylvania, have started sending home ""BMI report cards."" Those schools send home a report of a student's
BMI is a calculation of weight and height that tells whether a person is overweight for his or her age.
Should schools send home BMI reports? People on both sides of the debate are weighing in.
Some lawmakers say BMI reports alert parents to their children's health and help combat obesity. In 2003, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee helped launch the first program to report students' BMIs. Obesity rates in that state have since stopped increasing. Pediatrician Joe Thompson helped plan the BMI program for Arkansas schools. He explains that the reports in Arkansas are sent home separately from report cards. ""The misconception is students are being graded on their weight,"" he told
""Just like a school screens for vision or hearing, this is a health approach to raise awareness about a risk.""
Not everyone thinks that reporting students' BMIs is a good idea. Parents have complained that the reports damage their children's self-esteem. Some parents say kids also worry that they are being ""graded"" on their weight. Opponents of BMI reports argue that schools that label students overweight are acting unfairly. The critics point out that many school cafeterias serve fatty foods.

Sugary snacks and high-fat foods are on their way out as schools change their lunch menus.
School lunch will never be the same. Move
over, French fries, extra-cheese pizza, and chocolate chip cookies. Cafeterias in some schools across the country are making over their menus. Lunch trays are now filled with yogurts, sandwiches on whole-wheat bread, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Vending machines now offer nuts, bottled water, and granola bars.
In 2005, 17 states passed new nutrition laws to limit unhealthy food in schools. Texas removed deep-fried foods from school menus. Connecticut banned the sale of soft drinks and high-fat snacks in vending machines, school stores, and cafeterias. New Jersey passed one of the toughest school nutrition laws in the country.

School lunches arent entirely to blame for the obesity crisis, but many experts believe they are a good place to start.

Educators and lawmakers hope that providing good food choices in school will lead to making good food choices at home. (See ""

Not getting enough exercise is also to blame for kids putting on the pounds. Exercise burns calories. A
is a measure of the amount of energy from food. Kids today arent moving as much as they did in the past because they spend more time playing video games, watching television, and using computers.
Schools are becoming creative with physical education. Gym class isnt just about team sports anymore. Schools are finding new ways of encouraging physical activity in kids, from karate to yoga. Kids are also learning about physical fitnesshow to lift weights, monitor their heart rates, and keep food journals.
""A lack of physical activity is a huge problem in all parts of our lives,"" Sheryl Stanley of PEforlife, an organization that promotes physical education in schools, told
""Kids need to be active. Get out there and play.""
The U.S. government is helping kids get a handle on healthy eating. The U.S. Department of Agriculture released a new food pyramid to help kids make better food choices and encourage exercise. The pyramid focuses on a diet of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and calcium-rich foods, such as milk and cheese. It also recommends that kids eat only a small amount of oils and fats. The child climbing the pyramid reminds kids to do something active for at least 60 minutes each daybike ride, walk the dog, play a favorite sport, or dance!

New Mexico Rep. Ben Rios wants Gov. Gary Johnson to pardon Billy the Kid, who used several names, including William H. Bonney, Henry McCarty, and Henry Bonney.
In 1878, Billy the Kid shot and killed Sheriff William Brady. In April 1881, the Kid was sentenced to hang for shooting Brady. Before the sentence could be carried out, however, Billy escaped from jail, killing two deputies. After Billy escaped, Sheriff Pat Garrett tracked him down and shot him to death in July 1881.
The descendants of Sheriff Brady say that pardoning the Kid would be another crime. Bennett Brady, the sheriff's great-grandson, said, ""He doesn't deserve pardoning.""
Governor Johnson agrees. Diane Kinderwater, a spokesperson for the governor, told
that Johnson would not pardon the Kid. Kinderwater said the governor had told her, ""No, Billy the Kid is a murderer. He killed three law enforcement officers.""

No person was behind the camera's lens. The camera was triggered by motion and heat from the passing cat.
Scientists from the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York have placed about 30 such cameras in trees throughout the tropical forest of Belize (beh-LEEZ). That is a country in Central America.
The forest is also the site of the world's first jaguar

Belize has a healthy number of jaguars. The wildlife group estimates that about 14 jaguars live within a 55-square-mile area there. The cameras are helping researchers count the number of jaguars within certain areas of Belize and other places where jaguars roam.
Today, jaguars can be found from northern Argentina in South America up through Mexico. At one time, they lived as far north as New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. However, these powerful cats are now considered extinct in the United States.

Although the cats face many threats, they have a hopeful future. Researchers have been educating ranchers and helping them build electric fences to keep their livestock from wandering into the wild.
Using cameras, scientists are keeping a watchful eye on these threatened cats and learning more about their range. As Rabinowitz points out, ""In some areas, jaguars are decreasing. In other areas, they are making a comeback.""

For most of the last century, the flag that President Lincoln had touched was missing. This summer, officials at the Connecticut Historical Society said that they had discovered the flag in the society's basement. How did a flag from one of the darkest days in American history wind up in the historical society's basement?
After the shooting, the flag that Lincoln had grasped was given to a Civil War veteran from Connecticut. He gave it to his son, who gave it to the historical society in 1922. The flag ended up in the basement, where it lay, forgotten, for 76 years.
In 1998, a society librarian was in the basement. ""I looked down and saw what looked like a flag in a box,"" the librarian said.
The flag was in tatters, so the society spent the next three years repairing it and making sure it was the flag that our 16th president had touched.
Now visitors can see the flag at the society's museum. ""The flag makes history real,"" Susan Schoelwer, of the historical society, told

I'm for common sense restrictions on guns. I think that we should have tougher laws against guns falling into the hands of the wrong people. I think that we should have mandatory child-safety trigger locks. I think that we should have a photo license ID requirement for the purchase of a new handgun. I think that we should have a limit on the number of handguns per month that could be bought--a limit of one.

Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.

, or the exact point where the earthquake struck, was about 65 miles off the coast of El Salvador in the Pacific Ocean.
Officials in El Salvador said more than 700 people were killed and many people were still missing days after the quake. Thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed. As a result, many people were left without shelter.
San Salvador, the nation's capital, was the scene of terrible destruction. Much of the damage was caused by mudslides that buried many buildings.
To help the survivors of the earthquake, dozens of countries, including Japan, Spain, and the United States, rushed teams of rescue workers to El Salvador. The rescuers searched for people buried under mud and rubble from collapsed buildings.
To clear the wreckage, rescue workers used bulldozers, shovels, and their hands. Rescuers also used specially trained dogs, which have a keen sense of smell, to locate victims buried by the quake.
Thick layers of mud made rescue work difficult. ""Mud seals off everything considered essential for survival, such as oxygen,"" explained Gary O'Shea, director of the International Rescue Corps of the United Kingdom.
In addition to sending teams of rescue workers, many countries sent money, food, clothing, water, and medical supplies to help in the recovery efforts. (Ask your teacher how you can help the earthquake victims in El Salvador.)

When Earnhardt's car, painted with the driver's well-known number 3, slammed into the wall, he was traveling at 180 miles per hour. According to doctors who examined Earnhardt, the racing legend died of a head injury caused by the crash.
Many safety experts say that if Earnhardt had been wearing a HANS device, he might have survived the crash.
The device is a rigid collar that slips over a driver's uniform and rests on his or her shoulders. Two straps connect the helmet to the collar, locking the helmet in place. The device is designed to prevent a driver's head from whipping forward or side to side in an accident.
NASCAR driver Robby Gordon ordered a HANS device immediately after the race in which Earnhardt was killed. ""As a direct result of what happened at the [Daytona] 500, I have ordered the support system,"" said Gordon.
NASCAR officials say they will look more closely at the device and may require drivers to wear it in the future. Until then, drivers, who are well aware of the risks in their sport, will continue to get behind the wheel.

17 million Americans suffer from asthma. About 5 million kids suffer from asthma.
Each year, more than 3 million kids visit the doctor's office because of asthma attacks.
When you run hard and play hard, you may have trouble catching your breath. Some kids, however, lose their breath even when they're not running or playing. Those kids have
, a disease that makes it hard to breathe.
For many years, scientists have known that cigarette smoke, dog and cat
, dust mites, and cockroaches can trigger asthma attacks. Dander is tiny bits of fur and skin. Now scientists have added a new culprit to that list--mouse dander.
Scientists studied dust samples from 608 U.S. homes with children ages 4 to 9 who suffered from asthma. The scientists found many things in the dust, including evidence of mice. About 95 percent of the homes had at least one room that had mouse dander.
The scientists then tested the kids in each of the homes to see if mouse dander triggered asthma attacks in them. The dander triggered attacks in 18 out of every 100 kids.
As a result of those tests, Dr. Robert Wood of Johns Hopkins University concluded that mice trigger many asthma attacks. In fact, he said, the ""mouse is second in line [after the cockroach in causing asthma attacks].""
Mouse dander was found in many of the houses, even though not all of them had mice. Sometimes, kids tracked dander from mice and other animals into their homes when they came in from outside. Sometimes, the dander was from mice that had been in the home in the past.
Daniel, who lives in Clarksville, Maryland, suffers from asthma. Last year, scientists collected and studied dust from his home. The scientists found cat dander in the dust, even though his family didn't own a cat. It was cat dander that was triggering Daniel's asthma attacks, said Daniel's doctor.
To keep cat dander out of their home, Daniel and his mother frequently wash the floors, walls, and other surfaces. As a result, Daniel's mother said Daniel hasn't had an asthma attack in the last year.
Many kids who suffer from asthma might be able to breathe more easily if they could find ways to keep the dander of mice, cats, and other kinds of animals out of their homes.

348,"As firefighters battle the flames, how do some fires help Mother Nature?
Whoosh! Within seconds, a spark sets off large flames. The flames of a wildfire tear through a forest, destroying thousands of acres of trees and brush and threatening the homes of people and animals.
From California to Colorado and from Alaska to Arizona, firefighters have been battling thousands of wildfires this year. Wildfire season began in June and will last through November. So far, the flames have destroyed more than 3 million acres in the United Statesan area about the size of New Jersey!
The states in red show where the most wildfires have occurred this year.
Most wildfires are started naturally, either by lightning or from the sun's heat. Others are accidentally started by careless humans who leave campfires burning.
Hot, dry weather has caused most of this season's wildfires to spread. ""This year is unique,"" Rose Davis, an official at the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center, told
. Davis explained that the Northwest is suffering a
. A drought is a long period of dry weather with little rain. In the Southwest, heavy rains in the spring caused a lot of new grass to grow. The new grass burns quickly when it dries out.
Firefighters have been fighting the scorching flames from the ground and the air. Specially trained firefighters called
parachute from planes or helicopters to reach
fires. Because smoke jumpers leap into out-of-the-way areas, they carry enough food and water with them to survive for several days.
Although wildfires can be very dangerous, they are not all bad. In areas where few people live, officials monitor the wildfires. Sometimes, officials allow them to burn because the fires help the environment and keep forests healthy. ""If fires are going to spread to people's homes and property, we have to put them out,"" smoke jumper Lori Messenger told
Wildfires are like nature's housekeeperand forests come back to life after fires. ""Fire is a natural part of our forests,"" says Messenger. ""The fires kill the less healthy, diseased trees. They clean out the brush to make space for animals to graze on the new grass that grows.""
Some plants also need heat from a fire to help them release their seeds, which grow into new plants after a fire. Fire is nature's way of recycling dead plants into the soil. The dead plants help return nutrients to the soil.
Although some animals die, many creatures have ways of protecting themselves. Large animals, such as deer, moose, and buffalo, head to safety. Small animals, such as snakes, toads, and mice, burrow in the ground.
""It's important to realize that fires are an important part of what happens in a forest,"" says Messenger. ""It's a complicated balance, and people who manage the forest have to make good decisions about what fires will be fought and what fires will be left to burn.""
What qualities do you think a person needs to be a smoke jumper?

Dos Pilas was located south of both cities. Dos Pilas had been founded by the ruler of Tikal as a military outpost. The brother of Tikal's ruler ran the outpost.
At one point in the war, Calakmul took control of Dos Pilas. Calakmul's warriors spared the life of the ruler of Dos Pilas, so he changed sides. He attacked and defeated his brother in Tikal.

Fourth grader Blake Wichtowski told people at last year's Kids' Summit that wild blue lupine flowers would help the endangered Karner blue butterfly. Officials from New York are turning this young conservationist's idea into a reality. A conservationist is a person who helps save wildlife and other natural resources.
Blue lupine is the only food that Karner caterpillars will eat. Land development has destroyed much of their habitat.
With the help of the Seneca Park Zoo in Rochester and other officials, Blake's fourth grade class and a class at another elementary school will plant seeds for a blue lupine garden near the local airport.
Blake said it's important to help endangered species because ""every part of life has its place in the ecosystem."" An ecosystem is made up of plants and animals that depend on one another for survival.
When he grows up, Blake plans to be either a zoo veterinarian or an entomologist, a scientist who studies insects. Either way, he's off to a good start!

, which happen when power companies turn off electricity in an area for a short time.
Several factors contributed to the shortage, said Lawrence J. Makovich, a scientist who studies energy use. One problem is that California doesn't have enough power plants to supply all the electricity the Sunshine State needs. In addition, prices have risen for the fuels used in power plants to produce electricity, Makovich said.
The energy crisis may become worse this summer as Californians turn on air conditioners. According to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the state will probably be 10 percent short of the amount of electricity it needs.

Many states are taking steps to solve the shortage. In California, Gov. Gray Davis is urging people to save energy.

CIS is just one of hundreds of schools in the United States that are going green. A
is built with recycled and environmentally friendly materials. Green schools are designed to use less energy than traditional school buildings.
The majority of the energy supply in the United States comes from the burning of
such as oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels were formed from the remains of prehistoric animals and plants. People use fossil fuels when they drive their cars, heat their homes, and power farms, factories, and cities.
Though people depend on fossil fuels, those energy sources have their drawbacks. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air and releases gases that contribute to global warmingthe gradual rise in Earth's average temperature.
Hoover Dam generates clean energy by using water to spin turbines.
Fossil fuels are gradually being used up. To conserve them, scientists are looking to
sources. Renewable energy is power from sources that can't be used up and do not pollute the environment. Water, wind, and solar power are types of renewable energy.
President George W. Bush announced an energy plan that calls on lawmakers to ensure that ecofriendly fuels are developed and made easily available to Americans. Gas is a fossil fuel used in cars, and the price to fill up a gas tank is rising. Gas costs about $3 a gallon in some parts of the United States.
At CIS, students are excited for construction to begin on their new school building. ""I think the school is going to be a lot better,"" Drew Barsody, 10, told
""I'm looking forward to seeing the solar panels.""
These wind turbines convert wind into electricity.
Here are some common environmentally friendly energy alternatives.
Solar Power: Solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat and electricity. California and Arizona are two states that use solar power. One drawback of solar power is that energy can't be collected if the sun isn't shining.
Energy produced from windmills is used to generate electricity. The amount of electricity generated from wind has been growing in recent years, tripling since 1998 in the United States. Electricity is produced from wind in 30 states, including California, Texas, and Iowa.

Ethanol is a clean-burning fuel that can power cars. It is created from several sources, such as corn crops. Typically, a small amount of ethanol is combined with gasoline to fuel vehicles. That helps decrease the fuel's cost and harmful emissions.

Queen Nefertiti's name means ""the beautiful one has come."" It is not surprising that she was given such a name. Queen Nefertiti has long been admired for her swanlike neck and high cheekbones.
But Nefertiti was more than just a pretty face. She is believed to have been one of the most powerful women who ever lived. She ruled Egypt more than 3,000 years ago. Egypt is a country in Africa.
Mysteriously, no one knows how Queen Nefertiti died. Her remains have never been found--until now, perhaps.
led by Joann Fletcher uncovered three mummies in a tomb in Egypt. (Archaeologists are scientists who dig up ancient objects and study them to learn about the past.) Fletcher believes that one of the mummies is Queen Nefertiti.
Modern science is helping Fletcher prove her idea and identify the face of the mummy. After X-rays of the mummy were taken, scientists put together a computerized version of what the face would have looked like.
What they discovered was amazing! The re-created face resembles a famous sculpture of Queen Nefertiti that was made during her reign.
""If the mummy is who we think it is, it would certainly help to answer a lot of unanswered questions,"" said Fletcher.
Scientists are quick to point out that the computerized version of the face does not prove that the mummy is Queen Nefertiti. The re-created face, however, isn't the only clue to the past.
There are other pieces of the puzzle that make Fletcher's team think the mummy is Nefertiti. First, the mummy's hair had been shaved off. Nefertiti preferred a shaved head so that her crown would fit tightly. A shaved head also helped her stay cool in Egypt's heat. Second, traces of a wig found next to the mummy matched the kind Nefertiti would have worn.
In addition, the mummy's left earlobe was pierced twice. Statues of Nefertiti show her having a double-pierced ear. The mummy's forehead showed the mark of a tight-fitting band--a sign of royalty. Another clue was the mummy's bent arm, which was broken off. Royalty were usually buried with their arms bent.
Not all scientists are convinced that the mummy is Nefertiti.
""If the mummy is female and if it is royal, then you still do not necessarily have Nefertiti,"" one archaeologist told
Another scientist from Egypt expressed doubts that the mummy is even a female. He said that both men and women could have double-pierced ears.
But Fletcher believes that she has found the long-lost queen and has returned Nefertiti to her rightful place in history.
The mummy which may be Nefertiti lies in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. That is an ancient burial ground for royalty. It is located in the desert, south of Cairo (the capital of Egypt) and along the west bank of the Nile River.
Scientists are starting to piece together more about the legendary queen's life. Nefertiti is now one of the most popular faces from ancient history, but that wasn't always the case.
, ruled Egypt together and had many enemies. Pharaoh is a name given to Egyptian kings.
The pharaoh and Nefertiti were disliked because they challenged the religion of the time. They began to worship one god instead of many gods. As part of their new religion, they moved from the city of Thebes and built a new capital in the heart of the desert. The new capital was called Akhetaton (ah-keh-TAHT-uhn).
(The modern name is Amarna.) They also made many changes to the style of art and architecture of the time.
Many historians think that when Nefertiti's husband died, she became pharaoh.

For the 13-year-old bargain shopper, clipping coupons is the secret to saving. She's gotten hundreds of dollars worth of products free!
""If you just take a little time, it can save you a lot of money,"" Lisa said. The Texas teen collects coupons from newspapers, magazines, and the Internet. Even her neighbors pass along coupons to her. Lisa likes to use them on days when stores double and triple coupon values.
This coupon girl doesn't keep all her bargains to herself, though. Instead, she donates the groceries that she buys with her coupons to a local food bank.
How did Lisa come up with her bargain-hunting idea? Earlier this year, Lisa's mother challenged her to buy $50 worth of products with $25. Lisa did much better than that. At last count, Lisa bought more than $1,120 worth of products without spending anything.
What's her best bargain? Lisa got a bottle of sunscreen that costs $8.99 free with a special offer called a rebate. Now, that's an eye for a bargain!

The caption under Samuel Alitos college yearbook photo reads: ""Sam intends to go to law school and eventually to warm a seat on the Supreme Court."" His dream may soon come true. Alito, 55, is President George W. Bushs latest pick for a position on the countrys highest court.
The president chose Alito to replace Justice Sandra Day OConnor, who announced her retirement in July. In 1981, OConnor became the first woman in history to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.
Bush had first nominated Harriet Miers, a White House lawyer, to take OConnors place. However, Miers withdrew her nomination after coming under fire partly for a lack of experience. Miers had never been a judge. OConnor is serving on the Supreme Court until a replacement is confirmed.
Alito grew up in New Jersey in a family that valued learning. Both of his parents were teachers. He has argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court, losing just two.
As a federal judge, Alito has also served on a lower court for the past 15 years in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. With 29 years of legal experience, Bush says, Alito ""has more prior judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in more than 70 years.""
To become a Supreme Court justice, a nominee must be approved by the Senate. A series of Senate confirmation hearings, where Alito will answer questions about his views on laws, are set to begin on January 9, 2006. Senate leaders hope to have a final confirmation vote on January 20.

684,"Polar bears reign as the kings of the Arctic. Yet there is trouble underfoot for those snow-colored creatures and other wildlife as their icy habitat slips away.
The Arctic is the icy, cold region located around the North Pole. In November, scientists from eight countries released a report saying that the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of Earth.
In the report, scientists predict that at least half of the summer sea ice in the Arctic will melt by the end of this century. The scientists blame
for the Arctic thaw. That is the gradual rise in Earth's temperature.
Arctic ice is melting at an alarming rate. Winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen between 4 and 7 degrees Fahrenheit. During the past 30 years, polar bears have lost more than 386,000 square miles of ice--an area larger than the states of Texas and Arizona combined.
More than 20,000 polar bears live in the Arctic regions. Disappearing sea ice threatens polar bears and other cold-weather animals. Polar bears use the ice as a bridge to hunt seals, their primary source of food.
As the sea ice disappears, the mighty
, or hunters, catch fewer seals and risk starvation. Seals also depend on the ice to rest and give birth. Scientists fear that polar bears, seals, and other animals that rely on the ice could be wiped out by the end of the century if the warm-up continues.
Some of the 4 million people who live in the Arctic have also found themselves on shaky ground. As the frozen land thaws, buildings and roads have weakened.
Inuits (IH-nyoo-wets), a group of native people in the region, fish and hunt Arctic animals, including polar bears. They depend on those animals as their main source of food. Inuit hunters are also falling through thinning ice.
Rising sea levels have forced some people in the Arctic to move their coastal villages inland. The report warns that melting ice could cause sea levels to continue to rise--up to 3 feet by the end of this century. Towns and cities along coastlines around the world could flood as a result.
The warm-up also affects other parts of the planet. Arctic ice and snow reflect heat from the sun into space. Without the ice and snow, the planet would be much warmer. ""The polar regions are essentially the Earth's air conditioner,"" said scientist Michael McCracken.
Who cranked up the thermostat on the Arctic? Scientists say human activity is to blame for global warming. People use
, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to power cars, heat homes, and create electricity.
Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Burning those fuels gives off gases that trap heat from the sun and add to the overheating of the Earth.
To protect life in the Arctic, scientists say people need to limit their use of fossil fuels. ""Climate change is not just about the future,"" said scientist Pal Prestud, who worked on the report. ""It is happening now.""
The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Those gases collect in a layer and trap heat from the sun. The layer of gases is like the windows in a greenhouse. The process is called the
Too much of those gases in the air causes temperatures to rise. That is known as

Jesse Coltrane, a 15-year-old student at Camden's Promise, says that kids can help people in need through school and community projects. Like Jesse, thousands of students will be working in their schools and communities to make the world a better place during National Volunteer Week (April 27 through May 3).
This year will mark the 30th anniversary of National Volunteer Week. The theme of this year's week is ""Celebrate Volunteers-The Spirit of America."" As part of this year's week, kids across the United States will be taking part in service projects. Many kids will also participate in community events to honor volunteers.
""When you volunteer, you help America become strong. You become an instant champion!""
""Volunteers learn important skills like teamwork and responsibility,"" said Melissa Helmbrecht, founder of the volunteer organization Champions of Hope.
Champions of Hope is made up of more than 650,000 kids across the country and includes Jesse Coltrane and other students at Camden's Promise. Champions of Hope participants across the country are volunteering to collect food for the hungry, clean parks, and raise money for firefighters.
Champions of Hope started a United Day of Service on September 11, 2002, one year after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. On that day,
star Sean Astin spoke to youths gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., about the importance of civic action. Astin plays hobbit Sam Gamgee in the movie. Astin told

Sixth-grade student Matthew Malon from Illinois attended the September 11, 2002, rally and has collected food for homeless shelters. Astin's speech on volunteering moved him.
Some students from Camden's Promise also attended the rally. Students Damian Johnson, Keith Bennett, and Tashay Moody agree that it's important for kids to volunteer.As 16-year-old Damian Johnson puts it: ""[Volunteering] makes me feel like I have made an impact on people who don't have as much as I have.""
""How can I make a difference in the world if I'm just an ordinary kid?"" Thirteen-year-old author Sondra Clark answers that question in her fourth book,

The action doesn't stop for actor Sean Astin when the cameras stop rolling. Astin, one of the stars of The Lord of the Rings movies and the father of two young children, is inspiring kids to make the world a better place.
In January, Astin was appointed to the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation. President George W. Bush created the council to encourage volunteerism. He has urged Americans to make a lifetime commitment to volunteering.
Astin tells kids that it's easy to make a difference. As a teenager in Santa Monica, California, he volunteered his time helping preschool students cross the street. He told Weekly Reader, ""I remember feeling that because I was helping someone, I had an incredible responsibility, and it felt great. It made me a better person.""

Keiko became famous after starring in the movie Free Willy. After the movie, thousands of people donated money to have Keiko moved from his tank in Mexico to the protected bay in Iceland.
The problem, said the scientists who work with Keiko, was that he wouldn't stay with the other killer whales, or orcas. Every time Keiko's handlers took him out into the ocean for a ""walk,"" he returned to his pen.

The zoo reopened its doors over the summer. It welcomed its first visitors since the war with Iraq began in March. Today, the Baghdad zoo is home to about 80 animals. In addition to the lions, the zoo's animals include brown bears, monkeys, cheetahs, and rare birds.
Before the war began, this zoo in Baghdad was one of the largest in the Middle East. More than 600 animals were housed there.
When fighting began, the zoo was turned into a battleground. At one point, the zoo's population dropped to as few as six animals.
Many animals died and others were stolen, especially many of the birds. The cages of other animals were left open. Animals, such as lions and camels, roamed the streets. Other animals, locked in their cages, were left without food and water.
U.S. soldiers were the first people to come to the animals' rescue. They secured the zoo, found some of the wild creatures, and helped feed them. Since then, wildlife groups have helped nurse many of the sick animals back to health.
To people in Iraq, the reopened zoo is a sign of hope for their country. ""The Iraqi people see it as a small but important step in returning the country to [normal],"" said one wildlife rescue worker.

602,"Something to Go Nuts About: New Treatment May Help Kids With Peanut Allergies
Peanuts may seem harmless, but to some kids they mean trouble. About one and a half million Americans are allergic to peanuts. Between 50 and 100 people, mostly kids, die each year from peanut allergies.
For kids with peanut allergies, help may be on the way in the form of a new drug called TNX-901. Monthly shots of TNX-901 are not a cure, but they may save lives. Results suggest that the drug reduces the chance of a serious allergic reaction if peanuts are eaten accidentally.
Eating just the tiniest amount of peanuts can make kids with peanut allergies very sick. For some of those kids, an allergic reaction can occur from just touching or smelling peanuts. Symptoms include stomach pain, hives, and tightness in the throat.
""I get an itchy rash all over my body when I eat peanuts, so I hope the new injection will help,"" said an 11-year-old girl.
It may be years before the treatment is available to the public. More testing needs to be done before the drug is approved. Researcher Donald Leung said the new drug could ""help lift a cloud of fear that people with peanut allergies live under every time they eat."" That is something that kids with peanut allergies won't find nutty.
These eight foods are the cause of most food allergies:
tree nuts (such as walnuts and cashews)
About 7 million Americans have food allergies. People can be allergic to almost any food.
If you are allergic to any food, it is important to read labels carefully. Always ask an adult if you are not sure about what is in your food.

A spectacular tradition of college football takes place before every Florida State University (FSU) home game. A student dressed as the famous Seminole leader Chief Osceola (ah-see-OH-luh) charges down the field on a horse. The student launches a flaming spear into the air, which lands midfield. The fans, a sea of red and gold, cheer wildly.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tried to end that tradition. The NCAA is the organization that oversees college sports. The NCAA banned the use of Native American names, logos, or
by sports teams after the regular season. A mascot is a symbol that represents a sports team.
Seminole tribes in Florida and Oklahoma objected to the ban. The NCAA then removed FSU from its list of universities that are not allowed to use such names and mascots.

Sojourner Truth is best known as an outspoken
someone who worked to end slavery. But what people may not know is that Truth was one of thousands of slaves in the United States who were bought, sold, and forced to do labor in the North.
""Many people are surprised when you talk about slavery in the North,"" Alan Singer, a professor of education at Hofstra University, told
""We associate slavery with the South, even though the biggest importer of slavesafter South Carolinawas New York City.""
Singer and other educators spread the word about slavery in the North. Although there were fewer slaves in the North than in the South, slavery flourished in New York City, northern New Jersey, rural Pennsylvania, and the shipping towns of Connecticut and Rhode Island. In 1771, slaves made up about 12 percent of the population of New York City.
Some slaves in the North were offered freedom to fight for the British during the Revolutionary War (17751783). However, slavery wasnt abolished in the United States until the end of the Civil War (18611865). New Jersey, for example, reported 18 slaves in 1860.
Singer explains that the slave trade helped support the
in many major Northern cities, such as Boston and New York City. The Industrial Revolution was a rapid change in the economy in the 1800s, when factories and powerdriven machines were introduced. Many U.S. businesses got their start with profits from the slave trade and slave-produced goods.
Singer tells students that the effects of slavery linger today through racial prejudice and discrimination. ""Kids see slavery as something that happened in the deep past. I want children to know that we still live with the effects of that slavery society.""
Isabella Baumfree (17971883) was born one of 13 children but never got to know her siblings because they were sold into slavery. She was emancipated, or freed, in 1828. In 1843, she changed her name to Sojourner Truth. She traveled throughout New England and the Midwest, speaking publicly against slavery and in favor of womens rights.

Scientists found the lemurs on Madagascar, an island nation off the southeast coast of Africa. Madagascar is home to more than 30 species of lemurs. Most lemurs are the size of small rodents, but some can grow to be as large as a medium-sized dog. Lemurs are usually
animals, which means they mostly sleep during the day and come out at night.
The discovery surprised scientists. ""It's incredibly rare to discover a new species of primate, let alone three new species,"" said Steven Goodman of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.
Lemurs live only in the island nations of Madagascar and Comoros.
The smallest lemur weighs about 1 ounce.
The newly discovered species live only in the rain forests along Madagascar's west coast. They weigh a few ounces and eat beetles, fruits, and plants.
All lemurs on Madagascar are in trouble, however. Scientists fear that lemurs are in danger of becoming extinct.
One threat is from people cutting down the trees in which lemurs live. The trees are being cleared to create farmland. Another threat to lemurs comes from hunters who are trapping the primates for food.
To protect lemurs and the rain forests in which they live, wildlife officials in Madagascar have set up special parks and nature reserves. Loggers and hunters cannot cut down the trees or hunt the animals in the nature reserves.
Scientists hope that the special areas are large enough to protect all the species of lemurs that are living today. Scientists are especially concerned because there may be undiscovered species that need protection. ""So many areas of Madagascar haven't been [explored],"" said Dean Gibson of the Duke University Primate Center. ""I think there are more [species] to find.""

Skateboard class is rolling into schools! For sixth grader Carlos Cervantes, learning to skateboard takes a lot of work, but its worth it. ""[On] the first day of class, I was scared, but I tried it,"" the 12-year-old told
""After two days of practice, I felt more comfortable.""
Carlos is learning to skateboard in an after-school program at West Middle School in Aurora, Colorado. Skateboards are now finding their way into the regular school day as well. Douglass Elementary in nearby Boulder is the first public school in the country to offer skateboarding in gym class.
Douglasss physical education (PE) teacher Richard Cendali starts his skateboarding class by teaching students how to put on their safety gear and how to fall without getting hurt. Then kids start rolling around the gym. ""Sometimes theyre so excited, they fall. Theyre screaming, Im doing it! Im doing it!"" says Cendali, laughing. ""Its such a thrill to see those kids succeed and see their smiles.""
PE instructors around the country have started teaching classes such as skateboarding, in-line skating, yoga, and even rock climbing. Experts call these sports ""the new PE."" These individual sports are designed to help fight childhood
by getting kids involved in fun physical activities. Obesity is the condition of being dangerously overweight. Another goal of these nontraditional activities is to promote lifelong fitness habits.
Since 1980, the percentage of young people who are overweight has more than tripled. The time students spend in PE class, however, is decreasing. Many schools have dropped gym classes to save money or to provide students with more classroom time. Only 8 percent of elementary schools offer gym class to students every day, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Because students have less PE time, teachers are searching for ways to keep kids moving. ""[Skateboarding] is a great activity that keeps kids engaged in physical movement and gives them new skills and interests,"" says West Middle Schools afterschool program coordinator, Lindsey Johnson.
Some people say skateboarding not only offers health and fitness benefits but also teaches life lessons that could help kids with their schoolwork. Students who are learning to skateboard often spend hours practicing a new trick before they get it right. ""Skateboarding teaches kids to believe that if they stick with something, they will ultimately succeed,"" says education expert Richard Sagor of Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon.
Carloss skateboarding teacher at West Middle School, Eric Klassen, agrees. ""A baby will attempt to walk 600 to 900 times before [he or she] is successful,"" Klassen says. ""We tell students that they shouldnt say I cant do it unless theyve tried 600 to 900 times.""
Klassens students take his advice to heart. ""It took me 600 times to learn one new trick,"" says Martin Carrera, 11.
Over the last decade, team sports have dropped in popularity while individual sports, such as skateboarding, have been on the rise. This trend may affect the kinds of activities PE teachers offer in gym class. Learning individual sports gives all students an opportunity to exercise, whether they make it onto a school team or not.
Imagine that your school offers a skateboarding class. Would such a class have a positive effect on you? Explain.

That law prohibits public schools from treating boys and girls differently.
After the Title IX rules were put in place in 1975, singlegender classes were allowed only in specific cases, such as gym class. Under the new rules, school officials can separate boys and girls if they think it helps the students learn better. The decision has stirred up debate about equality in the classroom.
All-girls and all-boys classes in public schools have become more common. Since 1995, the number has jumped from three to more than 240. Of those, 51 are completely single-gender schools. Supporters say single-gender schools help kids improve their performance in school. ""Research shows that some students may learn better in single-[gender] environments,"" says Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings.

In December, 3,000 sculptors and workers began constructing Harbin's winter wonderland. Harbin lies on the Songhua River, which provides the festival with some of its ice. The festival covers 44 square city blocks. Workers used enough snow and ice to fill 90 Olympicsize swimming pools!

The ice festival changes each year. Here are some buildings and sculptures that have been part of the festival in the past.
The ice festival often has an ice slide that visitors use to get from one part of the city to another.
Visitors to the winter festival can even eat at restaurants made of ice, like this KFC.
This structure was built to look like an ancient European castle. It was lit up at night to attract visitors.
People try to climb a sheet of ice. The ice wall is often located in a part of the city called Adventure Playground.

Mei Xiang (MAY SHONG) is a 2-year-old female panda. Her name means ""beautiful fragrance."" Tian Tian (tee-YEN tee-YEN) is a 3-year-old male panda. His name means ""more and more.""
The map shows China, the most populated country in the world. More than 1.2 billion people live within China's 3.7 million square miles.
The two pandas arrived from China aboard a plane called
. From the airport, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian were taken to the National Zoo, where they will live for the next ten years.
Officials at the National Zoo agreed to give China $10 million in exchange for lending the United States the two pandas. That money will be used to protect pandas from becoming extinct in central China.
About 1,000 pandas live in the mountain forests of central China, where they eat mainly bamboo shoots. The pandas need the forests to survive.
The land where pandas are found, however, is being cleared and used for farmland. The trees are being used for firewood to heat people's homes.
There are now seven pandas living in the United States. Two are in Washington, D.C.; two are in Atlanta, Georgia; and three are in San Diego, California.
One of those seven pandas is a baby. The baby panda, Hua Mei, was born at the San Diego Zoo on August 21, 1999.
Hua Mei is the first baby panda born in the Western Hemisphere since 1990. When he was born, he weighed less than 5 ounces and looked more like a rat than a panda.
Fa Mingzhi is one of more than 4 million people who live near the area where the pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian come from. Most of the people who live in that area are farmers who need the forest to survive.
Like many people, Fa Mingzhi wants to protect the animals. But, she says, people want to eat, too. ""It's good to protect the panda, but it's harder now on the people who live here,"" she said.
As pandas and the people of China compete for the same resources, both face an uncertain future.

Anyone who's ever had a toothache will tell you that it can be very painful. Since ancient times, humans have tried different ways to stop the rot. Here are a few:
Ancient Egyptians placed a live mouse on a person's gums to relieve a toothache. They believed mice could cure toothaches because the rodents have good teeth.
One ancient Roman author wrote that tying a frog to a person's jaw would make teeth stronger.
Ancient Romans believed that boiling earthworms in olive oil and then using the oil as eardrops would relieve a toothache.

Scientists think the ancient tool served double duty. They believe that people used the tiny spoon to clean their ears! The bristles were probably hog hairs.
Although the toothbrush has been around for several hundred years, people have been caring for their teeth since ancient times. In fact, some scientists say that ancient Egyptians used stalks of grass to clean their teeth. They also believe that people long ago used tooth powders made of charcoal to clean their teeth.

The long-tailed, tree-dwelling monkey is a highland mangabey (MANG-guh-bee). It is covered with brownish-gray fur and has an off-white belly and tail. The new monkey makes an odd ""honk-bark"" call.
This latest discovery has surprised scientists. ""The chances of finding a large, noisy monkey that no one has ever scientifically described before makes this a rare event indeed,"" says scientist Trevor Jones.
Highland mangabeys are shy creatures. Their shyness makes them difficult to spot. That might explain why scientists were unaware that the species had existed. Another reason is that the monkeys live high in the forest
Scientists are working hard to protect the highland mangabey's environment. It is estimated that fewer than 1,000 of the monkeys live in the wild. Scientists say the discovery shows that there is still a lot to learn about Africa.

Earth's atmosphere is made of several layers. Ozone is a gas that makes up one of those layers. That layer stretches from 6 miles to 30 miles above Earth's surface.
Ozone is an important gas. It protects life on Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. Without ozone, life couldn't exist. The dangerous solar rays are called ultraviolet rays, or UV rays. UV rays can cause sunburn and skin cancer.
The pie chart shows the two most abundant gases in Earth""s atmosphere.
Scientists first noticed the ozone hole in the 1970s. Since then, each year, the hole has opened above Antarctica for a few months in the fall. The largest hole formed in 2000. It was three times larger than the United States. This year, unusually severe storms caused the hole to split, say scientists.
Cold temperatures in the atmosphere over Antarctica and chemical pollution cause the ozone hole. Chemicals that used to be in aerosol cans, air conditioners, and refrigerators made the pollution. To protect the atmosphere, people stopped using those dangerous chemicals in the mid-1990s.
Although the chemicals are no longer used, they stay in the atmosphere for a long time. Scientists say the ozone hole will continue to form for a long time. But it should start getting smaller.

The map shows Earth's southernmost continent, Antartica. A hole in the ozone layer opens above Antartica each year.
Scientists say a hole has formed in the ozone layer above the South Pole every July for at least 15 years. Each year, the hole grows, reaching its largest size in September and October. The hole then shrinks and finally disappears in November and December.
This year, the hole was larger than ever. It covered an area of more than 11 million square miles. That's much larger than the combined areas of Antarctica and Australia!
The hole was so large that, for the first time ever, the health of thousands of people who live in southern South America was threatened.
The hole in the ozone layer is mainly caused by

In 1987, many countries agreed to limit the use of ozone-destroying chemicals. But CFCs stay in the atmosphere for decades. Even though CFCs are rarely used now, the chemical will cause problems for many years, scientists say.

People splattered by the weird substance couldn't figure out what it was. Now, the state's Department of Environmental Quality has identified it.
The strange substance is not some weird goo from space. It is actually bee waste. The environmental workers found an unusually large number of beehives near the towns where the goo fell.
When the bees from those hives flew over the communities, they dropped the waste. Because it was a good year for bees, there was a lot of waste. Luckily, the bee goo is made mostly of pollen and is harmless.

Carved into the famous granite monument are the faces of four U.S. presidentsGeorge Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Mount Rushmore is located in the Black Hills of South Dakota. For five weeks this summer, a crew washed the presidents' faces.
To kick off the cleaning, workers scaled the mountain and sprayed the left side of Jefferson's forehead with water. They also blasted Jefferson's eyelid and jaw with handheld hoses to wash away decades of dirt.
""Apart from the dirt, we are concerned with the lichens,"" Mount Rushmore official Judy Olson told
. Lichens are small plant-like organisms that can grow on hard surfaces, such as rock and bark. They make an acid that can harm the faces. ""The lichen roots are digging into the stone,"" Olson says.
The workers took special care near the cracks on the stone faces. They used pressure washing instead of chemicals. Pressure washing has been used to clean other historical structures, including the Statue of Liberty in New York City and the Coliseum in Rome.
Mount Rushmore was designed by American sculptor Gutzon Borglum. From 1927 to 1941, his team worked on the memorial. They used drills and dynamite to blast into the cliff. Each head is as tall as a six-story building.
Four presidents were carved into Mount Rushmore because they symbolized courage and freedom during the first 150 years of American history.
(1732-1799), the first U.S. president, led the American colonies to freedom during the Revolutionary War (1775-1783)

350,"Where the Wild Things Are!: A Numbers Puzzle
Counting giant pandas in the wild is no easy task. Just ask a team of scientists who recently put their detective skills to the test.
The scientists trekked through dense forests in central China to search for clues of giant pandas. China, a country in Asia, is the only place where giant pandas live in the wild.
After spending four years in the country's mountainous region, scientists completed the largest
of giant pandas ever done. A census is a population count.
The results of the census surprised scientists! They counted about 1,600 giant pandas living in the wild in China. That is double the number originally thought to live there. ""We found giant pandas living in areas we didn't know had any,"" scientist Colby Loucks told
Although the news is hopeful, Loucks and other scientists are quick to point out that giant pandas still need protection. They are among the most
animals. That means there are very few left in the wild.
Human activity is the main reason the pandas are threatened. Their
, or home, is being destroyed as people cut down trees to get wood and to make farmland.
Giant pandas must eat a lot of bamboo to get the nutrients they need. Pandas spend up to 14 hours a day eating bamboo, because it is not very nutritious.
, or go into a long sleep, in the winter, because they can't store up enough fat on a bamboo diet.
A newborn panda weighs between 3 and 5 ounces and is about the size of a stick of butter.
Each front paw on a panda has an extra wrist bone that acts like a thumb to help the panda grasp bamboo shoots.
Scientists needed to collect clues to count pandas because the shy creatures are hard to spot in their natural environment. ""Giant pandas are very hard to see in the wild,"" said Loucks. ""They hide in the thick
Bamboo provides giant pandas with their main source of food. Each animal consumes about 80 pounds of this plant's stems and leaves a day.
In fact, the giant pandas' survival is linked to eating bamboo. If bamboo disappears in an area, giant pandas there risk starvation.
To collect clues, scientists combined the latest technology with old-fashioned tracking skills. Each time they spotted a clue, such as a panda paw print in the mud or fur on the bark of a tree, they entered their finding into a computer. Computer mapping helped them pinpoint the locations of the giant pandas.
How will the census results help protect pandas? Scientists hope their findings will lead to the creation of more
for giant pandas. Nature reserves are areas of forest that are protected from development. Currently, China has 40 nature reserves.
""Pandas live in the same place as other animals,"" said Loucks. ""If we conserve the panda habitat, we conserve [the habitat of other animals] too.""
Why is it important for scientists to track endangered animals?

To draw music fans back into stores, the world's largest record company announced a few weeks ago that it would lower its CD prices. Universal Music Group said its CDs would sell in stores for about $12.98 instead of the current prices ranging from $16.98 to $18.98.
For people who still want to get their music online, they can do it without breaking the law. Some music-sharing services on the Web work in a similar way to record stores. The services charge a small fee for each song that is copied.

NASA recently announced plans to build a permanent base on the moon. Astronauts could be living and working there by 2020, according to the U.S space agency. The goal is to prepare astronauts for a trip to Mars in the future.
Under the plan, four-person crews will begin with weeklong missions to the moon. By 2024, when more equipment has been set up, astronauts will be able to

NASA hopes to establish a lunar outpost near one of the moon's poles. ""These locations experience sunlight for longer periods of time than other locations on the moon, which will make it possible to use solar power,"" NASA official Michael Braukus told
Solar power is energy from the sun that can be used to generate electricity.
It is also likely that the polar regions are rich in natural resources, such as oxygen and hydrogen. While on the moon, astronauts plan to use natural resources for water and fuel.
The moon is the only place beyond Earth that humans have visited. About 238,900 miles away, the moon is Earth's closest space neighbor.
On July 20, 1969, Americans Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the moon. Those space pioneers traveled to the lunar surface on the

crew exploration vehicle, which is being developed. The vehicle, a modernized version of the
craft, will attach to a lunar lander.
The moon mission is part of President George W. Bush's longterm space plan. The proposed base is the first step in the bold plan to prepare astronauts for their ultimate destinationMars.
Because Mars is so far from Earth, traveling there will require humans to stay for long periods of time. Astronauts will not be able to bring enough supplies for the entire mission. They will have to use the elements on Mars to survive.
""By demonstrating we can survive on another world for a long time, we build confidence that we can venture much farther from Earth and stay for longer periods of time,"" says Braukus of NASA.
While some supporters are jumping over the moon about launching a new era of space exploration, not everyone is pleased with the plan. Critics warn that it will be difficult to fund the moon program. So far, NASA has not put a price tag on the mission but welcomes participation by other countries to help carry out its plan.
In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched
the first artificial satellite in space. The U.S. space program was established as a response. The ""space race"" between the two countries had begun. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy challenged Americans to send a person to the moon by the end of the 1960s. The time line shows some U.S. space milestones and NASA's plans for the lunar base.

The long gray line is what all the students who have ever attended West Point are called. The term refers to the color of the uniforms that the
, or military students, wear. It also reminds the cadets that they are part of a long tradition, which celebrates its 200th anniversary this year.
On March 16, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson founded a school to train military officers and teach engineering. The school was established at West Point, which had been used as a fort.
The school's first class of students was smaller than the one that entered this year. In 1802, only two students were enrolled at the school. The youngest was 10 years old!
When West Point was founded, the United States was much smaller than it is today. The country extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River.
Until 1817, West Point did not have a set course of study. In that year, Sylvanus Thayer was appointed the superintendent of West Point. He developed the school's curriculum and turned West Point into one of the best schools in the United States. George Woodbridge, who graduated from the school in 1826, explained Thayer's accomplishment, saying, ""His object was to make [us] gentlemen and soldiers.""
The officers who graduated from West Point helped build and defend the United States. They explored the vast areas west of the Mississippi River. They designed the roads, bridges, dams, railroads, and canals that the United States needed as it grew. They also helped design some of our greatest buildings and monuments. For example, they worked on the Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the base of the Statue of Liberty.
Many of the school's graduates have gone on to play important roles in U.S. history. They have been famous generals and U.S. presidents. Both President Ulysses S. Grant and President Dwight D. Eisenhower were generals and graduates of West Point. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, also graduated from West Point.
Even though all West Point graduates serve America in different ways, they all share important lessons learned at the academy. For example, they learn about taking responsibility for one's actions. They also share the school's motto. ""Always there echoes and reechoes in my ears [the motto]: Duty. Honor. Country,"" said General Douglas MacArthur, a West Point graduate.
George Washington Whistler graduated from West Point in 1819. He spent most of his career building railroads. He also built steam locomotives.
While building his first locomotive, Whistler also built the first American train whistle. He placed his whistle on top of the locomotive. He called his locomotive the Whistler. The sound of Whistler's whistle can still be heard on old steam locomotives.

Like people, overweight cats and dogs have a greater risk of developing heart disease and other health conditions. The clue for determining whether a pet is overweight is in the ribs.

Owners can help their plump pups and fat cats shed some extra pounds. Animal experts recommend feeding pudgy pets smaller portions, reducing their number of feedings, and using diet pet food. Regular exercise will also help pets trim down and stay healthy.
Many owners reward their pets or show them affection by giving them table scraps and other treats. Volkerts says that dogs and cats have their own food for a reason.

Marsupials have three types of cones in their eyes. Most mammals, including dogs and horses, have only two types of cone cells. That leaves them unable to see blues or reds.
Australia is home to most marsupials. This continent is often called the ""land down under."" That is because it lies in the Southern Hemispherethe half of Earth below the equator. Much of central Australia is desert. The Australian desert is called the outback, because it is so remote. More than 90 percent of the Australian population lives along the coast.

Lava from the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii hits the sea.
Tourists watched in awe as a huge chunk of Hawaiis coastline broke off and fell into the ocean. More than 44 acres of coastline collapsed and sent a glowing swirl of red-hot
bursting from a cliff. Lava is liquid rock that comes from a volcano.
The lava waterfall from the Kilauea volcano spilled into the Pacific Ocean. Steam shot into the air as the lava hit the water.
""The cliff just caved away like a glacier,"" Hawaii Volcanoes National Park spokesperson Jim Gale told reporters. ""It just sheared off that old wall."" Park officials let tourists watch the spectacular scene well away from the danger zone.
Kilauea, the worlds most active volcano, on Hawaiis Big Island has been erupting continuously since 1983. The November collapse was the largest in 23 years. It took about four hours for the cliff to tumble into the ocean. As the lava hardened, it began to form new land. All the Hawaiian Islands formed that way.
The recent collapse didnt surprise scientists. They had issued a warning months earlier because the cliff had formed cracks. Land collapses are not uncommon in the area. In 1996, a 26-acre area collapsed into the ocean, and in 1999, 25 acres of unsteady land fell into the water.

Venice attracts millions of tourists each year for its beautiful art and architecture. People weave their way through the city on boats because there are no streets. A maze of long
or waterways, takes the place of roads. In fact, there are no cars or trucks in Venice.
Venice is located in northern Italy on the Adriatic Sea. The city was built on a series of small islands in a
or an area of shallow water. During some high tides, water floods the city. For hundreds of years, people have tried to keep water out of the city to save it from sinking. Now a group of scientists has introduced a bold plan to keep the city afloat. And it means adding more water!
Venice is sinking at a rate of 1.57 inches per year, according to scientists. The Italian government has proposed the building of floodgates to control the flow of the sea.
Scientists hope to turn the tide in favor of Venice. They want to pump huge amounts of water into the ground through sturdy pipes. Scientists expect the water will expand the sand underneath and prop up the city. They hope to test the project on a small area over the next few months.
In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads.
Scientists behind the plan say that the pipes will work along with the floodgates to help save the city. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnt carried out in a careful way.
Everyone, however, agrees that saving the sinking city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose tremendous part of [history],"" Melissa Conn of Save Venice, an organization dedicated to helping preserve the city, told reporters.
Venice in Italian means ""city of canals.""
About 1.6 million people live in Venice.

A tropical rain forest is warm and has heavy rainfall. The Amazon, in South America, is the largest rain forest in the world.
Yet the Amazons future is grim. Farmers are rapidly destroying this lush landscape.
has been huge problem in the Amazon since the 1960s. Deforestation occurs when farmers and loggers cut down trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Until recently, scientists thought the rain forest was losing about 5,800 square miles a year. However, using the latest satellite technology, researchers have discovered that the Amazon is shrinking at about twice that rate.
Why should we worry about a rain forest that is thousands of miles from where we live? Deforestation reduces the rain forests
or the variety of plants and animals in a particular area. The Amazon is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant diversity. It is home to the biggest flower in the world, a bird-eating spider, and a monkey about the size of a toothbrush.
Scientists estimate that they have identified only a small number of all species that live in the rain forest. As loggers and farmers destroy the forest, animals and plants may become extinct before they are discovered.
Deforestation affects people too. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines we need come from the rain forest.
The Amazon is often called the ""lungs of the world."" Its trees clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans. Carbon dioxide is a
Greenhouse gases trap the suns heat close to Earth. Without the trees in the rain forest, the Earths climate would become much hotter.
Stopping the destruction of the rain forest is not an easy task. Brazils government recently created two national parks in the Amazon rain forest. The governments efforts placed 3.7 million acres of rain forest off-limits for development. The protected area is more than twice the size of Maryland.
Others think that this is not enough. ""The single most important factor contributing to forest loss is population growth in Brazil,"" scientist Jim Bowyer of the University of Michigan told
""People make the forest their home. All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive.""
Scientists estimate that if deforestation continues at its current rate, the rain forest may survive only another 40 to 50 years. ""We need to address the real causes of deforestation, like poverty and population growth,"" says Bowyer. ""Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest.""

It started when Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon killed three Israeli soldiers and kidnapped two others. Hezbollah is an Arab group that does not recognize Israel's right to exist. Israel was founded in 1948 as a homeland for Jewish people. Hezbollah says Israel took over land that belongs to Arabs.
Israel responded to the Hezbollah attack with force. Israeli planes bombed Hezbollah neighborhoods in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon. They also hit Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon. Israeli army troops crossed the border and fought with Hezbollah.
As a result, Hezbollah launched missiles at Israel. Hundreds have been killed in the conflict. The United States and other nations sent ships and planes to evacuate their citizens living in or visiting Lebanon.
Israel said it would not withdraw its troops until Hezbollah released the Israeli soldiers. Hezbollah has demanded that the Israeli soldiers be exchanged for Lebanese prisoners held in Israel.
World leaders looked for a way to end the fighting as tensions continued to grow. United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged a stop to the violence. ""We must say, to the people of Lebanon, to the people of Israel ... that we will do our utmost to help them find a path towards peace.""

According to the National Safe Kids Campaign, children younger than 15 were hurt in nine out of ten of those accidents. In one-third of those scooter accidents, the rider fell and broke or dislocated an arm or a hand.
Most scooter accidents happen when a rider goes too fast and does not wear safety equipment.
Safety gear helps protect riders, who usually ride at about 4 miles per hour. But some people cruise at speeds of 25 miles per hour or more. In England, police gave a man a ticket for racing a scooter at 39 miles per hour!
The number of scooter-related accidents has prompted some U.S. communities to pass laws requiring kids who ride scooters to wear helmets and other safety gear. Many states already have helmet laws for kids who ride bicycles, and some have helmet laws for kids who use skateboards and in-line skates.
Ann Brown, an official with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, recommends that kids use safety gear when riding scooters. ""We're trying to head off some of the kinds of injuries that happen with in-line skates,"" Brown said about scooter safety. ""We want people to know about the safety gear early on.""
This isn't the first time scooters have been popular. Scooters have been around since 1816. According to Annette Thompson of the Bicycle Museum of America, the first scooter was made from a board and two large wheels.
Even if scooter riders are careful, accidents can happen. Here are a few safety tips that scooter riders can use:
Always wear a helmet, wrist guards, and elbow and knee pads;
Make sure your scooter works properly and is not broken;
Ride only on smooth surfaces free of traffic;
Never hitch a ride from a bicycle or a motor vehicle;
In the 1930s, kids nailed roller skates to milk crates to make homemade scooters. Scooters remained popular until the 1980s, when skateboards and in-line skates became popular.

or separated by race. Under the law, black people were not allowed to attend the same schools as white people. They were forced to sit in the backseats of buses. They also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains.
King worked to change the laws by giving speeches and leading peaceful marches. Thanks to King and other leaders,
were passed. Those laws make sure that all Americans are treated equally.
On August 28, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech in Washington, D.C. A crowd of more than 200,000 people came to hear him. In his speech, King said, ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.""

Each year, about 20 million kids play sports during and after school. Unfortunately, about 5 million of those kids suffer some kind of injury while playing.
To help children play sports safely, the National Youth Sports Safety Foundation (NYSSF) has named April National Youth Sports Safety Month.
During April, the foundation plans to teach kids about sports safety. The foundation's message is that most sports injuries can be prevented.
According to the NYSSF, you can do a few things to keep from getting a sports injury:
Do warm-up stretches before and after playing any sport. Stretching helps loosen tight muscles and tissues.
Do not play when you are in pain. Pain is a sure sign of an injury!
Use proper sports safety equipment, such as helmets, elbow pads, kneepads, safety glasses, wrist guards, shin guards, and mouth guards.
The NYSSF says that playing sports and exercising help kids stay healthy and make friends. But no matter which sport you play, always remember to have fun!
Do you do warm-up activities before and after playing a sport?

Do you like being a hero? What do your parents think?
It feels good. My parents are proud of me. They took me out for ice cream.
What did you learn from this experience?
I learned that you should chew your food slowly, not fast. And if you're choking, you should point to your throat. That way, people around you know that you need help.
I learned that everyone should learn the Heimlich maneuver. You might have to use it on somebody.
Do you know someone who is a hero? What does someone do in order to be called a hero?
- Stand behind the choking victim, and wrap your arms around his or her waist.
- Make a fist, and hold it against the victim's stomach, between the belly button and the rib cage.
- Grab your fist with the other hand. Press it in with an upward motion. Repeat this until the victim stops choking.

Location: Iraq is a country located in Asia. It is in an area known as the Middle East.
Language: Most of the people in Iraq are Arabs. They speak Arabic, the official language of Iraq.
In July, the zoo reopened its doors to visitors. To the people of Iraq, the zoo is a welcome sight. ""I've been mostly inside the house for the last few months,"" said an 11-year-old girl in Iraq. ""I missed things like this.""

Selso (front center) and his family now have a brand-new house that was painted sky blue.
Much has changed in a year for Selso and his family. Volunteers with Habitat for Humanity recently built them a new house. More important, the workers brought hope. ""My parents are so happy. My mother had tears in her eyes,"" Selso told
Habitat for Humanity is a group that builds new homes for people who are poor. Habitat volunteers from seven countries, including the United States, traveled long hours to help families who lost their homes in the tsunami. Selsos family worked side by side with the volunteers.
Debris of beach resorts washed away in the December 26 Indian Ocean tsunami at Khao Lak, Thailand, seen December 30.
Selso lives in a small fishing village by the sea near Kanyakumari, India. India was one of 12 countries hit by the tsunami on December 26, 2004. Tens of thousands of people lost their lives. ""We knew people who died, but my family was lucky. We only lost our home,"" says Selso.
A year later, many people in India are still homeless. Volunteers plan on building another 10,000 homes there over the next two years.
""[The volunteers] didnt even know us, but they came here to help,"" says Selsos dad. ""This is the happiest day for my family. My children now have a safe, dry home where they can do their homework.""

Along with rebuilding homes in India, volunteers are installing (setting up for use) plumbing. That way, families can have clean water. Clean water is important for good health. Our bodies can survive without food for two months or longer, but we can survive without water for only a few days.

The peanut hunt is not over yet. Now scientists are looking for a peanut missing the other allergen. Once they find it, they will try to create an allergy-free peanut.
Scientists hope an allergy-free peanut will one day replace the more common peanut. That would make kids with peanut allergies very happy.

Why did the turtle cross the sea? To get to the other side, of course!

Leatherback turtles can weigh up to 2,000 pounds.
Scientists recently studied leatherback turtles in the Atlantic Ocean. Leatherback turtles are the largest species of turtle. They can grow up to about 7 feet long.
To migrate is to move from one area to another. Leatherback turtles spend most of their lives in the sea. They lay their eggs on land. Then they migrate back to the ocean.
Researchers watched leatherbacks that laid their eggs in Gabon. That is a country in Africa. Before the turtles slipped back into the water, the scientists attached small electronic tracking tools to some of the creatures. That allowed the researchers to follow the animals.
Experts learned that each of the turtles took a

Now that experts know where the turtles swim, they hope to better protect them. Leatherbacks face threats including hunting and fishing.
to help keep the turtles safe. Fisheries are businesses that catch and sell fish. Sometimes they catch turtles by mistake. Experts also hope countries near the Atlantic Ocean will do more to protect leatherbacks, says scientist Matthew Witt (below).
Now [that] we know where leatherbacks might go, Witt told
we have an idea of where we need to start working ... to protect this amazing species.
Leatherbacks are named for their flexible, leatherlike shells. Other turtles shells are hard and bony.
How low can you go? Some leatherbacks can dive down 4,200 feet. That is deeper than any other turtle can dive.
Leatherbacks arent afraid of chilly water. They sometimes swim as far north as Canada.

George W. Bush taking the Oath of Office on January 20, 2001, after his first election.
George W. Bush first took the Oath of Office in 2001. That is when he became the 43rd U.S. president. The oath is the only part of the day's events that is required by law. Every president since George Washington has taken this oath.
In 1961, John F. Kennedy gave one of the most famous inaugural addresses. Kennedy was the 35th president of the United States. He said, ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."" What do you think his message meant?
In 1977, Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. president to walk in the inaugural parade. The parade starts at the Capitol and ends at the White House. The White House is the president's home for the next four years. Every president except George Washington has lived there.
An inaugural ball is a formal dance. The first official ball was held in 1809 for President James Madison. So far, no president has attended more inaugural balls than President Bill Clinton in 1997. He and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton attended 14 in one night!
George Washington's inaugural address in 1793 was the shortest. His speech lasted only eight minutes. In 1841, William Henry Harrison gave the longest inaugural address. It lasted almost two hours!
Cold weather caused quite a problem at the inaugural ball for Ulysses S. Grant in 1873. The ball was held in a tent, which wasn't heated, and the valves on the band's musical instruments froze!
In 1981, guests at Ronald Reagan's inaugural balls received a sweet treat. Forty million jelly beans--one of Reagan's favorite candies--were eaten to celebrate!

It is not uncommon for a large pod, or group, of pilot whales to get stranded. They are highly social animals that stay close together. ""The value of sticking close together at times brings the risk of beaching. When one whale beaches, the other whales may follow,"" said scientist Michael Moore.
Sadly, 120 whales died on the beach. But volunteers were able to rescue 39 of the whales. The rescuers poured cool water on the whales to protect them from the heat. They helped push the huge mammals back into the water. Then small boats led the pilot whales back to sea.

or travel to a new location, when the season changes. Each spring, tens of millions of monarchs from Mexico head north. In the fall, they will fly to Mexico for the winter months.
Elizabeth Howard created the Web site Journey North. The site studies monarchs and tracks their travel patterns.

""There is a good chance that we will see big changes in the monarchs' migratory patterns in the next several decades,"" says monarch expert Karen Oberhauser. ""My hope is that monarchs will be able to adapt.""
Some monarch butterflies live for just a few weeks. Others may live up to eight months. Each butterfly races to complete its leg of the journey and produce the next generation before it dies. Parent butterflies leave Mexico in March. Their children are born in the southern United States. Those butterflies travel north. Grandchildren butterflies are produced in the north, where they spend July. Finally, it is the great-grandchild of the first butterfly that returns to Mexico. It will remain there for the winter.

In what ways would your life be different if you were blind? In what ways would it be the same?
In 1995, Erik started climbing the Seven Summits. He was 26 years old at the time. In September, he climbed the seventh summit, Mount Kosciuszko in Australia.
To prepare for the climbs, Erik spent more than 1,000 hours training each year. He walked on a treadmill every day. He also climbed stairs wearing a 100-pound pack on his back.
Erik climbs with the help of a team of climbers. He uses tracking poles to help him feel his way to the top of each mountain. ""I can't use my eyes, so I use my hands and my feet to feel what I'm doing,"" said Erik.
The mountains that Erik climbed are all different. Some are rocky. Others are covered in snow and ice. Although he cannot see, Erik can use his other senses to tell each mountain apart. ""My senses--the feel of the rock, the smell of the earth, the sound of the wind howling--are what make each mountain different and unique for me,"" he said.

Scientists hope the missions will answer questions about Mars. The spacecraft will take pictures of the planet. Some spacecraft will even collect samples of the soil on Mars to study. NASA first sent spacecraft to Mars in the 1960s. Since then, several spacecraft have landed on Mars. One of the most exciting landings happened in 1997, when

Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is often called the Red Planet because it looks red from Earth. Mars looks red because its surface has lots of iron. The iron has rusted and turned a reddish-brown color. Sometimes, winds on Mars whip the reddish dust into the sky, turning the sky pink.
A dust storm whips across the Martian surface. Dust storms often form in the Martian spring. A dust storm forms when high winds pick up sand and blow it across the surface. Large dust storms can last for months and blanket the entire planet with the red dust.
Two dry riverbeds cut across the surface of Mars. Each riverbed is more than a half-mile deep. Scientists say the riverbeds formed when water suddenly gushed to the surface from inside Mars. The riverbeds might have formed billions of years ago, scientists say. Hundreds of dry riverbeds crisscross the Red Planet.
Valles Marineris is the largest canyon on Mars. It is nearly 2,500 miles long and about 4 miles deep. On Earth, it would almost span the distance between New York City and Los Angeles. (The Grand Canyon on Earth is only 227 miles long and 1 mile deep!) The volcanoes on Mars are larger than volcanoes on Earth. The largest Martian volcano, is about the same size as Arizona at its base.
Mars has ice caps at its north and south poles, much like Earth has. But Martian ice caps are made of water ice and frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. The polar ice caps grow in the winter and shrink in the summer. This photo shows the planet's south pole in summer.
One day on Mars is 24 hours long; one year is 687 days long.
Temperatures on Mars range from -220 degrees Fahrenheit (F) to 68 degrees F.

Sneezes start at the back of your throat. Each quick burst can force out up to 40,000 droplets of saliva. The tiny droplets travel at up to 300 miles per hour.
Coughs come out of your lungs. Each blast can push out 3,000 saliva droplets as fast as 50 miles per hour. Enough air comes out to almost fill a 2-liter bottle.

Put on your party hat! January 17 is the 300th anniversary of Ben Franklins birth. People across the United States will celebrate the ways this great American helped our country. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, events are taking place all year.
The main event is an exhibit called
Benjamin Franklin: In Search of a Better World.
It began in Philadelphia and will travel to four other states during the yearMissouri,Texas, Colorado, and Georgia.
""In his 300th year, we want people to understand why Ben Franklin is still so important,"" spokesperson Nicola Twilley told
""We want to bring him and his
to life."" A legacy is something passed on to future generations.
Why is Philadelphia making such a big fuss about Franklins birthday? In 1723,when he was 17 years old, Franklin made his home there. He worked to make life in that city better. In Philadelphia, he helped set up the countrys first hospital, public library, and volunteer fire department.
During the 1700s, Philadelphia was the center of American government. When Franklin was young, America was made up of 13 colonies ruled by England. Franklin helped America gain independence. He also helped write the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.
""Hes very inspirational,"" says Twilley. ""He came from a poor background. He had only two years of school. He made himself into one of the greatest Americans of all time.""
If you could interview Ben Franklin, what would you ask him? Why?
Ben Franklin only attended school from the ages of 8 to 10. But his love of learning lasted a lifetime.
Even at a young age, Franklin was a scientist and an inventor. At the age of 10, Franklin invented wooden swim fins to help him swim faster.
When he was 12 years old, Franklin worked in his brothers printing shop. Later, he opened his own shop.

To migrate is to move from one area to another when the seasons change.
Whooping cranes are endangered. There are only about 380 of them in the United States. In the fall, whooping cranes in the North are supposed to migrate south for the winter. However, many whooping cranes dont know how. With so few birds, many baby whooping cranes dont have any adults to teach them how to migrate, explains Joe Duff. He is an Operation Migration pilot.
Thats where the trikes and costumes come in. Each October, pilots in Wisconsin dress up like whooping cranes and take to the skies. The young birds follow them because they think the trikes are whooping cranes leading the flock.
It takes about three months for the birds to reach the Southwith plenty of stops along the way. The pilots lead the whooping cranes to special
or protected areas, in Florida. By then, the birds know how to migrate. This spring, birds that flew with the pilots last fall will return to the North on their own.
For Duff, the best part of the trip is bringing whooping cranes to the refuges. Its [a nice feeling] because you know the birds are going to make it, he told
Last fall, pilots in Wisconsin led a flock of whooping cranes across seven states. In Florida, the flock was divided and taken to two refuges. Study the map for a birds-eye view of their trip.

Experts think kites were first made in China more than 2,000 years ago. Legend has it that a Chinese farmer invented the kite. On a very windy day, he tied a string to his hat. He held the string to keep his hat from blowing away.

Fifty years ago, the courageous act of Rosa Parks changed history.
For years, Rosa Parks stood up to unfair laws against black people. Then on December 1, 1955, she changed the history of the United States forever. Rosa Parks was riding a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and was told to give up her seat to a white passenger. When she refused, she was arrested and taken to jail.
At that time, states in the South were
by law. The law kept black people from having the same rights as white people. Black people were forced to sit in the back of city buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, water fountains, and other public facilities.
After Parks was arrested, thousands of people refused to ride the city buses in Montgomery. The
was led by Martin Luther King Jr. and lasted for more than a year. It was a success. In 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the bus segregation law was illegal.
December 1 marks the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest for not giving up her seat. On that day, people across the United States will honor this important time in history.
Special events will take place in Montgomery, where the equal rights movement began. As part of the day's events, hundreds of kids will march to remember the bus boycott.
""Never again should we foster hate or distrust based on one's skin color,"" says event spokesperson Kenneth Mullinax. The children will march ""as a pledge to treat everyone with equal love,"" he told
""Rosa Parks's not giving up her seat on the bus shows how important it is to stand up for what we believe in,"" says Mullinax.
Today, people can step aboard the bus that Rosa Parks made famous. It is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan. The bus has been restored to look as it did in 1955.

In a recent report, the government said people should eat foods that are higher in
and lower in fat. Nutrients give you energy and help your body stay healthy. Some foods that are good sources of nutrients are fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, such as brown rice and whole-wheat bread.
Nutritious foods can be fun and tasty!
A healthful diet is not the only way people can keep their bodies fit. The new guidelines say kids should exercise for at least one hour a day.
If you think eating healthful foods is boring, think again! Nutritious foods can be fun and tasty. Just ask the kids at Meadowbrook Elementary School in Fort Worth, Texas. They recently taste-tested foods, such as sweet potato pancakes and blueberry burgers.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture held the taste test. That group wants to help schools find ways to serve healthful foods and meet the new dietary guidelines.
""These new dietary guidelines represent our best ... advice to help Americans live healthier and longer lives,"" said one government official.

of todays Pueblo people. An ancestor is a family member who lived a long time ago.
The Ancient Pueblo lived in the area from about 600 to 1300. They lived on the
top until the 1100s. A mesa is a large, high rock with a flat top and steep sides. Later, they moved down to the sides of the cliffs and built homes there.

""It provides us the chance to look forward to the next 100 years and make sure this place stays preserved and enjoyed by the public.""

When people think of lightning, they generally picture it as a single bolt. However, scientists have recently reported that one flash of lightning often strikes in more than one place. It is common for lightning to fork, or split, and strike in two or more places, scientists say.
Lightning is a flow of electricity. A flash of lightning can heat the air around it to up to 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun!
When lightning heats the air around it, the air expands and makes a loud crashing sound-thunder. If you hear thunder, you are within striking distance of lightning. ""Anytime you hear thunder, you should immediately move to a safe area,"" said scientist E. Philip Krider. Safe places include a school, house, or car.
While it is unusual for people to be struck by lightning, it does happen. According to the National Weather Service, lightning causes nearly 300 injuries and 100 deaths in the United States each year.

The International Children's Games were first held in 1968 as a way to promote, or help develop, peace and friendship through sports. Since that time, more than 27,000 kids from around the world have participated.
The International Children's Games are modeled after the Olympics. The Olympic Games have a long history:
The first Olympic Games were held more than 2,700 years ago in Olympia, Greece. The Games included just one eventa 200-yard race.
The first modern Olympics took place in Athens, Greece, in 1896. More than 300 athletes from 13 countries competed in nine sports.
The Winter Olympics began in 1924. Like the Summer Olympics, they are held every four years.

Lincoln became the 16th U.S. president in 1861. The Civil War started a few weeks later. Lincoln won reelection in 1864.

In addition, Tut had a bone disease in his foot that probably made it hard for him to walk. That explains why he was buried with about 130 walking sticks, experts say. He most likely used them as canes. Ancient Egyptians buried people with objects they thought would be useful in their next life.
Scientists also studied 10 other mummies from Tuts time. They figured out that some of the mummies were his grandparents and great-grandparents. They even identified the bodies of his daddy and mummy! Now experts know a lot more about Tuts family tree.

Real Wrestling. Real Heroes. That is the

Unlike pro wrestling, the two challengers wrestle on a padded mat, not in a ring with ropes. They use certain moves to force their opponent to the mat.
Greg Strobel, a U.S. Olympic wrestling coach, says pro wrestling is meant to entertain. He says it is not a sport, like Olympic wrestling.
Chris Benoit and the Undertaker are two famous pro wrestlers. Many fans enjoy pro wrestling because of the action, fireworks, and costumes. However, pro wrestling is more of a show than a real contest, said Ron Buck, a sports reporter. According to many critics, the moves and punches in a professional match are fake.
U.S. Olympic wrestlers do not get paid to compete in the Olympics. For many team members, the chance to win a gold medal is a dream come true. Though pro wrestlers get more fame and attention, Olympic wrestlers consider representing the United States an honor. That is why, to many fans, these wrestlers are real heroes.
Olympic wrestlers compete only against others who are in the same weight class. Why is that an important rule?

This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Keep reading to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's As Easy As One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart (below).
So what's the result? Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

Eating in space can be hard because everything floats. Juice poured into a cup will float away and crumbs can get into air vents. So astronauts drink and eat in special ways. Astronauts drink with special straws and pouches. The pouch closes around the straw so juice doesn't leak out. Astronauts eat foods that don't make crumbs, like tortillas instead of bread.
On Earth, people usually sleep in beds. But most astronauts sleep in sleeping bags. The sleeping bags are in little cubbies. That way, a sleeping astronaut won't lose his or her pillow or float into something!
Astronauts have to work hard in space. Astronauts make sure that the space shuttle is in good condition. They clean air vents and check the engines and computers. The astronauts also do research and tests. Their work helps people learn about space.

Sharks do not like the taste of people. That's what Dr. Peter Klimley says. Klimley is a scientist who studies sharks. He says sharks would rather eat seals and sea lions than people. Seals and sea lions have a thick layer of fat on them. Eating that fat gives sharks energy. Klimley says people's bodies do not have enough fat to fill up a shark.
Klimley thinks that sharks should be afraid of people. Each year, people kill about 65 million sharks. Some people like to eat shark meat. And some sharks die because they live in water that is polluted.
Klimley says that at least seven kinds of sharks are endangered. The number of those sharks has dropped in the past ten years. Klimley hopes that people will help protect sharks.
There are at least 340 kinds of sharks.

Antarctica is a big icy continent. It is around the South Pole. The South Pole is found at the bottom of Earth.
Penguins are birds. Emperor and Adelie penguins live in Antarctica. The penguins stay warm because they have feathers that are very small and close together. The feathers have oil on them. Cold water can't get through the feathers to touch the penguins' skin. Each year, penguins molt, or lose, their feathers and grow new ones.
Penguins can waddle faster than humans can walk.
Penguins like to line up and dive into the water again and again.
Penguins sometimes toboggan, or slide, on their bellies.
Penguins surf waves to get back to shore.
Weddell seals live in Antarctica. Weddell seals swim in the cold ocean water to catch fish and other ocean animals to eat. These seals don't chew their food. They swallow the food in big pieces.
Weddell seals stay warm because they have a layer of blubber, or fat. They also have a coat of thick fur. The fur keeps water from touching the seal's skin.

In a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear.
Scientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help.
Scientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled.
Scientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest.
The African elephant is the largest animal that lives on land. African elephants can weigh up to 16,000 pounds.
An elephant's trunk contains more than 40,000 muscles. The trunk is used to smell, breathe, touch, eat, drink, and bathe.

Kids in some countries must deal with problems like those. But a special worldwide organization is trying to help them.
UNICEF helps children around the world. One way it helps is by providing schools and supplies. Three of the countries where UNICEF helps with education are Colombia, in South America, Rwanda (ruh-WAHN-duh), in Africa, and Thailand (TIGH-land), in Southeast Asia.
Those countries are probably far from where you live. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to go to school in another country?
In Colombia, the government requires kids to go to school for at least five years. Some people are poor and must work hard to survive. Some children must quit school to help their parents earn money.

One or two teachers must teach all the students, from grades 1 through 5. Students of the same age work together in small groups, helping one another learn.
Children in Rwanda must go to school from ages 7 to 15. But there is not enough space in some schools in Rwanda to fit all the students. Some students cannot afford to buy the uniforms and notebooks they must have to go to school.
To help solve those problems, UNICEF has created a special program called Schools-in-a-Box. Each box contains school supplies, workbooks, and learning games. When teachers use the Schools-in-a-Box, kids can be taught wherever they are.
Children in Thailand must go to school for six years. Though school is free, some families cannot afford to buy the uniforms children must wear to school.

UNICEF is an organization that works to help children all over the world. UNICEF tries to provide health care, nutritious food, clean water, and an education for all children. The organization raises money and talks to world governments about helping children.

Playing outside gives you a chance to breathe fresh air, but it also exposes you to harmful sun rays. Harmful sun rays can cause sunburns. You can get a sunburn even if you are outside for a short amount of time. So when you are in the sun, always wear sunscreen. Use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher, and be sure to rub it evenly into your skin. You should also wear a hat and try to play in the shade.
Whether you ride a bike, ride a scooter, or use in-line skates, be wheel safe. The most serious way kids get hurt while on wheels is by hitting their heads. So always wear a helmet when you are playing on wheels. When you ride scooters and use in-line skates, always wear wrist guards, kneepads, and elbow pads.
What's the Right Way to Wear a Helmet?
A helmet should be straight on the head, just above the eyebrows.
The chin strap should be snug but not too tight.
The rear straps go behind the ears; the front straps should run up and down.
One way to beat the summer heat is by swimming in a cool pool. To stay safe when you swim, you need to follow water-safety rules. Be water safe by swimming only when a grown-up is nearby. You should always swim with a buddy.

Robins build nests to lay thier eggs. A robin's nest is made of grass and mud. The mud helps the pieces of grass stick together. The nest is in the shape of a bowl. Robins usually build their nests in trees and shrubs.
A mother robin lays her eggs in the nest. Three to five eggs are laid at one time. The robin eggs are light blue. The mother sits on top of the eggs to keep them safe and warm. Baby robins hatch in about two weeks.
When a robin hatches from its egg, it has no feathers and it is blind. Its parents need to take care of it. The parents bring worms, spiders, and insects for the babies to eat. Baby robins grow up fast. After about two weeks, baby robins will leave their nest.
Why might a mother robin build her nest in a tree or shrub?
A father robin watches the young bird after it leaves the nest. He feeds it and teaches it where to find food. When fall comes, the young robin is ready to live and fly on its own.

Popocatpetl means ""smoking mountain"" in a language once spoken in Mexico. It is also the name of a Mexican volcano, which people have nicknamed ""Popo."" Mexico is a country just south of the United States.
Late last year, a volcano called Popo erupted. Gases and ash filled the air. No one was hurt by the eruption. Scientists studying Popo knew it was going to erupt. About 50,000 people live in the villages and towns that surround Popo. The scientists warned those people. Many of the residents left their homes before the eruption.
Inside Popo and below Earth's surface, temperatures were about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit before Popo popped. Scientists from Mexico and the United States used special tools to keep track of what was happening inside Popo. One tool detected that
, or melted rock, was rising inside the volcano.
During eruptions, magma can spill out of openings in volcanoes. The hot, flowing magma is called
when it is outside the volcano. When Popo erupted, only heat, gas, and ashes burst out.
After the eruption, the residents were able to return to their homes. But they are watching for future eruptions.
Lava and ash from volcanoes can harm people. What else might these substances harm?
Popo is almost 18,000 feet high. Last Year's eruption was its biggest in 1,200 years.
About 550 volcanoes have erupted on Earth's surface since people began recording history.
A volcano erupts somewhere on Earth about once a week. Not all eruptions are big, however.

This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
. That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's as Easy as One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.
Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?
