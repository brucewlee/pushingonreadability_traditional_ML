The First World War would start in two years. Birling's optimistic view that there would not be a war is completely wrong.
The Second World War ended on 8 May 1945. People were recovering from nearly six years of warfare, danger and uncertainty.
There were strong distinctions between the upper and lower classes.
Class distinctions had been greatly reduced as a result of two world wars.
Women were subservient to men. All a well off women could do was get married; a poor woman was seen as cheap labour.
As a result of the wars, women had earned a more valued place in society.
The ruling classes saw no need to change the status quo.
There was a great desire for social change. Immediately after The Second World War, Clement Attlee's Labour Party won a landslide victory over Winston Churchill and the Conservatives.
Priestley deliberately set his play in 1912 because the date represented an era when all was very different from the time he was writing. In 1912, rigid class and gender boundaries seemed to ensure that nothing would change. Yet by 1945, most of those class and gender divisions had been breached. Priestley wanted to make the most of these changes. Through this play, he encourages people to seize the opportunity the end of the war had given them to build a better, more caring society.

When there have been large numbers of job losses in an area which has undergone de-industrialisation, such as South Wales, the government and the EU will often intervene to improve the environment and quality of life for local people. Other areas which have been affected include Merseyside, Tyneside and Belfast with the decline of shipbuilding.
Industry is actively encouraged to locate in areas of low employment with incentives such as grants, subsidies and low rents.
Improvements which have accompanied the re-industrialisation in South Wales include:

It may damage the well-being of humans and other species - for example, it can pollute drinking-water supplies or poison plants and animals.
It may interfere with natural processes - for example, it could change local climatic conditions or destroy wildlife habitats.
It may impact on people's livelihoods - for example, pollution of the sea will hurt people who are involved in fishing and tourism.

The court wanted Exxon to pay to help compensate those people in Alaska whose livelihoods were hurt the worst. The 2.5bn pay out is the latest ruling in a long-running court case.
Traditionally, most retail outlets were located in the CBD. The centre of town was a logical place for shops because it was the most accessible part of a town and transport links radiate out from this point.
In the late 20th century, traffic congestion reduced accessibility to inner cities. This led to out of town locations becoming favoured for the retail industry. They are close to the suburbs and are accessible for many people via ring roads and motorways. Land is also cheaper in this part of a settlement, making it attractive to retailers.
A Next store in Hemel Hempstead, Herts
The result of this is that more people shop out of town, rather than in a CBD. The reduction in profits in the CBD can cause smaller branches of chain stores to close down, eg Next in St. Albans has recently closed in favour of the larger out of town store at the nearby Colney Fields retail park. Colney Fields benefits from free parking and easy access to the M25, giving it a wider sphere of influence than the smaller town centre store. Can you think of an example in your local area?
If this becomes widespread, areas in the centre of town can become derelict and unattractive, further discouraging people from shopping there. Also, unless bus or rail links are adequate, people without cars have limited access to shopping facilities.

Describe the peer review process. For instance, state that other scientists repeat the experiment to see if they get similar results and conclusions.
Understand that new scientific claims are less reliable if they have not yet been evaluated by peer review. For example, remarkable claims are being made for 'superfoods', such as that they prevent heart disease and increase longevity. However, many of the claims have not yet been peer reviewed, so they should not be treated as totally reliable.
Understand that if the results of an investigation have not been replicated by other scientists, they should be treated with suspicion.
Using the example of how lifestyle factors can affect the risk of heart disease, you need to be able to explain why scientists think it is important that a claim by one scientist should be replicated by other scientists.

The first attempt in Britain to improve roads started in 1663. This was when the Turnpike Trust was set up. The trusts had one simple aim:
to charge people to use newly improved roads
and then the money raised from the tolls was used to pay for the upkeep of the roads.

As you can see from the illustration, the road engineers built

5100,"Stalin's Russia was strong enough to defeat the irresistible Nazi armies, and to become for the next half-century one of the two superpowers on the world stage. Yet Stalin was a leader who instituted a terror that reputedly sent 10 million people to death. So was Stalin a monster, or a necessary evil for Russia's survival?
In 1956, three years after Stalin's death, Nikita Khrushchev gave a speech stating that:
'He killed thousands of Communists. He was changeable, irritable and brutal, a very distrustful man, diseased with suspicion. His rule was one of torture and oppression.'
to say what you felt about Stalin, the German writer Klaus Menhert went around asking people what they felt about Stalin. This is what four of them said:
""The blood-sucker! Just think of the number of people whose lives he ruined.""
""Who won the war for us? Who raised Russia from a backward country to the most powerful state in the world?""
""Of course, some bad things happened under his rule, but there were a hell of a lot more good things.""
""He murdered the best of our people because he was determined to be the sole boss.""

933,"The fractions from crude oil all contain hydrocarbons, molecules that are made from hydrogen and carbon atoms only.
Hydrocarbons with small molecules make better fuels than hydrocarbons with large molecules. This is because small hydrocarbon molecules:
are more volatile - turn into a gas more easily
are less viscous - they flow more easily
burn with a cleaner, less sooty flame
Fuels burn when they react with oxygen in the air. The hydrogen in hydrocarbons is oxidised to water - remember that water, H
O, is an oxide of hydrogen. If there is plenty of air, we get complete combustion and the carbon in hydrocarbons is oxidised to carbon dioxide:
hydrocarbon + oxygen  water + carbon dioxide
If there is insufficient air for complete combustion, for example in faulty gas fires, we get incomplete combustion instead. The hydrogen is still oxidised to water, but instead of carbon dioxide we get carbon monoxide. This is a toxic gas that sticks to the haemoglobin in our red blood cells, which lowers the capacity of the blood to carry oxygen to our cells.
Particles of carbon, seen as soot or smoke, are also released. These can cause respiratory diseases such as asthma.

Suppose 3.2g of sulfur reacts with oxygen to produce 6.4g of sulfur oxide. What is the formula of the oxide?
of sulfur is 32 and the A
Find the mass of each element. Conservation of mass tells us that the mass of oxygen = the mass of sulfur oxide - the mass of sulfur.
The mass of oxygen reacted = 6.4 - 3.2 = 3.2g
So we have 3.2g of sulfur and 3.2g of oxygen.
Now divide the mass of each element by its A
Finally, find the ratio of the elements.
You can do this by dividing the results by the smallest of the numbers to give you the number of atoms of each element in the compound.
In this case the smallest value is 0.1, so divide both results by that.
S = 0.1  0.1 = 1
O = 0.2  0.1 = 2
(If one of the numbers ends in 0.5, multiply all the numbers by 2 - this is because you cannot have half-atoms in a compound.)
So the ratio of sulfur to oxygen is 1:2
The number of atoms tells you that the formula for sulfur oxide is SO

when pregnancy might harm the mental or physical condition of the mother
to limit the number of children people have to ensure they don't damage living standards or affect other children
to prevent pregnancy in people who do not want a child at this stage in their lives
Contraception, including artificial contraception, is permitted in Judaism in appropriate circumstances.
Reform and Liberal schools of Judaism allow birth control for a wide range of reasons. Orthodox Judaism is more restrictive.
The methods of contraception allowed under Jewish law are those that do not damage the sperm or stop it getting to its intended destination. These are the contraceptive pill and the IUD.
Judaism teaches that life is a sacred gift from God:
Then God said, Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
Sexual intercourse is seen as an important part of marriage. It is part of a husbands duty and a womans rights. Judaism is generally opposed to contraception because of teachings such as:
He who fashioned and made the earth he did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited
God blessed them and said to them, Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.
Contraceptives are also thought to interfere with the physical union between a man and a woman:
For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.
On the other hand any restriction on the use of contraceptives can be lifted if the mothers life is at risk in any way.

starts with an old man looking after his pigeons. He has a favourite - a young, healthy bird that he is holding carefully. The man looks out happily across the countryside, until he sees his granddaughter swinging on a gate in the distance. The old man suddenly appears annoyed. He almost allows the young pigeon to fly off, then grabs it and locks it away in the small box.
He calls to his granddaughter, Alice, who comes over to speak to him, even though it is clear she is waiting to meet her boyfriend, Steven. The grandfather criticises her and threatens to tell her mother about the relationship. The girl simply laughs and says: 'Tell away!' She then wanders off singing a love song to annoy him.
The old man thinks about how the house was once full of grandchildren and full of life, but as the children grew up it became empty and he would soon be alone. He wants to apologise to Alice, but only mutters it - she cannot hear what he starts to say. He then becomes angry when he sees her meet her boyfriend and walk around the garden with him.
'Can't we keep her a bit longer?'
The old man talks to his daughter
The grandfather goes into the house feeling confused and angry, thinking all the time about his granddaughter and believing she has made a mistake by falling in love with Steven. He speaks to his daughter, Lucy, who does not seem at all concerned about Alice and Steven.
Lucy tries to calm her father down, but he gets more and more angry. He thinks about how all his granddaughters changed as soon as they got married. Lucy in turn blames her father for upsetting her girls - then announces Alice is to get married in a month's time. The old man says nothing. He walks out into the garden crying.
""He lifted the bird on his wrist, and watched it soar.""
The grandfather and Steven watch the pigeons fly away
The grandfather meets Alice and Steven almost immediately. Steven has a gift for him - a young pigeon - and the couple both fuss around the grandfather and lead him over to where the other pigeons are kept. They then move away to chat in private while the old man looks after the new bird, then locks it away in a box.
The old man takes out his favourite bird - the one he would not release at the start of the story. He knows it is too young to return to him, but lets it go anyway. Alice, Steven and Lucy all see the pigeon fly up, and the old man gets the impression that everything has stopped - even the wind - to watch this bird escape.
The older pigeons have also flown up, and they return. The young bird, the man's favourite, has disappeared. He smiles proudly at his granddaughter. She seems astonished by his actions and stares at him, crying.
is a very short story. We do not know many facts about the four main characters, and the events take place over perhaps just an hour in the man's life. We learn very little of what took place before this, and nothing of what happens after.
The story is deliberately unclear, especially when you look for reasons why someone does something. For instance, we cannot be sure why the old man lets his favourite bird leave. And we can only guess why Alice is crying at the end.
We do, however, get a clear picture of the different characters and their relationships with one another. This is what you need to concentrate on in your answers. The next section looks in detail at how you should write about the characters, and what part they play in the story.

You will need to take a range of pictures using a digital camera. Think about the
you want. It may sound obvious, but it's an essential aspect of getting the image you want. Before you start work, note down what you want to achieve.
Although some settings differ on the many different types of digital camera, most have the same basic
. Look at the diagram and table below to learn about the most common
The different elements that make up a system or device.
Turns the camera on and off. Some digitial cameras will have a power-saving mode that automatically turns the camera off when it's not in use.
Press this to take a photograph. Many newer cameras have an auto-focus function that is operated by holding the shutter button half way down to focus on the object. There might be a beep or icon on the LCD monitor to let you know when it is focussed. You then press the button all the way down to take the photograph.
This allows you to switch between the different modes of the camera - still photograph, video clip, or view photos. Sometimes there's a dial instead of a switch, or buttons. Check the camera manual if necessary.
Look through this to view your shot and playback photographs and video clips. You can also change the settings of the camera using the LCD monitor.
Instead of using the LCD monitor to compose your shots, you may prefer to look through the viewfinder (as you would with a non-digital camera). It saves power if you turn off the LCD monitor when using the viewfinder.
Close or tight shots are good for capturing
or atmosphere. Think about when you watch a sports match. When you are up close you can see the players sweating and hear the grunts as they immerse themselves in the game, which in turn arouses your interest. This also applies when capturing images, so focus on what you want to show, and

Capturing action shots requires practise. You could practise capturing images of footballers in action, but make sure you have their permission first. Take

Two images of a park - the first has too many focal points - a bench, trees, grass, people; the second has one clear focal point - a tree
There are too many focal points (people, trees, bench) in the first image shown above, whereas the second image shows the tree as the clear focal point.
Arrange your subjects to ensure you translate what you want the audience to focus on. Use

Two photographs of an iron - one with a messy background and one with a plain background
In the first image above, the messy background takes the focus away from the iron.
Have you ever taken a picture of a landscape and been disappointed when you have not captured the beauty of it?
There are several reasons why the camera views something differently from the human eye. We have the ability to interpret an image and enhance it, because the brain has the ability to process lots of different things at a time. The camera has a limited focus range whereas the eye is constantly scanning the scenery, recomposing it, and responding to changes in light conditions. The eyes work in conjunction with the brain to create the splendid image that you can see. A camera has a much narrower exposure range than the human eye.
and capture an attractive feature following the rules of taking good digital images. Once again, take lots of photos to ensure you capture one that is perfect.
Photographs with the focal point exactly in the centre can lack depth and interest, so it's better to position your focal point
. To do this, apply the rule of thirds. Draw two horizontal and two vertical lines through the picture you want to capture, to divide it into thirds.
The eyes are naturally drawn to the
illustrated in red above, so place the important elements of your picture on one (or more) of these points.
Compare the two images above. A focal point placed in the centre (as in image 1, above) often just looks boring, so as a rule avoid placing your focal point in the centre. You will see this rule being applied in any magazine you look at.
that is used when the camera senses there isn't enough natural light. It's good to keep the flash on automatic, to make sure your photographs are illuminated well. You need to experiment with your flash, to work out its
. Generally, most flashes work up to 10 metres away - any further, and your subject is likely to appear dark.
Also think about natural light, especially outside. Try to make sure the sun/light source is

shots, so experiment with using your camera horizontally and vertically. A photograph of Nelson's Column, for example, would be ideal for a vertical shot to illustrate the towering effect the coloumn has on its surrounding scenery.
Nelson's Column is ideal for a vertical shot.

Once you have mastered these rules, you can then begin to break them. With digital photography, it's easy to take lots of pictures, so don't be afraid to

Connecting a digital camera to a computer using a wire
The most common way to transfer photos from the camera onto the computer is through connecting the camera to the computer using a
a data communications technology that provides broadband Internet speeds over the cable television infrastructure
Plug the camera cable into the back of your computer. Make sure it is connected to the camera at the other end.
Once connected, turn your camera on at the power button.
On your computer, follow the on-screen instructions and choose the folder that you would like your images to be downloaded to. Normally, they will be saved as .JPG files, which is the best format to use for digital photographs.
There are other ways to transfer your photographs to your computer. You could take the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into a

Before the industrial revolution in Britain, most peppered moths were of the pale variety. This meant that they were camouflaged against the pale birch trees that they rest on. Moths with a mutant black colouring were easily spotted and eaten by birds. This gave the white variety an advantage, and they were more likely to survive to reproduce.
Airborne pollution in industrial areas blackened the birch tree bark with soot. This meant that the mutant black moths were now camouflaged, while the white variety became more vulnerable to predators. This gave the black variety an advantage, and they were more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, the black peppered moths became far more numerous in urban areas than the pale variety.

2453,"With the election of 1936 looming and
still a major problem Roosevelt introduced more
in the second New Deal. He wanted to further reform America and improve people's lives.
Although Roosevelt restored hope and staved off the collapse of the banking system, the problem of unemployment was more difficult and at the start of 1934 there was still 11.3 million people out of work. Some historians have said that failing to deal with unemployment was the biggest weakness of the New Deal. Criticism of Roosevelt emerged from several directions.
With this criticism in mind and the 1936 presidential election on the horizon, the New Deal began to change direction. Some historians have interpreted the change by saying there were two New Deals - the first dealing with the immediate emergency of 1933-34 and the second, which emerged in 1935-1936, offering more radical, reforming policies:
- this agency employed people to build schools, hospitals and other public buildings.
- this agency aimed to bring electricity to America's farms.
(Wagner Act) - this act aimed to improve relations between workers and employers, especially as 1934 had seen a series of violent industrial disputes.
Some historians say that, where the first New Deal aimed to save America and its capitalist economic system, the second New Deal aimed to change America.
The wealthy businessmen behind the American Liberty League argued that by increasing taxation and encouraging the development of the trade union movement, Roosevelt had
his own class (Roosevelt was from a very wealthy family).

Cartoon titled 'The Illegal Act' - caption reads: 'I'm sorry, but the Supreme Court says I must chuck you back again'
Does Source A criticise or support the New Deal?
At first glance, the cartoon could be mistaken for criticising Roosevelt and the New Deal. It looks like Roosevelt is rescuing another person from the sea of Depression and pulling him into his National Recovery boat. Many New Deal critics were opposed to the cost of the New Deal to the American taxpayer.
However, the cartoon is actually criticising the US Supreme Court - the caption gives it away - Roosevelt is saying: ""I'm sorry but the Supreme Court says I must chuck you back again"", and he is shown to be pushing the man's head down. This is because the Supreme Court did not agree with many of Roosevelt's New Deal proposals and, therefore, did not pass them.
This cartoon sympathises with Roosevelt as it shows him unwillingly pushing away the man who needs saving.

Corries, also known as cwms or cirques, are often the starting point of a glacier. The diagram below shows the formation of a corrie, cwm or cirque.
Snowflakes collect in a hollow. As more snow falls, the snow is compressed and the air is squeezed out to become

. With the pressure of more layers of snow, the firn will, over thousands of years, become glacier ice. Erosion and weathering by abrasion, plucking and freeze-thaw action will gradually make the hollow bigger.
Even though the ice is trapped in a hollow and unable to move down hill, gravity will still encourage it to move. This circular motion is known as
and can cause the ice to pull away from the backwall creating a crevasse or bergschrund. Plucked debris from the backwall causes further erosion through abrasion which deepens the corrie.
Some of this debris is deposited at the edge of the corrie, building up the lip.
These processes create a characteristic rounded, armchair shaped hollow with a steep back wall.
When ice in a corrie melts, a circular lake is often formed at the bottom of the hollow. This is known as a

As a glacier flows over the land, it flows over hard rock and softer rock. Softer rock is less resistant, so a glacier will carve a deeper trough. When the glacier has retreated, (melted) water will collect in the deeper area and create a long, thin lake called a

Teacher's notes: This question is worth 6 marks in the exam. Give yourself 7 - 8 minutes to answer it.
Mark Scheme: In History you are marked by levels. The higher the level the more marks you get and so the higher grade you will achieve.
The answer will be general providing some information related to the question but it will not adequately explain reaction to the Agreement.
The answer will discuss how the Agreement was viewed but will concentrate on either the unionist reaction or the nationalist reaction but not both.
The answer will reflect fully on the varied reactions of both nationalists and unionists to the Anglo Irish Agreement.
In November 1985 an agreement was signed by Margaret Thatcher the British Prime Minister and the Irish Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald which has become known as the Anglo-Irish Agreement. It was officially lodged with the United Nations and it recognised the right of the Irish Republic to have a say in the affairs of N. Ireland. Unionists were very opposed to the Agreement and nationalists supported it.
John would get a level 1 for this answer. Much of his answer is mere description. There is no need to include narrative. The candidate needs to get straight to the point of the question - how did nationalists and unionists view the Agreement and how did they react to it. The candidate merely refers to these points in his concluding sentence.
The Anglo Irish Agreement signed in November 1985 was heavily criticized by many unionists. They felt the British government had betrayed them by allowing the government of the Irish Republic to have a say in N. Ireland affairs. Unionists were not reassured by promises that N. Ireland would remain part of the United Kingdom as long as the majority of the population desired it. They believed that Mrs Thatcher had given in to Provisional IRA violence and they felt that a United Ireland would soon be established. As a result they organised a number of demonstrations to protest against the Agreement.
Mary would get a level 2 for this answer. The candidate has produced a reasonable answer. All of her answer is relevant to the question but it lacks balance. She comments well on unionist reaction to the Agreement but ignores completely the nationalist response.
Unionists and nationalists reacted very differently to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Unionists had not been informed in advance of the Agreement and were surprised and greatly angered by it. They strongly objected to giving the Republic of Ireland any say in the affairs of N. Ireland and believed that by doing so Margaret Thatcher was making concessions to Provisional IRA violence. Unionists organised an ""Ulster Says No"" campaign which involved numerous street demonstrations. All 15 unionist MPs at Westminster resigned their seats in protest. The Alliance Party was the only pro-union party to give its support to the Agreement
The Nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party welcomed the Agreement. They argued that the interests of nationalists in the north of Ireland would now be protected. The Workers' Party also expressed some support but Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA were very hostile to an Agreement which they believed guaranteed partition, for the Republic's government had officially recognised for the first time the state of Northern Ireland. Attitudes to the Agreement were divided in the South of Ireland. The Agreement was approved by the Dail by 88 votes to 75 but it was opposed by the Fianna Fail party and by leading political figures such as Mary Robinson, later president of Ireland.
William would get a level 3 for this answer. The candidate has produced a high quality answer. He is aware of how controversial the Agreement was and deals fully with the varied responses of nationalists and unionists.

Their job was to keep the home nice for their husband and family - their life should revolve round the three 'Ks':
""The mission of women is to be beautiful and to bring children into the world.""
, so the population would grow. The Nazis even considered making it law that families should have at least four children. Girls did keep fit in the
Bund Deutscher Madel - the German group for girls age 14+
to make themselves healthy for childbirth, but they were discouraged from staying slim, because it was thought that thin women had trouble giving birth.
gave newly wed couples a loan of 1,000 marks, and allowed them to keep 250 marks for each child they had. Mothers who had more than eight children were given a gold medal. Unmarried women could volunteer to have a baby for an

Also known as the Blackshirts. A German police/ military style organisation created to serve as the personal bodyguards of Adolf Hitler. In Hitler's Germany they eventually controlled the intelligence, security and police forces, and extermination of those they considered undesirable.
Women were supposed to emulate traditional German peasant fashions - plain peasant costumes, hair in plaits or buns and flat shoes. They were not expected to wear make-up or trousers, dye their hair or smoke in public.
Study the painting by Wolf Willrich and identify five ways in which this family illustrates the perfect Nazi ideal.
Here are ten ways in which the painting represents the Nazi ideal:
The family has four children, and the mother has just had a baby.
The mother is caring for the baby.
She has her hair in a bun; she is not wearing make-up.
The family lives in a rural/farming environment.
The boy wears his Hitler Youth uniform and is making something out of the clay.
The younger sister plays with a doll - preparation for motherhood.
The elder sister has plaited hair (acceptable fashions), and gazes longingly at the baby (longing for motherhood).
The family have fair hair, athletic bodies and ruddy complexions - they are the ideal Aryans.

This is used to detect genetic disorders where the symptoms develop later in life, such as Huntingtons disorder. Predictive testing can be valuable to people who have no symptoms but have a family member with a genetic disorder. The results can help to inform decisions about possible medical care.
Genetic tests are not available for every possible inherited disorder. And they are not completely reliable. They may produce false positive, or false negative, results. These can have serious consequences.
A false positive occurs when a genetic test has wrongly detected a certain allele or faulty chromosome. The individual or family could believe something is wrong when it is not. This may lead them to decide not to start a family, or to choose an abortion, in order to avoid having a baby with a genetic disorder.
A false negative happens when a genetic test has failed to detect a certain allele or faulty chromosome. The individual or family would be wrongly reassured. This may lead them to decide to start a family or continue with a pregnancy.

, plus various other roles. You do not need to refer to many of these. Depending on your task, you might just focus on one or two characters. The starting point is to sort out who they are, how they develop, and how they relate to each other.
Juliet is 13 and the daughter of Capulet and Lady Capulet. Her character at first appears to be quiet, obedient and innocent. She then meets Romeo and shows she is not as shy as we think. She speaks as much as him and in the same style, and they kiss twice.
She then tells the audience of her love for Romeo, knowing his family is hated by hers. She later announces her love for him again, not knowing he can hear.
Her thoughts are complex, showing her intelligence, and that her love of Romeo is sincere. When she realises he is there, her thoughts are immediately for his safety. She asks him to say he loves her, yet seems very practical about it, not wanting any proof - just his word.
Juliet shows her independence by proposing marriage. She also says she will follow Romeo 'throughout the world'. Juliet does not doubt her husband, even when she learns he has killed her cousin. She is prepared to commit suicide for him, then bravely carries out the Friar's plan, meaning she disobeys her parents and takes a huge risk. Finally, she commits suicide when she discovers Romeo dead beside her.
Those are the basic details of her character. We can now look at how you could use these in your work. Knowing the facts about a character is only the start, though. We need to be able to use them effectively. One way to do this is to have details or quotes from the play to support our ideas. For instance:
She says very little in Act 1, Scene 3
We are told she is not quite 14 several times
She lets Romeo kiss her at their first meeting
She tells Romeo he kisses 'by th'book' (that he kisses well or without any real feeling)
She says he is her 'only love'
She says: 'All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay'
She asks: 'Shall I speak ill of my husband?' and later gives her 'ring to my true knight'
She tells her 'I will not marry', and that she will marry Romeo rather than Paris
She says 'Tell me not of fear', and is quick to commit suicide, saying 'I'll be brief'

The firm's accountants monitor and record the actual financial performance of the firm against the budget, so that its likely financial performance can be forecast. When the two are compared there will usually be a difference. Adjustments will be made for the next budget or forecast.
Now look at both in detail and try to remember three ways of raising finance from each source.
The board of a public limited company may retain profits for a year rather than share it amongst the owners. The cash can be invested to earn interest.
Assets that are no longer required, like an outdated computer or an obsolete piece of machinery, can be sold.
Stock levels can be reduced and funds made available for other uses.
A sole trader or a small business may be able to borrow money from family or friends without paying interest.
Loans from a bank or a building society can be expensive. An agreed amount is borrowed and repaid over a fixed period of time with interest.
Grants from central or local government will cost the firm nothing.
Firms often lease equipment or machinery to avoid a large outlay of cash. This is useful if a firm needs to upgrade within the medium term as technology advances.

It is a bloodthirsty tale of ambition, and the evils we will go to in order to get what we want. We follow the central character, Macbeth, as he plots and kills in order to become king. And as soon as he is crowned, we watch as his world falls apart around him.
The play is considered very unlucky - actors shouldn't even say the word 'Macbeth' if they aren't on the stage performing it. So that's why people talk about 'The Scottish play', or 'The Comedy of Glamis', or even just 'The Play'. In fact, anything but

One reason for keeping quiet is that some people thought Shakespeare didn't just include witches as characters in his play, he actually wrote real magic spells in some of the lines. Because of this, the play was cursed - legend has it that an actor died on the opening night, and lots of others have died since.

Yeats wrote a great deal about the passage of time, and of youth and beauty giving way to old age and death.
A central, unifying idea that runs through a text or performance.
. The poem contrasts two types of human endeavour: the young women's dreams of love and obsession with appearance; and the hard, grinding, thankless work that is the Old Mother's lot.
An interesting cross-current is set going by our uncertainty about who the young women are.
Are they the Old Mother's own children? If so, their idleness is easier to forgive. Perhaps in her youth the old woman herself dreamed of love, lay late in bed, and obsessed about whether her ribbons matched. Perhaps, as old people often do, she has forgotten what it's like to be young!
Or are they the children of the old woman's rich employers? If they are, we are more likely to view them as spoilt and selfish young people whose idle lives are made possible only by the drudgery of poor servants like the Old Mother.
And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress:
While I must work because I am old,
And the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold.'

He is scrupulously honest. He tells Jem and Scout the truth about their relatives - rather than the gilded version Aunt Alexandra prefers. When he mistakenly believes that it was Jem who killed Mr Ewell, he is keen not to prevent Jem being punished.
He has a dry sense of humour. For instance, when Jem is anxious about going to Mrs Dubose's to read because it is dark and spooky, Atticus tells him: ""That should appeal to your imagination. Just imagine you're inside the Radley house"".
He always sees the best in people. Far from disliking Mrs Dubose, with her strongly racist views, he admires her for battling against her morphine addiction.
The only person who has some influence over him is his sister, Aunt Alexandra, who tries to control how he brings up Jem and Scout. However, he does not give in to her request to drop Tom Robinson's case.

Heavy industry in the Ruhr  A case study
Natural resources such as coal, iron ore and limestone enabled the iron and steel industry to develop in the Ruhr. The chemical and textile industries also grew due to good transport links and available workforce.
Canals and rivers such as the Rhine were used for transport and power.
The area developed industrially in the 1930s and 1940s to supply arms for Germany.
Up until the 1970s the factories and associated services were an important source of employment for people in the region.
The decline in the Ruhr's importance as a heavy industrial area has caused job losses in steelworks and coal mines. Many people have left the area, eg cities such as Dortmund, due to economic and associated social problems.
The environmental legacy of the heavy industry in the area includes waste tips from coal mining, air and water pollution.
Many of the original raw materials are exhausted, there are high labour costs and old, outdated machinery. This has led to cheaper steel being imported from south east Asia where labour costs are lower. This is one of the drawbacks of globalisation for MEDC industry.
Many of the problems and changes in the Ruhr have also been experienced in other industrial regions in the EU such as South Wales.
There is still a large workforce living in the area that have had to learn new skills as industries have changed.
New industries, eg electronics, are moving in to replace the traditional heavy industries.

28 = 2 x 2 x 7
How do we write a number as a product of its prime factors?
Write 24 as a product of its prime factors.
There are lots of ways to solve this. Here are two:
Start with the smallest prime number that divides into 24, in this case 2. (2 divides into all even numbers.) So we can write 24 as:
Now think of the smallest prime number that divides into 12. Again we can use 2, and write the 12 as 2 x 6, to give.
24 = 2 x 2 x 6
6 also divides by 2 (6 = 2 x 3), so we have:
24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3
2, 2, 2 and 3 are all prime numbers, so we have our answer.
In short, we would write the solution as:
= 2 x 2 x 2 x 3
We can also use a factor tree:
This shows us that 24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3
Remember that we can write these factors in index form. In this case

Standard of living of a person or a population is usually measured in economic terms, ie how much wealth they have. It also takes into account what there is to spend more on, ie the goods and services that are available for purchase. Life expectancy, literacy rate and other indicators may also be taken into account, when determining standard of living.
Gross Domestic Product [GDP] measures the wealth or income of a country. It is the total value of goods and services produced by a country in a year.

Development indices can be misleading and need to be used with care. For example:
Many indices are averages for the whole population of a country. This means that indices do not always reveal substantial inequalities between different segments of society. For example, a portion of the population of a highly developed country could be living below the poverty line.
In some countries, the data used in indices could be out of date or hard to collect. Some countries do not wish to have certain index data collected - for example, many countries do not publish statistics rabout the number of immigrants and migrants.

Most audiences these days don't believe in witches as they did in Shakespeare's time. This means a modern director has to approach the problem of the witches in a way that is

2255,"Read the following three sample answers to this question. Which one do you think would get the highest grade?
We heard you are planning to raise money for the British Red Cross. Thats a great idea! We planned a fundraiser when we were in year 10 and thought you might like some advice.
You need to get as many people as possible to give money, so think about an event that includes the whole school, staff as well, and maybe even the parents.
Last year, we sold sandwiches, pizza and cakes at break time from the school canteen. Lots of people came and bought food, including some of our parents.
It takes longer than you think to plan an event, so think about doing it next term. If you do a sponsored walk, for example, you will need to:
allow students long enough to collect sponsors
allow time for the money to be collected
How many people do you want to involve? How much money do you want to raise? Probably the answer to both these questions is LOADS, but if you are too ambitious it will be harder to organise.
Try to set an amount of money that you want to raise, keep it realistic, only huge organisations such as Comic Relief can raise millions. Then think about how many people you would need to raise 10, for example, for you to reach your target. If you decide to raise 200, then you need 10 people to make 20 each. Is that too hard, or too easy?
You will need a detailed list of what needs to be organised. The easiest thing is to appoint one person to be in charge of each section. You need to make sure that you have regular meetings, so everybody knows what is going on. Setting some deadlines would be a good idea because it makes sure everyone gets on with their job. Maybe you could ask a form tutor to sit in on your meetings so that they dont get too out of control.
The main thing is to be ORGANISED.
Once you have raised the money, you wont want to loose it! Last year, we asked one of the administrative staff to be in charge of collecting it. You will have to ask nicely! They will need a list of all the people who collected money so they can be crossed off once they have given it in. The school will write a cheque to your charity once all the money is collected.
Good luck with it. We had really good fun last year when we did our cake sale and raised 200!
I thought you would like some help with raising money for the British Red Cross. I think you should make sure you have an event that works such as a sponsored walk or selling food to the staff at break time. I would like a non-uniform day. You can charge people not to wear school uniform, also the teachers have to wear uniform. You should make sure that you set a target for how many people and how much money you want. Also you must avoid problems like people not joining in or people not helping when you have asked them to. You should get your form tutor to help you. Give all the money you raise to the school office, so it doesnt get lost or nicked.
If you want some help with your fundraising, you should read this. We did fundraising last year and heres what we discovered.
You need to plan an event that people will like and be interested in it. Maybe a fashion show or a sponsored walk.
Its good to plan the event very well so nothing goes wrong. You should get a committee together and give out the jobs and make sure you have lots of meetings so every one is working on what they should be doing.
You need to have some targets. This means deciding how much money you want to raise and how many people should be helping out.
To avoid problems, you probably need to get your form tutor to hold a meeting with everyone and get him or her to decide who has what jobs.
Dont let the money you raise get lost, thats very important.

Multiplying decimals is the same as multiplying two whole numbers. You just need to remember the following:
If there is one digit after the decimal point in the question, there will be one digit after the decimal point in the answer.
If there are two digits after the decimal point in the question, there will be two digits after the decimal point in the answer etc.
For example to calculate 3.42  2 we work out 342  2 and then work out where to put the decimal point.
There are two digits after the decimal point in the question (3.42 x 2), so there will be two digits after the decimal point in the answer. Therefore 3.42  2 = 6.84
First work out 12 x 11 = 132
Now count the digits behind decimals points in the question. There are two of them. So you need two digits behind the decimal point in your answer. So 1.2 x 1.1 = 1.32
When dividing a decimal by a whole number, divide as usual but keep the decimal points aligned
(Note that the decimal points are in the same place.)
If you are dividing a decimal by another decimal, you need to use equivalent fractions.

Recycling is an important way to help us achieve sustainable development. We can recycle many resources, including:
Glass is easily recycled. It can be melted and remoulded to make new objects, such as bottles. The energy needed to do this is less than the energy needed to make new glass from its raw materials. However, we need to sort different coloured glass ready for recycling, and transport it to the recycling plant.
Just like glass, it takes less energy to melt and remould metals than it does to extract new metals from their ores. Aluminium is a valuable metal that melts at a relatively low temperature, and is particularly attractive for recycling. However, a lot of metals that we use are mixtures called alloys, and it can be difficult to sort different metals ready for recycling.
Paper is not melted when it is recycled. Instead, it is broken up into small pieces and reformed to make new sheets of paper. This takes less energy to do than making paper from trees. However, paper can only be recycled a few times before its fibres become too short to be useful, and the recycled paper is often only good enough for toilet paper or cardboard. But it can be used as a fuel or compost instead.

point is when a firm begins to make a profit. It will make a loss if it produces and sells output below this level.
The breakeven point for a firm is when total costs equals total revenue. Expenditure and income are the same and the firm makes neither a profit or a loss. If the firm can sell at production levels above this point, it will be making a profit. If sales fall below this point, it will be making a loss. Establishing the breakeven point helps a firm to plan the levels of production it needs to be profitable.
Before you can calculate the breakeven point, you need to identify the firm's costs. These include:
Renting an office block is part of a company's fixed costs
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
are constant and do not change however many goods are produced. They include rent and insurance.
Wages paid to employees are part of a company's variable costs
These change according to output eg raw materials.
include raw materials and wages. You need to calculate the variable costs per unit. These costs increase in direct proportion to the number of units produced.
By adding the firm's variable costs and fixed costs you can work out the
Fixed costs plus variable costs make total costs.
The firm's variable costs are added to the fixed costs and these make the total costs.
You need to establish how many units are to be produced.
You need to know the selling price of the units.
Once you have the above information, you can begin to calculate the breakeven point. You do this either by using a chart or an equation.
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
These change according to output eg raw materials.
You may find it helpful to work through the
Here is how to work out the breakeven point, using the example of a firm manufacturing compact discs. You can assume the firm has the following costs:
You first construct a chart with output (units) on the horizontal (x) axis, and costs and revenue on the vertical (y) axis. On to this, you plot a horizontal fixed costs line (it is horizontal because fixed costs don't changewith output).
Then you plot a variable cost line from this point, which will, in effect, be the total costs line. This is because the fixed cost added to the variable cost gives the total cost. To do this, you multiply:
variable cost per unit  number of units
In this example of the CD manufacturing firm, you can assume that the variable cost per unit is 2 and there are 2 000 units = 4,000
Once you have done this, you are ready to plot the
The value of sales at a given output ie sales price multiplied by output.
sales price  number of units (output)
If the sales price is 6.00 and 2.000 items were to be manufactured, the calculation is:
6.00  2,000 = 12,000 total revenue
Where the total revenue line crosses the total costs line is the breakeven point (ie costs and revenue are the same). Everything below this point is produced at a loss, and everything above it is produced at a profit.
Fixed costs: 10,000, Variable costs: 2 per unit, Sales price: 6 per unit
If you read downwards, it tells you how many units you need to produce and sell at this price to breakeven: 2,500 CDs
If you read across, it tells you how much money you must spend before you recover your outlay: 15,000
As with any calculation, it is easy to make a mistake. There are two simple equations you can use to double-check your answer. You can calculate the breakeven point in:
Either way, the result should be the same.
For the breakeven point in costs/revenue, you then multiply the breakeven point in units, which you have just calculated, by the sales price.
If you look at the breakeven chart, you will see this is the correct answer.
Breakeven analysis is a favourite exam topic. In an exam, you could be asked to complete a breakeven chart. With these two equations, you'll be able to double check your calculations, get them right and improve your marks.
Use the example of the CD manufacturer above and plot your own chart with the same costs, but this time with a different total revenue line:
You should have calculated a breakeven point of 2,000 units and a costs revenue of 14,000.
If you have made a mistake, calculate the breakeven point in units, and then in costs/revenue again and double check your calculations again.

A number of gears connected together are called a
. The input (eg a motor) is connected to the driver gear. The output, (eg the wheel of a buggy) is connected to the driven gear.
The photograph below shows a simple gear train made up of a couple of spur gears. These are the common gears (or cogs) that look like wheels with teeth around the rim. Next to the photo is a diagram showing how you would draw this gear train in an exam.
In the drawing, the centre of each gear is shown by a cross. Each gear is drawn as two circles, one slightly larger than the other to show where the teeth would be. Teeth do not have to be drawn, but the number of teeth is written next to the gear, in this case 60 teeth and 15 teeth. Arrows indicate the direction that the gears are moving. Note that with two connected gears, they will be rotating in opposite directions.
Where there are two gears of different sizes, the smaller gear will rotate faster than the larger gear. The difference between these two speeds is called the
, and can be calculated using the number of teeth. The formula is:
Gear ratio = number or teeth on driven gear  number of teeth on the driver gear
So the gear ratio for the simple gear train above, if the smaller gear is the driver gear, is:
Gear ratio = 60  15 = 4
In other words, the driver gear revolves four times to make the driven gear revolve once.
If you know the gear ratio, and the speed input at the driver gear, you can calculate the speed output at the driven gear using the formula:
Output speed = input speed  gear ratio
So if the gear ratio is 4 and the driver gear is revolving at 200

output speed = 200  4 = 50 rpm

5406,"Joining wood 1: screws, nails, glues and knock-downs
There are many different ways of making joints in wood. The method used will depend on the function of the product, the strength required and the quality of the product. Temporary fixings will often be done using fastening components such screws or bolts. More permanent joints can be achieved with glue, or with nails - though these may lack strength and be rough-and-ready in appearance.
All screwing needs two sizes of hole. The

of the screw - so that the core fits tightly into it.
Screws come with different types of head. They can be flat or round-headed, and be fitted with a slot (for traditional screwdrivers), crosses (for Phillips or Posidrive screwdrivers) or square holes (for square drivers). If the screw head is to lie flush with the surface of the wood, the hole must be enlarged or
are made from very hard steel. They have a thread which goes all the way up to the head, and cut an internal thread as they are screwed in. They can be used in metal and plastic as well as wood. Machine screws are used for joining metal and plastic components.
Nails come in different shapes and sizes. Nails are much cheaper than screws and quick to put in. You do not need to drill holes in the wood first, except sometimes when using hard wood or to prevent the wood splitting.
When using wood glue, make sure you:
Get the surfaces to be glued to fit well - no gaps!
Don't put any finish on the surfaces to be glued.
Get everything ready before you start - glue, brush, damp cloth, clamps and blocks to protect your work.
Don't start to glue up unless you are sure you have enough time - you can't stop half way through!

Planet Airlines would want to sell their First Class seats to rich people. Business Class would probably be sold to business people and Economy Class to poorer people.
Mandy's answer was very basic. She has shown some understanding of the subject, but should have given far more detailed reasons. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade.
Planet Airlines would want to sell their First Class seats to rich people, because they can afford to spend more money. Business Class would probably be sold to business people, because they need more space to work on the plane. Economy Class would probably be aimed at people who cannot afford expensive tickets, for example, a family.
Jamie's answer showed he understood the subject, and his explanations were good. He could have included more detail and used business terms. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade.
Planet Airlines would want to sell their First Class seats to people in the highest socio-economic groups. Many of these will be in high managerial jobs with a large disposable income, and can afford to spend more money on luxuries. Business Class would probably be targeted at business people, because they need space to work on the plane, as well as being fresh for meetings on arrival. Economy Class would probably be aimed at tourists and people who cannot afford expensive seats, for example, an average family, belonging to soci-economic groups C1 or C2, white collar (office) and blue collar (factory) workers. These are examples of income and lifestyle segmentation.
Craig's answer was very detailed, and he used the correct business terms like 'disposable income' and 'lifestyle segmentation'. He showed that he understood the subject very well indeed. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.

A beam of electromagnetic radiation delivers energy in packets called photons.
The energy delivered by each photon increases with the
of the electromagnetic waves. This means that gamma photons have the most energy, and radio photons the least.
of a beam of electromagnetic radiation is the energy it delivers to a surface each second. This depends on how much energy each photon delivers, and on how many photons per second arrive at that surface.
Different frequencies of electromagnetic radiation are used for different purposes due to their varying characteristics in reflection, absorption and transmission by various materials.
. X-rays mostly pass through skin and soft tissue, but they do not easily pass through bone or metal. X-rays are used to produce shadow photographs of bones to check for damage such as fractures. They are also used in industry to check metal components and welds for cracks or other damage, and can detect objects hidden in the luggage of aircraft passengers.
Even low doses of X-rays can cause cells to become cancerous, so precautions are taken in hospitals to limit the dose received by patients and staff when X-ray photographs are taken.

6731,"If a food product is going to be successful, it has to appeal to the target market. People's tastes and diets change over time, and foods go in and out of fashion. There are lots of reasons why people buy different foods today compared to 20 years ago.
The development of a food product is divided into distinct stages - many of them identical to the development steps for any new product - with formal drawing, model-making and ICT all playing an important part.
At predefined points there will need to be quality-control checks - part of a process called Quality Assurance.
The food products market is affected by changing
. For example, many people have more income today compared with 20 years ago. This gives them more money to spend. People also lead busier lives, so they might do more shopping in supermarkets, than traditional shops, and buy more ready-made meals or eat out more, rather than cooking for themselves.
Food developers need to constantly rethink the type of foods that need to be on shop shelves, in order to take account these lifestyle changes. Customers expect to find a wider range of foods, including foreign dishes and food ingredients. There are several reasons for this:
abroad more frequently and so are exposed to many new types of food.
made up of many different races and religions - many with their own traditional cuisines.
There are also numerous cookery programmes on
that encourage people to try new food ideas.
Many factors affect what people choose to eat. These include

food grown without chemical fertilisers, pesticides or hormones
food obtained by trading on fair terms directly with the growers

Computers have revolutionised the development of food products. Computers and the internet speed up the design phase, allow designers to gather and share useful facts and information quickly and efficiently, and make product modelling easier and more effective.
To take just three examples - spreadsheets make it easy for designers to project costs for large-scale production, drawing software makes it easier to produce 2D and 3D drawings, and digital cameras allow instant capture and manipulation of images of the product.

It is obviously going to make a difference whether you are writing the essay for an examination or as coursework, how many words you are expected to write and - in the case of an examination - how long you are given. For this sample, we are assuming an examination answer of 45 minutes, and a target of 450 words or more, depending on writing speed.
In an examination, give yourself ten minutes to plan, and five minutes to check, your answer.
You will have to work quickly in the examination, but it is worth planning carefully when you are practising essays.

Jane is the narrator, so we see things from her point of view.

There are a number of characters that Jane has to ""overcome"" in the story.
Jane faces a number of dangers and difficulties.
Jane never lets her desire overtake what she knows is right.
How does Charlotte Bront create sympathy for Jane Eyre?
The main way that Charlotte Bront creates sympathy for Jane Eyre is by telling the story through her. We see everything from her point of view. The effect is that, even if we see her behaving in a way we do not like, we understand why she behaves as she does, and share her feelings.
At the beginning of the book, Jane gets into trouble because of her behaviour towards John Reed. Described as it is, we realise immediately that she is the victim, and not a naughty child. When Jane refuses to live with Rochester as his mistress, it is easier to understand the moral code she lives by. When she struggles to resist St John Rivers, we can see her dealing with her desolation and sense of duty, at the same time as a certainty that marriage to him would not bring any happiness.
Jane's strength is in her spirit, rather than physical power. At the beginning of the book, she may be defeated, and so overcome that she actually loses consciousness, but she still speaks confidently afterwards to Mr Lloyd, and looks forward to escaping from Gateshead by going to school.
Years later, when the bigamous marriage is halted, Jane is at first totally distraught. As she emerges from her initial grief, she realises she must leave Thornfield, even though this is opposed to her wishes. She describes her struggle to follow her conscience: ""I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out for me."" (Chapter 27.) She will not allow herself to do anything other than follow her conscience. She also shows, in her admiration of characters like Helen Burns and Miss Temple, that she is a good judge of character.
There are a number of characters that Jane has to ""overcome"". There are simple bullies like John Reed, and people in a position of greater authority, such as Mr Brocklehurst and Mrs Reed. Jane is not always outspoken, yet she demonstrates to us, through her thoughts, that while she may be upset she is not defeated.
When Mr Brocklehurst victimises her, she talks of an ""impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst and Co."" (Chapter 8.) Later, thanks to Helen's support, Jane is confident enough to tell Miss Temple that she was ""wrongly accused"".
Further on, she has to face other harsh characters, such as Blanche and her mother. While she is careful to keep to her place, she is not intimidated in herself, and her reflections are often critical of them. As readers, we surely prefer this.
Jane faces up to a number of difficulties and dangers. When she leaves Thornfield, she risks destitution (in that day and age), because she has limited funds and nowhere to go. (When she leaves her belongings on the coach, it is a significant misfortune.) However, Jane is unshakeable in her determination to do what is right. Sometimes it is her love for Mr Rochester that drives her - looking after Mr Mason when he is injured, saving Rochester from the fire, giving up everything to return to him when she senses him calling to her. Yet her response on all of these occasions is not that of a weak character, and we admire her.
Jane has the strength to do what is right, whatever her desire. The only time she wavers from this certainty is when St John pursues her and she wonders whether it would be her duty to go with him. However, the novel is more romantic than a moral tract, and it is at this point that Rochester calls to her and we know she will be happy.

4669,"The Ruhr is a heavily industrialised area of western Germany named after the river that flows through the region. It is the centre of Germany's manufacturing industry and includes the cities of Essen and Dortmund.
Heavy industry in the Ruhr  A case study
Natural resources such as coal, iron ore and limestone enabled the iron and steel industry to develop in the Ruhr. The chemical and textile industries also grew due to good transport links and available workforce.
Canals and rivers such as the Rhine were used for transport and power.
The area developed industrially in the 1930s and 1940s to supply arms for Germany.
Up until the 1970s the factories and associated services were an important source of employment for people in the region.
The decline in the Ruhr's importance as a heavy industrial area has caused job losses in steelworks and coal mines. Many people have left the area, eg cities such as Dortmund, due to economic and associated social problems.
The environmental legacy of the heavy industry in the area includes waste tips from coal mining, air and water pollution.
Many of the original raw materials are exhausted, there are high labour costs and old, outdated machinery. This has led to cheaper steel being imported from south east Asia where labour costs are lower. This is one of the drawbacks of globalisation for MEDC industry.
Many of the problems and changes in the Ruhr have also been experienced in other industrial regions in the EU such as South Wales.
There is still a large workforce living in the area that have had to learn new skills as industries have changed.
New industries, eg electronics, are moving in to replace the traditional heavy industries.
Much of the derelict land has been improved to provide a more pleasant living and working environment.
The Ruhr has good access to much of the EU is once again an attractive location for industry.
Footloose industry in the UK  A case study
Footloose industries are not tied to a particular location. They include high-tech industries and are located near motorway junctions or on the edges of towns and cities in business parks. The products are often electronics and computer components.
Examples include Silicon Glen in Scotland and the M4 corridor. Some of the benefits of locating an industry in the M4 corridor are shown in the diagram below.
The M4 corridor stretches from Heathrow airport in the east to Bath and Bristol in the west. The corridor is home to companies such as Hewlett Packard and Sony who are involved in research and development (quaternary industry) and have links with universities who provide well-qualified graduates.
Few raw materials are used and therefore transport costs are low, making the industries 'footloose'.
Land on the edge of cities is often cheaper than in the centre. The out of town surroundings and easy access to workers in the suburbs provides an ideal location for building science and business parks.
Motorway links and railways also provide access for commuters and for transporting components and products.
Workers wanting to live near their place of work increases the demand for housing and puts pressure on green belt land.
As demand grows, house prices increase. This means that less skilled and lower paid workers are priced out of the market in desirable areas.

This is echoed in the structure of the play. For instance, as soon as Romeo is alone with Juliet in the orchard, we are reminded several times of the danger he is in. Love seems to be linked to hatred throughout.
Elsewhere, the play mixes the two aspects for dramatic effect. In Act 2, Scene 4, Romeo is described as 'dead' and 'stabbed', but due to love, not hatred.

Christians believe there is an afterlife. Although the body dies and is buried or cremated, they believe that their unique soul lives on and is raised to new life by God.
Their belief that Jesus rose from the dead three days after his crucifixion (a Roman method of execution) gives Christians hope that if they follow Jesus teaching and accept him as their Lord and Saviour, then this new resurrection life awaits them. By being born as a human being (the incarnation), and then dying on the cross, Jesus made this new life after death possible for all.

Christians believe that God is just and fair, and so cannot let evil go unpunished. Most believe in the idea of judgement after death, and that God will treat people in the afterlife according to how they lived their life on earth.
Although heaven is often mentioned in the Bible, it is rarely described. Christians therefore have very different ideas about it. Some believe that heaven is a physical place, where their body goes after death. Others believe that it is their soul that lives on, and that heaven is a state of being united with God.
The Bible is even less specific about hell, and Christians have very different ideas about this too. Some Christians believe that hell is a
of suffering, and of separation from God. Others (perhaps most) believe that hell is a
state of being separated from God for eternity.
Some Christians, including Roman Catholics, believe in purgatory. This is an in-between state for the majority of people of waiting for heaven, a time of cleansing from sin and preparing for heaven.
Many Christians believe that there is a place in the Kingdom of God for members of other faiths, and for many who have not even believed in God on earth but have done the will of God in many ways without knowing it.
Some Christians believe in the Second Coming (

To round to two decimal places, look at the number in the third decimal place. It's a 4, so round down.
To round to one decimal place, look at the number in the second decimal place. It's a 5, so round up.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places then the answer must have that number of decimal places, even if you have to add some zeros.
For example, rounding 3.40021 to two decimal places gives 3.40 (2 d.p.).

Ariel brings Ferdinand (the King's son) to Prospero's cave. Ferdinand thinks he's the only survivor from the shipwreck. Miranda, who has seen no other man but her father during her time on the island, sees Ferdinand and thinks he must be a spirit - while Ferdinand thinks Miranda is a goddess. The two young people fall in love, but Prospero is not pleased, and makes Ferdinand his prisoner.
On another part of the island we discover one of the groups of shipwreck survivors. They begin to wake up. They're surprised that their clothes seem fresh and new.
Ariel's magical song puts them to sleep again - all except Sebastian (the King's brother) and Antonio (Prospero's brother). Antonio convinces Sebastian that they should kill the King (Alonso) so that Sebastian can take his place. Fortunately everyone else wakes up again, before they can carry out their plan.
Elsewhere on the island, Trinculo, a jester who was on board the ship, comes across Caliban. Trinculo's drunken friend Stephano turns up, and gives Caliban strong alcohol. This makes Caliban believe that Stephano is more powerful than Prospero (who Caliban hates).
Meanwhile, Ariel, who has made himself invisible, watches the three drunken clowns. He causes havoc by whispering the accusation ""thou liest"" in Caliban's ear, then Stephano's. They become confused and fight.
Caliban reveals his plans to destroy Prospero and take over the island. Stephano drunkenly agrees. Caliban is delighted that Stephano has agreed to his plan and they sing to celebrate. Ariel plays a tune to accompany their singing which frightens both Trinculo and Stephano.
Caliban tells them not to be afraid in a moving speech that describes the beauty and magic of the island. Stephano, Trinculo and Caliban follow the sound of the music.

What sort of atmosphere is Wells trying to create and how does he use figurative language to do this?
The writer is trying to create an atmosphere of fear and tension in the extract. He describes the passage as being ""draughty"" and mentions that it is underground. This makes it seem creepy and ghostly. The fact that the character only has a candle to light his way makes the story seem old-fashioned, and also creates drama because we know that the draught could blow it out! The way the echoes ""rang up and down"" and the fact that the man stops because he thinks he hears a sound, adds to the ghostly effects.
The shadows also help to create a sinister atmosphere as they flicker around and make it even harder for the man to see what's ahead. The writer uses figurative language such as personification to describe them. He says that they ""cower and quiver"", come ""sweeping up"" and that they ""fled"". All of this makes them sound alive, or perhaps like ghosts. The words used are all linked with fear, so that even the shadows seem to be afraid of what's in the corridor. This is very eerie and helps to create a very tense atmosphere.

391,"> Forces - Weight, mass and gravity
People often confuse mass and weight. Remember that weight is a force, and is measured in newtons. Mass is measured in kilograms (kg).
The mass of an object is the
or ""stuff"" it contains. The more matter an object contains, the greater its mass. An elephant contains more matter than a mouse, so it has a greater mass. Mass is measured in
A 100 kg object has a greater mass than a 5 kg object. Remember an object's mass stays the same wherever it is.
All objects have a force that attracts them towards each other. This is called
. Even you attract other objects to you because of gravity, but you have too little mass for the force to be very strong.
Gravity only becomes noticeable when there is a really massive object like a moon, planet or star. We are pulled down towards the ground because of gravity. The gravitational force pulls in the direction towards the centre of the Earth.
""Down"" is towards the centre of the Earth, wherever you are on the planet
Weight is a force caused by gravity. The weight of an object is the
between the object and the Earth. The more mass the object has the greater its weight will be.
Weight is a force, so it's measured in
. On the surface of the Earth an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 10 N.
The mass of an object stays the same wherever it is, but its weight can change. This happens if the object goes somewhere where gravity is stronger, or weaker, such as the Moon.
The Moon has less mass than the Earth, so its gravity is less than the Earth's gravity. This means that objects weigh less on the Moon than they do on the Earth.
The Moon's gravity is one sixth of the Earth's gravity. A 120 kg astronaut weighs 1200 N on Earth. On the Moon they would weigh only 200 N. The astronaut's

The different substances in mixtures are usually easily separated from one another. The method you use depends upon the type of mixture you have.
This is good for separating dissolved substances that have different colours, such as inks and plant dyes. It works because some of the coloured substances dissolve in the liquid better than others, so they travel further up the paper.
from a liquid. (An insoluble substance is one that does not dissolve).
Sand, for example, can be separated from a mixture of sand and water using filtration. That's because sand does not dissolve in water.
from a liquid (a soluble substance does dissolve, to form a solution).
For example copper sulfate crystals can be separated from copper sulfate solution using evaporation. Remember that it is the water that evaporates away, not the solution.
from a solution. For example, water can be separated from salty water by simple distillation. This method works because the water evaporates from the solution, but is then cooled and condensed into a separate container. The salt does not evaporate and so it stays behind.

Variation and classification - Continuous & discontinuous
Some of the features of the different organisms in a species show continuous variation, and some features show discontinuous variation.
Human height is an example of continuous variation. Height ranges from that of the shortest person in the world to that of the tallest person. Any height is possible between these values. So it is continuous variation.
For any species a characteristic that changes gradually over a range of values shows continuous variation. Examples of such characteristics are:
If you record the heights of a group of people and draw a graph of your results, it usually looks something like this:
The more people you measure, and the smaller the categories you use, the closer the results will be to the curved line. This shape of graph is typical of a feature with continuous variation. Weight and foot length would give graphs similar in shape to this.
Human blood group is an example of discontinuous variation. There are only 4 types of blood group. There are no other possibilities and there are no values in between. So this is discontinuous variation.

On their way to see Prospero, to kill him, Caliban and Stephano discuss horrible ways of murdering him. Ariel overhears them and makes them go in the wrong direction, with soothing, magical music.
In another part of the island, King Alonso and his companions sit down to rest. Prospero and Ariel cause the spirits of the island to prepare them a wonderful banquet. But at their first taste, Ariel appears to them. He accuses the ""three men of sin"" (Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian - plotters all) of their crimes. They are warned that they will suffer a nasty death unless they are truly sorry and live a ""clear life"" in the future. Only Alonso will admit what he has done.

Read through the following extract. How does the writer create an atmosphere of cold and loneliness?
Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness - a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.
The extract describes a cold, empty landscape.
The text states that the trees have been ""stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost"".
The land is described as ""desolate"" and it contains ""a laughter more terrible than any sadness"".
This suggests that the place is completely isolated.
The fact that it seems to be full of terrible laughter suggests it is a very cruel area, which would be hard to explore.
If you are going to use quotations from the extract in your answer, remember to set them out properly. Here are some points to remember:
Quotes of three words or less can be used in the sentence you're writing - for example ...when the writer talks about the ""futility of life"" he means...
Longer quotations need to be included on a line of their own and with a space before it (known as an indent) - for example ...the writer describes the landscape as a ""desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold"" he creates a picture that...
Short, well-chosen quotations are better than long, vague ones.

Stories can also be persuasive as well. A writer may want you to like or dislike a character. The way that they describe a character can persuade you to do either of these. Look at this extract from 'Jane Eyre':
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at the table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye with flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mamma had taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate health'.

Romeo pays Balthasar off and breaks into the Capulet tomb. Paris tries to stop him. Romeo begs him to leave him alone, but Paris thinks he is vandalising the tomb. They fight. Romeo kills Paris. Just before Paris dies he asks Romeo to place him next to Juliet's body. Romeo is sad that he had to kill Paris and takes him into the tomb to be near Juliet.
When Romeo sees Juliet lying in the tomb, he can't believe that she is dead because she looks so beautiful. He hugs her and kisses her. He takes the poison then kisses her again and dies.

The Tempest second key extract - Characters
If you get a question about characters in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with the answer.
Question: What do we learn about Miranda in the two extracts?
In the two Key Extracts we learn that Miranda is young and inexperienced, but not necessarily weak. She has a pure heart and sees the best in Ferdinand and even defends Prospero. In the First Key Extract she must do what her father says, even though his behaviour is questionable. In the Second Key Extract, she knows her own mind and goes behind her father's back (or thinks she has) to ask Ferdinand to be her husband.
Miranda can be read as a strong female character. Even though Prospero is a controlling father, Miranda shows from the beginning of the extract that she is beginning to test his power over her.
She relies on her own judgement and questions her father's actions. She stands up for Ferdinand against her father and is on the receiving end of Prospero's ugly temper. She replies with dignity and even tries to excuse her father's bad behaviour to Ferdinand. However, throughout the first extract, she is being unwittingly manipulated by Prospero.
In the second extract she openly defies her father (although it is part of Prospero's plan that she does this). She demonstrates that she is Ferdinand's equal by offering to share his workload. She claims that she is not worthy of him, but then shows her independence by proposing marriage.
Miranda pleads with Prospero to see the best in Ferdinand, but perhaps her father, who is more experienced, is wise to test Ferdinand's love for his daughter. Miranda is open about her feelings for Ferdinand, but in doing so believes that she is betraying her father's wishes. Miranda is sometimes weak and sometimes strong. She is a complex character.
Throughout the two extracts we see Miranda's growing independence. The truth is, however, that although she thinks she is rebelling against her father by following her own heart, her actions are part of Prospero's plans.

- each generation provides words known as 'slang' - often many of these words become accepted into mainstream English eg 'ok' and 'cool'. However, many slang terms lose popularity as a new generation emerges with their own slang words and phrases - making words such as 'phat' and 'groovy' history.
- the multi-cultural society we live in often provides new or adapted words. You might be familiar with the term 'avatar' in online communities but did you know the word is actually Hindi in origin? Has anyone ever said 'gesundheit' after you've sneezed? This is actually a German word, which has become popular in English.

It's important to use paragraphs, and to use them in the right places. So TiPToP it by using a new paragraph when...
You are writing a story with speech and you change speaker.
You are describing a number of different things.
You move from writing details about something in the past and then a number of details about the present.

Explore, imagine and entertain - Ending short-stories
The other problem some writers have is ending the story. It doesn't matter if it's a happy ending or not, but it has to make sense. There are lots of ways of ending, such as:
, where we have to wait until the final moment until we know. For instance, the spy who manages to stop the bomb two seconds before it explodes.
, where we are fairly sure about something, but in the final part everything changes. For example, we then learn that this is a fake bomb, and the real one is hidden somewhere else and will explode in five minutes.
, where the story stops, but we aren't sure what has actually happened at the end. For instance, the bomb is defused and everyone is safe. But then an army commander reports the theft of another bomb... only this time twice as powerful.
However, there are two endings to avoid:
, where a bomb will inevitably explode and as it does, the narrator wakes up - it was all a dream. Some English teachers don't mind this sort of thing, but others hate it. You have been warned.
, where the secret agent suddenly stops worrying about the bomb, retires, and goes off to play golf. This is even worse, and no-one likes it because the ending has nothing to do with the story.
Whatever kind of story you write, decide on your ending and include it in your plan.
Writing that explores, imagines or entertains depends on being creative. You need to experiment a little and not be frightened to try something new.

Writer's tricks - The effect on the reader
You will now be very familiar with the idea that every text is intended to affect its readers in some way.
Every reader is, of course, different too, and sometimes a text will affect you in ways a writer didn't imagine, or you might notice depth in it that others won't. This is particularly true if the text matches your personal experience. A story about your home town might interest you more than one about somewhere else, or a text about smoking might affect you more if you know somebody who is trying to give it up.
Remember, you get marks for noticing the intended effect on the reader. Even if something doesn't interest, horrify, amuse or persuade you, you need to spot what the writer meant to do. It's usually better not to mention your personal opinion unless you are asked to.

the second part comes from the acid that was used
Where does the name potassium nitrate come from?
These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt:
How can we make copper sulfate? The first part of the name is 'copper', so we need a base containing copper. We could use copper oxide or copper carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'sulfate', so we need to use sulfuric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
copper sulfate + water + carbon dioixde
How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.

It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced.

Solids cannot flow because their particles are only able to vibrate and cannot move from place to place.
Liquids can flow because their particles can move over each other. When water is poured into a glass, the particles of water move over each other and into the corners of the glass. The particles keep on moving over each other as the water takes the shape of the glass. The animation shows how this works.

Gases can flow because their particles can move in all directions. When a Bunsen burner is connected to a gas tap and turned on, natural gas flows through the rubber tubing. The particles of natural gas are free to move anywhere inside the tubing, and pressure forces them through the tubing into the Bunsen burner.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
Romeo and his friends have left the Capulets' party. Romeo has run away from his friends. Mercutio has been shouting rude jokes because he thinks that Romeo has gone off with Rosaline. Mercutio and Benvolio finally give up looking for him and go home.
The second set extract begins with Romeo hiding from Mercutio and Benvolio in Juliet's garden. Romeo thinks to himself that Mercutio can never understand how he feels because he has never been in love.
""He jests at scars that never felt a wound""
He watches Juliet as she stands on her balcony thinking out loud. He thinks that she is like the sun
Romeo uses lots of words and images that relate to light when he describes Juliet.: 'sun', 'stars' 'brightness'.
and that the moon is jealous of her because she is so beautiful. He says that her eyes are like two stars that are so bright that they would stop night-time from being dark if they were in heaven, and the birds would sing because they would think that night was day.
Romeo uses more words and images to do with light to describe Juliet.
He idolises her and compares her to an angel.
When Romeo says that Juliet is like an angel from heaven, on the one hand, he is saying how lovely she is. On the other hand, you could say that he doesn't really see her as a flesh and blood person. He idolises her. Do you believe that he can really love her when he doesn't actually know anything about her? Or do you believe in love at first sight?
Juliet, not realising that Romeo is hiding in her garden, imagines what she would say to Romeo if he were there. She says out loud that she wishes he wasn't a Montague, but says that it doesn't really matter because she loves him anyway, and hopes that he loves her. After all, a name is just a word; it doesn't really mean that much.
If we used another word for a rose instead of the word 'rose', eg 'poo', the rose would still be a rose, it wouldn't smell like poo just because we used that word. In the same way, Romeo is still lovely even though his name is Montague.
When Juliet is thinking these things aloud on her balcony, she doesn't know that anyone else is watching. Have you ever practiced saying something to someone, even though you know that you would never be brave enough to say it?
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet
When Romeo replies, Juliet nearly jumps out of her skin.
""My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself""
When Romeo calls her 'dear saint', Juliet realizes who he is. Romeo called her 'dear saint' at the party.
Juliet is very worried for Romeo's safety; he is a Montague on Capulet property. Romeo uses very poetic and exaggerated language to describe how he managed to climb over the walls.
Romeo has been quite brave and perhaps foolish to break into Juliet's garden. He likes to takes risks and doesn't think clearly about the seriousness of his actions. He uses poetic language to exaggerate his bravery.
He declares that he'd rather die than live never having the opportunity to love Juliet.
Juliet admits that she is embarrassed that Romeo heard the things that she was saying about him. She asks him if he loves her too, but she doesn't give him the chance to answer.
Juliet is worried that she has shown herself to be too keen on Romeo. In Shakespeare's day, nice girls weren't supposed to show that they were interested in boys.
Juliet's speech is very long! Is she nervous or embarrassed? Is she a chatterbox? Is she so excited about her new love that she can't stop talking about it?
Romeo begins to use poetic language about the moon to describe how much he loves her, but Juliet won't let him finish.
Time - Juliet won't let Romeo finish his sentences! Poor Romeo! We already know how much he loves to speak! Juliet's mind is working very quickly. She is excited, but also worried about how suddenly they have fallen in love.
She says that if he swears by the moon, he might turn out to be just as changeable as the moon (the moon changes its shape throughout the month).
She worries that they have fallen in love so quickly.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.
She tries to say goodnight, but she is excited and passionate about her feelings for Romeo and can't seem to stop talking about it.
""My bounty is as boundless as the sea.
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite""
Juliet's use of imagery seems more heartfelt than Romeo's: her love is as deep as the sea, and the sea never runs out. That's passion!
Juliet's Nurse shouts to her from inside the house. Juliet asks Romeo to wait. As she goes into her bedroom, Romeo thinks to himself that their love seems like a dream.
Love - Is this true love? How could it have happened so quickly? Do you believe in 'love at first sight'? Remember, that same evening that he met and fell in love with Juliet, Romeo was moping about saying that he would never love anyone as much as he loved Rosaline! Romeo might argue though that he didn't really know what true love was until he met Juliet.
Juliet comes back out onto the balcony and tells Romeo that if he is serious about her, she will send a messenger out to him tomorrow to find out where and what time they will get married!
Time - events happen very quickly in this play. In less than a week, Romeo and Juliet fall in love, get married and die.
She says goodnight to him as her Nurse impatiently tells her to come inside.
Romeo finds it hard to say goodnight to her.
Romeo said that he was in love with Rosaline in the first extract. Less than a day later, he claims to be in love with Juliet. Has he really thought about the consequences of marrying Juliet. Perhaps, when you are in love, nothing else matters. What do you think?

499,"> Drama - Drama from your imagination
Taking part in drama doesn't always involve learning lines from scripts - often you'll be asked to improvise. Usually you will work in groups or pairs to devise a piece of drama from your own imagination. You'll need to be able to think on your feet and become a different character.
This might sound difficult, but you've probably improvised before without realising it - in games you used to play as a child. If you've ever played pirates, nurses or superheroes when you were younger, you were improvising - although don't think running around your classroom with a tablecloth for a cape pretending to be Superman will impress your drama teacher - it probably won't!
As with any English work, you need to think about your audience when you devise drama. Your drama needs to entertain them and keep their attention. Your drama also needs to be believable - your audience is likely to become disconnected if your story or characters are too far fetched.
The story of your drama begins with your character. Ask yourself: what does my character feel, think and react?
Here are two ideas for a character:
You are a journalist who has uncovered a story that will have big consequences and you're about to tell the world. Would your character be confident or scared?
You are a global superstar - singer, actor and producer - and paparazzi follow your every move. You live a glamorous and privileged life, but what are the secrets behind the smiles?
When you have decided on your character, you need to create a scene.
Here are some ideas for a scene based on the characters above. Can you think of any more?
You're about to appear on the most popular morning TV programme and expose your discovery when you suddenly receive a startling phone call. Who is on the phone? What do they say? How do they make you feel?
You've landed a part in a popular soap but you don't get on with the other actors. Should you tell the press the truth or pretend that you all get along?
You've been working late in the library just double checking a few facts for your article when you notice a menacing looking man watching you. Does your character panic or keep calm? Do they run or confront the man? Maybe they are being paranoid?
The press have published some false rumours about you and you're really upset. Your agent has secured a slot on a popular chat show to give your side of the story. Do you accept the offer or decide to lie low? How do you feel?
Your article has been published and has been a massive hit. You're receiving job offers from high profile newspapers and magazines and your life is about to change for the better. How do your family react? What do you decide to do?
You've found out that one of the other band members is planning to leave the group and go solo. You confront them - can you persuade them to stay, or would it be better for everyone if they left?
When you have a rough idea of your character and scene, you can think about what your character might say. If you're given time to prepare you should write a short script. If working in pairs or a group, you could improvise the scene first to get more ideas.
You may be allowed to use props to make your scene more realistic and interesting. Only use a prop if it is relevant, otherwise it could end up distracting you and your audience. If you decide to use props and costumes, always practice with them first.

It's often useful to be able to find a percentage of a quantity. For example, you might be told that bus fares are going up by 5% and you need to know how much more you will need each week.
Here are a couple of ways you could do it:
Find 1% of the quantity by dividing it by 100.
Find x% of a quantity by multiplying 1% of the quantity by x.
Rakesh has a box containing 60 pens. 20% of the pens are red. How many is that?
You need to find 20% of 60.
1% of 60 is 60  100 = 0.6
So 20% of 60 is 0.6  20 = 12
Find x% of a quantity by multiplying that quantity by x/100
This combines the division and multiplication of Method 1 into one sum.

The Tempest first key extract - Performance
When you talk about the performance of a play, you should think about how people in the audience feel as they watch it. For instance, the beginning of the first extract is magical and romantic. The tone changes in the middle to one of conflict.
Prospero has lots of asides (thoughts spoken aloud) in the first extract. His role in this scene is made more complex because his character is pretending to be something he is not. The director has to decide whether he wants us to see Prospero as a good father who wants the best for his daughter or a manipulative control freak.
Prospero also speaks to Ariel who is invisible to the other characters on the stage.
When Ariel appears, the director must decide how to present the 'illusion'. Ariel is invisible to the other characters. But it does not necessarily follow that he must be invisible to the audience, too. Try to imagine as many interesting and unusual ways to present Ariel - the 'invisible' sprite - as you can.
When you write about performance, you need to mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:
The characters and how you respond to them
The language used - the detail about freedom and slavery, for example
The issues and ideas - like love, magic and power

Food chains - Changes to food webs
Let's look at the food web again and ask some questions about its predator-prey relationships, with some possible answers.
What would happen if the grass died?
The grass is the producer, so if it died the consumers that feed on it - rabbits, insects and slugs - would have no food. They would starve and die unless they could move to another habitat. All the other animals in the food web would die too, because their food supplies would have died out. The populations of the consumers would fall as the population of the producer fell.
What would happen if the population of slugs decreased?
Slugs, rabbits and insects all eat grass. If there were fewer slugs there would be more grass for the rabbits and insects. With more food the populations of rabbits and insects would increase. However, the thrushes would have to eat more insects to maintain their population, so it is also possible that the population of insects could decrease. This is turn may reduce the populations of voles and frogs.
What would happen if the population of insects decreased?
There would be more food for the rabbits and slugs, so their populations would increase. However, there would be less food for the frogs and voles, so their populations would decrease. This means less food for the foxes and hawks. However, there are likely to be more rabbits and thrushes for them to eat, so their populations are likely to stay the same.

The extract below is from a leaflet about passive smoking.
. Passive smoking is breathing in other people's tobacco smoke. Other people's tobacco smoke is sometimes called environmental tobacco smoke.
. Only 15% of the smoke from a cigarette is inhaled by the smoker - the rest goes into the surrounding air and other people can breathe it in. Breathing air which contains tobacco smoke can be bad for your health. This is because the tiny particles and gases in tobacco smoke contain over 4000 chemicals, many of which are harmful - at least 60 are known to cause cancer. The gases also contain carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas that comes out of car exhausts.
Q. What is the effect on my health?
. Breathing other people's smoke is uncomfortable and can cause:
nose, throat and chest irritation and breathing difficulties
From a Health Development Agency Passive Smoking Information Leaflet
The following questions will draw on all the skills you have revised so far. Note down your answers then compare them with ours.
Q1. What, according to the leaflet, is ""passive smoking""?
Q2. How much of the smoke from one cigarette is inhaled by the smoker?
Q3. Name one effect that passive smoking can have on our health, according to the extract.
Q4. Who do you think is the target audience for the leaflet?
Q5. Give one reason why you think this.
Q6. Look at the second answer that the writer has given in the leaflet: the one beginning ""Only 15% of the smoke..."". Explain two ways in which the writer has used language to persuade the reader that passive smoking is dangerous.
Q7. Why has the writer phrased each heading as a question?
Q8. Explain two ways in which the writer has used layout to make the text more effective.
A1. Passive smoking is 'breathing in other people's tobacco smoke'.
A2. 15% is inhaled by the smoker.
A3. Coughing. (You could name any of the effects listed in the bullet points.)
A4. The target audience could be teenagers, or a broad audience. It is the reason that you give in the next answer that is more important.
A5. Reasons are: the language used is quite simple; sentences are mainly quite short and simple, many only contain one or two ideas; the information is broken up into short sections; the headings make the information easy to follow. All these would make the text accessible for many readers, including young people.
A6. There are three main ways: the simple statement that it is 'bad for your health'; the fact that tobacco smoke contains 'over 4000 chemicals', many of which are harmful; the mention of carbon monoxide which is 'poisonous'.
A7. The headings are phrased as questions to draw the reader into the text.
A8. Layout has been used in several different ways: the 'Q' and 'A' format is eyecatching; the short paragraphs are easy to follow; the bullet points at the end of the extract make the facts easy to read.

And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Call me but love, and Ill be new-baptized.

The orchard walls are high and hard to climb 
And the place death, considering who thou art,

With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls,
For stony limits cannot hold love out 
And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Fain would I dwell on form  fain, fain deny
What I have spoke.  But farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay 
And I will take thy word. Yet if thou swearst
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers perjuries
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
Or if thou think I am too quickly won,
Ill frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo  but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light.
But trust me, gentleman, Ill prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheardst, ere I was ware,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discoverd.

That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops 
O swear not by the moon, th inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract tonight.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden 
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.
This bud of love, by summers ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

I gave thee mine before thou didst request it 
And yet I would it were to give again.
Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?

Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow
By one that Ill procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite 
And all my fortunes at thy foot Ill lay,
And follow thee, my lord, throughout the world.

This is the general word equation for the reaction:
The salt produced depends upon the metal and the acid. Here are two examples:
It doesn't matter which metal or acid is used, if there is a reaction we always get hydrogen gas as well as the salt.
There is a simple laboratory test to see if a gas is hydrogen. A lighted wooden splint goes pop if it is put into a test tube of hydrogen. This is because the flame ignites the hydrogen, which burns explosively to make a loud sound.
All acids contain hydrogen atoms. Apart from hydrochloric acid, this is not clear from their names, but you can tell they contain hydrogen from their chemical formulae. Remember that the chemical symbol for hydrogen is H.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - Language
Think about how language is used in the two Key Extracts - for example, where it seems the same in both, and where it seems different.
When Montague talks about how Romeo is in a bad mood and avoiding sunlight, he uses lots of imagery to do with darkness.
When Romeo describes Juliet he uses lots of words and imagery to do with light. Even the night imagery involves brightness with stars and the moon.
The metaphors and similes used by the characters in the first extract (especially Romeo) are quite complicated. Benvolio and Romeo enjoy using puns to make jokes together. Language is used in clever ways.
Romeo still uses language skillfully, but Juliet wants honesty rather than clever poetry. When Romeo starts to swear by the moon, she won't let him finish his clever metaphor. Juliet uses imagery to make her thoughts clear, eg Romeo is like a rose; Juliet's love is as deep as the sea.
Much of the first extract is in rhyme. In the scene between Romeo and Benvolio, this helps to bring out the humour in their banter.
Romeo and Juliet both speak in blank verse: they are talking about love in a much more sensitive way than Romeo did when he was talking to Benvolio. Juliet's final line in the scene finishes Romeo's to make one line of blank verse. (Blank verse is unrhymed and has lines that have 10 syllables each). This shows how close they have become.
If you get a question about language in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with your answer:
How is love described in the two extracts?
Love is described in many different ways in the two extracts. By the second extract, love is described in a more positive light.
In the first extract, Romeo uses oxymorons because he is confused about his feelings for Rosaline. Romeo compares love to poison and madness.
In the second extract, Romeo uses words to do with light and heaven when describing his feelings for Juliet. Juliet talks about love in terms of truth and promises.
In the first extract, love means many different things to Romeo. Love is confusing to Romeo and seems to have a dark side that he has no control over. Love is ruining his life. By the end of the first extract, you might think that Romeo has confused his feelings of lust for love. In the second extract, love is related to light and heaven for Romeo. Perhaps when he meets Juliet, he realizes what true love is. For Juliet, love is about truth and honesty. She is almost overwhelmed by her feelings for Romeo. For both characters, love is a powerful and wonderful force.

In a scale drawing, all dimensions have been reduced by the same proportion.
A model boat is made to a scale of 1:20 (1 to 20). This scale can be applied to any units, so 1mm measured on the model is 20mm on the actual boat, 1cm measured on the model is 20cm on the actual boat, and so on.
a) If the 1:20 model boat is 15cm wide, how wide is the actual boat?
b) If the boat has a mast of height 4m, how high is the mast on the model?
The scale is 1:20. This means that every cm on the model is equivalent to 20cm on the boat.
a) 1cm on the model = 20cm on the boat, so:

Maps scales can be written in ratios and tell you how many units of land, sea etc are equal to one unit on the map.
If you are travelling from Manchester to Newcastle, for example, and need to know how far it is, it would be very difficult to work this out if the map does not have a scale.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. A distance is measured as 3cm on the map.
How many cm, m and km is this equivalent to in real life?
1 cm on the map represents 50 000cm. Therefore, 3cm on the map represents 150 000cm.
To convert from cm to m, divide by 100.
To convert from m to km divide by 1000.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. What distance on the map will represent 5km?
5km = 5000m = 5000  100 cm = 500 000cm
We want to know what distance on the map represents 500 000cm in real life.

Let's look at two examples of how organisms are adapted to such changes.
If you have ever been to the seaside and looked for creatures in rock pools, you are likely to have seen lots of limpets on the rocks.
When the tide is in, limpets move over sea-covered rocks, scraping off tiny bits of seaweed. When the tide goes out, limpets clamp themselves very tightly against the newly exposed rock. This makes it difficult for predators to pull them off the rock to eat them. It also stops the limpets losing water, or being washed away by waves.
The snowshoe hare lives in Canada and other parts of North America.
The snowshoe hare has brown fur during the summer, to help camouflage it amongst the earth and plants. Its fur is white during the winter, to help camouflage it in the snow. This adaptation makes it more difficult for predators to see the snowshoe hare, whatever the season.

Tobacco smoke contains many harmful substances. These include:

Cells in the lining of the breathing tubes produce sticky mucus to trap dirt and microbes. Cells with tiny hair-like parts, called

Hot smoke and tar from smoking damages the cilia. So smokers cough to move the mucus and are more likely to get

Carbon monoxide is a gas that takes the place of oxygen in red blood cells. This reduces the amount of oxygen that the blood can carry. This means that the circulatory system has to work harder, causing heart disease.

In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Second Key Extract takes place outside Prospero's cave. Ferdinand is carrying logs. He thinks to himself that he doesn't mind the hard work because he is doing it for Miranda,
Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble.
even if her father is cruel and grumpy.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
Miranda comes to see him. Neither of them realise that Prospero is watching them from a distance.
On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance?
Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
but he says he has too much to do, so she offers to carry some logs for him.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
He says he would rather break his back than see her work. Miranda insists again that she should help him.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Looking on, Prospero sees how much Miranda is in love with Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Ferdinand asks Miranda her name and when she tells him, she remembers that in doing so, she has broken her promise to her father.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand admits that he has liked lots of different women in the past
Ferdinand uses the word 'bondage' to describe his reaction to listening to beautiful women talk. It links back to the issue of Freedom and Slavery in the play. Ferdinand means that he has been like a slave to beautiful women in the past.
, but they have always disappointed him with some fault or other in the end.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
However, Miranda, he says, is perfect. Miranda, on the other hand, hasn't met any men except for her father, or any women, except for herself. Even so, she says that she can't imagine liking anyone more than she likes Ferdinand.
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand tells her that he is a prince, possibly a king (although he hopes his father isn't dead). He wouldn't usually put up with having to carry logs like a slave
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
but he knew as soon as he saw Miranda that he'd do anything for her. When Miranda asks him if he loves her, Ferdinand says he loves, prizes and honours her more than anything else in the world. This makes Miranda so happy that she cries. As Prospero watches them together, he is moved.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Ferdinand asks Miranda why she is crying. She says she thinks she isn't good enough for him
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!
but realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else. Ferdinand happily agrees to marry her. They say goodbye and part.
Prospero is happy for them, but he claims that their engagement is no surprise to him as it was all part of his plan. He goes to get his magic book because he has lots of work to do before supper time.

We say that unlike poles attract, and like poles repel.
How can you test if a piece of metal is a magnet. Seeing if it sticks to a magnet is not a good test, because unmagnetised iron, steel, cobalt and nickel objects will be attracted to either pole of a magnet.
So you can't test for what it is attracted to. But you can test what it repels:
You can only show that an object is a magnet if it repels a known magnet.

Ariel tells Prospero what has happened to the ship and its passengers and crew. He tells how he appeared on the ship as a flame (he is after all a magic spirit), and frightened the passengers so much that they had jumped in to the sea. Only the crew remained on the ship.
Prospero wants to be sure that the crew and the passengers are safe. Ariel tells him how he saw to it that the passengers were washed up on the island in separate groups. He made sure the ship was safe, and that the crew were sleeping peacefully. He had sent the rest of the fleet back to Naples, with everyone believing that their king's ship had been sunk, and its passengers drowned.
Ariel now changes the subject, and says he's getting impatient. He reminds Prospero there is a time limit on how long he had to be Prospero's servant, after his release from Sycorax's spell. Ariel wants his freedom, and reminds Prospero that he's been a good servant.

Prospero, in reply, reminds Ariel of the horror he was released from. He tells him that he needs him to work for two more days and then he will be free. Prospero sends him off to keep watch over the washed-up passengers.
As Ariel leaves, Prospero wakes Miranda and tells her that they are going to see Caliban. This doesn't please Miranda, who refers to Caliban as a ""villain"" that she does not ""love to look on"".

You can write the whole number part as a fraction, then add the fractions together.
Converting from improper fractions to mixed numbers
You can separate out the fraction into smaller fractions, like this:
Another way to convert an improper fraction is to find how many whole numbers you get, by using a division.
We start by dividing the top number by the bottom number.

A team of scientists might be ditching the phrase ""oh, rats!"" from their vocabulary. They are experimenting with ways that rats may help find people who are buried as a result of earthquakes or other disasters.
Like dogs, rats have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out survivors. The rodents are also small enough to crawl almost anywhere. Dogs can be limited in their searches because of their larger size.
The scientists trained the rats to recognize the scent of people. To do that, researchers implanted electronic devices into the brains of the animals.
The electronic devices affect the rat's brain so that it picks up the scent of a person and then plans how to locate the person. Signals from the rat's brain are relayed to a radio transmitter that scientists attach to the rodent's back.
Rescue teams then will be able to track those signals and follow the rat's path. That will help rescuers determine where to start digging for survivors. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next nine months.

Temperatures are on the rise in Antartica. What does that mean for emperor penguins and other wildlife?
Emperor penguins and other Antarctic wildlife ""feel the heat"" as their icy home melts away.
In the hit documentary March of the Penguins,
emperor penguins make an amazing journey. They cross the vast continent of Antarctica, a frozen area that surrounds the South Pole. The penguins leave their ocean homes and cross the ice on a dangerous trip. They are blinded by blizzards and toppled over by strong winds. But each winter, they do this to lay their eggs and raise their chicks.
That cycle of life may be in trouble though. Scientists have discovered an alarming rise in temperatures around Antarctica. ""The region at the peninsula has warmed up about 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 40 to 50 years,"" Wayne Trivelpiece, a scientist who studies Antarctica, told Weekly Reader.
A recent study also shows that the ocean near the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed since the 1960s. A
is a stretch of land surrounded on three sides by water. A change in temperature could spell trouble for penguins, whales, seals, and other creatures at the South Pole.
Although researchers are certain about the increase in temperatures, they are still unsure about the cause. Many scientists blame
the gradual rise in Earths average temperature.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth. Temperatures there rarely reach above freezing. Although it is too cold for humans to permanently live there, many animals swim in the icy waters surrounding the continent. Penguins, for example, waddle across the ice and dive into the cold ocean waters in search of food. They eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called
In warmer water, however, krill have trouble surviving. ""Warming temperatures have led to a decline in sea ice,"" says Trivelpiece. ""Sea ice holds the food that krill need to survive. Without the ice, there is less food for krill and without the krill, the penguins are not surviving.""
These changes could upset the balance of the food chain and endanger larger animals and birds. A loss of penguins could leave leopard seals and whales hungry. (See
.) ""A very small change in temperature [can] completely change the whole food chain,"" says Trivelpiece.
Its not just emperor penguins and other creatures that may be in trouble. People who live thousands of miles away may be affected by melting ice.
As glaciers and sheets of ice melt, they add to the worlds sea level. When ice on land falls into the ocean and melts, it raises the water level. It is like dropping ice cubes into a glass of water. A 4-foot increase in global sea level would drown low-lying coastal areas.

Some heat from greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is necessary. Without them, Earth would be too cold to support life. But burning fossil fuels can release too much carbon dioxide into the air, which can cause temperatures to rise.
Scientists are working to persuade governments to reduce their use of greenhouse gases. Experts say that if greenhouse gases continue to gather in the air, temperatures will likely be higher by 2100 than any time in human history.

Hispanic Americans are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. Those parts of the world include Spain, Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and most countries in Central America and South America. In the United States, many Hispanic Americans are also called Latinos.
As of June, about 39 million Hispanic Americans are living in the United States. That number marks a jump from the 2000 census count. At that time, Hispanic Americans numbered about 35 million. Today, the total population of the United States is estimated at more than 288 million people.
Currently, 1 out of every 6 kids in this country is Hispanic. Officials estimate that by 2020, 1 out of 4 children will be Hispanic American.
Hispanic Americans have influenced food, music, and customs in the United States. Hispanic Heritage Month marks a time for Americans to celebrate the traditions and history of Hispanic people. It takes place from September 15 to October 15.
People in communities around the country will celebrate the month with festivals. Many students will recognize the month by learning about the important roles Hispanic people have played in our countrys history.
Ellen Ochoa, the first Hispanic American astronaut, told
that to understand the history of the United States, people should learn about the contributions of different groups, including Hispanic Americans.
People sometimes refer to the United States as a ""melting pot."" That phrase means that people from many different countries have settled here. People of Hispanic heritage, along with people from other cultures, help make the United States strong.
From science to sports, people of Hispanic heritage have contributed to the history of the United States. Take a look at some of these well-known people.
Dr. Novello was born in Puerto Rico. In 1990, she became the first Hispanic American to serve as the U.S. surgeon general. That is the doctor who leads our country on health issues. She worked to improve healthcare for Americans, especially children, women, and minorities.
Gary Soto is an award-winning Hispanic American author. He writes fiction and poetry for adults and children. His writing is based on his experiences growing up as a Mexican American in California. His books, including
Baseball in April and Other Stories and Taking Sides
, are popular with many young readers.
In 1990, Ellen Ochoa became the first Hispanic American woman astronaut when she was accepted into NASAs training program. Ochoa, whose fathers parents were from Mexico, flew her first space shuttle mission in 1993. Since then she has clocked more than 720 hours in flight.

Troubled waters are ahead for the world's fish. Those finned creatures and shellfish, such as crabs and clams, may be a rare sight by 2048, according to a fouryear study. The study, recently published in the journal
was conducted by a team of 14 researchers in four countries.
If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
The study warns that ocean life is being wiped out because of overfishing and pollution.
Global warming (a rise in Earth's temperatures) and habitat loss are also to blame for the decline in seafood.
Although the world's sea life is in serious danger, it's not too late to reverse the problem, says the study's lead author, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. The researchers have called for measures to protect current fish populations, such as reducing large-scale fishing and pollution. ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we don't change things,"" Worm told reporters.
The loss of ocean life will cause more than just a shortage of seafood. It could spell disaster for ecosystems too. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that work together as a unit to live. A declining fish population would cause a disaster up and down the food chain. Larger animals, such as seals and dolphins, depend on fish for food. Without enough fish to eat, those animals would be in trouble.

Yet the Amazons future is grim. Farmers are rapidly destroying this lush landscape.
has been huge problem in the Amazon since the 1960s. Deforestation occurs when farmers and loggers cut down trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Until recently, scientists thought the rain forest was losing about 5,800 square miles a year. However, using the latest satellite technology, researchers have discovered that the Amazon is shrinking at about twice that rate.

or the variety of plants and animals in a particular area. The Amazon is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant diversity. It is home to the biggest flower in the world, a bird-eating spider, and a monkey about the size of a toothbrush.
Scientists estimate that they have identified only a small number of all species that live in the rain forest. As loggers and farmers destroy the forest, animals and plants may become extinct before they are discovered.
Deforestation affects people too. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines we need come from the rain forest.
The Amazon is often called the ""lungs of the world."" Its trees clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans. Carbon dioxide is a
Greenhouse gases trap the suns heat close to Earth. Without the trees in the rain forest, the Earths climate would become much hotter.
Stopping the destruction of the rain forest is not an easy task. Brazils government recently created two national parks in the Amazon rain forest. The governments efforts placed 3.7 million acres of rain forest off-limits for development. The protected area is more than twice the size of Maryland.
Others think that this is not enough. ""The single most important factor contributing to forest loss is population growth in Brazil,"" scientist Jim Bowyer of the University of Michigan told
""People make the forest their home. All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive.""
Scientists estimate that if deforestation continues at its current rate, the rain forest may survive only another 40 to 50 years. ""We need to address the real causes of deforestation, like poverty and population growth,"" says Bowyer. ""Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest.""

After Sonia Mia strapped herself in, the shuttle moved into launch position. The countdown began, and the shuttle blasted off! During the mission, Sonia Mia and her team used buttons and joysticks to perform the tasks associated with their roles. The ride lasted about 4 minutes.
The mission was as intense as Sonia Mia had hoped. What was her favorite part? The liftoff! ""I liked the intensity of the blastoff and the air pressure on my face,"" she said.
So how did the ride live up to a real space shuttle mission? Weekly Reader caught up with NASA astronaut Winston Scott to ask him that question.
Scott launched into space on two shuttle flights. He tested out Mission: SPACE and gave it a big thumbs up. ""It's a thrill a minute,"" he said.
Although no astronauts have been to Mars yet, Scott said the ride's liftoff was realistic. The feeling of moving up the launch pad and being forced back into your seat were similar to those felt on a shuttle.
However, he points out, there are differences. In an actual launch, astronauts feel about three times the force of
. Gravity is the force that pulls things toward Earth.
The blastoff on the ride was also shorter than an actual liftoff. And, he said, riders don't experience weightlessness. On a real space shuttle, astronauts become weightless because there is no gravity.
For many people, the ride brings to mind the courage of space explorers. As Sonia Mia pointed out, ""Going on the ride made me think about how brave astronauts are.""
Sonia Mia Diaz interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the forces behind Mission: SPACE. Here's what Sonia Mia learned.
Imagineers are people who work for Disney.
In general, Imagineering is about storytelling. We build attractions that put people who visit our parks into different worlds and stories. We also use technology to tell stories.
What was your role in creating the ride?
I'm the senior show producer, which is like being a movie director. A movie director guides people and directs the show, including the lighting, music, artists, and motion you experience on the ride.
Where did your team get the inspiration for Mission: SPACE?
People have always had an interest in space. The time and technology were right to create this new space attraction. We worked closely with NASA to develop the science and technology behind the attraction. No one has ever put people into a ride system like this before.
Before the ride, I was warned not to move my head or close my eyes because of motion sickness. I didn't feel sick, but might a person if he or she does those things?
That could happen if you move your head, because of the technology used to create the ride. We give those recommendations because we want people to feel most comfortable. Some people can move their heads, and it doesn't bother them at all.
How many times have you been on Mission: SPACE?
At last count, I've ridden it more than 400 times!

692,"Four hundred years after its founding, Jamestown is a historical hot spot.
Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on armor and talk to tour guides. This year, more than 2.4 million people from across the country are expected to attend Jamestown events.
Stepping into Jamestown Settlement museum in Virginia is like stepping into the past. And that's just what thousands of people are planning to do this spring. May marks the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America. Organizers are expecting nearly 90,000 visitors on the weekend of May 11 to 13, when many major events are planned.
Jamestown is a tourist destination for people who want a frontrow seat to American history. ""The whole idea is to give people an idea of Jamestown and the world in 1607,"" historian Tom Davidson told
Davidson helped put together exhibits at the Jamestown museum for the anniversary.
Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on English armor and watch experts demonstrate how to fire muskets. Tourists can also go aboard and explore
or models, of the three ships that brought the first settlers to present-day Virginia.
The story of Jamestown began on May 14, 1607, when about 100 English men and boys arrived in present-day Virginia. They came seeking gold and other treasures. The settlers, called
built a fort on the bank of a river and named their colony Jamestown, after King James I of England.
or businesspeople, of the Virginia Company to make money in North America. But the settlers faced many problems, including disease, starvation, and conflict with the area's Powhatan people (see ""
At first, settlers stayed close together for protection. ""There were hundreds of people living inside a wooden-walled fort,"" explains Davidson. Living in the fort helped the settlers defend themselves from attack, but it also made hunting for food or growing crops difficult.
Captain John Smith was one of Jamestown's original leaders. He took command of the colony in 1608. When the colony was in danger of running out of food, Smith gave an order: ""He who does not work, will not eat.""
spent five months crossing the Atlantic. The original Godspeed carried 39 passengers from England to Virginia, making two stops along the way. The new Godspeed traveled from Maine to Virginia, stopping along the way to let visitors see the ship.
By 1613, Jamestown had expanded into a successful colony. At about that time, the settlers began to grow tobacco. Tobacco was a
meaning that it could be sold in large amounts to England. In the following years, the settlers pushed the Powhatan off the land and built tobacco
or large farms. Later, the Jamestown colonists bought slaves from Africa to work on the plantations.
Over time, Jamestown grew to become the colony of Virginia. Virginia was one of the 13 colonies that joined in 1776 to rebel against England, starting the American Revolution (17751783).
Much is known about Jamestown, yet more details are being discovered. For more than a hundred years, experts thought the site of the original settlement had been destroyed by the James River. In 1994, archaeologists, or scientists who study the remains left behind by past cultures, discovered what may be Jamestown's original location.
""Visitors can see things being excavated that haven't seen the light of day in 400 years,"" Jamestown spokesperson Mike Litterst told
Scientists are currently looking for the foundation of the first church that the Jamestown settlers built. If found, it will be the oldest English church ever discovered in the United States.
The skeletons of two settlers have already been uncovered at the site. They are on display beneath a glass case, exactly as they were found. Historians believe that one of the skeletons is that of Captain Bartholomew Gosnoll, a member of Jamestown's original ruling council. Gosnoll and Jamestown Settlement will have a lot of visitors in the coming weeks for the 400th anniversary. ""It's the biggest event we've had since 1957, when the [Jamestown] museum first opened,"" says Litterst.
When the English colonists first settled in what is now Virginia, a powerful Native American group had lived on the land for hundreds of years. ""There were about 20,000 Powhatan people there when the English arrived in Jamestown,"" Virginia Indian culture expert Karenne Wood told
She hopes that the 400th anniversary of Jamestown will help shed light on the Powhatan's story.
When Jamestown began, the English and the Powhatan tried to trade with each other peacefully, but soon fighting broke out over land and resources. Beginning in 1614, the fighting stopped for eight years when Pocahontas, a daughter of the Powhatan chief, married Englishman John Rolfe. However, the fighting quickly resumed as Jamestown expanded.
Over time, the Powhatan people lost their land to the English settlers. However, Virginia is home to many Native American descendants today. ""We have changed a lot,"" says Wood, ""but we are still here.""
Organizers at Jamestown are not calling the 400th anniversary a celebration. Why might that be?

""The capture of Saddam is good news for the people of Iraq and the world,"" said Democratic presidential candidate and former U.S. Senator Carol Moseley Braun. ""But it does not change the fact that our troops remain in harm's way, and we are no closer to bringing them home.""
What qualities do you think are important in a president?

And they're off! Teams of specially trained dogs are racing to the finish line across one of the toughest terrains in the world.
Along a jagged trail of snow and ice, the teams battle Alaska's below-zero temperatures. They are competing in the Iditarod (igh-DIT-ah-rod) Trail Sled Dog Race, which kicked off on March 6.
The Iditarod is the longest sled dog race in the world. This year, about 90 sled dog teams are running the roughly 1,110-mile route.
The race, now in its 32nd year, starts in the city of Anchorage and ends in the city of Nome. The stretch of land the teams must cross is almost equal to the distance from New York City to Miami.
A team of 12 to 16 dogs tow each sled. It can take more than two weeks for teams to complete the race. In 2002, a record holder completed the race in 8 days, 22 hours, 46 minutes, and 2 seconds.

, check the health of each dog.
During their journey, mushers set up camp to make sure the dogs get enough food, water, and rest. The mushers and dogs are required to stop for at least one 24-hour period and two 8-hour periods.
Not surprisingly, dog mushing is Alaska's state sport. Before mushing became a popular sport, dog teams served as an important form of transportation.
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, miners discovered gold in Alaska. Thousands of people traveled there for the gold rush.
During that time, sled dogs helped people get from place to place and transported gold, mail, and supplies. ""Dog teams were important to settling Alaska during this time,"" race director Joanne Potts told
In 1925, sled dogs in Anchorage delivered lifesaving medicine to sick children in Nome. The Iditarod teams follow the same route. The race

that the race is as much about the people, culture, and landscape of Alaska as it is about the dogs. ""I've been interested in the Iditarod since I was a kid,"" he said. ""To experience this race firsthand is like a dream come true.""
In January 1959, Alaska became the 49th state. More than twice the size of Texas, Alaska is the largest state.
Alaska's nickname is ""The Last Frontier"" because much of the land is wilderness that remains unsettled.
Mount McKinley, in Alaska, is the tallest mountain in North America.
In 1867, the United States bought Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million, or about 2 cents per acre.
Contrary to popular belief, Alaska is not one giant icebox! In some parts of the state, summer temperatures can reach into the 80s.

The idea for the state reptile came from the schools mascot, a diamondback rattlesnake. The students convinced their state representative, David Clark, to present the bill to the state Congress.
Sixty students from Diamond Valley recently visited the state House of Representatives in Salt Lake City, the state capital. They sang their school song, which mentions the slithery reptile. They also presented Governor Jon Huntsman Jr. with a cherry pie (cherries are the state fruit) and performed a lively square dance (the state folk dance).
The students efforts are paying off. The bill passed the House of Representatives. Next it has to make it through the state Senate before it lands on the governors desk for signing.

What is it like to live like a sea creature? The Bionic Dolphin gives people the chance to find out. The vehicle can cruise across the water at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour (mph) and then dive at least 10 feet. Its inventor, Thomas Rowe, designed the vehicle with wings to enable it to ""fly"" underwater as fast as 40 mph. ""The majority of my research was on dolphins, but where I got the most help was penguins and diving birds,"" Rowe told
The Bionic Dolphin was first designed for

What combines music, rock climbing, and video games? Its a musical climbing wall called DigiWall. This climbing wall has interactive games based on speed, cooperation, and creativity. ""We wanted to do some kind of computer game where you are very physical,"" project leader Mats Liljedahl told
""We removed the computer screen, and instead we are using the lights and the grips."" The grips light up when they are touched.
Robonaut may help astronauts in future space missions. The robot is being designed by NASA, the U.S. space agency. The robot will ""perform tasks that up until now only astronauts could do,"" NASA engineer Roger Rovekamp told
Robonaut can operate on its own or be controlled by a human operator from Earth or in space. The operator would wear a special headset that displays live video from the cameras on the robots head. By wearing a glove with sensors, that person can control the actions of Robonauts fingers, which can hold tools as small as tweezers.

According to Daniels, the underside of the two-headed tortoise's shell is flat. Usually, it is rounded. In other ways, Daniels said, the tortoise appears to be normal. However, there is some confusion when the tortoise gets frightened. Each head seems to want to move in its own direction.
Daniels said that it's a good thing the tortoise moves slowly, because it has enough time ""to figure out which way to go.""

802,"North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear site, viewed from space in February 2002
In late January, officials fro South Korea traveled to North Korea. Both countries are located in eastern Asia. The reason for their visit was to try get North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Last October, officials in North Korea admitted to a U.S. official that North Korea is building nuclear weapons. That action violates a 1994 agreement to stop the spread of nuclear arms.
Tensions further increased when North Korea's leader, Kim Jong II, opened up nuclear power plants. The power plants had been closed under an agreement that North Korea made with the United States nearly ten years ago. Officials in North Korea say the power plants will only be used to generate electricity.
However, people in the United States and countries near North Korea, like South Korea and Japan, are concerned. They think that North Korea will use the plants make nuclear arms. North Korea recently kicked out U.N. weapons inspectors. That only added to the mistrust.
North Korea is an extremely poor country. Yet it spends most of its money on its army. It relies on help from other countries to feed its starving people.
Area: 46,500 square miles (about the size of Mississippi)
Economy: many children and families are starving
Area: 38,000 square miles 9about the size of Indiana)
Economy: it has the fourth largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The United States is working with countries in the region, such as South Korea, to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear crisis. South Korea was hoping to help the United States negotiate a peaceful solution. However, officials in North Korea want to discuss the issue directly with the United States.
U.S. official have said they will communicate with North Korea if it abandons its nuclear weapons program. President Bush has said that the world will respect North Korea when it is no loner a nuclear threat.
North Korea and South Korea are located on a Peninsula in Eastern Asia. Soldiers from the United States and South Korea routinely divides North Korea and South Korea. After World War II (1939-1945), Korea was split in half. In 1950, the Korean War began when North Korea attacked South Korea, The United States helped defend South Korea.

582,"Tourists Put Pressure on World's Monuments and Parks
Some of the World's most important monuments and parks are being loved to death. Many sites around the world are in bad shape because of a recent sharp increase in the number of tourists worldwide. The causes of damage range from everyday wear and tear to pollution to
, or the destruction of property on purpose.
Each year, hundreds of millions of tourists visit special places around the world. In fact, according to the World Tourism Organization, by the end of this year about 668 million people will have made tourist trips. By 2020, the organization said, that number may more than double, to 1.5 billion tourists!
The problem is that a large number of visitors can damage a monument or park. The thousands of cars and buses that carry tourists to a site create air pollution. Air pollution can discolor and damage monuments made of stone and other materials. Huge numbers of tourists also cause garbage to pile up. And sometimes tourists take pieces of monuments away with them as souvenirs.
These are some of the special places that are suffering from too much attention:
. These are two of the biggest national parks in the United States. Millions of tourists each year crowd into these areas. As a result, air pollution, garbage, and other damage have marred these awesome sites.
. Located in Peru, a country in South America, Machu Picchu is the site of an ancient city in the Andes Mountains. A people called the Incas built the city almost 600 years ago for Incan royalty. Garbage tossed aside by tourists, as well as air and water pollution, are now problems at Machu Picchu.
. The Parthenon is a temple that was built almost 2,500 years ago in Athens, a city in the European country of Greece. Air pollution has pitted and discolored the marble that the beautiful building is made of.
. Located near the town of Dunhuang, in north-central China, these caves are covered with delicate paintings and carvings. However, the breath of the 300,000 visitors who pass through the 492 caves each year is damaging the artwork, which is between 700 and 1,700 years old.
To help preserve such important places, new rules are being written by organizations such as UNESCO, which is a part of the United Nations. UNESCO is working with governments worldwide to limit the number of tourists who visit some special sites.
UNESCO is also working to educate sightseers about how to avoid damaging the places they visit. As one student who works with UNESCO said, ""You have to protect the past to reach tomorrow.""
If you are visiting a monument or national park, here are a few rules the U.S. Park Service says you should always follow:
If you are camping, take your trash and leftover food out with you when you leave.
When visiting a monument, don't touch sculptures, paintings, or other artwork.
Leave any artifacts, plants, stones, or other things where they are.
If you see someone damaging a monument or throwing garbage on the ground in a park, tell a park ranger or another park official.

If you have had a cavity, you have probably felt the bite of a dentist's whirling drill as it cuts into your tooth. Soon, however, the dentist may no longer need a drill.

So far, the scientists have tested the vaccine on rats. The rats that took the vaccine didn't get many cavities.
Now the scientists want people to try the vaccine. If it works, dentists may have a lot less drilling to do--other than drilling it into people's heads to remember to take the vaccine!

361,"The Heat Is On: Will Global Warming Affect Animals?
Polar bears in Alaska are having trouble catching one of their main meals--ringed seals. To get to the seals, the bears often walk across islands of ice floating in the water.
Ice throughout Alaska is melting earlier and faster in the spring than it did several years ago. So polar bears don't have as much time to catch seals before the ice melts. As a result, polar bears are catching fewer seals.
Ice along Alaska's coast is melting because the temperature is higher worldwide. In the last 100 years, Earth's temperature has risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit.
. Global warming is changing the environment worldwide. As a result, many plants and animals are being affected, say scientists from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
As temperatures rise, more and more animals will have to
, or move, in order to survive, said scientist Jay Malcolm of the WWF.
Many plants and animals that can't adjust or migrate will not survive the rise in temperature, said WWF scientists. In some areas of the world, the WWF says, as many as two in ten species of plants and animals will die out by the year 2100.
Here are some examples of how global warming is affecting some animals in North America.
The numbers on the map show where each animal can be found.
The black guillemot (GIL-uh-maht) is a bird that lives on an island off Alaska's coast. It eats Arctic cod, a fish that lives in water under ice. Rising temperatures have caused much of the ice to melt. The Arctic cod has moved to other parts of the sea where water is still covered with ice. The guillemot no longer has enough fish to eat.
The American bistort is a plant that lives in Mount Rainier National Park. The Edith's checkerspot butterfly drinks nectar from bistort flowers. The warming temperatures have caused the butterflies to hatch earlier, before the flowers bloom, so the butterflies don't have enough food right after they hatch.
Global warming is actually helping some animals.
The Mexican vole lives in areas with warm temperatures. It is spreading northward into Arizona and Colorado because of the rise in temperatures there.
For years, red fire ants lived in the warm southern part of the United States. Today, because of rising temperatures, they are spreading northward.
Scientists have learned that global warming is already affecting Earth. ""We should not expect the effects of global warming to take place 50 years in the future,"" said scientist Rafe Sagarin. ""It's happening right now.""
Scientists agree that Earth has been getting warmer for the last 100 years. They don't agree on
Gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming. Carbon dioxide in the air traps heat from the sun, causing Earth's temperature to rise.
Volcanoes and forest fires release carbon dioxide into the air. Some scientists blame the rise in temperature on volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and other natural events.
Other scientists blame human actions for the rise in temperature. They say Earth has always had volcanoes and forest fires, so why is Earth warming now? Those scientists say the carbon dioxide from automobiles and factories is causing the recent increase in global warming.

NASA recently announced plans to build a permanent base on the moon. Astronauts could be living and working there by 2020, according to the U.S space agency. The goal is to prepare astronauts for a trip to Mars in the future.
Under the plan, four-person crews will begin with weeklong missions to the moon. By 2024, when more equipment has been set up, astronauts will be able to
or live, on the moon for as long as six months. Astronauts will travel in roving vehicles to explore the area near the
Unlike Earth, the moon has no air, wind, or weather. Its dusty
or surface, is covered with deep craters. So how can humans survive on the moon?
NASA hopes to establish a lunar outpost near one of the moon's poles. ""These locations experience sunlight for longer periods of time than other locations on the moon, which will make it possible to use solar power,"" NASA official Michael Braukus told
Solar power is energy from the sun that can be used to generate electricity.
It is also likely that the polar regions are rich in natural resources, such as oxygen and hydrogen. While on the moon, astronauts plan to use natural resources for water and fuel.
The moon is the only place beyond Earth that humans have visited. About 238,900 miles away, the moon is Earth's closest space neighbor.
On July 20, 1969, Americans Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the moon. Those space pioneers traveled to the lunar surface on the

or stop using, its aging space shuttle fleet by 2010. For their trek to the moon, astronauts will travel aboard the new
crew exploration vehicle, which is being developed. The vehicle, a modernized version of the
craft, will attach to a lunar lander.
The moon mission is part of President George W. Bush's longterm space plan. The proposed base is the first step in the bold plan to prepare astronauts for their ultimate destinationMars.
Because Mars is so far from Earth, traveling there will require humans to stay for long periods of time. Astronauts will not be able to bring enough supplies for the entire mission. They will have to use the elements on Mars to survive.
""By demonstrating we can survive on another world for a long time, we build confidence that we can venture much farther from Earth and stay for longer periods of time,"" says Braukus of NASA.
While some supporters are jumping over the moon about launching a new era of space exploration, not everyone is pleased with the plan. Critics warn that it will be difficult to fund the moon program. So far, NASA has not put a price tag on the mission but welcomes participation by other countries to help carry out its plan.
In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched
the first artificial satellite in space. The U.S. space program was established as a response. The ""space race"" between the two countries had begun. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy challenged Americans to send a person to the moon by the end of the 1960s. The time line shows some U.S. space milestones and NASA's plans for the lunar base.

To the spectators below, Bello's stunt looked dangerous-and it was. But Bello knew a secret. He was using science to help keep himself safe.
Bello began performing circus stunts when he was 9 years old. He walked on a thin wire that was stretched 9 feet off the ground.
To stay on a wire without falling, Bello needs to keep his center of gravity low. An object's center of gravity is usually located in the middle of the object. That is where the object's weight is centered.
By crouching and keeping low, Bello keeps his center of gravity low. The lower his center of gravity, the harder it is for Bello to fall.

Bello also uses Newton's first law of motion when he performs. That law is named for Isaac Newton. He was a scientist who lived about 275 years ago.

A great white shark cruised across the Indian Ocean in a record-breaking swim. The great white became the first shark known to complete a round-trip journey between two continents.
""This is the first time that an individual fish has been found to go across an entire ocean and come back to the same spot,"" says Ramn Bonfil, one of the scientists who studied the shark. Scientists named the shark Nicole, after Australian actor Nicole Kidman.
Nicole not only set a distance record but also took a bite out of the speed record. The great white clocked more than 12,400 miles on her trip from South Africa to Australia and back. She
or moved between locations, faster than any other marine animal.
The map shows Nicoles route between South Africa and Australia.
Great whites live mainly off the coasts of California, South Africa, and Australia. Nicoles 99-day journey was tracked with an electronic tag placed on her fin.
The tag recorded her movements, including how deep she dove in the water. The results stunned scientists. They discovered that there is more interaction among great white populations in Africa and Australia than had previously been thought.
The new find is helping scientists learn more about how sharks migrate and
(find their way). Why might Nicole have swum so far so fast? Scientists dont know for sure, but they think one of the reasons that she may have made the trip was a search for food. Great white sharks feed mainly on whales, seals, and fish.
And how did Nicole find her way from one continent to another? Although she frequently plunged to depths of more than one-half mile, Nicole spent most of her time swimming on the surface. That led scientists to suspect that great whites might use the sun and the moon to help navigate.
The recent discoveries have excited shark lovers. ""Its clear that we have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg,"" says Bonfil. ""There is still much to learn about great white shark migrations.""
Great whites arent the only big fish in the sea. There are about 370 species, or types, of sharks. Here are some sharks that make a splash.
The whale shark grows up to 40 feet long and weighs about 15 tons. Thats heavier than two elephants!
The dwarf lantern shark is thought to be one of the smallest sharks. It is about 6 inches long.
Although most sharks swim about 1.5 miles per hour (mph), the mako shark is thought to cruise around at 22 mph.
The dusky shark has the most powerful bite. Its jaws clamp together with 132 pounds of force.

The truck then climbs the hill and pours the water into a dumpster and six barrels. Martinez and her family use that water to bathe, clean, and wash. Although the water is free, it is not

bursting from a cliff. Lava is liquid rock that comes from a volcano.
The lava waterfall from the Kilauea volcano spilled into the Pacific Ocean. Steam shot into the air as the lava hit the water.

Kilauea, the worlds most active volcano, on Hawaiis Big Island has been erupting continuously since 1983. The November collapse was the largest in 23 years. It took about four hours for the cliff to tumble into the ocean. As the lava hardened, it began to form new land. All the Hawaiian Islands formed that way.
The recent collapse didnt surprise scientists. They had issued a warning months earlier because the cliff had formed cracks. Land collapses are not uncommon in the area. In 1996, a 26-acre area collapsed into the ocean, and in 1999, 25 acres of unsteady land fell into the water.

""We found that kids who were [light] TV watchers were [thinner]. The kids who were the fattest were those who watch a lot of TV,"" said Dr. Carlos Crespo. Crespo and Dr. Ross Anderson wrote the study.
The doctors said kids today watch more TV than kids did 30 years ago. Today, one in three kids watches four or more hours of TV a day. Watching that much TV, they said, is unhealthful.
According to the doctors, kids are not entirely to blame for watching too much TV. Part of the problem comes from a lack of safe places for kids to play.
Crespo and Anderson aren't against watching TV, as long as kids limit the time they spend in front of the tube.
""There are a certain number of hours in the day you're supposed to sleep [and] do your homework,"" said Crespo. ""You're supposed to go to school, and then there is a certain amount of hours that you are free to do whatever you want.

He scrambles up high ladders, walks down the sides of buildings, and rides in a fire engine. He is learning to be a firefighter at the New Haven Fire Academy.
Woolfolk and 28 other students are currently learning what it takes to become a firefighter. Classes at the fire academy, which is in Connecticut, last for about 22 weeks. On most days, the students go to school from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. However, once a week, school lasts until 10 p.m.
For two days each week, the students sit in a classroom to learn science, math, and emergency medicine. They learn the science of fires, how to calculate water pressure, and how to treat medical emergencies.
During the other three days, the students go outside and learn how to hook hoses to fire hydrants, climb buildings, rescue people trapped in burning buildings, and many other things.
""Firefighters have to know lots of different things,"" said Pablo Menendez, an instructor at the school. ""We have to treat medical emergencies, know how to handle dangerous chemicals, and rescue people who have fallen from cliffs.""
Teamwork is one of the most important lessons students learn at the school. ""Working together saves lives,"" said Capt. William Seward, the director of the academy. ""Students need to learn that they are part of a team.""
Fighting fires is not easy. The suits and equipment a firefighter wears weigh about 40 pounds.
Firefighters are very busy. In New Haven, they respond to 32,000 emergency calls a year. Each time firefighters go out, they know they might not come back. Across the United States, about 100 firefighters die each year.
""That's why the lessons learned here at the academy are so important,"" said Seward. ""What they learn here can save their lives.""
Firefighters know how dangerous their jobs are. Their training helps them overcome their fear of heights and fires. ""When you're up there on the ladder looking down, it's scary,"" said one student. ""To do this job, you've got to wipe out the fear.""
Firefighters overcome their fear for one reason. ""I wanted to help other people,"" said Leah Harwin. ""I think it is important to help other people whenever you can.""

The law is meant to ensure that schools are doing enough to help students who are struggling learners. Bush says that the law helps students perform better in reading and math. Under the law, schools are required to measure students' progress through testing. Schools in which many students don't perform well on the tests have two years to improve. Otherwise, students have the option to transfer to different schools.

When the sun is very active, dark spots, called
, dot the sun's surface. Each day, scientists can see more than 100 sunspots on the sun. Sunspots slowly change shape and move across the sun's surface.
Sunspots have a temperature of 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit (F). That might seem hot, but it is cooler than the rest of the sun's surface, which is a sweltering 10,000 degrees F. Because sunspots are cooler than the rest of the surface, they look dark--almost like shadows.
When the sun is very active, huge explosions can rip across its surface. Those explosions, called
, propel solar material into space. About three or four days after a flare erupts on the sun, the flare may collide with Earth's atmosphere.
When a flare reaches Earth, it can damage satellites orbiting Earth, power stations, and electrical equipment. In July, a huge flare interfered with communication satellites.
The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth.
A car traveling at 55 miles per hour would take 193 years to get from Earth to the sun.
It takes a beam of light eight minutes to travel from the surface of the sun to Earth.
When solar flares reach our planet, they can make gases in Earth's atmosphere glow. The glowing gases form the northern lights.
The northern lights can be many different colors: red, blue, green, or a combination of colors.
Scientists say the best time to see the northern lights is when the sun is active. People in many parts of the United States should be able to see the northern lights in the night sky this fall. People who live in the northern part of the United States have the best chance of seeing the dancing lights. To see them, the sky must be very dark.
senior editor Fran Downey once saw an aurora (the northern lights) while visiting Washington state. ""It began as a dull green light and got brighter and brighter, until it lit up the sky,"" Downey said. ""In the distance, I could hear coyotes howling at the aurora. It was beautiful.""

To solve that problem, some communities are sending kids to school in old stores, car dealerships, and malls!
The number of kids in school is increasing. In 15 years, eight million more kids than today will attend U.S. schools. Educators wonder what to do with all those kids. ""We need to figure out where we will put these children and who will teach them,"" said Richard Riley, U.S. Secretary of Education.
Educators say 10 million additional teachers will be needed to teach those kids.
Mesa, Arizona, is typical of many communities that have more kids than school space. Mesa has 84 schools and 550 classroom trailers parked around those schools. And still there isn't enough room for all the school-age kids.
To solve its space problem, officials in Mesa are building new schools. The community is also recycling old stores into schools.
This year, 700 elementary students in Mesa are attending the new Pedro Guerrero School, which used to be a supermarket. Where families once shopped for vegetables, kids now learn reading, history, science, and math.
Cassandra Fernandez attends the new school. The fifth grader's mother, who used to shop at the store, was worried when she heard that the city planned to turn it into a school. ""I thought, how are they going to make that [store] into a school?"" she said. Cassandra's mother, however, now likes the school and all the new equipment in it.
Mesa isn't the only community that has recycled old buildings into schools. Schools in Georgia, New Jersey, Ohio, and other states are also recycling schools. Recycling old buildings into schools is less expensive and takes less time than building new schools. Recycling schools also helps the environment by leaving space for trees.

The United States and Canada formed a task force to make sure another widespread blackout doesn't happen. Preventing a repeat blackout involves fixing the way electricity flows through the power grid. Some people want the government to spend more money on additional, stronger power lines and newer equipment.

Public schools across the country are going on a health kick. Thanks to a new federal law, students are saying farewell to fatty foods and hello to better eating habits in school. They are also exercising more during the school day.
Its up to schools to decide how they will comply with the law. Many districts are

In Florida, Missouri, and Texas, some schools have new rules that restrict desserts such as cupcakes and lollipops from parties. Instead, school officials are encouraging teachers and parents to provide more nutritious treats.
To get kids to exercise more, the northwestern Minnesota district of Perham Dent has added more physical activity to the school day. Many school districts are also making sure that kids have recess every day.

Obesity is the condition of being very overweight. Experts say the percentage of young people who are overweight has tripled since 1980. Being obese can lead to serious health problems later in life.
""We know that adults who are very overweight get sick more often and lose time at work,"" Julia Lear, the director of the Center for Health and Health Care in Schools, told
""The best thing to do is get kids in the habit of getting lots of exercise and eating healthy meals.""

shows that about 17,000 school busrelated accidents occur each year. Thats more than double previous estimates. Those injuries range from cuts to broken bones.
Researchers reported that crashes arent causing all those bumps and bruises. Slips and falls, getting jostled during stops and turns, and roughhousing are other ways kids get hurt. Nearly one-quarter of those injuries occur when kids are getting on and off buses.
Though the numbers are higher than thought, they represent a small fraction of kids. There are about 24 million kids who travel on school buses each year. School buses are still the safest way for kids to ride to school, according to the National School Transportation Association.
The results may prompt stronger arguments for requiring safety belts on buses. But not all safety experts agree. Seat belts wouldnt reduce injuries and wouldnt be worth the added expense for school districts, says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

President George W. Bush and many members of the U.S. Congress think so. On October 26, Bush signed the Secure Fence Act of 2006 into law. The law will allow the building of 700 miles of new fencing along the 2,100-mile border between the United States and Mexico.
The fence is designed to keep people from entering the United States without permission. About 6 million illegal immigrants from Mexico live in the United States today. An

Most illegal immigrants leave Mexico to find jobs in the United States. They usually cant find jobs in Mexico that pay as much as those in the United States do.
Some Americans say illegal immigrants take away jobs from U.S. citizens. Others say, however, that illegal immigrants help the U.S. economy by doing jobs that many Americans dont want.
The signing of the bill led to great anger in Mexico. Mexican officials say a fence would not stop illegal immigration and would be an insult to Mexico. Mexican President-elect Felipe Caldern pledged to challenge the fence at the United Nations. Bush, however, called the fence ""an important step in our nations efforts to secure our borders.""

When you come home from school, does your pet dog run to you barking and wagging its tail? Does your cat purr when you pet it? Many pet owners believe that tail wagging and purring are signs that pets are happy.
Most scientists are not sure that animals feel emotions. They say animals never feel happy or sad. In fact, they say, animals probably don't feel love, anger, hate or other emotions either.
Scientist Joseph LeDoux studied rats to find out whether the rodents have emotions. He found that rats do feel at least one emotion--fear. He also found the part of the brain that seems to control fear in rats. In humans, that part of the brain controls fear and some other emotions.
Even though LeDoux says rats feel fear, he doubts that other animals have emotions in the way humans and other primates do. ""A whale may behave as if it's in love,"" he said, ""but you can't prove what it's feeling, if anything.""
A number of scientists say animals do have a range of emotions. Some scientists who have studied such animals as dogs, cats, elephants, lions, and whales say those animals feel emotions. Scientist Joyce Poole studies elephants. She has written that pachyderms often show grief when a relative dies. She says elephants have ""deep emotions.""
Jane Goodall, studies chimpanzees. She says she has seen chimps playing and chasing one another for fun. Goodall also says chimps feel grief. After Flo, a 50-year-old chimp, died, one of her sons, Flint, refused to eat food. Flint's brothers and sisters tried to get him to eat, but they couldn't. Three weeks later, Flint died. Goodall says Flint ""died of grief.""
More recently, scientist Marc Bekoff watched an elk run back and forth through a patch of snow, jumping into the air as it completed each back-and-forth pass. Bekoff said the animal was feeling the ""joy of life.""
Bekoff said he can't prove that animals have feelings, because animals can't talk. But, he said, animals can communicate feelings in other ways. ""I can't prove that another human being is feeling happy or sad,"" he said, ""but I can [guess] how [he or she is] feeling through body language and facial expressions."" Both people and animals use

Last summer, a federal court in California ruled that the pledge is

Guide horses are usually between 26 and 27 inches tall and weigh between 80 and 100 pounds-about the same size as many guide dogs.

In 1999, eight hurricanes formed in the Atlantic Ocean. Although Gray predicts fewer hurricanes will form this year, it is still more hurricanes than usual. On average, six hurricanes form each year.
Gray expects hurricanes to hit more often in years to come. ""There is a strong likelihood that in coming years, we'll see more major storms [than we have in the past],"" he said. He predicts more hurricanes because the Atlantic Ocean is warmer than usual.
Hurricanes are killers. Last year, Hurricane Floyd killed 68 people and forced 3 million people to leave their homes.

The ice fields there stretch along the Andes Mountains in South America and are home to 63 glaciers.
are large sheets of snow and ice that move slowly over land.
Glaciers are found in the polar regions around the world and in mountain valleys. The glaciers in South America are some of the largest outside the polar regions.
Because of the region's rough terrain and harsh weather, scientists have trouble reaching the area by foot. To study the melting of the South American glaciers, scientists recently relied on satellite technology.
Scientists discovered that glaciers in this area are rapidly melting.In fact, they are melting twice as fast as they were just a few years ago. Erik Rignot, an expert who studied the glaciers, referred to the South American ice fields as the ""fastest area of glacial retreat on Earth.""
As the glaciers melt, their water flows into lakes or oceans. As a result, the meltdown is causing sea levels to rise. If ocean levels rise by even a foot, the water could flood the world's coastal cities.
What is causing the glaciers to pull a disappearing act? Warmer temperatures and less snowfall from
are to blame for the meltdown, say scientists. Global warming is the worldwide rise in temperature.
The warmer temperatures cause the glaciers to break off into the ocean as icebergs. That process, called
It's not just that the South American glaciers are on thin ice. Scientists warn that about 90 percent of the world's glaciers are melting from global warming.
Some scientists say that people contribute to Earth's warmer temperatures. Harmful gases are released into the air when people burn certain fuels for electricity or for driving cars.
To help solve the problem, some scientists say people must work to reduce the effects of global warming. ""Once the glaciers have melted, that's it [for them],"" said one scientist.
Glaciers are large sheets of moving ice and snow. As snow accumulates, or builds up, on a glacier, the weight causes the snow underneath to turn into ice. The ice becomes so heavy that it forces the glacier to move.
As glaciers slowly move, they carve out the land beneath them, carrying away rocks and soil. Glaciers erode, or gradually wear away, the land.
What are some ways people can help prevent global warming?
Over hundreds and thousands of years, glaciers create different landforms, such as lakes.

Yet Ellis wonders whether the koalas on St. Bees could be headed for hard times. The island is overrun with wild goats. Ellis thinks the goats are eating the small blue gum trees.
Without those trees, koalas will run out of food in the future. Ellis hopes more research will help him understand how to protect the blue gumsand the koalas that depend on them.

They spend most of their time in eucalyptus trees.
A koala eats about 2 ? pounds of eucalyptus leaves each day. Koalas eat so many leaves that they often smell like eucalyptus cough drops.
Eucalyptus leaves are not very nutritious. As a result, koalas spend up to 18 hours a day sleeping. That helps them store up energy.
Bill Ellis shakes the branches of a tree where a koala named Yellow rests.
As volunteers hold a plastic sheet to catch Yellow, Ellis (in the red-and-blue cap) gently pushes her into a sack.
Volunteers hold Yellow in the sack as they adjust a radio collar around her neck. The radio collar will help scientists track her. They also place a colored tag in her ear to help tell her apart from other koalas on St. Bees Island.

follows a clownfish that is scooped up from the Great Barrier Reef.
In real life, clownfish are among the thousands of colorful sea creatures that call the Great Barrier Reef home.
Stretching 1,250 miles along Australia's northeastern coast, the Great Barrier Reef is the longest coral reef in the world. A
But these days, the Great Barrier Reef has found itself in trouble. Over fishing, pollution, and high temperatures are harming its health. That's why the government in Australia is trying to help rescue the reef.
While coral may look like a plant, it is actually made up of tiny sea animals. Those sea animals are called
As polyps die, they leave hard shells behind. Other polyps grow on top of the shells. Over thousands of years, they form a coral reef in warm water that is not very deep.
In many ways, the Great Barrier Reef resembles an underwater garden. Coral can be hard or soft. It forms in different colors and in strange shapes. Some coral looks like hardened brains. Other coral looks like fans and lettuces. The reef bursts with schools of tropical fish, darting among gaps in the coral.
The reef supplies food and shelter to creatures living in and around the coral. Turtles, sharks, sea horses, and crabs are among its many inhabitants. The reef also acts as a barrier to keep waves from slamming against the shore.
While the reef is important to ocean life, it helps humans, too. People rely on the reef for both food and jobs. It also provides medicine used to treat disease. Each year, the Great Barrier Reef contributes about $975 million to the economy through tourism and fishing.
Is it surprising, then, that the Great Barrier Reef is under too much stress? Fishing nets and ships break off sections and damage the reef. Air and water pollution are also doing harm. At the same time, warmer sea temperatures have caused
on half of the reef. The high temperatures cause the coral to turn white, often killing it.
In an effort to help save the reef, the government has limited fishing to two-thirds of it. That plan increases the number of ""green zones."" Those are areas that are off-limits to fishermen and boats. However, tourists and researchers can still visit them. Many fishermen are upset about the plan because they rely on the reef for jobs.
The Australian government says that its plan will help keep the reef safe from some threats. ""It is very important that we give the reef proper protection for the future,"" said one government official. ""The reef is Australia's greatest natural [treasure].""
Ships and fishing nets are destroying the Great Barrier Reef. They sometimes break off large sections of the reef.

A recent study shows that how kids answer those questions tells a lot about whether they are headed for trouble. The study says kids who spend their free time aimlessly often get into trouble.
The study, called the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, was funded by the federal government. More than 90,000 kids between the ages of 12 and 18 took part in the study. Those kids attended 134 different U.S. schools. The study followed them from 1994 to 2000.
About half of the kids in the study said they were not involved in dangerous activities. But 25 percent said they had tried a cigarette, 26 percent said they had picked up a gun, and 47 percent said they had tried alcohol.
The study found that kids who spend their free time hanging out with nothing to do, who get poor grades, or who don't talk with their parents are eight times more likely to take part in unhealthful activities later on, such as smoking cigarettes or trying drugs.
Kids who hang out with friends who drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or have tried drugs are likely to do what their friends are doing, said Robert Blum. Blum is one of the doctors who conducted the study. In other words, kids tend to act like their friends, Blum said.
""How young people do at school and what they do with their free time are the most important [ways of predicting] risky behavior,"" said Blum.
Kids should get involved in interesting activities, Blum advised. Instead of hanging out with kids who are already trying what the study calls ""high-risk activities,"" Blum said that kids should play sports, read, talk with parents, or do homework.
The National Longitudinal Study finds that kids who are involved in activities usually don't get into trouble. Here's a story written by a
kid reporter about a few kids who know how to spend their time:
There are a lot of good kids. I know three of them who live in my hometown, Lockport, Illinois.

The students found the canoes in a lake near Gainesville, Florida. The Seminole people used to live near the lake. Seminole Chief James Billie said his ancestors called the lake
, which means ""place of the long boats.""
The sunken wooden canoes were exposed when the lake's water level dropped last spring. The mud at the bottom of the lake had preserved the canoes.
The scientists who studied the canoes say they are 22 feet long. After studying the canoes, the scientists returned them to the lake bed. They explained that leaving the ancient canoes exposed to the air would have caused them to crumble in a few days or weeks.

489,"Going, Going, Gone! African Monkey Declared Extinct
In 1933, a discovery in Africa excited scientists around the world. They had found a
, or kind, of monkey that they had never seen before--the Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey. Now, only 77 years after it was found, that monkey is extinct, scientists recently announced.
No one has seen a Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey for more than 20 years. In 1988, scientists declared the monkey an endangered species. For the last seven years, scientists searched for the monkey in Ghana and Cte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), two countries in western Africa. They found no sign of the animal.
""If [the] red colobus were present near any of our survey routes, it is likely that we would have seen one,"" said scientist John Oates.
Scientists blame the animal's extinction on hunting and the destruction of the forests where it lived.
Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was the first primate --which includes monkeys and apes--to become extinct in nearly 300 years. But scientists say it will not be the last. They worry that many of the 600 other primate species may die out within the next 100 years. Twenty-five species may die out within ten to 20 years. More than 120 primate species may become extinct before the end of this century, said Ross MacPhee of New York City's American Museum of Natural History.
Endangered primates live in Africa, Asia, and South America. Many of those primates live in areas where people are poor and need to hunt for food to survive.
Scientists fear that unlimited hunting could kill off more primates. ""Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was eaten by people. The last ones probably went into someone's pot,"" said scientist John Terborgh.
MacPhee explained that the best way to help primates is to protect them and the areas where they live. ""As long as there are a few individuals, and as long as humans leave them alone, they'll come back [from near extinction].""

Knock, Knock? Who's there? The ivory-billed woodpecker, that's who!
For more than 50 years, scientists thought the ivory-billed woodpecker was extinct in the United States. Now bird lovers are flying high. Scientists recently announced that they have evidence the bird still exists in eastern Arkansas. The scientists caught the black-and-white birds in flight on a blurry videotape.
The ivory-billed woodpecker was seen again at Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in Eastern Arkansas.
The rare woodpeckers began to disappear between 1880 and the 1940s when loggers cut down the forests where they lived. The last sighting was in 1944.
The ivorybill is the largest woodpecker in the country. The red-crested bird's body is shiny blue-black. It has white markings on its neck and on both edges of its huge wings. The woodpecker's wingspan extends almost 3 feet. The bird also has a straight bill, short legs, and feet with curved claws.
, or one-of-a-kind, sound. They produce a double knock when their strong beaks strike trees. In addition, they make a call that sounds like the toot of a toy horn.
For people who doubted the videotape of the woodpeckers, the scientists collected more proof. They recorded the bird's double knock.
The recording made believers out of the doubters. ""Hearing [the recording] was very exciting!"" Richard Prum, a scientist from Yale University who studies birds, told
. ""[It is] convincing evidence that the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct.""
What are people doing to help the number of ivory-billed woodpeckers bounce back? Nature lovers are cutting down some trees in a select area of Arkansas. Sound strange? The woodpeckers feed on young beetles that thrive under the bark of fallen trees. With more food for the woodpeckers, bird lovers hope that the ivorybill's double knock will become a common sound again.

""I want to show people what I am able to do,"" Reilly said from the top of Mount Fuji. ""Maybe it will inspire them.""
How exactly did he make his climb? Reilly used a special bike that he powered with his arms. Reilly traveled with a support team of eight people and reached the

Reilly's journey, however, was not without obstacles. His team was stopped by a park ranger who said mountain bikes weren't allowed on the trail. They managed to persuade the park ranger to allow them to continue their journey. Although Reilly's bike was built to climb rocks, the trail was covered with volcanic ash and gravel, making for a difficult ride.
What does Reilly teach people about overcoming challenges to reach their goals?
Mount Fuji is one of the most-climbed peaks in the world. Reilly chose the mountain because he wanted to pick one outside the United States. Since losing the use of his legs, Reilly has also climbed peaks in Colorado and California.

The centennial celebration honors the Ancient Pueblo (PWEH-bloh) people, formerly known as the Anasazi (ah-nuh-SAH-zee). The word
means ""town"" in Spanish. The Ancient Pueblo, who constructed Mesa Verdes cliff dwellings, are the ancestors of todays Pueblo people of the U.S. Southwest.
The Ancient Pueblo were an agricultural people who
or lived, in the area more than 1,000 years ago. They mainly farmed corn, beans, and squash.
From 600 until the 1100s, the Ancient Pueblo lived primarily on the

Why did the Ancient Pueblo abandon the region? ""We dont know the exact reason,"" says Puskar. Some possibilities are climate change, drought, or overuse of the areas soil and other resources.
In the late 1800s, explorers found the ancient dwellings and removed pottery, baskets, and other
from the site. An artifact is any object made or used by people in the past.
On June 29, 1906, Congress passed a bill to establish Mesa Verde National Park. The bill, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt, protects the cultural treasures at this historic Native American site. It is a federal crime to remove or destroy any historic object or monument on land owned by the U.S. government.
""Its not often that you come across a hundred years of something special,"" Puskar says about the park. ""It was worthwhile to celebrate the past that comes from the Pueblo people as well as our nations past. [The centennial] provides us the chance to look forward to the next 100 years and make sure this place stays preserved and enjoyed by the public.""

Mesa Verde National Park protects more than 600 cliff dwellings built by the Ancient Pueblo. The two largest dwellings contain about 160 rooms each.
By building their dwellings out of stone, the Ancient Pueblo could construct homes on top of one another. By 1100, their structures were as large as some modern-day apartment buildings.
Why did the Ancient Pueblo of the Southwest rely on farming rather than hunting?

314,"Lighten Up! Most students carry too much weight in their backpacks.
A new study shows that kids need to lessen their backpack loads.
Chances are youre carrying a heavy burdentoo much weight in your backpack. A new study warns that American kids need to reduce their backpack loads and spread out the weight.
Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, have shown that too much pressure from an overloaded backpack may cause shoulder pain. In addition, an uneven backpack load may lead to pain in the lower back.
Five girls and five boysall 13 years oldparticipated in the study. The kids wore identical backpacks, fitted on the shoulder straps with measuring devices called pressure sensors.
The children first carried 10 percent of their body weight, then 20 percent, and finally 30 percent. With each increase, the kids reported that their pain worsened.
According to previous studies, children typically carry loads that are about 22 percent of their body weight. The new study confirmed that 22 percent of body weight is too high.
Each year an estimated 7,500 emergency room visits result from injuries related to backpacks and book bags, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The researchers hope their information will encourage backpack makers to design wide, well-padded shoulder straps to help spread the weight.
The researchers also hope the results of their study will encourage kids to
or lessen, their loads. ""The weight in the backpack should be minimized as much as possible,"" Brandon Macias, one of the studys lead authors, told
Here are some tips to help you wear your backpack safely.
Dont carry more than 15 percent of your body weight. This means that if you weigh 100 pounds, you should not wear a backpack heavier than 15 pounds.
Choose a backpack that is the right size for your body.
Pack only what you need, and load heaviest items closest to your back.
Always wear both shoulder straps, and fasten the waist strap to balance the backpacks weight evenly.
Adjust shoulder and waist straps so the backpack fits snugly to your body and the weight is evenly balanced.
If your backpack is too heavy, consider using a book bag on wheels, if your school allows it.

The Mercury missions were the first attempts by NASA, the U.S. space agency, to send a human into space. The rocket missions took place from 1961 to 1963. During the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union competed to build the best space program. That period was called the space race.

Carved into the famous granite monument are the faces of four U.S. presidentsGeorge Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Mount Rushmore is located in the Black Hills of South Dakota. For five weeks this summer, a crew washed the presidents' faces.
To kick off the cleaning, workers scaled the mountain and sprayed the left side of Jefferson's forehead with water. They also blasted Jefferson's eyelid and jaw with handheld hoses to wash away decades of dirt.
""Apart from the dirt, we are concerned with the lichens,"" Mount Rushmore official Judy Olson told
. Lichens are small plant-like organisms that can grow on hard surfaces, such as rock and bark. They make an acid that can harm the faces. ""The lichen roots are digging into the stone,"" Olson says.
The workers took special care near the cracks on the stone faces. They used pressure washing instead of chemicals. Pressure washing has been used to clean other historical structures, including the Statue of Liberty in New York City and the Coliseum in Rome.
Mount Rushmore was designed by American sculptor Gutzon Borglum. From 1927 to 1941, his team worked on the memorial. They used drills and dynamite to blast into the cliff. Each head is as tall as a six-story building.
Four presidents were carved into Mount Rushmore because they symbolized courage and freedom during the first 150 years of American history.

The land where pandas are found, however, is being cleared and used for farmland. The trees are being used for firewood to heat people's homes.
There are now seven pandas living in the United States. Two are in Washington, D.C.; two are in Atlanta, Georgia; and three are in San Diego, California.

The Civil War is one of the most important wars in U.S. history. It lasted from 1861 to 1865. During the Civil War, 11 states broke away from the United States. The U.S. government then declared war on the rebel states to bring them back into the United States.
The breakaway states formed a new country called the Confederate States of America. The other states were called the Union. About 625,000 people died fighting the war.
The Union won the war and the rebel states eventually rejoined the United States. The end of the war also brought about the end of slavery in the United States.

During his mission to raise money, Ryan became pen pals with Akana Jimmy, an orphan who lived in Africa. In Jimmys tiny village of Agweo, Uganda, there was no clean water until Ryan raised enough money to buy the village its first well. A new book tells the story of their life-changing friendship

His teacher said the cost of building a well in Africa was just $70. Determined to help, Ryan spent months doing household chores to earn enough money to pay for a well.
Later that year, Ryan proudly took his savings to WaterCan, a Canadian organization that helps provide safe drinking water to impoverished countries. To his disappointment, Ryan was told that the cost of building a well was much higher: $2,000.

Ryans well changed the lives of the people in Agweo and especially affected Jimmys life. Thats when the two boys became pen pals. They became friends when Ryan traveled to Uganda in 2000 to help complete the well.
In 2003, Ryans family arranged to bring Jimmy to their home in Canada. ""We used to live as friends,"" Jimmy, now 17, says, ""but now we live as brothers.""

You may be surprised to learn that only a scarce, or limited, amount of the water is drinkable. Salty seawater makes up about 97 percent of the worlds water. Another 2 percent is frozen at the North and South poles.
More than 1 billion people around the world dont have access to safe drinking water, according to the United Nations. Why isnt all the freshwater available to people safe for drinking? Chemicals from factories, fertilizers from farms, and untreated sewage pollute the water supply. ""One of our goals is to educate people about the importance of clean water,"" says Ryan.
What are some ways you can help conserve water?

Millions of citizens across the country watched in horror as terrorists used hijacked airplanes to attack two of America's most famous landmarks--the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Another stolen plane crashed in Pennsylvania.
The destruction caused by the hijacked jetliners stunned eyewitnesses. ""It was like the building had been hit by an asteroid,"" Marty Singer said of the World Trade Center in New York City.
Another eyewitness compared the attack on the twin towers of the World Trade Center to a terrible storm. ""Giant balls of flame burst out of the walls,"" Hugh Smyser said. ""Glass and aluminum sheathing [outer material from the buildings] came down like a huge snowstorm.""
Although the attacks took place in New York and our nation's capital, every U.S. citizen felt the impact of the attacks. Many states and communities closed public buildings, parks, and monuments. Events, such as baseball games, were canceled. Many businesses and schools were closed, as everyone mourned the victims of the savage attacks.
The flames from the burning landmarks forged a new bond among Americans. Thousands lined up to donate blood for victims injured in the attacks. Firefighters, rescue workers, doctors, nurses, and volunteers worked tirelessly. Millions of Americans sent canned goods, snack foods, bottled water, and money to help the victims and rescue workers.
As Americans came together to help one another out during the crisis, people throughout the world knew that life would never again be the same. ""This is one of the few days in life that one can actually say will change everything,"" said one European leader.
U.S. authorities said soon after the attacks that the terrorists who hijacked the four planes from three airports must have planned their assaults carefully. Here's what happened, beginning at 8:48 a.m. on September 11.
A plane hijacked from an airport in Boston, Massachusetts, crashes into one of the 110 story towers that made up the World Trade Center in New York City. As the building burns, a second plane hijacked from Boston slams into the other World Trade Center tower 18 minutes later.
A third hijacked jet, which took off from an airport near Washington, D.C., crashes into the side Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac River from the capital. The Pentagon houses the offices of most of the branches of the U.S. military.
One of the World Trade Center towers collapses. Fifteen minutes later, a fourth hijacked place crashes in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, about 80 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. The other tower collapses almost 25 minutes later.
Ash and debris from the collapsed towers cover victims and rescue workers.
Rescue workers comb through the rubble of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon looking for survivors. At the same time, law enforcement officials look for clues to find the terrorist who staged the brutal attacks.

A happy ending took place off the southern coast of Florida in August. Five pilot whales were released back into the ocean. Pilot whales are members of the dolphin family.
Rescue workers had nursed the whales back to health after the creatures had become stranded in shallow water in April. Their return to the water marked the first time in history that five whales stranded at the same time were returned to the ocean together.
Using a crane, volunteers lowered the whales headfirst into the water. The whales had been fitted with special devices for scientists to track their progress. As the whales swam away, many volunteers cheered. Some were moved to tears.
Later in the day, people in a helicopter spotted the whales swimming together. Rescuers hoped that the five would join a larger group of nearby whales.

Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.

This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
. The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
. A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
. That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
. Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's As Easy As One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
. The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
. The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
. We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.

405,"In 1969, Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin made history as the first people on the moon.
spoke to Buzz Aldrin about NASA's planned return to the moon, a future on Mars, and his children's book,
, which was recently featured at the National Book Festival in Washington, D.C.
What does it feel like to walk on the moon?
Aldrin: You knew that you were there, but it was unreal at the same time. It's so different and unusual that it's almost dreamlike.
What was the most memorable part of walking on the moon?
Aldrin: There are two moments that are not recorded on film. They're recorded in my mind. One was just the second or two after we shut the engine down and we realized that the spacecraft was on the moon. That really was the major achievement. When I was outside seeing the Earth, my other thought was that there were only three human beings who were not on Earth. [The third was Michael Collins, who was orbiting the moon in a craft that would take the astronauts back to Earth.]
Your children's book is about following your dreams. Did you dream of being an astronaut?
Aldrin: Well, there wasn't any such thing as an astronaut until about 1958 or 1959.
[the Soviet space satellite] didn't go up until 1957, so thinking of human beings in space was not at all common.
Will returning to the moon have the same impact as it did when you and Mr. Armstrong first set foot on the moon?
Aldrin: No, I don't think there is any way you can replace that competitiveness [to reach the moon first] that existed, that pioneering spirit. The moon is a proving ground in our backyard. We've been there before, but it's preparing us to visit another planet.
You've been a supporter of a piloted mission to Mars. Why do you think it's so important that we send humans to Mars?
Aldrin: Now we can send robots to Mars, but that just wouldn't satisfy the human desire to want to expand our horizons. We've always done that. I can't answer by saying that there is going to be something profitable that will be returned from Mars, other than perhaps storytelling or making movies en route.
Your sister gave you the name ""Buzzer"" when you were youngand then it got shortened to Buzz. And that stuck?
Aldrin: It certainly did. It made it very recognizable and unique.

258,"The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle's grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles.
The disease attacks an infected bird's brain and spinal cord.
At first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird.
In recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year.
Although the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased.
By the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild.
Wildlife experts are especially concerned because they don't know much about the disease, including what causes it. ""We have some ideas, but we don't have any answers,"" John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said.
Experts also don't know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. ""This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn't noticed,"" Fischer said.
While wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Scientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America's bird--the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn't true in 1782.
Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol.
""I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country"", Franklin wrote. ""He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird"".

The fourth grader swam the 1.4 miles between Alcatraz Island and San Francisco in just less than two hours. He swam to raise money for Hurricane Katrina victims.
Although Johnny trained for three months, the water was colder and wavier than he had expected. Johnny made it to the shore by telling himself, ""Im almost there. Im almost there.""
His classmates were waiting on shore, cheering ""Go, Johnny! Go, Johnny!"" When he came out of the chilly water, his father hugged him and said, ""Can you believe it? You did it!""
Johnny successfully made the trek that Alcatraz prisoners had dared to cross years ago. Alcatraz Island housed a prison from 1934 to 1963. In 1962, three prisoners escaped by swimming across the bay. They were never heard from again, so it remains a mystery whether they made it through the frigid waters to land.
Johnny didnt only raise more than $30,000 for his swim. He also reportedly became the youngest person to swim the distance from Alcatraz to San Francisco.

Rats have always lived in cities. The rodents live off food and waste that people throw away. Recently, however, rat populations have grown because many communities don't have the money to pay for rat-control programs, said Jerry Hershovitz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Such programs keep rat populations down.
Rats can carry diseases that can make people seriously ill, so controlling the rat population is important.
The solution to the rat problem is to limit their food supply, say experts. For example, people in cities should use garbage cans that rats cannot get into.

674,"The mummy which may be Nefertiti lies in Egypt's Valley of the Kings.
Queen Nefertiti's name means ""the beautiful one has come."" It is not surprising that she was given such a name. Queen Nefertiti has long been admired for her swanlike neck and high cheekbones.
But Nefertiti was more than just a pretty face. She is believed to have been one of the most powerful women who ever lived. She ruled Egypt more than 3,000 years ago. Egypt is a country in Africa.
Mysteriously, no one knows how Queen Nefertiti died. Her remains have never been found--until now, perhaps.
led by Joann Fletcher uncovered three mummies in a tomb in Egypt. (Archaeologists are scientists who dig up ancient objects and study them to learn about the past.) Fletcher believes that one of the mummies is Queen Nefertiti.
Modern science is helping Fletcher prove her idea and identify the face of the mummy. After X-rays of the mummy were taken, scientists put together a computerized version of what the face would have looked like.
What they discovered was amazing! The re-created face resembles a famous sculpture of Queen Nefertiti that was made during her reign.
""If the mummy is who we think it is, it would certainly help to answer a lot of unanswered questions,"" said Fletcher.
Scientists are quick to point out that the computerized version of the face does not prove that the mummy is Queen Nefertiti. The re-created face, however, isn't the only clue to the past.
There are other pieces of the puzzle that make Fletcher's team think the mummy is Nefertiti. First, the mummy's hair had been shaved off. Nefertiti preferred a shaved head so that her crown would fit tightly. A shaved head also helped her stay cool in Egypt's heat. Second, traces of a wig found next to the mummy matched the kind Nefertiti would have worn.
In addition, the mummy's left earlobe was pierced twice. Statues of Nefertiti show her having a double-pierced ear. The mummy's forehead showed the mark of a tight-fitting band--a sign of royalty. Another clue was the mummy's bent arm, which was broken off. Royalty were usually buried with their arms bent.
Not all scientists are convinced that the mummy is Nefertiti.
""If the mummy is female and if it is royal, then you still do not necessarily have Nefertiti,"" one archaeologist told
Another scientist from Egypt expressed doubts that the mummy is even a female. He said that both men and women could have double-pierced ears.

The pharaoh and Nefertiti were disliked because they challenged the religion of the time. They began to worship one god instead of many gods. As part of their new religion, they moved from the city of Thebes and built a new capital in the heart of the desert. The new capital was called Akhetaton (ah-keh-TAHT-uhn).

The explosions killed ten workers and injured others. Workers struggled for days to save the rig, only to see it slowly topple over and sink into the ocean.
Officials from the Brazilian oil company Petrobras, which owns the rig, were concerned after some of the 400,000 gallons of diesel fuel and crude oil on the rig leaked out. But the spill turned out to be smaller than expected.
The problem now facing Brazil is the loss of oil production. The P-36 rig provided a large portion of the oil Brazil uses to make fuel. Now the country will have to import more oil from other countries to meet demands.

What exactly makes a story a fantasy? Traditionally, a fantasy tells the story of a single character, the hero, such as Harry Potter. Like Harry, the hero is often unaware of his or her power. After crossing into a different world, the hero is faced with a series of tests.
In a fantasy story, a teacher often shows the hero the tricks of the trade. In
, wise Gandalf protects the hobbit Frodo. Harry, too, is taught by Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts.
Fantasy books typically end with a battle between the hero and the villainand the hero ultimately wins. If Rowling sticks to the fantasy formula, will Harry defeat Lord Voldemort in Book 7 of the series?
The fantasy craze has also hit the big screen, with many books being made into films. Fans of
movies turned out in record numbers. This December, a film version of the classic C. S. Lewis book

Sugary snacks and high-fat foods are on their way out as schools change their lunch menus.
School lunch will never be the same. Move

Lunch trays are now filled with yogurts, sandwiches on whole-wheat bread, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Vending machines now offer nuts, bottled water, and granola bars.
In 2005, 17 states passed new nutrition laws to limit unhealthy food in schools. Texas removed deep-fried foods from school menus. Connecticut banned the sale of soft drinks and high-fat snacks in vending machines, school stores, and cafeterias. New Jersey passed one of the toughest school nutrition laws in the country. Next year, no schools in that state will be able to sell foods or drinks that list sugar as the main ingredient. Those items include candy and soda.

252,"The Southeast: Exploring the 'Land of the Flowers'
Long before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, Spaniards had explored and settled large parts of what is now the United States.
One of the regions the Spanish explored first was the Southeast. Hernando de Soto and 600 followers were the first European explorers to journey through the Southeast. For nearly four years, de Soto and his followers wandered through the region.
After sailing from Cuba in 1539, de Soto landed in Florida. An earlier Spanish explorer, Juan Ponce de Len, had named the land
, after a Spanish word meaning ""flowery"".
La Florida was much larger then present-day Florida. It covered most of the area in what are now the southeastern states. One of de Soto's men described the animals the explorers found. ""There are many lions and bears in Florida, wolves, deer, jackals, cats and rabbits (also live there),"" he wrote.
Many different groups of Native Americans lived in La Florida. They grew corn, beans and squash. They also fished and hunted.
Because the native groups did not trust de Soto, they often left their villages before the Spaniards arrived. The Native Americans had good reason to fear de Soto. He captured and enslaved some of them.
De Soto and his men were mainly looking for gold. The search for gold led them out of present-day Florida north to what is now Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
After reaching North Carolina without finding gold, the explorers turned west and crossed the Appalachian Mountains. Upon hearing rumors of gold, de Soto led his men into Tennessee and south to Alabama.
In southern Alabama, the Choctaw Indians attacked the explorers. They killed many of de Soto's men, and some of his supplies were taken.
De Soto's expedition then turned northwest through Alabama and into present-day Mississippi. In May 1541, de Soto reached the Mississippi River, near what is now Memphis, Tennessee. Then they crossed into Arkansas, where in May 1542, De Soto died.
The explorers then retreated to the Mississippi River, where they built boats, which sailed down the river to the Gulf of Mexico. Only about half of the people who had landed with de Soto in Florida survived the trek across the Southeast.

About 40 years ago, the number of bald eagles in the United States was declining rapidly. Today, however, the bald eagle is returning to the skies. Wildlife officials hope to remove the bird from the list of threatened species by the end of the year.
In the early 1700s, bald eagles were a common sight. There were about half a million of those birds living in the United States.
Over time, their population fell dramatically. In the early 1960s, very few bald eagles remained.
What caused the number to drop? Hunting and the use of harmful chemicals sprayed on crops were largely to blame. Those chemicals poisoned the birds and their eggs.
Pollution also contributed to the problem. Bald eagles often became sick after eating fish from polluted waters.

In 1782, the bald eagle was made the national bird of the United States. The nation's founders chose the bird because it symbolized freedom, strength, and courage. At the time, some people disagreed about the choice for the national bird. Benjamin Franklin, for example, thought the turkey would make a better choice because it was ""a much more respectable bird.""

On Inauguration Day, Bush is scheduled to stand outside the U.S. Capitol before thousands of citizens, the men and women of Congress, and members of the U.S. Supreme Court.
Bush will put his hand on an open Bible held by the chief justice of the United States. Bush will then recite the same Oath of Office that was spoken by the first U.S. president, George Washington, in 1789. The
is the president's promise to lead the country.
After Bush recites the Oath of Office, he will give a speech that may set the tone of his presidency. Many people will be listening carefully to his speech, because the 2000 presidential election was the source of bitter debate.
The first inauguration ceremony was performed in New York City, which was then the nation's capital. On April 30, 1789, George Washington took office. Since then, the ceremony has changed.
Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, walked to the White House after his ceremony in 1801. Bush will arrive at the White House in a long parade of limousines and Secret Service vehicles.
James Monroe, the fifth U.S. president, gave the first outdoor inaugural speech in 1817.
After Andrew Jackson, the seventh U.S. president, was inaugurated in 1829, he held an open house at the White House. The open house got out of control after the crowd, in a rush to see President Jackson, started breaking furniture and china. Jackson was forced to escape through an open window. Although an open house is expected to be held again this year, it will probably be a more controlled event.

Some of superheated rivers of lava flowed toward towns. In an attempt to stop the advancing lava, airplanes dropped thousands of gallons on water on it. Fearing for their lives, many people fled from their homes.

Hollywood is used to rolling out the red carpet for celebrities. Now it has laid out the carpet once again for its latest starKing Tutankhamun (too-tahn-KAHmun). The famous Egyptian king's treasures are traveling the country in a new exhibit, now open in Los Angeles. The tour will make stops in three other U.S. cities before returning to Egypt in 2007. ""
King Tut and his treasures first visited the United States in the 1970s. That display attracted a whopping 8 million visitors. The new exhibit looks at what life was like for Tut and other
who ruled ancient Egypt more than 3,500 years ago. A pharaoh is an ancient Egyptian ruler.
After the death of his father, King Tut became pharaoh at just 9 years old. Tut reigned for about nine years before he died mysteriously. He was buried in a hidden tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, an area near the Nile River.
Tut's tomb remained locked away until 1922, when British

""Not only does [the figure] show Tut's majesty, but it also shows his human side,"" Egyptian expert David Silverman told
""You can see a young boy behind those eyes.""
The exhibit also includes the boy king's crown and gold dagger. The dagger was found strapped to the mummy's thigh. Scientists believe that Tut's subjects buried their king with the dagger to fight villains on his journey to the afterlife. Objects that belonged to Tut's family members and other Egyptian royalty are also featured at the exhibit.

No person was behind the camera's lens. The camera was triggered by motion and heat from the passing cat.
Scientists from the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York have placed about 30 such cameras in trees throughout the tropical forest of Belize (beh-LEEZ). That is a country in Central America.
The forest is also the site of the world's first jaguar
. A reserve is an area set apart for a special purpose. At the reserve in Belize, jaguars are protected and can safely roam.
Belize has a healthy number of jaguars. The wildlife group estimates that about 14 jaguars live within a 55-square-mile area there. The cameras are helping researchers count the number of jaguars within certain areas of Belize and other places where jaguars roam.
Today, jaguars can be found from northern Argentina in South America up through Mexico. At one time, they lived as far north as New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. However, these powerful cats are now considered extinct in the United States.

The actions of people have caused a decline in the animal's range. The cutting down of trees has destroyed some of the jaguar's habitat.
Many ranchers shoot the cats because they fear that jaguars will kill their livestock, such as sheep and cattle. Researchers say, however, that livestock are often killed by puma cats or die from disease or poor nutrition.
Although the cats face many threats, they have a hopeful future. Researchers have been educating ranchers and helping them build electric fences to keep their livestock from wandering into the wild.
Using cameras, scientists are keeping a watchful eye on these threatened cats and learning more about their range. As Rabinowitz points out, ""In some areas, jaguars are decreasing. In other areas, they are making a comeback.""

232,"The Liberty Bell no longer rings today. During the move, wireless technology will be attached to the bell.
The Liberty Bell is about to get a new home. This fall, it will move from its current location at Liberty Bell Pavilion in Philadelphia to a new building down the street.
Why the change of address? It is part of improvements being made to the area where the bell now hangs.
Moving the bell, which weighs 2,080 pounds, could be tricky. Movers want to make sure that no additional harm is done to the bell's famous crack.
During the move, scientists will attach wireless technology to the bell. That technology will sound an alarm if strain from the move causes the crack to enlarge. Earlier this year, scientists conducted a test using wireless technology, and the crack did not appear to change.
""The bell is fragile because of the way it was [made],"" said one historian. The bell was built mostly of copper.
In 1752, the bell was brought to Philadelphia from England. The bell was rung to mark special events. It became a symbol of freedom in the United States. It was rung to call people to the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence on July 8, 1776. That document was signed on July 4, 1776.
This is not the first time the Liberty Bell has moved. From 1885 to 1915, the Liberty Bell traveled across the country, taking part in several World's Fair exhibits. During those years, it visited more than 400 cities and towns, including New Orleans, St. Louis, and San Francisco.
The last time the Liberty Bell changed location was in 1976.
At that time, it was taken from Independence Hall to its current nearby home. Many people consider Independence Hall the birthplace of the United States. Both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were signed there.
The Liberty Bell cracked the first time it was rung in 1752. However, the bell was rebuilt twice in its early years. The Liberty Bell cracked again sometime between 1817 and 1846. How it cracked remains a mystery. According to one report, its famous split occurred in February 1846 while it was ringing to celebrate George Washington's birthday.

Al Gore was born in Washington, D.C. on March 31, 1948. As a child, he spent part of his time in Washington, where his father was a U.S. senator.
During summer vacations, Al often had to live with family friends in Tennessee while his parents were in Washington. At those times, the house he stayed in didn't have indoor plumbing, he said.
When Al was in Tennessee, he worked hard on his family's farm. He baled hay, worked with farm animals, and cleared farmland of trees and rocks.
Gore said that he liked to work hard and help out even when he was supposed to be having fun. When he was 9 years old, Al went to a 4-H camp. At camp, he volunteered to work in the kitchen and do the work that was usually given to older boys. ""He was the only camper I ever had volunteer for K-P, or kitchen duty,"" said Jerry Cole, a local 4-H representative.
Although he worked hard, Al also knew how to have a good time. When his parents weren't looking, he recalled, he would sometimes move all the furniture in the living room to make a fort.
Because Al's father was a senator, he got to meet some important people. When Al was 5 years old, he met then Vice President Richard Nixon. ""He put me on his knee and was very nice to me,"" Gore remembered.
Today, as vice president, Gore is still working hard. And now his goal is to become president of the United States.

Born on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut, George moved to Texas with his family about two years later. As a child, George dreamed of becoming a baseball player.
""All George ever wanted to be was a major-league baseball player,"" said classmate Terry Throckmorton. ""That's all he ever talked about.""
He also collected baseball cards. When George was 10 years old, he began mailing baseball cards to the players pictured on them. He asked the players to sign the cards and return them to him. Many of the best players of the time autographed his cards.
George's teachers remember that he was a good student. ""He was a good, well-rounded young man, and he did his work,"" said George's third-grade teacher, Austine Crosby.
In addition to learning the usual subjects in school, Bush told
that he learned a very important lesson: ""I learned never to pretend that I know more than I know.""
When George was in seventh grade, his classmates remember that he ran against Jack Hanks for class president. Today, his classmates claim that George won the election. ""I voted for George because he was cuter,"" remembered classmate Peggy Porter Weiss.
Bush went on to run in other elections. The people of Texas twice elected him their governor. He is now running for president of the United States.

The scientists went to Sicily to learn from the 3,000-year old volcano. One of the things they wanted to learn is how to predict when a volcano will erupt.
Dozens of vulcanologists bravely climbed Mount Etna each day. They hoped that the mountain of fire would be a good teacher. ""We will probably learn more about this volcano during this eruption than had been learned in 3,000 years"", said Borris Behnke, a German scientist.
Climbing Mount Etna is more dangerous than climbing some other volcanoes. The scientists risked being burned by the rivers of lava flowing down the volcano. Hot lava flowed from both the top of the volcano and from many
, or holes, along the volcano's sides.
Etna was also hurling huge rocks into the air. ""Some of them are bigger than cars and some might be as big as trucks,"" said Behnke.
Some of the scientists didn't need to climb Mount Etna. Over the past few years, scientists had placed hundreds of sensors on the volcano. The sensors gather data about the lava flow and send the data by radio to scientists located a safe distance from the volcano.
The sensors also record earthquakes. Earthquakes in a volcanic area can mean that the volcano is about to erupt. In the days before Mount Etna erupted, the sensors had picked up more than 2,600 small earthquakes.
Behnke says that lava may erupt from Mount Etna for at least six more months. During that time, he plans to climb the volcano many times, risking his life to learn firsthand what is happening.

In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads.
Scientists say Venice is sinking about 1 1/2 inches each year. To save the city, scientists want to pump water into the ground through pipes. The team expects the water to expand the sand under Venice and raise the city.
Scientists behind the plan say the pipes will work. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnt done carefully.
Everyone, however, agrees that saving the city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose a tremendous part of [history],"" says Melissa Conn of Save Venice, a group that is working to save the city.

It is not uncommon for a large pod, or group, of pilot whales to get stranded. They are highly social animals that stay close together. ""The value of sticking close together at times brings the risk of beaching. When one whale beaches, the other whales may follow,"" said scientist Michael Moore.
Sadly, 120 whales died on the beach. But volunteers were able to rescue 39 of the whales. The rescuers poured cool water on the whales to protect them from the heat. They helped push the huge mammals back into the water. Then small boats led the pilot whales back to sea.

Some people have built their own kites for the festival. ""I chose to build a Japanese fighter kite,"" said Mike Van Meers. ""In 17th-century Japan, the kites were built with bamboo and paper. I'm building one with modern materials.""
Experts think kites were first made in China more than 2,000 years ago. Legend has it that a Chinese farmer invented the kite. On a very windy day, he tied a string to his hat. He held the string to keep his hat from blowing away.
Traders from China spread kite flying to other parts of the world. ""Kites come in all different shapes and sizes,"" said Van Meers. ""Every culture is unique, and every culture has a different style.""
The kite gets its name from a bird of the same name. Kites are graceful, soaring birds with long, narrow wings. These birds were once common in England. In the 1600s, kids in England made toys that sailed through the sky when pulled with a string. When the toys moved, they looked like the gliding birds.

The Great Pyramid is made of more than 2 million blocks of stone. Each stone weighs an average of nearly 3 tons. Some experts say it took 100,000 people 20 years to build the Great Pyramid.
Many pharaohs were buried with treasures. To keep thieves out, builders designed the pyramids with hidden rooms. No one knows what happened to Khufu's body or if he was buried with treasures. Perhaps the answer is behind a mysterious door inside the Great Pyramid.
The passage that leads to the door is too small for a person to fit through. On September 16, scientists sent a small robot into the narrow passage. From inside the pyramid, scientists controlled the robot's movements.
The robot drilled a hole through the thick stone door. The robot's camera showed a room on the other side of the door. The room looked empty, except for another door.

Scientists hope the missions will answer questions about Mars. The spacecraft will take pictures of the planet. Some spacecraft will even collect samples of the soil on Mars to study. NASA first sent spacecraft to Mars in the 1960s. Since then, several spacecraft have landed on Mars. One of the most exciting landings happened in 1997, when

Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is often called the Red Planet because it looks red from Earth. Mars looks red because its surface has lots of iron. The iron has rusted and turned a reddish-brown color. Sometimes, winds on Mars whip the reddish dust into the sky, turning the sky pink.
A dust storm whips across the Martian surface. Dust storms often form in the Martian spring. A dust storm forms when high winds pick up sand and blow it across the surface. Large dust storms can last for months and blanket the entire planet with the red dust.
Two dry riverbeds cut across the surface of Mars. Each riverbed is more than a half-mile deep. Scientists say the riverbeds formed when water suddenly gushed to the surface from inside Mars. The riverbeds might have formed billions of years ago, scientists say. Hundreds of dry riverbeds crisscross the Red Planet.

A celebration is under way for Ben Franklin's 300th birthday. Way is he considered one of the greatest Americans of all time?
Put on your party hat! January 17 is the 300th anniversary of Ben Franklins birth. People across the United States will celebrate the ways this great American helped our country. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, events are taking place all year.
The main event is an exhibit called
Benjamin Franklin: In Search of a Better World.
It began in Philadelphia and will travel to four other states during the yearMissouri,Texas, Colorado, and Georgia.
""In his 300th year, we want people to understand why Ben Franklin is still so important,"" spokesperson Nicola Twilley told
""We want to bring him and his
to life."" A legacy is something passed on to future generations.
Why is Philadelphia making such a big fuss about Franklins birthday? In 1723,when he was 17 years old, Franklin made his home there. He worked to make life in that city better. In Philadelphia, he helped set up the countrys first hospital, public library, and volunteer fire department.
During the 1700s, Philadelphia was the center of American government. When Franklin was young, America was made up of 13 colonies ruled by England. Franklin helped America gain independence. He also helped write the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.
""Hes very inspirational,"" says Twilley. ""He came from a poor background. He had only two years of school. He made himself into one of the greatest Americans of all time.""
If you could interview Ben Franklin, what would you ask him? Why?
Ben Franklin only attended school from the ages of 8 to 10. But his love of learning lasted a lifetime.
Even at a young age, Franklin was a scientist and an inventor. At the age of 10, Franklin invented wooden swim fins to help him swim faster.
When he was 12 years old, Franklin worked in his brothers printing shop. Later, he opened his own shop.

Michael was taking part in the Young Eagles program, which began in 1992. Pilots for the program have a goal of giving a million kids free rides in private airplanes by December 17, 2003. That date is special! It is the 100th anniversary of the first powered flight, made by the Wright brothers.
>From the time they were kids in Ohio, Wilbur and Orville Wright dreamed of flying. The brothers built their first powered airplane, the Flyer, in 1903. They tested it on December 14 at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. However, the airplane never made it off the ground.
Three days later, though, the brothers succeeded! That day, they made their mark on history. ""The airplane changed people's lives,"" Steve Buss, the director of the Young Eagles program, told
In honor of the Wright brothers, the one millionth Young Eagles flight is scheduled for December 17. It will take place at a celebration at Kitty Hawk.
""The first 100 years [of flight] were exciting-from the Wright Flyer to landing on the moon,"" said Buss. ""Hopefully, through the Young Eagle's program, the kids of today will make the next 100 years even more exciting.""
How has the invention of the airplane changed people's lives?

You don't have to travel to Asia to see sloth bears slurp up insects. You can see the shaggy-coated creatures at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The zoo opened a new exhibit, called the Asia Trail, in October.
Sloth bears and six other species, or types, of animals from Asia have new homes at the National Zoo. Those animals face several threats in the wild.
Before the Asia Trail opened, the animals lived in tight spaces. Now they have twice the room. The changes are part of a 10-year plan to update the zoo.
""This is a giant leap forward for the National Zoo,"" says its director, John Berry. ""Our goal is to be the world's finest zoo by 2016.""
Giant panda cub Tai Shan (tie-SHAHN) and his parents are the stars of the show. They help draw huge crowds to the zoo. Three million people are expected to visit this year.
The giant pandas' new home includes more trees for climbing. Pandas like water, so their area has a waterfall and pools. Fog machines help make the exhibit more like their habitat, or natural home, in China.
Visitors now have closer views of the giant pandas and other animals. ""You can see, hear, touch, and even smell the zoo's science,"" says Susan Ades, head of the new design.
The National Zoo is home to 2,000 animals. Along with fishing cats, clouded leopards, sloth bears, and Japanese giant salamanders, the creatures here live on the Asia Trail.

Thousands of years ago, enemy armies and natural disasters destroyed the cities of Zeugma and Herakleion (ee-RAH-klee-on). This summer, however, scientists known as archaeologists (ahr-kee-OL-uh-jists) discovered the lost cities. They found Zeugma in Turkey, a country in Asia. Other scientists found Herakleion underwater off the coast of Egypt, a country in Africa.
About 2,000 years ago, Zeugma was an important meeting place for traders and soldiers. The ruins show that some of the homes had water pipes and mosaics.
Zeugma is located near a dam on the Euphrates (yoo-FRAY-teez) River. The dam is needed to make electricity for people who live nearby. But the dam will cause the river to rise. Soon the river's water will cover part of Zeugma's ruins.
Off the coast of Egypt, divers are finding the remains of Herakleion. Herakleion was built to honor Hercules, an ancient hero.
Experts say Herakleion is at least 2,500 years old. They say an earthquake probably caused the city to sink into the Mediterranean Sea. Archaeologists have found the remains of houses, roads, temples, statues, and coins under 30 feet of water. ""It was really a lost world,"" said Franck Goddio, an archaeologist working on the site.

King was a leader who dreamed of a better world.
Martin Luther King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia. Each January, Americans honor him with a holiday. This year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is January 19.
King gives his I Have a Dream speech to a large crowd in Washington, D.C.
When King was growing up, the laws in some places were unfair. Those laws treated African American people differently from white people. African Americans were not allowed to go to the same schools as white students. Many were also forced to sit in the back of buses.
House: James Randklev/Corbis; Young Martin Luther King: Martin Luther King Family
Kings birth home is in Atlanta, Georgia. Here he is at age 6.
In the 1950s and 1960s, King worked to change unfair laws. He led peaceful marches and gave many speeches. In 1963, King gave his famous I Have a Dream speech. He said, I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
As a result of Kings hard work, equal rights laws were passed. Those laws make sure that all Americans are treated fairly and equally.

Many kids will spend hours playing outside in the summer sun. Be careful, though. The suns harmful rays can cause damage to your skin and eyes.
If you are out in the sun, be sure to wear sunscreen. It should have a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher, say experts. Make sure you rub it in everywhere your skin is showing.
You should also wear a hat and sunglasses that protect against the suns harmful rays. Better yet, play in the shade!
You can beat the heat by splashing in a pool. Just make sure you follow water-safety rules. Always swim with a grown-up watching you. You should also swim with a buddy. If you dont know how to swim, you can take lessons.
Biking and in-line skating are good ways to exercise. To stay wheel safe, always wear a helmet. It protects your head and brain if you fall. If you are in-line skating, also wear wrist guards, elbow pads, and kneepads.

Playing outside gives you a chance to breathe fresh air, but it also exposes you to harmful sun rays. Harmful sun rays can cause sunburns. You can get a sunburn even if you are outside for a short amount of time. So when you are in the sun, always wear sunscreen. Use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher, and be sure to rub it evenly into your skin. You should also wear a hat and try to play in the shade.
Whether you ride a bike, ride a scooter, or use in-line skates, be wheel safe. The most serious way kids get hurt while on wheels is by hitting their heads. So always wear a helmet when you are playing on wheels. When you ride scooters and use in-line skates, always wear wrist guards, kneepads, and elbow pads.
What's the Right Way to Wear a Helmet?
A helmet should be straight on the head, just above the eyebrows.
The chin strap should be snug but not too tight.
The rear straps go behind the ears; the front straps should run up and down.
One way to beat the summer heat is by swimming in a cool pool. To stay safe when you swim, you need to follow water-safety rules. Be water safe by swimming only when a grown-up is nearby. You should always swim with a buddy.

Kids in some countries must deal with problems like those. But a special worldwide organization is trying to help them.
UNICEF helps children around the world. One way it helps is by providing schools and supplies. Three of the countries where UNICEF helps with education are Colombia, in South America, Rwanda (ruh-WAHN-duh), in Africa, and Thailand (TIGH-land), in Southeast Asia.
Those countries are probably far from where you live. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to go to school in another country?
In Colombia, the government requires kids to go to school for at least five years. Some people are poor and must work hard to survive. Some children must quit school to help their parents earn money.
With UNICEF's help, Colombia's government is creating a special school for those children. The students learn at their own pace and attend when they can. They have a small library and a garden where they grow vegetables.
One or two teachers must teach all the students, from grades 1 through 5. Students of the same age work together in small groups, helping one another learn.
Children in Rwanda must go to school from ages 7 to 15. But there is not enough space in some schools in Rwanda to fit all the students. Some students cannot afford to buy the uniforms and notebooks they must have to go to school.
To help solve those problems, UNICEF has created a special program called Schools-in-a-Box. Each box contains school supplies, workbooks, and learning games. When teachers use the Schools-in-a-Box, kids can be taught wherever they are.
Children in Thailand must go to school for six years. Though school is free, some families cannot afford to buy the uniforms children must wear to school.
Some classrooms in Thailand have as many as 50 kids and only one teacher! Often, children of all ages are in the same grade. The children must share the few books and school supplies that are in the school.
But UNICEF is working to help these people. The organization has built Village Education Centers in parts of Thailand. At night, adults gather there and take classes. During the day, the buildings are schools for children.
UNICEF is an organization that works to help children all over the world. UNICEF tries to provide health care, nutritious food, clean water, and an education for all children. The organization raises money and talks to world governments about helping children.
