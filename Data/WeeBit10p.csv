In Chapter 10, Jekyll writes clearly about the dual nature of human beings. He says that, as a young, educated man from a respectable family, he maintained an appearance of good behaviour at all times. But he says this was a fraud - no one suspected his true nature, which was at times extremely immoral.
Jekyll's experiments began in an attempt to separate the two sides of human nature and destroy the evil one. He discovered that the evil part of his nature was, indeed, part of himself, and therefore, in some sense, natural and part of the whole.
Jekyll and Lanyon are both scientists. Science traditionally explains the real world by means of experiment and observation. Scientists are usually dismissive of the
Something that cannot be explained by the laws of nature; for example, gods and ghosts.
, and Lanyon has avoided Jekyll for ten years because of his 'fanciful' and 'wrong minded' ideas and investigations.
By contrast, in his final 'confession', Jekyll says his investigations ""led wholly towards the mystic and the
Relating to forces or beings that exist outside the natural world.
"". He is fascinated by the mystery of human nature - and such investigations could be seen as closer to religion and psychology than traditional 19th-century science.
There is a 'war of attitudes' between Jekyll and Lanyon, and both men are destroyed by their beliefs. Lanyon by his inability to imagine or accept a world beyond the rational and scientific; Jekyll by accepting and unleashing the dark powers that lie beyond.
Stevenson asks the reader to examine for themselves which man comes closer to the truth.
Utterson represents the standards of conventional society and the law. Like Lanyon, he does not have the imagination to understand what Jekyll is doing.
That is why Jekyll cannot confide in him about what is happening, even though they are old friends. It is also why, throughout the novel, Stevenson makes Utterson come to all the wrong conclusions. The law blinds him to the truth. It is because Utterson is a lawyer that he constantly suspects Hyde is blackmailing Jekyll or has some other criminal purpose.
The ultimate failure of Utterson (and therefore the law) is built into the

Their silence is like the death of Lanyon; they have no power to deal with the unexplained that Jekyll has unleashed.

of Jekyll's name (Je and kyll) perhaps mean 'I kill' (
). In the last chapter, Jekyll describes how he tried to get rid of (kill) the Hyde in him.
Hyde spelled as 'hide' suggests something hidden from view, or the rough skin of an animal. Jekyll is in some way trying to kill the hidden Hyde and his animal nature.
The size and age of Jekyll and Hyde
Jekyll is much bigger than Hyde. This is seen particularly when Hyde's small body is found in the much larger clothes of Dr Jekyll. The author is perhaps suggesting Hyde is a smaller part of Jekyll, but that if people repress the bad in them it will take over and destroy them.
Hyde is younger and more energetic than Jekyll. This suggests evil is something that develops later in life, after a period of childhood innocence. It also suggests Stevenson felt there is something primitively energetic and exciting about mankind's baser nature; that the 'higher', respectable nature of social humans is

Development indices can be misleading and need to be used with care. For example:
Many indices are averages for the whole population of a country. This means that indices do not always reveal substantial inequalities between different segments of society. For example, a portion of the population of a highly developed country could be living below the poverty line.
In some countries, the data used in indices could be out of date or hard to collect. Some countries do not wish to have certain index data collected - for example, many countries do not publish statistics rabout the number of immigrants and migrants.

I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another.
You shall love your neighbour as yourself.
There are also two important teachings in the writings of Paul about this:
From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live.
There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
No one can follow these teachings perfectly, and there will be occasions when Christians, like those of other faiths, are guilty of prejudice and discrimination.
But there are many examples too of Christians challenging injustice when they see the laws of God being broken.

The microorganisms are spread through the air in tiny droplets when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Most people who are infected do not show any symptoms. About 10 per cent of people who are infected will go on to suffer symptoms, which include:
death (in about 50 per cent of cases)
Only infected people who show symptoms of TB can spread the microorganisms to other people.

Antiobiotics are drugs that kill bacteria or prevent them from reproducing. Infected people who do not show any symptoms of TB are usually given a course of one antibiotic, but infected people who are showing symptoms of TB need a course of several antibiotics at once. This is to reduce the chance that strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria will emerge.

I am following the movement of your winds,

Come to break the frozen lake in me,
Shaking the foundations of the very trees within me,
That the earth is the earth is the earth.
A woman, living in England, is woken by a hurricane.
Addressing the wind as a god, she asks what it is doing creating such havoc in this part of the world (stanzas 2-5).
She then speaks of the effect the storm has on her personally. She feels somehow unchained, and at one with the world.
She feels that the hurricane has come with a message to her, perhaps to tell her that the same forces are at work in England as in the Caribbean.
The Carib Indian God of the winds. The Carib Indians were the original inhabitants of the Caribbean Islands, until they were wiped out by European settlers.
Oya and Shango are both storm gods - one female, one male - belonging originally to the Yoruba people of West Africa. When, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the people of Africa were transported to the Caribbean to be sold as slaves, they carried their religion with them. At first, the gods were worshipped secretly, but in the 20th century they emerged as symbols of the African side of Caribbean identity. 'Ogun', in Edward Kamau Brathwaite's poem, is also a Yoruban god.
Hurricanes are given names, by meteorologists, in alphabetical order. Until quite recently, these names were always female. Hurricane Hattie is one Grace Nichols remembers from her childhood.

Vaccination involves putting a small amount of an inactive form of a pathogen, or dead pathogen, into the body. Vaccines can contain:
live pathogens treated to make them harmless
a type of natural poison produced by an organism, often as a form of protection
These all act as antigens. When injected into the body, they stimulate white blood cells to produce antibodies against the pathogen.
Because the vaccine contains only a weakened or harmless version of a pathogen, the vaccinated person is not in danger of developing disease - although some people may suffer a mild reaction. If the person does get infected by the pathogen later, the required lymphocytes are able to reproduce rapidly and destroy it.

In this set of data, each measurement is only slightly different from the other. The results are repeatable, meaning that each time a measurement is taken it has approximately the same value. We can say that this set of data is reliable.

Teacher's notes: This question is worth 6 marks in the exam. Give yourself 7 - 8 minutes to answer it.
Mark Scheme: In History you are marked by levels. The higher the level the more marks you get and so the higher grade you will achieve.
The answer will be general providing some information related to the question but it will not adequately explain reaction to the Agreement.
The answer will discuss how the Agreement was viewed but will concentrate on either the unionist reaction or the nationalist reaction but not both.
The answer will reflect fully on the varied reactions of both nationalists and unionists to the Anglo Irish Agreement.
In November 1985 an agreement was signed by Margaret Thatcher the British Prime Minister and the Irish Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald which has become known as the Anglo-Irish Agreement. It was officially lodged with the United Nations and it recognised the right of the Irish Republic to have a say in the affairs of N. Ireland. Unionists were very opposed to the Agreement and nationalists supported it.
John would get a level 1 for this answer. Much of his answer is mere description. There is no need to include narrative. The candidate needs to get straight to the point of the question - how did nationalists and unionists view the Agreement and how did they react to it. The candidate merely refers to these points in his concluding sentence.
The Anglo Irish Agreement signed in November 1985 was heavily criticized by many unionists. They felt the British government had betrayed them by allowing the government of the Irish Republic to have a say in N. Ireland affairs. Unionists were not reassured by promises that N. Ireland would remain part of the United Kingdom as long as the majority of the population desired it. They believed that Mrs Thatcher had given in to Provisional IRA violence and they felt that a United Ireland would soon be established. As a result they organised a number of demonstrations to protest against the Agreement.
Mary would get a level 2 for this answer. The candidate has produced a reasonable answer. All of her answer is relevant to the question but it lacks balance. She comments well on unionist reaction to the Agreement but ignores completely the nationalist response.
Unionists and nationalists reacted very differently to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Unionists had not been informed in advance of the Agreement and were surprised and greatly angered by it. They strongly objected to giving the Republic of Ireland any say in the affairs of N. Ireland and believed that by doing so Margaret Thatcher was making concessions to Provisional IRA violence. Unionists organised an ""Ulster Says No"" campaign which involved numerous street demonstrations. All 15 unionist MPs at Westminster resigned their seats in protest. The Alliance Party was the only pro-union party to give its support to the Agreement
The Nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party welcomed the Agreement. They argued that the interests of nationalists in the north of Ireland would now be protected. The Workers' Party also expressed some support but Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA were very hostile to an Agreement which they believed guaranteed partition, for the Republic's government had officially recognised for the first time the state of Northern Ireland. Attitudes to the Agreement were divided in the South of Ireland. The Agreement was approved by the Dail by 88 votes to 75 but it was opposed by the Fianna Fail party and by leading political figures such as Mary Robinson, later president of Ireland.
William would get a level 3 for this answer. The candidate has produced a high quality answer. He is aware of how controversial the Agreement was and deals fully with the varied responses of nationalists and unionists.

If the decimal repeats with two digits, the denominator will be 99:
If the decimal does not repeat at all it is known as an irrational number, and you cannot write it as a fraction.
How do we know whether a fraction will give a terminating decimal? The rule is to find the prime factors of the denominator.
If the prime factors are only 2 and/or 5 the decimal will terminate.
28 = 2 x 2 x 7
so the decimal will not terminate. It will be a recurring decimal.
40 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 5
The prime factors of 40 consist of 2s and 5s, so the decimal will terminate.
125 = 5 x 5 x 5
120 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 5
There is a 3 in there, so the decimal will recur.
To change a fraction to a percentage multiply it by 100.
Remember: you might find it easier to convert the fraction to a decimal before you multiply by 100.
To change a percentage to a fraction divide by 100.
To change a decimal to a percentage multiply it by 100.
0.4 becomes 0.4 x 100 = 40%.
2.01 becomes 2.01 x 100 = 201%.
To change a percentage to a decimal divide by 100.

Vaccination involves putting a small amount of an inactive form of a pathogen into the body. Vaccines can contain:
live pathogens treated to make them harmless
a type of natural poison produced by an organism, often as a form of protection
Foreign organisms that get into the body, and trigger an immune response.
. When injected into the body, they stimulate white blood cells to produce antibodies to fight the pathogen.
The vaccine contains only a weakened or harmless version of a pathogen, which means that the vaccinated person is in no danger of developing the disease. Some people, however, may suffer a mild reaction. If the person later becomes infected with the pathogen, the required
white blood cells which attack pathogens by producing antibodies

Vaccinations in early childhood can offer protection against many serious diseases. Sometimes more than one vaccine is given at a time, like the MMR triple vaccine against mumps, measles and rubella.
Sometimes vaccine boosters are required because the immune response memory weakens over time. Anti-tetanus injections may need to be repeated every ten years, for example.
There is often a conflict between a persons right to decide what is best for themselves and their family, and what is best for society as a whole. For example, some people used to think the MMR vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella could cause autism in children. They decided not to risk letting their child have the vaccine and just hope they would not catch measles, mumps or rubella. But this meant that, as less and less children were vaccinated, the three diseases began to spread more easily and the number of cases began to increase. Therefore, a decision originally taken by a single individual had big implications for society as a whole.
Vaccinations can never be completely safe because side-effect levels vary. So, when making a decision, these are some of the factors that should be considered:
When fewer people are vaccinated, the number of cases of the disease increases.
The chance of falling seriously ill or dying from the disease may be far greater than the chance of experiencing a serious side-effect.
Using a vaccine may be much cheaper than treating a very ill person.

He is obviously regretting the call he made to the Immigration Bureau, but it is too late - two officers arrive. It is clear that Beatrice and Catherine immediately suspect that Eddie was the informer. As the officers lead Marco, Rodolpho and the two other immigrants away, Catherine pleads with the men to spare Rodolpho and Marco spits in Eddie's face. Eddie shouts out that he'll kill Marco; Marco retorts that Eddie has stolen food from his children. Eddie protests that he is innocent, but all the neighbours turn away from him. The honour of both Eddie and Marco is now at stake. We next see Marco and Rodolpho and Catherine with Alfieri's in the reception room of the prison: Alfieri needs a promise from Marco that he will not kill Eddie as a condition of bail.

show population change over time - and also show marked differences between LEDCs and MEDCs.
At present the world's population is growing quickly, though this has not always been the case.
Until the 1800s the world's population grew slowly for thousands of years.
In 1820 the world's population reached one billion.
In the early 1970s, the world's population reached three billion.
In 1999, less than 30 years later, the population doubled to six billion.
The global rate of population growth is now one billion every 15 years.
The graph shows this pattern of accelerating growth:
The three main causes of population change are:
- usually measured using the birth rate (number of live births per 1000 of the population).
- usually measured using the death rate (number of deaths per 1000 of the population) .
- the movement of people in and out of an area.
of population change. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate of a country or place is called the
. The natural increase is calculated by subtracting the death rate from the birth rate.
natural increase = birth rate - death rate
The rate of natural increase is given as a percentage, calculated by dividing the natural increase by 10.
For example if the birth rate is 14 per 1000 population, and the death rate is 8 per 1000 population, then the growth rate = 14 - 8 = 6
Rates of population growth vary across the world. Although the world's total population is rising rapidly, not all countries are experiencing this growth. In the UK, for example, population growth is slowing, while in Germany the population has started to decline.
A More Economically Developed Country [MEDC] has high levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the northern hemisphere are MEDCs, eg UK, USA, Canada, Europe. More of the countries in the southern hemisphere are Less Economically Developed Countries [LEDCs].

In stage two, the total population starts to rise as death rates start to fall, but birth rates remain quite high. In stage three, the population is still growing, but the gap between the birth rate and death rate narrows.

Natural increase is the natural growth of a population due to the number of births exceeding deaths. The rate of this increase can be calculated by subtracting the birth rate from the death rate.
Total population is high, but it is balanced by a low birth rate and a low death rate. Birth control is widely available and there is a desire for smaller families.
Total population is high but going into decline due to an ageing population. There is a continued desire for smaller families, with people opting to have children later in life.

The following graphs show the population pyramids of an MEDC (the UK) and an LEDC (Mozambique), for 2000 and in 2025 using projected figures. The left side of each pyramid shows the number of men in each age group, the right side shows the number of women in each age group.
Notice how in the UK 2000 pyramid there is a bulge in the area of the 30-34 and 35-39 age groups, with the numbers thereafter reducing fairly steadily as the ages increase. This matches stage 4 of the demographic transition model.
Projected population pyramid for the UK 2025
Compare this to the 2025 pyramid, which would be stage 5 in the model. Here the bulge extends much further, covering the age groups 30-64, with the numbers beginning to reduce significantly only after 64.
Now compare the UK population pyramids with those for
In this graph, notice that in 2000 the 0-4 age group contained the largest number of people, with the numbers thereafter declining steadily as the ages increase. The graph matches stage 1 in the model.

Over time, as a country develops, the shape changes from triangular to barrel-like.

Global warming refers to the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's surface. In the last 100 years it is believed to have risen by 0.6 degrees C. There are estimates that in the next 100 years, the global temperatures could rise by as much as 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.
One way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air is to burn
fossil fuels. Unfortunately, we depend on the burning of fossil fuels for heating, electricity generation and transport. If we are to burn less fossil fuels, we will need alternatives for these essential activities.
Clouds of smoke and other combustion products are emitted from chimneys
Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.

Acid rain is rain that contains a high level of acids. These acids can contaminate drinking water, damage plants and water creatures and buildings. It is believed to be caused by pollution and, maybe, natural activity such as volcanic eruptions.

removing sulfur from natural gas and fuel oil
removing sulfur dioxide from the flue gases emitted by coal-burning power stations
Coal-powered stations give off solid particulates. These can also be removed from the flue gases.
Atmospheric pollution caused by the exhaust gases given out by motor vehicles can be reduced by:

There be some sports are painful, and their labour
Delight in them sets off. Some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone, and most poor matters
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead,
And makes my labours pleasures. O, she is
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed 
And he's composed of harshness! I must remove
Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up,
Upon a sore injunction. My sweet mistress
Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness
Had never like executor. I forget 
 But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
, who watches from a distance, unseen.
Work not so hard! I would the lightning had
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile!
Pray, set it down, and rest you. When this burns,

If we put a capital letter at the beginning of the clause we've used, and a full stop at the end, we have a sentence.
. A simple sentence consists of one clause that has a subject and a verb. A simple sentence puts across one simple idea.
A complex sentence is used to put across more
ideas. A complex sentence contains one main clause that can make sense on its own, and one or more minor clauses that are linked to it.
The main clause is the 'big dog barked' because it has a subject and a verb and makes sense by itself.
The minor clause is 'When I arrived'. Although it is a clause with a subject and a verb, it doesn't make sense on its own, it needs a main clause.
We can add more minor clauses to make a more complex sentence.
We can even split the main clause with a minor clause and still have a complex sentence.

Dave and Lisa win 500 between them. They agree to divide the money in the ratio 2:3.
The ratio 2:3 tells us that for every 2 parts Dave receives, Lisa will receive 3 parts. There are 5 parts in total.
500 represents 5 parts. Therefore, 100 represents 1 part.

A salt is always made when an acid is neutralised by a base. But the exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used.

the first part comes from the metal in the base used
the second part comes from the acid that was used
Where does the name potassium nitrate come from?
These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt:
How can we make copper sulfate? The first part of the name is 'copper', so we need a base containing copper. We could use copper oxide or copper carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'sulfate', so we need to use sulfuric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
copper sulfate + water + carbon dioixde
How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid.

It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced.

If you ride your bike over a bump in the road, you will be pleased that gases exert

The particles in a gas move quickly in all directions, but they don't get far before they bump into each other or the walls of their container. When gas particles hit the walls of their container they cause pressure. The more particles that hit the walls, the higher the pressure.
This is why the pressure in a tyre or balloon goes up when more air is pumped in.
Gas particles hit the walls of their container and cause pressure
. They hit the walls of their container harder and more often. This increases the pressure. Sometimes the pressure gets so great that the container bursts.

Formal and informal writing - Informal writing
Writing is informal when it reads as though someone is chatting to the reader. In the right situation, it makes your writing seem more friendly and natural.
Which of the following would you NOT write using informal language?
b) An essay about a Shakespeare play
c) A talk aimed at students your own age or younger
e) A story written from the point of view of a character (in the first person)
b) An essay should always be written using formal language. All of the other situations would suit a more informal style.
Tips to make your informal writing more effective
""Dear reader, I'm really glad you've found the time to open this letter.""
2. It's okay sometimes to use the kind of words that are more usual in speech than writing:
""You don't have to put up with bullying. We'll stick together and make it stop.""
3. Contractions sound more natural in certain types of writing eg a talk to fellow students:
""It's good to know that we're all going to work together on this.""
Don't baffle your reader with too much slang.
Think carefully about structure - informal writing is different to speech and needs carefully planned paragraphs to keep it clear and easy to read.
Sometimes there is opportunity to break the rules of Standard English and use English in unexpected ways. Two good examples of writers who achieve this are poet Benjamin Zephaniah and writer Andrea Levy in her book Small Island.
If you're asked to write a story, it would be a mistake for you as the author to use incorrect grammar and slang - but inside speech marks, your characters can!

There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.

It's important that you check the accuracy of your spelling in your written work. Here are some common errors to watch out for:
Not dropping the final ""e"" before adding ""-ing"".
Errors in forming plurals in words that end in ""-y"".
Homophones (words that sound the same but are spelt differently and have different meanings), like ""to"", ""two"" and ""too"".
Problems with two vowels in the middle of words, such as ea, ou and ie
Problems with words that we sometimes shorten when we say them, like ""probly"" for ""probably"".
Certain words could also cause trouble, so look for any ways of remembering them. Sometimes the oddest ideas are the easiest to remember, like Big Elephants Can Always Understand Small Elephants, which gives us 'because'. Here are a few more to help you:

Solids cannot flow because their particles are only able to vibrate and cannot move from place to place.
Liquids can flow because their particles can move over each other. When water is poured into a glass, the particles of water move over each other and into the corners of the glass. The particles keep on moving over each other as the water takes the shape of the glass. The animation shows how this works.

Gases can flow because their particles can move in all directions. When a Bunsen burner is connected to a gas tap and turned on, natural gas flows through the rubber tubing.

Rubbish does not vanish when it is thrown away. A lot of it is buried in

rubbish is important because fewer landfill sites are needed, and the materials in the rubbish are re-used.
Fertilisers are chemicals used by farmers to help their crops grow well. Rain can wash fertilizers off the fields and into rivers. This causes water plants to overgrow and block out the light. Other plants die as a result. They use up oxygen as they rot away, and fish and other animals suffocate. This process is called eutrophication.

The Tempest first key extract - Performance
When you talk about the performance of a play, you should think about how people in the audience feel as they watch it. For instance, the beginning of the first extract is magical and romantic. The tone changes in the middle to one of conflict.
Prospero has lots of asides (thoughts spoken aloud) in the first extract. His role in this scene is made more complex because his character is pretending to be something he is not. The director has to decide whether he wants us to see Prospero as a good father who wants the best for his daughter or a manipulative control freak.
Prospero also speaks to Ariel who is invisible to the other characters on the stage.
When Ariel appears, the director must decide how to present the 'illusion'. Ariel is invisible to the other characters. But it does not necessarily follow that he must be invisible to the audience, too. Try to imagine as many interesting and unusual ways to present Ariel - the 'invisible' sprite - as you can.
When you write about performance, you need to mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:
The characters and how you respond to them
The language used - the detail about freedom and slavery, for example

Fifty years ago, one brave woman's refusal to give up her bus seat changed history.
Honor the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest and the start of the Montgomery bus boycott with our classroom play.
During the 1950s, the law in the South prevented black
people from having the same rights as white people. At that time, the South was
by law. Black people were forced to sit in the back of public buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, drinking fountains, and other public facilities.
Those laws made Rosa Parks angry. She was a well-known leader in the African American community of Montgomery, Alabama. For years, Rosa Parks had stood up to unfair laws against African Americans. She worked courageously with other African American leaders to change them. She also was one of the first women in Montgomery to join the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to fight for
, or equal rights under the law.
Rosa Parks had refused to move from her seat on city buses in the past. Drivers simply forced her off the bus. But 50 years ago, on December 1, 1955, her action changed history. She refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person and was arrested. Her arrest led to the Montgomery
. During the yearlong boycott, African Americans refused to ride public buses. As a result of the boycott and Rosa Parks's courage, the law was changed to provide equal seating on buses. It marked the beginning of the struggle to end segregation.
SCENE 1: Downtown Montgomery, Alabama, December 1, 1955
Rosa Parks, 42, boards a city bus on her way home from work as a seamstress.
At the time, buses are divided into two sections. The section at the front of the bus is for whites only. The section for black people begins five to 10 rows back. Holding her head high, Rosa Parks sits down in the first row of the ""colored"" section.
After the bus grinds to a stop, a few white people get on. They quickly fill the empty seats in the ""whites-only"" section. One white man is left standing. According to a city law, black people are to give up their seats in the colored section if no seats remain in the white section.
There are white people who want to sit down.
You know white people and black people can't sit in the same row. Are you going to stand up?
Then I'm going to have you arrested.
A few minutes later, two police officers board the bus and walk toward Rosa Parks.
Did the driver tell you to stand?
Why do you all push us around?
I don't know, but the law is the law, and you're under arrest.
SCENE 2: Rosa Parks's house, that night
Rosa Parks is released from jail on bail that day. She and other Montgomery civil rights leaders meet at her house to discuss the bus boycott.
For years, civil rights leaders have been planning a bus boycott to fight segregation. They are waiting for the right time and the right leader to spark the boycottand Rosa Parks is that person. They know Rosa Parks has the courage to stand up to segregation. Because most of Montgomery's bus riders are black, the bus companies will lose money if black people refuse to ride the buses.
I know one thing, I will never, ever ride another segregated bus againeven if it means I have to walk to work.
You have to stand up for what you believe in.
Rosa, how would you feel about making your arrest a test case against segregation? We may be able to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.
I don't like being in the spotlight, and I don't want to put my family in danger.
Rosa, this may be our best chance to fight segregation laws.
Good. In the meantime, we're going to boycott the buses.
The next day, community leaders meet to discuss the boycott. At their request, Martin Luther King Jr. agrees to lead it.

The steps of the courthouse are packed with people. Some bystanders threaten Rosa Parks. Others shout their support.

Oh, she's so sweet. They've messed with the wrong one now!
After Rosa Parks and her husband manage to push their way into the courtroom, the trial begins. The bus driver takes the stand.
I politely asked her to move to the back, which is required by city law. She refused to listen.
Rosa Parks is not called to the stand. Instead, her lawyers speak on her behalf.
I find Rosa Parks guilty of violating the city law. She must pay a $10 fine plus $4 in court costs.
The crowd of supporters in the courtroom reacts angrily to the verdict.
You haven't heard the last from us.
Despite the boos from supporters, the guilty verdict was exactly what Rosa Parks and her lawyers wanted. Their case eventually made it to the nation's highest courtthe Supreme Court.
Montgomery's black community continued to boycott the buses. On November 13, 1956, their efforts finally paid off. The Supreme Court ruled that Alabama's segregated buses were against the law. After more than a year, the boycott ended.
At the urging of photographers, Rosa Parks boarded a bus on December 20. This time, she sat in the front seat. (See the cover.)

How would you feel if your favorite book was yanked from library shelves? Beginning September 23, the American Library Association (ALA) observes Banned Books Week. When a book is banned, it is removed from a library or a school. Many people say that banning books goes against the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech. People who challenge books often claim that they want to protect others from dangerous ideas. Weve piled up some well-known titles that have been challenged.

Political polls predict that the 2004 presidential election will be a close race. The candidates know that every vote will count.
""I want to be your president for four more years,"" Bush said in a speech on the campaign trail. ""From creating jobs to improving our schools, from fighting terror to spreading the peace, we made much progress, and there is more to do.""
Those issues are important to Kerry too. ""You meet incredible people, and you want to make their lives better,"" said Kerry.

Winning the presidential election tops the list of George W. Bush and John Kerry these days, but that wasn't always the case. Both candidates dreamed of being sports stars as kids.
President Bush was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on July 6, 1946. His family moved to Texas not long after he was born.
As a child, Bush dreamed of becoming a baseball player. One of his hobbies was collecting baseball cards. When he was 10 years old, Bush used to mail cards to famous baseball players to have them autographed and returned to him.
Before being elected president in 2000, Bush was a part owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He also served as governor of Texas for six years.
Senator Kerry was born in Denver, Colorado, on December 11, 1943. His family moved to Massachusetts a few months after he was born.
As a child, Kerry wanted to become a hockey player and even thought about becoming a football player. His interest in sports continued through the years. He played hockey, soccer, and lacrosse in college.
As he grew up, Kerry began to think about public service. Before serving as a Massachusetts senator for the past 20 years, Kerry was the lieutenant governor of that state for two years.

T. rex roamed the Earth about 85 million to 65 million years ago. Although T. rex is known for its bone-crushing bite, its image as a ferocious killer is up for debate. A new exhibit at a museum in London poses this question: Was T. rex really a killer?

At 40 feet long, this dinosaur was about the size of a truck. In addition, T. rex had tiny arms, which would have made it difficult for this creature to catch a moving target.

Another paleontologist agrees that T. rex was not built for speed. However, she argues that T. rex could have caught slow-moving prey. ""I think it was partly a scavenger and partly a hunter. It could have killed old or weak animals.""
The exhibit leaves it up to visitors to judge for themselves. Recently, a show of hands from a group of kids suggested it was likely a combination of killer and scavenger.

Other humanoid robots created by Japanese companies have been getting plenty of attention even without playing the trumpet.
Japanese scientists introduced ASIMO (ah-SEE-moh), the world's first stair-climbing robot, in 2000. The 4-foot, 115-pound ASIMO's many talents include walking, holding objects, speaking Japanese, and recognizing faces. ASIMO recently finished a world tour.

In March, QRIO conducted Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in Japan. Before the rehearsal in front of a live audience, the robot grumbled, ""I'm feeling nervous.""
Today, robots come in all shapes and sizes. Many robots are used in factories. They help build cars, inspect computer parts, and package food. Robots speed up production on assembly lines and help save companies both time and money.
Robots also perform tasks that are difficult or dangerous for humans. Robots have explored the far reaches of space and traveled into active volcanoes.
that when robots were first introduced in the 1960s, they performed only jobs that were ""dirty, difficult, and dangerous."" That, however, is starting to change. Today's engineers hope that the new breed of humanoid robots will improve people's lives.
Many people are excited that humanoid robots may one day be able to lift people confined to beds or wheelchairs. The robots may also be able to help elderly people with chores such as vacuuming and taking out the garbage. Some people, however, worry that robots may take away jobs that are now performed by humans.
Although the humanoid robots have been busy making public appearances, they aren't for sale yet. If you really want a robot that will clean your room and help out with chores, you still have to wait a bit longer.

Historians believe that colonists from England dug the well nearly 400 years ago. Shortly after the well was completed, it dried up. The colonists then used the well as a dump.
The historians have found a piece of old armor in the well. Studying the armor and other ""garbage"" from the well will help us learn about life in early Jamestown.
The history of Jamestown begins in England. On December 20, 1606, three ships sailed from England. The ships were bound for Virginia. After the colonists on the ships landed in Virginia, they built a fort. The colonists arrived in North America 14 years before the Pilgrims.
Most of the colonists came to Virginia to search for treasure. Most did not know how to grow crops to feed themselves. They became so hungry that they ate dogs, rats, and snakes.
Eventually, more people settled in Jamestown. They turned the fort into a town. The colonists began to grow and sell crops. The small fort became the first permanent English settlement in North America.
The ""garbage"" from the well is helping historians better understand how the colonists lived.

That is exactly the point. ""The museum shows what happens to our trash, how we can reduce our trash, and what we can do instead of throwing our trash away,"" said museum director Sotoria Montanari.
Today, Americans create more garbage than ever before. In the early 1900s, most items were packed in containers that could be used again. Now, most of the food we buy, from cereal to milk, comes in boxes and cartons that can be thrown away.

Today, ancient Assur is in ruins. Desert sand has covered over much of the 3,500-year-old city. Now Assur faces a new threat: water.
Assur is located in what is now Iraq, a country in the Middle East. Many parts of Iraq are covered by desert. Water is hard to find in the desert areas. To increase the amount of water, Iraqi officials are building a dam on the river Tigris.
The dam will trap the river's water. As the water rises, it might flood Assur and many other nearby ancient ruins.
Scientists worry that floodwaters will destroy artifacts hidden beneath the desert sand. Assur has already been the site of some amazing discoveries.
Scientists recently discovered four hidden tombs at Assur. They found ancient coffins, gold, jewelry, and gems. They also dug up the remains of two ancient Assurian queens.
Scientists used modern medical equipment to study the queens' bodies. They learned about some of the medical problems the ancient queens suffered from. The bodies showed evidence of dental cavities, sinus infections, and poor nutrition.
Michael Mller-Karpe, a scientist who studies ancient Assyria, said, ""The Assyrian queens have just begun to speak to us, and we are looking forward to more answers.""
Mller-Karpe and other scientists worry that the new dam may keep them from getting more answers. Even if the new dam doesn't flood Assur, the rising water could damage the ancient city. Moisture could cause the artifacts to crumble.
""You can't save Assur if it's [near] a dam,"" said scientist Peter Miglus. The soil beneath the ancient city would soak up water like a sponge. The water in the soil would destroy what's left of ancient Assur.
For now, scientists are scrambling to uncover the secrets hidden for centuries in Assur and other nearby communities. Meanwhile, some people are looking for ways to save the ancient cities. ""We don't want the slightest damage to Assur,"" one Iraqi official said.

The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center is located in Cincinnati, Ohio.
What would you do if you were in Kaleb's shoes? Using an interactive exhibit, kids who visit the recently opened National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, can help Kaleb make a decision. They can also learn about the consequences of that decision.
""The exhibit gives kids a sense of the risk and losses that were part of trying to gain freedom,"" museum official Stephen DeVillez told
The new museum opened in August 2004 on the northern bank of the Ohio River. That river once marked the line between slavery and freedom. Historians believe that thousands of slaves who escaped through the Underground Railroad from the South, where slavery was allowed, crossed the Ohio River.
The Underground Railroad was not a real railroad. During the late 1700s to mid-1800s, the Underground Railroad was actually a secret system of safe routes that runaway slaves could use as they fled from the South to free Northern states, Canada, and Mexico.
The Underground Railroad covered hundreds of hidden routes. Most slaves escaped through Ohio, Indiana, and western Pennsylvania. Slaves made their way to freedom any way they could. Most hid during the day and traveled at night.
Along the way, a vast network of black people and white people called

""The Underground Railroad wouldn't have existed if it wasn't for brave people who took a risk to stand up for freedom,"" said DeVillez. ""The museum is a learning center that teaches lessons of courage and the fight for freedom that exists even today.""
Some key people fought against slavery during the mid-1800s.
Harriet Tubman was a former slave who became the most famous conductor of the Underground Railroad. From 1850 to 1860, she led about 300 slaves to freedom. Tubman once said, ""On my Underground Railroad, I [never] run my train off [the] track, and I never [lost] a passenger.""
Harriet Beecher Stowe was a teacher and a minister's wife from Ohio who wrote
in 1852. The book was about a cruel slave master who beat a slave named Tom to death. Her book convinced many people that the horrors of slavery needed to end.
Frederick Douglass was born a slave in Maryland in 1817. He escaped in 1838 to New York and moved to Massachusetts, where he founded

Troubled waters are ahead for the world's fish. Those finned creatures and shellfish, such as crabs and clams, may be a rare sight by 2048, according to a fouryear study. The study, recently published in the journal
was conducted by a team of 14 researchers in four countries.
If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
The study warns that ocean life is being wiped out because of overfishing and pollution.
Global warming (a rise in Earth's temperatures) and habitat loss are also to blame for the decline in seafood.
Although the world's sea life is in serious danger, it's not too late to reverse the problem, says the study's lead author, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. The researchers have called for measures to protect current fish populations, such as reducing large-scale fishing and pollution. ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we don't change things,"" Worm told reporters.
The loss of ocean life will cause more than just a shortage of seafood. It could spell disaster for ecosystems too. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that work together as a unit to live. A declining fish population would cause a disaster up and down the food chain. Larger animals, such as seals and dolphins, depend on fish for food. Without enough fish to eat, those animals would be in trouble.

World leaders are focusing on providing long-term aid to the affected areas. That includes helping people rebuild their homes, their lives, and their businesses. Officials predict that it could take up to a decade to recover from the tsunami.
Governments have promised more than $3 billion in aid. ""The world is coming together in a manner we have never ever seen before,"" said United Nations official Jan Egeland.
It's not just governments helping out. People are making a difference in ways large and small, with companies donating millions of dollars and kids organizing bake sales to raise money.
Officials say an early warning system could have saved thousands of lives. A warning system was established in 1965 for countries that border the Pacific Ocean. The United States is part of that system.
What other problems may arise after the tsunami?
Because tsunamis are rare in the Indian Ocean, countries in that area did not have a warning system. World leaders are working to create a system that will warn and help protect people in all countries.

One of the most historic regions in the United States is in trouble. The 175-mile-long area of land stretches through Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
The area is home to more American history than any other slice of land in the country, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. George Washington built his estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison also built their homes in that state. The region at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains includes many battlefields from the Civil War (18611865).
As people construct new houses, roads, and buildings, they are destroying acres of history. Officials say the region has lost more than 150,000 acres of farmland in the past 20 years. That is an area slightly smaller than New York City.

Brandon and millions of other kids have come together to help the victims of the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. Those kids have been offering comfort to one another; collecting clothes, food, water, and other supplies to send to rescue workers; and raising money to help the victims' families.
As kids have reached out to help others, they've learned about what their country stands for. English teacher Nan Bartow of New Haven, Connecticut, has been teaching for more than 30 years. She said, ""Kids are more patriotic than ever before.""
Many other teachers agree with Bartow. ""The students are saying, 'We are proud to be Americans' and that they appreciate everything they have,"" said Cynthia Elwood, a principal in Arlington, Texas.
Kids have shown their appreciation by sharing what they have. Here are some of the things they have done:
In Georgia, Parker Pratt, age 10, and Mac Conway, age 9, opened a lemonade stand and collected about $60 for charity.
Teachers and students at the Academy Hill School in Wilton, Maine, declared Friday, September 21, Red, White, and Blue Day. Everyone at the school wore the colors of the American flag to school that day.
In Stow, Ohio, 7-year-old Alexa came up with an idea that enabled her class to raise $113. ""I saw people who were crying because they didn't have houses or anything and they lost their sisters and brothers,"" she said.
In Oklahoma, kids and their parents collected more than 40,000 teddy bears to give kids in 350 schools in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.
""It is especially hard for children to understand what has happened, but they know how to show love,"" said Sue Hale, who helped coordinate the donations. Many kids wrote and attached special notes to the bears they donated. They said the bears and notes would help give thousands of kids hope for a bright future.
If you are looking to help the victims and families of the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. you might contact the following organizations. Each of these organizations has a long history of helping disaster victims.
* The American Red Cross can be contacted at 1-800-HELP-NOW.
* The Salvation Army can be contacted at 1-800-SAL-ARMY.

Simpson's dad rushed to her defense after the incident. He said his daughter was lip-synching because an upset stomach had made her voice hoarse.
""Every artist that I know in this business has had vocal problems at some time,"" he told The Associated Press. ""So you've got to do what you've got to do.""
An embarrassed Simpson apologized to her fans but said she hadn't done anything different from what many other artists do. Some music industry officials defend the practice. They say it's nearly impossible to sound good and sing on cue when you're dancing onstage or performing complicated acts.
Difficult dance moves are not an excuse for lip-synching, say many fans. In fact, some fans say lip-synching is a dishonest practice that hurts a singer's credibility.
Fans often question a star's talent if the singer is unable to perform live onstage. They say most people can sound good on a CD if their voice is enhanced in a studio. Some concertgoers also feel betrayed and disappointed if an artist lip-synchs, especially when they have spent a lot of money on a ticket to hear a live performance.

He scrambles up high ladders, walks down the sides of buildings, and rides in a fire engine. He is learning to be a firefighter at the New Haven Fire Academy.
Woolfolk and 28 other students are currently learning what it takes to become a firefighter. Classes at the fire academy, which is in Connecticut, last for about 22 weeks. On most days, the students go to school from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. However, once a week, school lasts until 10 p.m.
For two days each week, the students sit in a classroom to learn science, math, and emergency medicine. They learn the science of fires, how to calculate water pressure, and how to treat medical emergencies.
During the other three days, the students go outside and learn how to hook hoses to fire hydrants, climb buildings, rescue people trapped in burning buildings, and many other things.
""Firefighters have to know lots of different things,"" said Pablo Menendez, an instructor at the school. ""We have to treat medical emergencies, know how to handle dangerous chemicals, and rescue people who have fallen from cliffs.""
Teamwork is one of the most important lessons students learn at the school. ""Working together saves lives,"" said Capt. William Seward, the director of the academy. ""Students need to learn that they are part of a team.""
Fighting fires is not easy. The suits and equipment a firefighter wears weigh about 40 pounds.
Firefighters are very busy. In New Haven, they respond to 32,000 emergency calls a year. Each time firefighters go out, they know they might not come back. Across the United States, about 100 firefighters die each year.
""That's why the lessons learned here at the academy are so important,"" said Seward. ""What they learn here can save their lives.""
Firefighters know how dangerous their jobs are. Their training helps them overcome their fear of heights and fires. ""When you're up there on the ladder looking down, it's scary,"" said one student. ""To do this job, you've got to wipe out the fear.""
Firefighters overcome their fear for one reason. ""I wanted to help other people,"" said Leah Harwin. ""I think it is important to help other people whenever you can.""

Officials in El Salvador said more than 700 people were killed and many people were still missing days after the quake. Thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed. As a result, many people were left without shelter.
San Salvador, the nation's capital, was the scene of terrible destruction. Much of the damage was caused by mudslides that buried many buildings.
To help the survivors of the earthquake, dozens of countries, including Japan, Spain, and the United States, rushed teams of rescue workers to El Salvador. The rescuers searched for people buried under mud and rubble from collapsed buildings.
To clear the wreckage, rescue workers used bulldozers, shovels, and their hands. Rescuers also used specially trained dogs, which have a keen sense of smell, to locate victims buried by the quake.
Thick layers of mud made rescue work difficult. ""Mud seals off everything considered essential for survival, such as oxygen,"" explained Gary O'Shea, director of the International Rescue Corps of the United Kingdom.
In addition to sending teams of rescue workers, many countries sent money, food, clothing, water, and medical supplies to help in the recovery efforts. (Ask your teacher how you can help the earthquake victims in El Salvador.)

Recently, soldiers from North Korea and South Korea marched into a no man's land. The area is between the two countries. The soldiers cleared land mines from the area. In the future, roads and railroads might be built there. The roads would link the two countries for the first time in almost 50 years.
The no man's land was set up after fighting in the Korean War ended in 1953. It is a
zone (DMZ). The DMZ is not under anyone's military control.
""Today we are standing at the start of a new era during which the South and the North will move forward hand in hand toward the future,"" said a South Korean official as the search for land mines started. ""We are burying a history marked by the scars of war and the pain of division.""
After World War II ended in 1945, Korea was divided into two countries-North Korea and South Korea. On June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea.
Sixteen countries including the United States sent soldiers to help South Korea. All 16 countries were members of the United Nations. China and the Soviet Union helped the North Koreans. About 2 million died in the war. Many of the casualties were civilians. More than 107,230 U.S. soldiers were killed.
Most of the fighting ended when an armistice, or agreement to stop fighting, was signed on July 27, 1953. Land mines were placed in the DMZ to keep the two sides from combat.
However, the two sides never signed a peace treaty. The two sides continued to fight occasionally. Now the countries are trying to settle their differences and work together.

Thousands of people who fled the storm weeks ago are still wondering when they can go homeif they still have a home. Across the country, other people are rebuilding their lives in new neighborhoods.
""The devastation is greater than our worst fears,"" says Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco. ""It's just totally overwhelming.""
Officials are now developing plans to repair the roads, bridges, houses, and buildings the storm washed away. Congress approved billions of dollars in aid. Companies in the United States have donated millions to the relief efforts.
Government officials have also been working on providing housing, schools, and jobs to those who
or fled, New Orleans. ""Our hearts go out to people, our brothers and sisters, along the Gulf Coast,"" says Mayor Bill White of Houston, Texas. ""They are welcome, and we are going to provide whatever support we need to.""
People from around the United States, along with those in other countries, are also reaching out to Katrina's victims. In Texas, schools opened their doors to students from the devastated communities.
In the city of Greenwood, Indiana, fourth-grade teacher Carol Edwards started a drive so her students at Southwest Elementary School could help those affected by Katrina. The class is collecting school supplies and clothing to send to a school that was damaged in the storm. Nine-year-old Alex Warford, a student in Edwards's class, says, ""I think it's a great idea because they lost all their things.""
A hurricane forms when warm, moist air rises from the ocean's surface. The air pressure drops, and the winds cause a mass of clouds to form around an eye. The eye is the calm center of the hurricane.
The rising air cools and condenses, and heavy rain falls. The eyewall is a solid ring of thunderstorms around the eye. The strongest winds and heaviest rains are located there.
Rescue teams in boats search a flooded street in New Orleans, Louisiana, September 7.
By the time Hurricane Katrina moved from the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico to land, it was a Category 4 storm.(""
When Katrina slammed into the coasts of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana on August 29, no one was prepared for the destruction that followed. The hurricane packed fierce winds of more than 145 miles an hour by the time it hit land. The monster winds, heavy rains, and flooding destroyed homes, peeled roofs from buildings, and toppled trees.

""We're dealing with one of the worst natural disasters in our nation's history,"" said President George W. Bush after flying over the devastation. ""The folks on the Gulf Coast are going to need the help of this country for a long time.""
Hurricanes are rated on a scale of 1 to 5. A storm's rating is based on wind speed and the potential for destruction.

252,"The Southeast: Exploring the 'Land of the Flowers'
Long before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, Spaniards had explored and settled large parts of what is now the United States.
One of the regions the Spanish explored first was the Southeast. Hernando de Soto and 600 followers were the first European explorers to journey through the Southeast. For nearly four years, de Soto and his followers wandered through the region.
After sailing from Cuba in 1539, de Soto landed in Florida. An earlier Spanish explorer, Juan Ponce de Len, had named the land
, after a Spanish word meaning ""flowery"".
La Florida was much larger then present-day Florida. It covered most of the area in what are now the southeastern states. One of de Soto's men described the animals the explorers found. ""There are many lions and bears in Florida, wolves, deer, jackals, cats and rabbits (also live there),"" he wrote.
Many different groups of Native Americans lived in La Florida. They grew corn, beans and squash. They also fished and hunted.
Because the native groups did not trust de Soto, they often left their villages before the Spaniards arrived. The Native Americans had good reason to fear de Soto. He captured and enslaved some of them.
De Soto and his men were mainly looking for gold. The search for gold led them out of present-day Florida north to what is now Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
After reaching North Carolina without finding gold, the explorers turned west and crossed the Appalachian Mountains. Upon hearing rumors of gold, de Soto led his men into Tennessee and south to Alabama.
In southern Alabama, the Choctaw Indians attacked the explorers. They killed many of de Soto's men, and some of his supplies were taken.
De Soto's expedition then turned northwest through Alabama and into present-day Mississippi. In May 1541, de Soto reached the Mississippi River, near what is now Memphis, Tennessee. Then they crossed into Arkansas, where in May 1542, De Soto died.
The explorers then retreated to the Mississippi River, where they built boats, which sailed down the river to the Gulf of Mexico. Only about half of the people who had landed with de Soto in Florida survived the trek across the Southeast.

268,"Can Iraq's new constitution help bring peace to this war-torn country?
Although the constitution has been approved, Iraqis clash over the countrys future.
Nothing was going to stand in the way of
Zeinab Sahib, a mother of three, as she voted on Iraqs constitution. She cast her ballot at a school in Baghdad, the war-torn countrys capital. ""I came to vote because I am tired of terrorists, and I want my country to be safe again,"" she says.
Sahib was one of 7 million Iraqis who voted to accept or reject the new constitution on October 15. The ballots took days to count by hand, but the constitution passed. Seventy-eight percent of Iraqis voted to make the constitution the countrys new set of laws. ""It is a landmark day in the history of Iraq,"" White House spokesperson Scott McClellan told reporters. ""The political process is continuing to move forward in Iraq, and it is an encouraging sign to see more and more people participating in the process.""
The new constitution marks a step toward establishing a
in Iraq since U.S.-led forces removed Saddam Hussein from power in 2003. A democracy is a type of government in which people vote for their leaders in elections.
Bringing democracy to Iraq has been a challenge. Violent attacks continue throughout the country as
, or rebels, try to prevent Iraq from becoming a democracy. More than 150,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq, helping to bring peace and stability to the country. The U.S. military has also been training Iraqis to protect themselves from insurgents.
Although the constitution was approved, the country is deeply divided. Not all Iraqis agree on how Iraq should be run. Iraq is made up of three major groupsShiites (SHEE-ights), Sunnis (SOON-eez), and Kurds.
Under Saddam Hussein, who was a Sunni, Shiites and Kurds had little voice in the government. The Shiites who live in southern Iraq and the Kurds who live in northern Iraq largely voted for the new constitution. The Sunnis, a minority group, live in the middle of the country and voted against it.
U.S. troops patrol the site of a car bomb explosion in Baghdad, Iraq, in March 2004.
Many Sunnis, who were in control during Saddam Husseins rule, say the constitution favors Shiites and Kurds. The constitution allows the Shiites and Kurds to govern their own areas. Those regions have more oil than where most Sunnis live. The Sunnis worry that the Shiites and Kurds will control most of the oil and leave them weak and powerless.
Along with granting more power to local governments, the new constitution allows Iraqis to vote for leaders every four years. On December 15, Iraqis will vote on a permanent government. They will choose a
, a lawmaking body, like the U.S. Congress. The new government will have the power to revise the draft constitution. If they decide to revise it, voters will have to approve the changes.
As Iraqis begin running their own government, the United States hopes to begin withdrawing its troops. Since the war began three years ago, more than 2,000 U.S. troops have died. Recent polls show that support for the war has dropped and that many Americans want troops to come home. Others warn that the country still faces many obstacles on its path to stability.
In the meantime, President George W. Bush praised the high participation in Iraqs vote. He says, ""The Iraqis are making inspiring progress toward building a democracy.""
Why are the people of Iraq divided over their form of government?
Size: 168,754 square miles (about twice the size of Idaho)
Religion: About 95 percent of Iraqis are Muslims. They practice the religion of Islam. Shiite Muslims make up about 60 percent of Iraqs population. Sunni Muslims make up about 35 percent.

Thousands of years ago, enemy armies and natural disasters destroyed the cities of Zeugma and Herakleion (ee-RAH-klee-on). This summer, however, scientists known as archaeologists (ahr-kee-OL-uh-jists) discovered the lost cities. They found Zeugma in Turkey, a country in Asia. Other scientists found Herakleion underwater off the coast of Egypt, a country in Africa.
About 2,000 years ago, Zeugma was an important meeting place for traders and soldiers. The ruins show that some of the homes had water pipes and mosaics.
Zeugma is located near a dam on the Euphrates (yoo-FRAY-teez) River. The dam is needed to make electricity for people who live nearby. But the dam will cause the river to rise. Soon the river's water will cover part of Zeugma's ruins.
Off the coast of Egypt, divers are finding the remains of Herakleion. Herakleion was built to honor Hercules, an ancient hero.
Experts say Herakleion is at least 2,500 years old. They say an earthquake probably caused the city to sink into the Mediterranean Sea. Archaeologists have found the remains of houses, roads, temples, statues, and coins under 30 feet of water. ""It was really a lost world,"" said Franck Goddio, an archaeologist working on the site.

Real Wrestling. Real Heroes. That is the

Unlike pro wrestling, the two challengers wrestle on a padded mat, not in a ring with ropes. They use certain moves to force their opponent to the mat.
Greg Strobel, a U.S. Olympic wrestling coach, says pro wrestling is meant to entertain. He says it is not a sport, like Olympic wrestling.
Chris Benoit and the Undertaker are two famous pro wrestlers. Many fans enjoy pro wrestling because of the action, fireworks, and costumes. However, pro wrestling is more of a show than a real contest, said Ron Buck, a sports reporter. According to many critics, the moves and punches in a professional match are fake.
U.S. Olympic wrestlers do not get paid to compete in the Olympics. For many team members, the chance to win a gold medal is a dream come true. Though pro wrestlers get more fame and attention, Olympic wrestlers consider representing the United States an honor. That is why, to many fans, these wrestlers are real heroes.
Olympic wrestlers compete only against others who are in the same weight class. Why is that an important rule?

In a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear.
Scientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help.
Scientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled.
Scientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest.
The African elephant is the largest animal that lives on land. African elephants can weigh up to 16,000 pounds.
An elephant's trunk contains more than 40,000 muscles. The trunk is used to smell, breathe, touch, eat, drink, and bathe.
An angry or frightened elephant can run about 25 miles per hour.

If the kids keep their grades up, they can play on hockey teams. Some travel across the country playing other teams.

202,"Hi! My Name is Pam Pollster. This is my pet parakeet, Polly. We live in Polling Place. Polly is a smart bird. In fact, she's so smart, she can count very high numbers. This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
. That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's as Easy as One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.
Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?
