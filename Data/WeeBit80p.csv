Revolutions in other Eastern European countries quickly followed - notably the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989.
In 1991, Gorbachev fell from power and the Soviet Union was dissolved.
Problems facing the USSR in the 1980s
Russia could not afford the arms race.
The Soviet economy was backwards - factories and mines were decrepit and out of date.
Backward industry was causing increasing environmental problems - eg pollution, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion of 1986, and the Aral Sea dried up.
Many people were much poorer than the poorest people in the capitalist West - unrest about shortages was growing.
Crime, alcoholism and drugs were out of control in Soviet towns.
The Soviet system had become corrupt and out of date - instead of dealing with problems, the government just covered them up (eg Chernobyl, 1986).
Many people were dissatisfied with the Soviet police state and censorship.
Increasing dtente between the two sides after the Cuban Missiles Crisis gradually brought the Cold War to an end.

Jekyll tells the story of how he turned into Hyde.
It began as scientific curiosity in the duality of human nature (or the good and evil), and his attempt to destroy the 'darker self'. Eventually, however, he became addicted to the character of Hyde, who increasingly took over and destroyed him.
The novel does not return to Utterson who, at the end of Chapter 8, was going to return to Jekyll's house.

3000,"The use of electronic instruments and the means of amplification had an enormous effect on the development of 20th century music including jazz, blues, rock and roll, world music (including bhangra and salsa), disco and modern dance music, as well as some art music including serialism and minimalism. In minimalism electronically recorded and in some cases, manipulated, sounds may be heard.
The ability to record and transmit music saw quicker and wider dissemination of music in the 20th century. Modern recording techniques include the use of multitrack recording facilities and the use of computer software programmes.
Some of the most important techniques in music production
The process of changing a sound by reducing the level of louder sounds and increasing the level of quieter sounds. This is usually applied to vocals.
The sound produced when too much signal is sent to parts of an electronic system such as an amplifier or loudspeakers, resulting in a change to the original sound. Some electric guitarists use it deliberately to produce a particular sound. Distortion is usually used in Heavy Metal music.
Sound processing where the original sound is changed by adding one or more clearly discernible repeats of the original sound (the repeats usually die away).
A sound processing unit capable of adding a range of different effects to the sound such as echo, phasing and flanging.
A control on a mixer, which moves the sound between two outputs, such as left and right (similar to a balance control on a hi-fi system).
Sound processing where the original sound is changed by adding hundreds of short reflections (this makes it sound as though the sound is being played in a large space, such as a church).
A sound is recorded and then edited in a computer. The end sound is sometimes used in dance music.
A device which enables musicians to record musical data which can then be played back, edited and stored. Some sequencers are built into keyboards (onboard sequencers), whilst others are software and display information on a computer screen.

1260,"Trade is the exchange of goods and services between one country and another.
Goods bought into a country are called imports, and those sold to another country are called exports.
A trade surplus means that the value of exports is greater than imports creating a trade surplus. A trade deficit is when there are more imports than exports.
A More Economically Developed Country [MEDC] has high levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the northern hemisphere are MEDCs, eg UK, USA, Canada, Europe. More of the countries in the southern hemisphere are Less Economically Developed Countries [LEDCs].
A Less Economically Developed Country [LEDC] has low levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the southern hemisphere (eg countries in southern Africa, southern Asia and South America) are LEDCs, while more of the countries in the northern hemisphere are More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs].
the opposite is true. This means that LEDCs have little purchasing power, making it difficult for them to pay off their debts or escape from poverty.
The price of primary products fluctuates on the world market which means that workers and producers in LEDCs
. The price of manufactured goods is steadier which means that MEDCs always benefit.
Increasing trade and reducing their balance of trade deficit is essential for the development of LEDCs. However sometimes MEDCs impose
on imports. Tariffs are taxes imposed on imports, which makes foreign goods more expensive to the consumer. Quotas are limits on the amount of goods imported and usually work in the MEDC's favour.
means that they are dependent on one another in some way. For example, many LEDCs are dependent on MEDCs for manufactured goods or aid. MEDCs are dependent on LEDCs for primary products such as steel and iron. LEDCs are also dependent on MEDCs for income from tourism, whilst MEDCs require LEDCs to provide the climate and hospitality for some holiday destinations.
The result of the pattern of world trade is that the workers in primary industries in LEDCs often lose out. They receive low wages and often have poor standards of living. They cannot afford education for their children and many children are required to work to help their families earn a living.
means that the producer receives a guaranteed and fair price for their product regardless of the price on the world market. This means their quality of life should improve, as well as the long-term prospects for their children.
Fair trade products sometimes cost more in supermarkets in MEDCs, but many consumers consider this a small price to pay for the benefits they bring.
Fair trade sets minimum standards for the pay and conditions of workers.
promotes Global Citizenship by guaranteeing a fair, minimum price for products. In this way, they support producers in improving their living conditions.
Fair trade products are becoming more widespread and include tea, coffee, sugar, chocolate and cotton.

There are legal limits to the level of alcohol that drivers and pilots can have in the body. This is because alcohol impairs the ability of people to control their vehicles properly.
Alcohol has short-term effects such as sleepiness and impaired judgment, balance and muscle control. This leads to blurred vision and slurred speech. Vasodilation occurs - blood vessels in the skin carry more blood - leading to heat loss.
The long-term effects of alcohol include damage to the liver and brain. The liver removes alcohol from the bloodstream, as it is a toxic chemical. Over time, alcohol consumption can lead to liver damage - cirrhosis.

The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is maintained through a balance between processes such as photosynthesis, respiration and combustion. But human activities are polluting the atmosphere.
Photosynthesis by plants is thought to be a key process in the evolution of the Earths atmosphere.
You need to know the proportions of the main gases in the atmosphere.
The Earth's atmosphere has remained much the same for the past 200 million years. The pie chart shows the proportions of the main gases in the atmosphere.
It is clear that the main gas is nitrogen. Oxygen - the gas that allows animals and plants to
to engage in respiration - the energy-producing process inside living cells
, and fuels to burn - is the next most abundant gas. These two gases are both elements and account for about 99% of the gases in the atmosphere. The remaining gases, such as carbon dioxide, water vapour and noble gases such as argon, are found in much smaller proportions.

The play also contains a lot of expressions that Shakespeare invented and are still in use today, such as 'on a wild goose chase' or 'fool's paradise'. More recently, builders have started to use the term 'Juliet balcony' (although many of them now spell it 'Juliette balcony'). This is very shallow balcony with a rail in front of a patio door. Oddly enough, there's no mention of a balcony in the play itself. But it has become traditional to have Juliet talking to Romeo from one.

5290,"Black people were originally brought from Africa to America during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. They were forcibly transported across the Atlantic in slave ships (in which many died) and sold as slaves to work on sugar and cotton plantations in the Caribbean and the southern states of north America. They had no rights and were seen by their white owners as little more than animals or machines.
Even after the abolition of slavery in 1865, the blacks were still almost powerless. The whites had too much to lose to allow blacks any rights. Nothing was equal: blacks had the worst of everything while whites had the best.
Such was the hatred of blacks by the whites - especially during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when money was tight for everyone - that it was common for blacks to be

7207,"Emma studied painting at West Surrey College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Art. Her work has been exhibited widely in the UK and Europe including at the London Art and Design Show.
I make two-dimensional work using a variety of practices. Painting, drawing, print-making and cut-paper collage. Moving between the different processes seems to invigorate my work. When I explore techniques as a means of representing my ideas a door opens up and images find their way in, some come unheralded and make a sudden entry, others hang about in the doorway and need a little coaxing.
I work from my imagination and I also use source material (photographs, found objects, studies from life) to assist my drawing. It is very important for me to take care in the execution and composition of the pieces.
I tend to make work in series. This doesn't necessarily mean the pictures have a story running through them that I am aware of at the time of making, although that can happen; it just means I am exploring and experimenting with particular themes and/or materials and techniques. Sometimes I work on one piece through to completion but I often work on a few pieces at once. If I get stuck and am unable to resolve an image I can move to another and return later with a fresh eye. The most important piece of equipment I have in the studio to help with evaluating the progress of a picture is a mirror. I hold the image up and look at the reflection many times as I add things. I also rotate it. This allows me to see the image and its composition as if for the first time.
This is taken from a series of seven pieces that were inspired by the writing of two archetypal psychologists. A book by James Hillman called 'The Souls Code - In search of Character and Calling' and an article by Eva Loewe called 'The New Lacemakers' from 'Sphinx' - a journal for archetypal psychology and the arts; vol. 4. It was also a response to two events about five years earlier; the death of my father and the birth of my son.
Firstly, I experimented with the colour mixing. I tried to get close to the colour of fresh blood as I wanted the colour to represent life. I chose acrylic paint to get a flat consistent finish as I didnt want the look of the paint to detract from the cut shapes. I painted this on to a heavy weight cartridge paper. Paper can buckle when you use water-based paint, so I painted a large ""X"" with water from corner to corner on the back to counteract the wet surface of the front. This helped to keep the paper flat as it dried. When it was dry I drew and cut out the form of the circle.
I chose the circle to reference the human ovum after conception and the design of astrological charts at the moment of birth. I wanted to include the elements of Earth, Air, Fire and Water. I had been looking at a book called 'Alchemy and Mysticism' which has fantastic circular images that include fire, dragons, water etc.
The paper was cut with a scalpel. One reason for using this method was to force me into being bold and committed. Sometimes I cut freehand directly into the front of the piece using the scalpel to draw instead of a pencil for an intuitive way of working. The images like the rams and the suns were consciously added to reflect the element of Earth. Also fertility, spring and growth. These had to be drawn and cut out from the back of the paper, so no vestiges of pencil would be left on the front.
I achieved the eventual look of the piece by cutting out shapes but also by cutting to leave silhouettes. Endeavouring to make the cut paper collaged series more ""lacy"" I found that cutting away too much could make the piece very flimsy and it would lose its circular shape or crease and make it very difficult to position. I had to learn when to stop cutting.
Some of the final images in the piece are forms that suggested themselves to me along the way through the process of using the mirror; for example the emblem for Air, Fire and renewal - the abstracted phoenix-like bird. The eye and beak holding a burning ember can be made out in the bottom right. When I felt the piece was complete I sprayed the back with a permanent mounting spray and mounted it on to white cartridge paper.
The woodcut entitled 'Field' (2005) is made in a similar way to 'Trailing Stars'. It's very direct; part intuitive, part intentional. The block itself is mdf and the cuts were made using a basic set of japanese woodcut tools and a cheap electric engraving set with different attachments from a high street store.
Woodcut is a fairly new process for me, so when I began the piece I wanted to explore the different kinds of marks that my tools could make. I knew I wanted to start with a pair of wings (now seen upside down in top right) as a follow on from a previous series that include winged imagery. The resulting print could be called a ""happy surprise"" as the main inspiration came from experimenting and enjoying the ease of the tools cutting through the material. The mirror helped me to see images within the shapes and marks.
Mdf is a fabulously responsive material that can be cut in any direction as it has no grain. It is essential to use a mask specifically designed for mdf because of the toxic dust. Firstly I paint the block with black ink, this enables me to see what I am left with when I begin cutting once the ink is dry. It also gives a good surface for preparatory drawing. With this image I cut directly into the wood without drawing first, regularly holding it up to the mirror. There is always a point at which I stop rotating the piece because of the early decisions I make which bring the composition into focus.
When a block is finished I brush the block for fine dust and splinters, then paint it with a few layers of button polish/knotting which is a synthetic shellac to seal the mdf. This stops the block being too absorbent. I usually use black oil-based printing ink applied thinly up to about ten times with a hard roller. Currently I print onto ""Kozo"" japanese paper which is quite strong and not too expensive. Also as I print by hand the surface is fine enough and smooth enough to take the ink without the necessity for a relief printing press. I place paper on top of the inked block and I print using an inexpensive version of a japanese tool called a ""baren"". About the size/shape of a CD covered in bamboo leaf with a hand hold on the back, it has to be kept in an oiled cloth as the leaf will crack if it dries out. I apply quite a lot of pressure in a circular motion lifting the paper from time to time and checking the quality of the print underneath. When there is an even covering then I lift the paper away and ink up for another copy.
The artists whose work I admire in no particular order of preference are Munch, Titian, Vermeer, Murillo, Gustav Moreau, Leonora Carrington, William Blake, Sheila Ogilvie, Odilon Redon, Paula Rego, Rebecca Horn, Grayson Perry, Laura Ford, Beatrix Potter, Herman Nitsch, Goya, Picasso, Cornelia Parker, Philip Guston, Mervyn Peake, Katharina Fritsch, Fran Burden, Oona Grimes and Denys Blacker.
I also admire the work of Japanese animators at Studio Ghibli. I love cave paintings like those seen at the caves in Altamira and Lascaux. I really enjoy looking at and find a lot of inspiration from the art and imagery of ancient cultures. Recently I have been enjoying looking at Japanese woodblock prints and the work of outsider artists like Henry Darger.

, you can see that the number of occupied energy levels is the same as the period number.
from left to right, an energy level gradually becomes filled with electrons. The highest occupied energy level contains just one electron on the left-hand side of the table. It is filled by the time you get to the right-hand side.
, you can see that the number of electrons in the highest occupied energy level is the same as the group number.
Each element in a group therefore has the same number of electrons in its highest occupied energy level. Group 0 is a partial exception to this rule. Although it comes after Group 7, it is not called Group 8 - and it contains helium, which has only two electrons in its outer shell.
Here is how to use the periodic table to work out an electronic structure:
Find the element in the periodic table. Work out which period it is in, and draw that number of circles around the nucleus.
Work out which group the element is in and draw that number of electrons in the outer circle - with eight for Group 0 elements - except helium.
Fill the other circles with electrons. Remember - two in the first, eight in the second and third, and 18 in the fourth.
Finally, count your electrons and check that they equal the atomic number.

War transforms soldiers, breaking them physically and mentally: 'Bent double' 'Knock-kneed'. Rather than glorious men, Owen presents the soldiers as weakened old 'hags'.
The experience of war is something no soldier can escape: 'In all my dreams, before my helpless sight, / He plunges at me'.
The effect of gas used in World War One is communicated to the reader through Owen's use of verbs linked to death by a lack of oxygen: 'guttering, choking, drowning', 'smothering'.
Owen offers the reader very graphic imagery associated with suffering, aiming to present the truth about the war experience, arguably arising from his first-hand experience of war.
Owen presents the soldiers as victims who have been betrayed by those who encouraged them to go to war. He uses words such as 'innocent' and 'children' to reinforce his positive attitude to the soldiers.
Owen is bitter about war and the encouragement given to go to war. He angrily refers to 'The old Lie' that dying for your country is sweet and honourable.

The equation below shows the relationship between energy transferred, power and time:
energy transferred (kilowatt-hour, kWh) = power (kilowatt, kW)  time (hour, h)
Note that power is measured in kilowatts here, instead of the more usual watts. To convert from W to kW you must divide by 1,000.
For example, 2,000W = 2,000  1,000 = 2kW.
Also note that time is measured in hours here, instead of the more usual seconds. To convert from seconds to hours you must divide by 3,600.
For example, 1,800s = 1,800  3,600 = 0.5 hours.
Electricity meters measure the number of units of electricity used in a home or other building. The more units used, the greater the cost. The cost of the electricity used is calculated using this equation:
cost = power (kW)  time (hour)  cost of 1 kWh (pence)
An electric fire needs 2 kW. It is switched on for 3 hours. If each kWh costs 10p, how much does it cost to run the fire?
cost = power  time  cost of 1 kWh
 = 2 kW  3 h  10p
A TV needs 250 W. It is switched on for 30 minutes. If each kWh costs 8p, how much does it cost to run the TV?

6460,"Most of the characters are deeply concerned about their 'reputation' - how others see them and their standing in society. This is linked to 'class' (see Context), but a character's reputation isn't necessarily linked to their social standing (for example, Wickham).
Darcy is concerned about his reputation, but not as much as other characters believe. He has two faces: one public, one private. In public, although he acts with manners and formality, many believe he's arrogant and aloof. In Longbourn, his reputation develops along these lines. But in private he's loving and caring. He treats his tenants and servants well, and ensures Lydia's reputation is rescued, without publicising this.
One of Elizabeth's most attractive qualities is not being as concerned as others are about someone's reputation. She won't be intimidated by either Darcy or Lady Catherine, despite their 'reputations'. She believes there are more important things. When she finds out Jane is ill, she thinks nothing of walking three miles over fields and arriving at Netherfield in a mess - something most women wouldn't have done. Some would look down on her for being so unladylike (the Bingley sisters). However, to Elizabeth, her reputation is far less important than her sister's welfare.
Although she perhaps doesn't understand completely, by becoming Wickham's lover outside of marriage her reputation as a lady would be completely destroyed. This is why Darcy makes sure Wickham marries her. Even this isn't enough for Collins, who feels she should still be disowned. Although Austen treats snobbery lightly, this issue of reputation is taken seriously. Lydia's behaviour compromises the standing of her whole family.
Wickham is keen to use his looks and charm to cultivate a good reputation for himself. For the most part, this works. Darcy is such a gentleman he only reveals the truth about Wickham's corrupt past to Elizabeth when forced to - and insists she doesn't tell others. Wickham is concerned with his own reputation on the surface, but not sincerely, or he wouldn't act as he does. He's more concerned with others' reputations and how he might affect theirs for his own gain.
Mrs Bennet is concerned with reputation, but on a very basic level. She would be hysterical if she knew what others really thought of her. She believes she's well regarded and tries hard to be so, all the while making things worse for herself through her loud, embarrassing actions. Perhaps the best example of her misguided belief in reputation comes when she discovers Wickham has married Lydia. Rather than be concerned that her youngest daughter has married a terrible man, she immediately worries about how the wedding dress will look.

7058,"If you become too hot or too cold, there are several ways in which your temperature can be controlled. They involve sweating, shivering, skin capillaries and hairs.
Sweat glands in the skin release more sweat. This evaporates, removing heat energy from the skin.
Blood vessels leading to the skin capillaries become wider - they
- allowing more blood to flow through the skin, and more heat to be lost.
Muscles contract rapidly - we shiver. These contractions need energy from respiration, and some of this is released as heat.
Blood vessels leading to the skin capillaries become narrower - they
- letting less blood flow through the skin and conserving heat in the body.
The hairs on the skin also help to control body temperature. They lie flat when we are warm, and rise when we are cold. The hairs trap a layer of air above the skin, which helps to insulate the skin against heat loss.
- Hair muscles pull hairs on end.
- Hair muscles relax. Hairs lie flat so heat can escape.
- Sweat secreted by sweat glands. Cools skin by evaporation.
Remember: Capillaries do not move up and down inside the skin. Temperature is regulated by controlling the amount of blood which flows through the capillaries.

1653,"Evidence for the Big Bang - higher
You may have noticed that when an ambulance or police car goes past, its siren is high-pitched as it comes towards you, then becomes low-pitched as it goes away. This effect, where there is a change in frequency and wavelength, is called the Doppler effect. It happens with any wave source that moves relative to an observer.
This happens with light, too, and is called 'red shift'. Our Sun contains helium. We know this because there are black lines in the spectrum of the light from the Sun where helium has absorbed light. These lines form the absorption spectrum for helium.
When we look at the spectrum of a distant star, the absorption spectrum is there, but the pattern of lines has moved towards the red end of the spectrum, as you can see below:
. It is a change in frequency of the position of the lines.
Astronomers have found that the further from us a star is, the more its light is red-shifted. This tells us that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and that the further away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away.
Since we cannot assume that we have a special place in the Universe, this is evidence for a generally expanding universe. It suggests that everything is moving away from everything else. The Big Bang theory says this expansion started 13.6 billion years ago with an explosion.
Summary of some of the evidence of the Big Bang and its interpretation
The light from other galaxies is red-shifted.
The other galaxies are moving away from us.
The further away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.
The most likely explanation is that the whole Universe is expanding. This supports the theory that the start of the Universe could have began with a single explosion.

6746,"You should be able to explain why digital signals maintain their quality better than analogue signals.
All signals become weaker as they travel long distances, and they may also pick up random extra signals. This is called noise, and it is heard as crackles and hiss on radio programmes. Noise may also cause an internet connection to drop or slow down, as the modem tries to compensate.
Noise adds extra random information to analogue signals. Each time the signal is amplified, the noise is also amplified. Gradually, the signal becomes less and less like the original signal. Eventually, it may be impossible to make out the music in a radio broadcast against the background noise, for example.
Noise also adds extra random information to digital signals. However, this noise is usually lower in amplitude than the amplitude of the ON states. As a result, the electronics in the amplifiers can ignore the noise and it does not get passed along. This means that the quality of the signal is maintained, which is one reason why television and radio broadcasters are gradually changing from analogue to digital transmissions.
They can also squeeze in more programmes, because digital signals can carry more information per second than analogue signals.

This works well for insoluble gases such as hydrogen, or gases that do not dissolve easily in water, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. Ammonia and chlorine are readily soluble in water and are not collected this way.

What is the importance of Dr Lanyon in the novel, and how does Stevenson present him?
Dr Lanyon is an important character in Stevenson's novel because, like Dr Jekyll, he is a scientist and doctor, so he makes an interesting point of comparison and contrast. He is also the only character to actually witness the transformation of Hyde/Jekyll. His account of this is very interesting to the reader. Stevenson saves Lanyon's account until the penultimate chapter, where it dramatically solves most of the mystery about the character of Mr Hyde. (
Opening paragraph briefly but clearly focuses upon a) the importance of Lanyon and b) the authors presentation.
Dr Lanyon first appears in Chapter 2 when Utterson goes to consult him about the strange will of their friend Dr Jekyll. He is described as a ""hearty, healthy"" gentleman with a warm manner of welcoming his friend that is based on ""genuine feeling"". (
Quotation shows evidence of the first bullet point in the question  what Lanyon is like.
) This emphasis on his good qualities and his genuine friendship is important. (
) It makes us trust him and believe his judgement may be right when he says that, because Jekyll ""began to go wrong"", he has seen little of him during the last ten years. In fact, he becomes uncharacteristically agitated and talks angrily of Jekyll's ideas as ""scientific balderdash"". This raises our level of interest in what Dr Jekyll might be involved in. (
Paragraph focuses on two different characters reactions to Lanyon - clear focus on the second bullet point.
) is clearly very friendly with Lanyon, and likes him. Because Utterson appears in the novel much more frequently than the doctor, and is also a steady, reliable, caring man, we tend to trust Lanyon even more. Stevenson makes him appear a model of reliable good sense and decent friendship. Dr Jekyll also tells Utterson that Lanyon is ""a good fellow... an excellent fellow"". But he adds, ""a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant blatant pedant"", and scorns Lanyon's disagreement with ""what he called my scientific heresies"". (
) This again raises our interest in what Jekyll is up to, because his attitudes toward Lanyon are wildly contradictory. (
Up to this point in the novel, Stevenson has made me like and trust Dr Lanyon. He is possibly a bit stuffy (but only possibly - can Jekyll's judgement be trusted?), but his heart is in the right place. In Chapter 6 (Remarkable Incident of Dr Lanyon), however, Stevenson creates a shocking change in Lanyon. When Utterson visits him, he finds a man ""with his death warrant written legibly on his face"". As a reader, I (
Use of ""me"" and ""I"" shows evidence of personal response, which the third bullet point asks for.
) am concerned to find out why. But even though there are hints of a dreadful confrontation between him and Jekyll, a horrific mystery hangs over the cause. The previously cheerful scientist and doctor lives in dread, feels he will soon die, and refuses to talk to Utterson about their former friend, Jekyll. His words ""if you cannot keep clear of this accursed topic, then in God's name, go"" show the author's skill (

Lanyon is important to the novel (
Focuses clearly on the fourth bullet point  the examiner can easily follow the structure of your essay.
) because of the dramatic mystery surrounding what he has seen. It excites the reader and draws us in. He is also important because, as a scientist and doctor, his disagreement with Jekyll's ""wrong in the head"" (
) ideas shows us that Jekyll is thinking and working outside of normal science. Jekyll is ""breaking the rules"", an important theme in the novel which would be far less apparent without the character of Lanyon. (
Refers to a theme of the novel.
) In the penultimate chapter, Lanyon's account of what he has witnessed raises the ending of the novel to a fever pitch of horror. Finally, in Lanyon's terrified language, we learn that Hyde is Jekyll and that Lanyon witnessed the transformation - this is why he is important in Stevenson's novel. (

The poet begins his sonnet with a clear statement, I love to see the summer: he wants to announce his feelings for the summer with all the passion of a lover.
The lack of punctuation in the poem suggests he is so keen to express his ideas that they all come tumbling out at once.
He describes the whole view to us, from the wool sack clouds to the bright beetles. This shift of perspective suggests that nothing escapes him: he is aware of every single summer beauty.
The poet provides us with several highly visual images, such as the marsh marigolds which stain the meadow with gold. The word stain indicates how deeply the rich colour belongs to the landscape - it will not come off.
It is interesting that the poem ends on play. It is a word associated with childhood and freedom, which is in complete contrast to Clare's sad life at the time that this poem was written. Perhaps this suggests that the summer helps to lift his spirits and remind him of more joyful times.
You will probably not have included all of these points, and will also have some of your own that are not mentioned here! Of course, all the ideas referred to in the

Nuclear power stations and coal-fired power stations usually provide base load electricity - they are run all of the time because they take the longest time to start up. Oil-fired and gas-fired power stations are often used to provide extra electricity at peak times, because they take the least time to start up.
The fuel for nuclear power stations is relatively cheap, but the power stations themselves are expensive to build. It is also very expensive to dismantle old nuclear power stations, and to store their radioactive waste, which is a dangerous health hazard.

Permit holder parking - certain parts of the city, particularly near the centre, are designated as permit parking only. This means that people must have a permit to park in that area. This reduces the number of people driving in to towns and cities as parking opportunities are restricted.

Problems of urbanisation in the inner city  inequalities
. Inequality means extreme differences between poverty and wealth, as well as in people's well-being and access to things like jobs, housing, and education. Inequalities may occur in:
Often people who live in inner-city areas experience a poor quality of life. This is because the inner-city is typically a zone with older housing and declining industry. The diagram below compares the quality of life for someone living in an outer London borough with that of someone who lives in an inner London borough.

run-down inner-city areas. Inner-city redevelopments, such as those in London's Docklands or Manchester's Salford Quays, may improve the physical environment of the area and improve the quality of housing. However, it can also create even greater inequalities because the local residents may not be able to afford to live there anymore. Often the old industrial jobs are replaced by skilled jobs and new people move to the area.
Problems of urbanisation in the urban rural fringe  housing demand
[an error occurred while processing this directive]
changes are leading to a greater demand for housing. People are living longer, and choosing to marry later, and in recent years there has been a rise in the number of single-parent families. Added to this, the UK is experiencing immigration from other countries, eg from Poland which has recently joined the EU. The result is an ever-larger number of smaller households, all requiring accommodation.
However, building new, affordable homes in urban areas is difficult. Land values are very high and land is in short supply:

The stopping distance of a car depends on two things: the thinking distance and the braking distance.
the same as mass. Mass is a measure of how much stuff is in an object. Weight is a force acting on that stuff.
You have to be careful. In physics, the term weight has a specific meaning, and is measured in newtons. Mass is measured in kilograms. The mass of a given object is the same everywhere, but its weight can change.
Weight is the result of gravity. The gravitational field strength of the Earth is 10 N/kg (ten newtons per kilogram). This means an object with a mass of 1kg would be attracted towards the centre of the Earth by a force of 10N. We feel forces like this as weight.
You would weigh less on the Moon because the gravitational field strength of the Moon is one-sixth of that of the Earth. But note that your mass would stay the same.
On Earth, if you drop an object it accelerates towards the centre of the planet. You can calculate the weight of an object using this equation:
weight (N) = mass (kg)  gravitational field strength (N/kg)
A person has a mass of 60kg. How much do they weigh on Earth, if the gravitational field strength is 10N/kg?
weight = mass  gravitational field strength
How much would the same person weigh on the Moon, if the gravitational field strength is 1.6N/kg?
weight = mass  gravitational field strength

The men see unmarried women in one of only two ways: as innocent and pure, so ready to be married, or dirty and to be used solely for sex, like prostitutes. The men themselves have very different standards. They might look for sex with a prostitute when they are young, but then expect to marry later in life (and insist on marrying a virgin). The play makes these double standards very clear.
Beatrice is the exception in this society. Her 'honour' is never questioned, but she behaves just like a man in public. She is powerful, jokes, insults people, interrupts others, and takes the lead when she wants to. She is like a modern role model for women.
At the end of the play, though, she agrees to marry. Benedick asks for ""Peace"", saying he will ""stop"" her mouth, meaning he will kiss her to keep her quiet. Does this mean Beatrice is now submitting and suddenly doing what she is told? No-one knows, because the play ends here. It is an interesting idea to think about.

What might you want to say about the poet's attitude to the
in this poem? Briefly note down some points that you would want to include in your essay, then compare your ideas with those in our sample answer on the next page.
The old woman's day is very regimented. The strong, regular rhythm throughout the poem indicates both the sameness of her days and the monotony of what she has to do.
Her work is very physical. She uses strong, plain-sounding verbs to describe her work: kneel, blow, scrub, bake, sweep, which contrasts to the light, airy verbs applied to the young: lie, dream, sigh.
She uses childish language when she personifies the stars to blink and peep. Maybe this is because the appearance of the stars is a chance for her to relax at last and escape the rigours of her day.
She seems jealous of the young. She compares her life of work to their lives of idleness: the young women with nothing more to fill their days than worry about their ribbons.
Is the old woman mocking the young who have nothing more to complain about than the wind disarranging their hair OR is she quietly regretful, wishing that she has no more to worry about than they do?
It is sad that she has to work because she is old: we wonder what happened to her when she was younger to make hard work a necessity for her now. It is poignant that she does not seem to question her lot.
The last line shows the old woman's real feelings. The fire she refers to is her own life - and it is getting feeble and cold. This suggests that she does not have long left to live: her fire will soon go out.

Italy in 1955 was a very poor country. During World War Two, Italy - ruled by the Fascist Mussolini - had initially fought alongside Nazi Germany. Yet the Italians became increasingly anxious about their role in the war and about Fascism, and in 1943, Mussolini was deposed by Victor Emmanuel III, the king of Italy. Italy then switched sides in the war and supported the British allies, but suffered huge loses in northern towns and villages as the Nazis tried to take revenge. After the war, following a referendum, the monarchy was abolished and a republic was established.

However, the economy was slow to grow, especially in the south, which was less industrialised. With no jobs and no prospects, it was not surprising that many people decided to try their luck in 'rich' America. There was a thriving trade in illegal immigration, encouraged by the dockyard owners, who knew that they could get cheap labour from immigrants until they had paid for their passage over. Once they had paid their fare, the immigrants were left to make their own way.
When Italy joined the new European Economic Community in 1957, much money was pumped into Italy to reduce unemployment. One key part of this process was the establishment of the Fiat factory in Turin: thousands of peasants from the south moved north to make cars. Sadly, this was just too late for Marco and Rodolpho.

A radio programme receiver does not need to be directly in view of the transmitter to receive programme signals. For low frequency radio waves diffraction can allow them to be received behind hills, although repeater stations are often used to improve the quality of the signals.
The lowest frequency radio waves are also reflected from an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere, called the Ionosphere. This means that they can reach receivers that are not in the line of sight because of the curvature of the Earth's surface.

Click 'Next' for some background information on this artist.
Backa Carin was born in 1973 in Uppsala, Sweden. She graduated from Stockholm University College of Arts, Craft and Design in 2000 with a master's degree in fine art and has since worked as a professional artist. Her works have been exhibited internationally and in main galleries in Sweden.
She creates installation pieces in porcelain and stoneware that often blur dreams and reality.
The symbolic signs of dreams are astonishingly general. A lot of people recognise their own dreams when they see my work.
She views her role as an artist as being similar to that of a set designer in that
she engages the viewer to enter the artwork and become part of it
. The installations are often on a large scale and incorporate movement, noise and light.
My desire is to give the viewer an impression of life; the encounter between what is beautiful and horrible, the beauty and destructiveness of love, and the fact that we are immortal until we die.
When I was about to start working on my Master of Fine Art project I had an intense dream. In this dream I was looking at the exhibition of all the MFA students' art projects. The artwork that was most interesting was a long corridor covered with tentacles.
The impression of walking through it was pleasant and at the same time disgusting as the tentacles reached out almost touching your body. When I woke up I realized that the corridor should become my MFA artwork.
The feeling of it, the size, material colour and expression was so real and clear in the dream all that was left for me to do was to make it.
When creating the corridor artwork I tried to stay as close to the dream as possible. So the shape of the tiles had to be organic and skin like. The corridor bent round in my dream so I built walls to reflect this, the corridor had to be the same scale and shape as what I had seen in my dream. Since the material of the tentacles was porcelain in the dream I made several moulds of plaster and then poured porcelain clay in to them. I made around 400 tentacle tiles to create this installation.
The greatest source of inspiration for me is just to keep working. One project leads to another like a chain of happenings. One artwork inspires me to a new one.
My two children give me inspiration in the way that they help me see the building stones in life and how people develop from the very beginning. To see a little person explore life is very interesting and you learn a lot about yourself and humanity.
Other sources of inspiration are my friends around me and the long discussions about everything. Love and death are also really important.
Other artists that have influenced me in no particular order include Eva Hesse, Louise Borgouise, Gerhard Richter, Matthew Barney, Damien Hirst, Paul McCarthy, Mona Hatoum, among others.
For me it is really simple: I can't do anything else. If I could do something else I would choose that. I think that to be an artist, living off what you create, you have to be a special kind of a person. It is not enough that you are talented. You have to be really intense in the creating process. The wish to create has to be stronger than all other wishes.

. The individual fullerene molecules or nanotubes have different properties from the bulk material.
The nanotubes structure allows it to be used as a vessel for transporting a drug into the body. A molecule of the drug can be placed inside the nanotube cage which keeps the drug wrapped up until it reaches the site where it's required. In this way, a dose that might be prohibitively damaging to other parts of the body can be delivered safely to, say, a cancerous tumour.
The structure of nanotubes involves a massive surface area. Spreading a catalyst, atom by atom, on the surface of a nanotube provides a huge surface area where reactants can come into contact with the catalyst.
The examples above might be described as molecular manufacturing or nanotechnology. Building a product molecule by molecule, positioning molecules one at a time or producing nanoscale features by removing matter from a bigger structure may enable us to do things which only a short time ago were undreamed of.

I will not mention many famous doctors like Cassius, Calpetanus, Arruntius and Rubrius. Their annual salaries were a quarter of a million sesterces. When Nero was emperor, people rushed to Thessalus, who overturned all previous theories and when he walked about in public he was followed by as big a crowd as an actor or chariot-driver. Next came Crinas of Massilia, who decided what his patients could eat according to the astrologers' almanacs.
There is no doubt that these doctors, in their hunt to gain fame by means of some new idea, did not hesitate to buy it with our lives. Consequently those wretched quarrelsome consultations at the bedside of patients. Consequently also the gloomy inscription on monuments: ""It was the crowd of doctors that killed me"".
Medicine changes every day and we are swept along on the puffs of the clever brains of the Greeks. People can live without doctors (though not, of course, without medicine). It was not medicine which our ancestors hated, but doctors. They refused to pay fees to profiteers in order to save their lives. Of all the Greek arts, it is only medicine which we serious Romans have not yet practiced.

Pliny felt that medicine was not serious/practical ('...it is only medicine which we serious Romans have not yet practiced.')

They were angry that they had not been allowed to negotiate.
'Deutsche Zeitung', a German newspaper, vowed: ""We will never stop until we win back what we deserve.""
Count Brockdorff-Rantzau, leader of the German delegation at Versailles said Article 231- the war-guilt clause - was: ""a lie"". Germany officially denied the war-guilt clause in 1927.
There was a revolution (the Kapp Putsch) against the treaty in Berlin in 1920.
Germany hated reparations. It had to be made to pay in 1921, defaulted in 1923 and eventually Hitler refused to pay altogether.
Britain gained some German colonies and the German navy was destroyed
Lloyd George thought the treaty was too harsh, saying: ""We shall have to fight another war again in 25 years time.""
The British diplomat Harold Nicolson called it: ""neither just nor wise"" and the people who made it: ""stupid"".
The economist John Maynard Keynes prophesied that reparations would ruin the economy of Europe.
France got Alsace-Lorraine, German colonies, harsh reparations and a tiny German army
Many French people wanted an independent, not a demilitarised, Rhineland.

The fulcrum of a lever does not have to be in the middle. If the fulcrum is nearer to the load, then a large load can be moved with a small effort (travelling a longer distance). If the fulcrum is nearer to the effort, then a small load requires a larger effort (but travelling a shorter distance).
Pulleys are used to transmit rotary movement from one place to another - for example in a display model.
A pulley is a wheel with a groove round the outside to hold a driving belt. Two pulley wheels arranged some way apart can transmit motion over considerable distances.

. Frustrated with the high costs of transporting coal by packhorse from his mines in Worsley to the market in Manchester 11 miles away, Bridgewater decided to look for a method of transport that was cheaper than by road. Bridgewater knew that when he drained his mines there was excess water. He believed that this water could be used to fill a canal, which would provide him with
a cheaper method of transporting his coal to Manchester
where he could sell it more cheaply yet make more profit. He was the only businessman to ever finance the building of a canal alone.

Brindley built a pioneering canal, which included the Barton Aqueduct over the River Irwell, constructed locks to allow the canal to go over hills and used clay puddling to prevent leaks.

This Revision Bite will help you understand why and how a company conducts market research.
Market research is the collection of information or data to better understand what is happening in the market place. A firm's marketing department needs to know about economic trends, as well as consumers' views. Based on this information, they can put together a marketing plan, which will meet their own needs as well as those of their consumers.
There are two general types of research:
Primary research provides new data for a specific purpose
The marketing department of a firm or a specialist research organisation can provide this. Typically, the data is gathered in face-to-face interviews, by telephone, by post or via the internet, using questionnaires. This is called a
. Sometimes potential consumers are asked to test products, and their responses are recorded.
Gathering primary or new data - questionnaires, surveys etc.
has the advantage that the firm itself has control over the whole process. The disadvantages are that it takes longer and is more expensive.
It can be anything from a company's own sales statistics to Department of Trade and Industry reports. Other secondary sources of information include journals, company reports, government statistics, and surveys published by research organisations. Traditionally, these have been paper-based, but more and more information is now available on CD-ROM or on-line through the Internet.
Gathering secondary or existing data - internet, newspapers etc.
has the advantages of being cheaper and quicker than field research. The disadvantages are not knowing if the findings are accurate, or how relevant they will be to your product.
Marketing departments need to have information so they can get their

right. For example, they will want to know what similar products already exist and how much they cost. They will also want to know whether consumers will want to buy their new product, and what they think about it. The process for doing this is as follows:
Now have a look at the process in more detail. If you were a marketing manager, you might do the following things:
Make sure you know what you are trying to find out, and how it will help you. This is something that people sometimes forget. There is an endless amount of information available, so it is important to be focused.
You have to decide which are going to be the best ways to gather this information. Choose the most appropriate reports and journals. Depending on how much time you have, choose what field research you can do. Designing questionnaires and testing products on consumers can take a long time. You also have to decide whether you have the necessary skills, or whether you need to use a specialist research organisation. This is a more expensive option.
You would usually do desk research first, because it is cheaper and quicker. Then supplement this with field research, so that you don't duplicate your findings. Designing the questionnaires and conducting the surveys takes place during this phase.
Now that you have the findings, you have to work out what they are telling you. If you identified your objectives before you started, this should not be too difficult. You must look for
and patterns. Then you should see how this affects your marketing mix. For example, if you were thinking of setting a price for your product of 10 per unit, and 70% of the

think this is too high, then you may need to consider reducing the price. If you don't, you may find that few consumers will buy it. But remember: no survey is perfect. There is always a margin of error.
In market research, what is the difference between desk research and field research? Give two examples of each.
When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page.
Desk research is finding information that already exists, and field research is finding new information. Journals are one type of desk research, and questionnaires are one type of field research.
Dionne's answer was basically correct, but lacked detail. It also looks as if she didn't read the question properly as she only gave one example of each type of research. If the question asks for two reasons then you will have to give two to get full marks.
Desk research is finding information from sources that already exist, such as journals and reports. Field research is finding out new information that you specifically need. This could be through questionnaires or consumers trying out your product.
Garth's answer showed he understood the terms, and his examples were appropriate. He could have included more detail, and would have gained more marks by using business terms in his answer (see Heather's answer).
Desk research is getting data from existing secondary sources, such as journals and reports. Field research is finding out new information about your consumer's needs. This could be through a survey using questionnaires, or getting them to try out your products and recording their opinions.
Heather's answer was very detailed, and she used the correct business terms. She showed that she understood the subject very well. She would get a very good mark.

To enable genes to code for proteins, the bases A, T, G and C get together not in pairs but in triplets. This is how it works:
Each protein is made up of large numbers of amino acid molecules.
Each triplet of bases codes for one particular amino acid.
So amino acids are made in the number and order dictated by the number and order of base triplets.
Finally, the amino acid molecules join together in a long chain to make a protein molecule. The number and sequence of amino acids determines which protein results.

This change needs heat energy from the toaster, and it cannot be reversed.
Eggs and meat are good sources of protein. The protein molecules change shape as a result of the heat energy they absorb. This causes changes in the appearance and texture of the eggs and meat when they are cooked. For example:
Egg white solidifies and becomes white instead of transparent.
Meat becomes firmer and turns from red to brown.

Its worth thinking through all the options before writing definite answers. Once you've seen what all the questions are, you can often work out the answers by elimination.
Think about whether it's a noun, a verb or an adjective that you need - then you can at least narrow down the options.
Or you could narrow the choices down by deciding which words are likely to relate to which story. Synonyms (two or more different words that all have a similar meaning) are often used in this sort of exercise.

Mairad added extra detail where relevant - facilities at school / relationship with teachers etc.
Ideas and opinions that are developed and justified
Mairad said it was a new school and therefore the facilities were first class. This shows development of ideas.
She also said why she likes the school and gave her own opinion.
Read the question carefully. Identify the tenses you will need.
Writing a brief diagram or plan first will help focus your ideas.
Think about material you have prepared for your Presentation / Conversation - is any of it useful here?
Writing each task as a separate paragraph is a good way to organise your answer.

Have you developed the tasks where appropriate by adding some extra information? This will make your answer more varied and interesting.
Have you stuck to the word limit - not gone under and not gone over by too many words?
Have you covered each task? It is a good idea to tick each one off when completed.

Telescopes are devices used to observe the universe. There are many different types and some are even sited in space.
Optical telescopes observe visible light from space. Small ones allow amateurs to view the night sky relatively cheaply but there are very large optical telescopes sited around the world for professional astronomers to use.
Optical telescopes on the ground have some disadvantages:
they can only be used at night
they cannot be used if the weather is poor or cloudy
Radio telescopes detect radio waves coming from space. Although they are usually very large and expensive, these telescopes have an advantage over optical telescopes. They can be used in bad weather because the radio waves are not blocked by clouds as they pass through the atmosphere. Radio telescopes can also be used in the daytime as well as at night.
X-rays are partly blocked by the Earth's atmosphere and so X-ray telescopes need to be at high altitude or flown in balloons.

This is the sort of truth that we can find in pictures, novels or films. We are not saying that what we are looking at, reading or watching is actually true. However, we might say that it is 'true to life'. By this we mean that it is believable - it could happen - although it is not actually true itself.
This is quite straightforward. We can say that we 'know' that something happened in the past even though we were not there and did not see it for ourselves. We know that it happened because we have seen

When people use something, it becomes a resource.
A More Economically Developed Country [MEDC] has high levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the northern hemisphere are MEDCs, eg UK, USA, Canada, Europe. More of the countries in the southern hemisphere are Less Economically Developed Countries [LEDCs].

More of the countries in the southern hemisphere (eg countries in southern Africa, southern Asia and South America) are LEDCs, while more of the countries in the northern hemisphere are More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs].
sometimes have limited access to basic resources such as food and water. People in LEDCs also often have rich natural resources, such as large forests and deep deposits of valuable metals and minerals. To help them out of poverty, LEDCs can extract and sell resources to MEDCs.
This system creates a dependency that has serious implications for the environment. The more resources that MEDCs buy from LEDCs, the more money there is for LEDCs to improve living standards, but the greater the impact on the environment.
A water pump in Lulimba, DR Congo
There is an increasing demand for goods and services from a growing global population, especially those in MEDCs. The world's resources are being used up more quickly. The consumption of resources is spread unequally between MEDCs, who use more resources, and LEDCs, who use less.
Higher energy prices as sources are depleted, eg increase in petrol prices and domestic fuel bills in the UK. This can have the result of leaving the elderly and those on low incomes in fuel poverty.
The gap between rich and poor becomes more evident.
Funding needed for research into alternative energy, and increased costs for exploration and extraction of existing energy sources.
Increased carbon emissions cause global warming with consequences including climate change and sea levels rising due to melting ice caps.
Air pollution from factories as countries industrialise and exploit resources. The economic miracle in China is exploiting resources at a rapid rate and making Chinese cities, such as Beijing, some of the most polluted in the world.
Ecosystems such as rainforests are under threat from exploitation as countries eg Brazil, exploit their resources for development.

There should be a better balance between the consumption of those resources between LEDCs and MEDCs.

A finite resource can only be used once and is in limited supply. For example one day the world's oil could run out.

Sustainable means using something or doing something in a way that minimises damage to the environment and which avoids using up natural resources, eg by using renewable rather than scarce resources.
resource management can help ensure that the use of resources does not cause an imbalance in the environment.

Tourists are able to enjoy areas of natural beauty without requiring over-development that might harm the environment.

When you come across a swelling of the flesh in any part of the body of a patient and your patient is clammy and the swelling comes and goes under the finger, then you must say to your patient: ""It is a tumour of the flesh.

Widespread cutting down of trees for fuel reduces the soils ability to hold water - drying out the ground, triggering
Desertification is the spread of desert conditions in arid regions due to human activities, drought or climate change.
Constructing a dam on a large river may help provide electricity and water to irrigate farmland near the reservoir. However, it may also cause drought downstream by severely reducing the flow of water.
Droughts endanger lives and livelihoods through thirst, hunger (due to crops dying from lack of water) and the spread of disease.
Millions of people died in the 20th century due to severe drought and famines. One of the worst hit areas was the Sahel region of Africa, which covers parts of Eritrea, Ethiopia and the Sudan.
Droughts and famines can have other geographical impacts. If drought forces people to migrate to a new home it could put pressure on resources in neighbouring countries.
Droughts can have a severe impact on MEDCs as well as LEDCs. Droughts have caused deaths in Europe in recent years - especially amongst the elderly. In the UK in summer 2006, there were hose pipe bans and campaigns to make people save water.

How to increase the rate of a reaction
The rate of a reaction increases if:
The concentration of a solution tells us how much of a substance is dissolved in water. Concentration is measured in moles per dm3. The higher the concentration, the more particles of the substance are present.
substances present at the start of a chemical reaction
the pressure of a reacting gas is increased
solid reactants are broken into smaller pieces
A catalyst changes the rate of a chemical reaction without being changed by the reaction itself.
The graph above summarises the differences in the rate of reaction at different temperatures, concentrations and size of pieces. The steeper the line, the greater the rate of reaction. Reactions are usually fastest at the beginning, when the concentration of reactants is greatest. When the line becomes horizontal, the reaction has stopped.

3123,"Decay is an essential life process, which helps to digest food and recycle materials. Bacteria and fungi are the main groups of decomposer. They release enzymes to break down compounds, so that they can absorb the nutrients. We can preserve our food, for example by freezing or canning, to remove the conditions needed for decay to occur.
Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another.
Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
Intensive farming practices include growing high-yield crops, using fertilisers and pesticides and keeping animals indoors. Food production is increased but there are unwelcome side effects.
Organic farming bans chemical inputs and has a less harmful effect on the environment but often produces less, more expensive food.
Hydroponics is the production of food using nutrient-rich solution rather than soil.
Leaves enable photosynthesis to happen. Photosynthesis is the process by which leaves absorb light and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrate (food) for plants to grow. Leaves are adapted to perform their function eg they have a large surface area to absorb sunlight.
Plants use minerals from the soil to build the complex molecules they need to survive and grow. Poor plant growth may be due to a deficiency of one or more minerals. Tests can be done to establish which mineral is deficient or a general purpose NPK fertiliser added.
Plants have two different types of 'transport' tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots.
The element carbon is the present in all living organisms. It's recycled through various processes, which are described in the carbon cycle.
Nitrogen is essential for the formation of amino acids to make proteins. The nitrogen cycle describes the ways in which nitrogen is recycled.
Osmosis is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low water concentration through a partially permeable membrane. Osmosis takes place in all living cells.
Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis through their root hair cells. Plants use water for several vital processes including photosynthesis and transporting minerals.
All substances are made from atoms. Each atom is made of a nucleus - containing protons and neutrons - surrounded by electrons.
The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. The elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in ascending order of atomic number.
The mass number of an atom is the total of protons plus neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and hence different mass numbers) are called isotopes of that element.
A covalent bond is formed between non metal atoms, which combine together by sharing electrons. Covalent compounds have no free electrons and no ions so they don't conduct electricity.
The Periodic Table is an arrangement of the elements in order of atomic number. Elements in the same vertical column are in the same group or family and have similar chemical properties.
Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid using electricity. When ionic compounds are molten or dissolved in water the ions are free to move.
When sulfuric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen is produced at the cathode (negative electrode) and oxygen at the anode (positive electrode). Aluminium is extracted from the mineral bauxite using the process of electrolysis.
All matter is made of atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements, and each one has a symbol. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other.
When atoms of different elements join together they make a compound. Compounds are represented by formulae that show how many atoms of each element are in the compound. Formulae can be worked out from the charge of the ions that make up the compound.
Chemical reactions can be written down as balanced chemical equations.
The Group 1 elements in the Periodic Table are known as the alkali metals. They include lithium, sodium and potassium, which all react vigorously with air and water.
The reactivity of the alkali metals increases down the group. Flame tests are used to identify alkali metal ions in compounds.
The Group 7 elements are also known as the halogens. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, which all have seven electrons in their outer shell.
In a displacement reaction a less reactive element is
Ionic bonding occurs between positive and negative ions, which attract each other and bind together to form ionic compounds. For example, sodium chloride consists of Na
Each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions held in place by electrostatic attraction and forming an ionic crystal lattice. The ions in a crystal lattice are very strongly bonded - a high temperature is required to melt the crystal.
The physical properties of different metals make them useful for different purposes. For example, aluminium conducts heat, which makes it a useful material for making saucepans and gold is shiny, which makes it an attractive material for jewellery.
Metal particles are held together by strong metallic bonds, which is why they have high melting and boiling points. The loose electrons in metals can all move together through the metal  creating an electric current.
The elements in the middle section of the Periodic Table are the transition elements. They're all metals with typical metallic properties eg conducting heat and electricity. They often form coloured compounds.
Transition metal carbonates undergo thermal decomposition - a reaction in which a substance is broken down into at least two other substances by heat.
Transition metal hydroxides are insoluble in water. They can be precipitated out of a transitional metal compound solution using sodium hydroxide solution.

The next step is to write down the
The formula of sodium (and all other metals) is the same as the symbol,

Each of the hydroxides of Group 1 metals has a formula with the metal symbol and OH for hydroxide. So sodium hydroxide has the formula NaOH.
Hydrogen is an element that exists as diatomic molecules, so its formula is H
We can now begin to write the symbol equation:

5243,"Infectious diseases are caused by the transmission of pathogens, which are microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. Pathogens can be transmitted by direct contact - horizontal and vertical transmission - and by indirect contact - vehicle-borne transmission and vector-borne transmission.
Pathogens are microorganisms that cause infectious disease. Bacteria and viruses are the main pathogens.
Bacteria come in many shapes and sizes, but even the largest are only 10 micrometres long (10 millionths of a metre).
Bacteria are living cells and, in favourable conditions, can multiply rapidly. Once inside the body, they release poisons or toxins that make us feel ill.
Hepatitis C virus. DNA are enclosed in a protein coat.
Viruses are many times smaller than bacteria. They are among the smallest organisms known and consist of a fragment of genetic material inside a protective protein coat.
Viruses can only reproduce inside host cells, and they damage the cell when they do this. A virus can get inside a cell and, once there, take over and make hundreds of thousands of copies of itself. Eventually the virus copies fill the whole host cell and burst it open. The viruses are then passed out in the bloodstream, the airways, or by other routes.
Microorganisms can be transmitted in two main ways: direct contact and indirect contact.
Direct contact means that the disease-causing microbe is passed from one person to another when their bodies touch in some way.
happens when microorganisms pass from a mother to her unborn baby through the placenta. German measles and HIV can pass this way.
happens when microorganisms pass from one person to another by touching, kissing or sexual intercourse.
Indirect contact happens when microorganisms are carried to a person in some way, instead of by actual body to body contact.
involves an object carrying the disease-causing microorganism.
involves an animal such as an insect. For example, malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes and plague by fleas.
Most pathogens have to get inside our body to spread infection. Once they are inside, the body provides ideal living conditions - plenty of food, water and warmth. Standing in their way is our body's immune system - the body's co-ordinated response to the invading pathogens.
The first line of defence is the body's natural barriers. These include:
Tiny hairs, which line the respiratory tract. They beat continuously to move mucus and dirt up the bronchi and trachea.
The skin covers the whole body. It protects the body from physical damage, microbe infection and dehydration. Its dry, dead outer cells are difficult for microbes to penetrate, and the sebaceous glands produce oils which help kill microbes.
The respiratory system (or gaseous exchange tract) is protected in several ways. Nasal hairs keep out dust and larger microorganisms. Sticky mucus traps dust and microbes. These are then carried away by cilia, which are tiny hairs on the cells that line the gaseous exchange tract.
Tears, saliva and mucus contain an enzyme called lysozyme. This destroys microorganisms.
If microorganisms get into the body through a cut in the skin, the most important thing is to quickly close the wound so more microorganisms cannot enter. A scab does just this. The blood contains tiny structures called platelets, and a protein called fibrin. A scab is basically platelets stuck in a fibrin mesh. The animation shows how this works.

As a wound heals, nearby blood vessels widen to allow more blood to reach the area. This causes inflammation where the damaged area becomes swollen, hot and red. White blood cells called phagocytes move into the area, and destroy bacteria by engulfing and digesting them.

Pathogens contain certain chemicals that are foreign to the body and are called antigens. White blood cells called lymphocytes carry a specific type of antibody - a protein that has a chemical 'fit' to a certain antigen. When a lymphocyte with the appropriate antibody meets a dangerous foreign body (pathogen containing antigen), the lymphocyte reproduces quickly, and makes many copies of the antibody that neutralises the pathogen.
Antibodies neutralise pathogens in a number of ways:
They bind to pathogens and damage or destroy them.
They coat pathogens, clumping them together so that they are easily ingested by
Cells, such as white blood cells, that engulfs and absorbs waste material, harmful microorganisms, or other foreign bodies in the bloodstream and tissues.
They bind to the pathogens and release chemical signals to attract more phagocytes.
Lymphocytes may also release antitoxins that stick to the appropriate toxin and stop it damaging the body.

Ultraviolet radiation - UV - is found naturally in sunlight. We cannot see or feel ultraviolet radiation, but our skin responds to it by turning darker. This happens as our bodies attempt to reduce the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching deeper skin tissues. Darker skins absorb more ultraviolet light, so less ultraviolet radiation reaches the deeper tissues. This is important, because ultraviolet radiation can cause normal cells to become cancerous.

Nuclear reactors use the heat from nuclear reactions in the nuclear fuel to boil water. Just as in conventional power stations, the steam from the boiling water makes a turbine spin, which in turn makes the generator turn.

3679,"is full of characters who suffer physical or emotional isolation. Shelley deliberately chose settings that would emphasise this, such as the remote vastness of the Arctic Circle, where the story begins and ends.
Walton chooses to isolate himself in this frozen wasteland, yet soon regrets the absence of a true companion on his expedition.
Victor also chooses to isolate himself, firstly at university in Ingolstadt, when he avoids contact with his family to work on the Monster. Later, he neglects Elizabeth (his most loving, unfailing companion) out of fear she will discover his secret. He then chooses the remote Orkney Islands on which to embark on the construction of the second creature, and seems most comfortable when surrounded by the wilderness of vast lakes, towering mountains or wild heathland.
It is no surprise that when Victor meets the Monster for the first time since its creation the setting is high up in the Swiss Alps. Both are drawn to it as a place where they can attempt to escape reminders of what they have done and become. Also,
landscapes such as these overwhelming remind the reader of the characters' insignificance compared with the awesome power of nature.
The Monster is another victim of isolation. Unlike Walton and Victor, it does not bring this upon itself. Indeed, it tries early on to make contact with humans and connect with them, but is always abused, leading to self-imposed isolation in the hovel next to the De Laceys' cottage.
The torment it feels at being excluded from society in general, and loving companionship in particular, is what makes it ask Victor for a mate. When it later witnesses Victor tearing this mate to pieces, it sees a lifetime of isolation ahead and only then commits its most terrible crimes. Shelley's point here is that isolation, whether self-imposed or not, can only bring about unhappiness, a breakdown in civilisation and, ultimately, tragic consequences.

He is twelve years and a few months old. He has an attractive appearance, which suggests that he has an attractive character too.
He is sensible: it was Ralph's idea to have a chief, establish rules and build a signal fire so they can be rescued. He speaks wisely.
He is a good leader. He knows that it's important to keep Jack on his side and speaks to Piggy with the directness of genuine leadership. Later on he feels the weight of being chief as a personal hell - but he doesn't give up.
He wants to hang on to civilised values. When he realises that their lives are full of dirt and decay, he feels a

It is Ralph who approaches the dead airman at the top of the mountain, with leaden steps, while Jack and Roger stay back.
Yet even Ralph sometimes gets carried away with the hunt. Ralph starts the game where they pretend Robert is a pig:

Some of the units used for measuring length
Nanotubes like this could be used to make tiny mechanical devices, molecular computers or extremely strong materials
Nanoparticles range in size from about 100 nm down to about 1 nm. They are typically the size of small molecules and are far too small to see with a microscope.
Nanoparticles are so small that they have different properties than the same substance in normal-sized pieces. For example, pieces of gold are, fairly obviously, gold-coloured. But gold nanoparticles are deep red or even black when mixed with water. Such different properties are very useful.
Titanium dioxide is a white solid used in house paint and certain candy-coated chocolates. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles are so small that they do not reflect visible light, so they cannot be seen. They are used in sunblock creams because they block harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun without appearing white on the skin.
Some cosmetics contain 'liposomes', which are fatty nanoparticles. Liposomes also have great potential in the pharmaceutical industry, as they can deliver tiny doses of medicines direct to cells.
Since the properties of a given nanoparticle are not easily predicted by studying the substance from which it is made, there are worries that nanoparticles may have undiscovered side-effects.
Nanoparticles have a very large surface area compared to their volume, so they are often able to react very quickly. This makes them useful as catalysts to speed up reactions. For example, they can be used in self-cleaning ovens and windows. However, there is also the possibility that they might speed up reactions in living things in unpredictable ways, perhaps causing illness or death.

each image carefully, providing written explanation or annotations.
, images don't just refer to photographs - you can use sketches, drawings, stick men diagrams or any type of image, so long as you use it to
Student example: using an image in the 'Response' phase
This is a still-image of our work when we were
the abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison. We were trying to communicate that the prisoner was being intimidated by two US soldiers, and that this was a harrowing experience for the prisoner.
I feel we should have arranged the image better, so that the proxemics could more easily show what was happening. If the prisoner had been placed facing the audience it would have been easier to see his expression, and if the two soldiers had been placed a little upstage on each side of the prisoner, we could have shown the expressions of everyone - and the face of one soldier character would not have been hidden by their hair.
The prisoner should have looked more intimidated than is shown in the actor's body language - she looked too relaxed to communicate the terror the prisoner must have felt.
The candidate has written well about the image, and has included some evaluative remarks that point out the shortcomings of the group's work. It is clear that the candidate realizes how the work could have been improved, and this demonstrates understanding of the process.
Student example: using an image in the 'Development' phase
Students acting a scene set in Abu Ghraib prison
During the phase of the work when we were
scenes to show the abuse in Abu Ghraib prison, we were working to show how the soldiers were intimidated by their own superior officers, because of the abuse that they were investigating.
We wanted to show how by making the officer stand behind the soldier, with the soldier too scared to turn around, we were able to show the status of the officer.
We could also show the way in which he could signal his feelings to the audience, without the prisoner seeing any facial expressions.
This would also leave the soldier able to show his own anxiety in the situation, through his body language and facial expressions. The actor here was able to signal this well.
Here the image is commented on by the candidate, and it is clear that the proxemics are such that the candidates were able to heighten the sense of anxiety in the scene, and to show this to the audience. The candidate has explained well the reasons for their staging of this sequence.
Student example: using an image in the 'Evaluation' phase
Students acting out a scene set in a care home
This image shows our work at a point when we, the staff in the care home, were taking the old lady away from her room to clean her up after she had spilled her food.
We wanted to show that the staff can be harsh in their treatment of the elderly residents of the home and that they don't treat some of their residents as they state in their brochures.
As it is shown here, the staff members look as if they are not caring, and I think that this would be clear to an audience. I think we were able to show that the old woman looks scared and that the staff look uncaring about her fears.
The girl playing the old lady is showing through her facial expression and body language that she is scared and we planned that the audience would be shocked by this treatment of her.
The comment by the candidate has first been put into context, so that the situation is more understandable. The evaluation and reflection on his / her work illustrates some strong aspects, and others where the candidate feels that improvements could be made. This indicates that the candidate has a good level of knowledge and understanding.

- does your school have a swimming pool, Astroturf pitch, sports hall or tennis courts?
- what sports activity does your school have outside of PE lessons?
- are they positive? Do they have favourite sports? What if your favourite isnt the same as theirs?
- are you introduced to clubs in the area?
Your school's links with local clubs can affect your participation
Role models such as David Beckham, Tanni Grey-Thompson and Kelly Holmes have had a huge influence on participation in recent years.
Women are now accepted as managers, officials and club directors although this was not always the case.
Some sports, such as squash, have declined in popularity whilst womens football and extreme sports are booming. Media coverage of sport affects participation levels. So does the rising concern about safety which has stopped a lot of 'free play' on the streets and in parks.

There are many other references to time, too, such as in Act 3, Scene 2 with Juliet is waiting for the night and the arrival of Romeo. Plus, the whole play covers just a few days, and the pace changes frequently.
Time is also crucial to the plot: the plans for Juliet's marriage are brought forward, the sleeping potion only lasts a certain time, and Romeo kills himself just before Juliet wakes up. Even her death is related to time - she says she will 'be brief'. The audience might well feel the two lovers are racing to their deaths and there is nothing anyone can do to stop this.
There may be other topics you can spot - for instance, the play deals with families and the subjects of loyalty and hatred. It is good to include something about the basic ideas in Romeo and Juliet in your work.

When ultrasound waves reach a boundary between two substances with different densities, they are partly reflected back. The remainder of the ultrasound waves continue to pass through. A detector placed near the source of the ultrasound waves is able to detect the reflected waves. It can measure the time between an ultrasound wave leaving the source and reaching the detector. The further away the boundary, the longer the time between leaving the source and reaching the detector:
distance (metre, m) = speed (metre/second, m/s)  time (second, s)
For example, sound travels through water at about 1,400 m/s. If it takes 0.5 s for a sound to reach a boundary and reflect back to the detector, the total distance travelled is:
The distance to the boundary is half this, which is 350 m.
The distances and times are much smaller of course when scanning babies and in engineering jobs.

Computers are able to create detailed images by combining many ultrasound reflection readings. This is used in medicine for pre-natal scanning - checking unborn babies.
Ultrasound can be used in industry for quality control procedures to check manufactured objects, such as railway tracks and oil pipelines, for damage or defects. The diagram shows how a piece of metal may be tested for cracks or other flaws using ultrasound.

It is important to realise that these arguments are not necessarily true, or what we would say today - they are what people said
The arguments for and against women's suffrage
A woman's place is in the home; going out into the rough world of politics will change her caring nature.
Women already have the vote in local elections.
Many women do not want the vote, and would not use it if they got it.
Some women (eg doctors and mayors) are far better than some men (eg convicts and lunatics) who have the vote.
The vast mass of women are too ignorant of politics to be able to use their vote properly.
Other countries have given women the vote.
If women are given the vote, it will not be the gentle intelligent women who will stand for Parliament, but the violent Suffragettes. Parliament will be ruined.

Make sure that you have a vocabulary book or record that covers each area of experience included in the syllabus.
Build up your personal vocabulary by learning a small number of new words every day.
Get plenty of regular practice. Use past papers. Use this website - both the Revision Bites and the Test Bites. Try to go over your work with someone who can show you how to do better next time.
Make sure you are familiar with different types of task that you might get on an exam paper, eg multiple choice, filling in a grid, matching, gap filling, answering in French, answering in English.
Go over some questions with a friend. It will give you a chance to look at someone else's exam technique. You might learn from each other.
Make sure you are confident with recognising the full range of words that introduce questions, eg
' O?' 'Qui?' 'Comment?' 'Pourquoi?' 'Quand?' 'Que?' 'Quel(le)?' 'Qu'est-ce que?'
Try to find opportunities to read something that interests you in French without the pressure of questions and time limits. For example French magazines, comics, newspapers and internet sites.
You must come to the exam with a clear idea of the strategies that will help you work well under pressure. Here are some suggestions.
Don't panic! You are not expected to understand every word of the text.
Take a positive approach to your reading. Concentrate on what you can understand, not on difficult words and phrases.
Have a good look at the title of the text as well as any illustrations. They may give you some important clues.
Read the whole text before attempting to answer any questions. It is usually better to read the text twice at a brisk pace, than to struggle along once, slowly.
Be clear as to exactly what each question wants. For example: should you give precise details or an overall impression? When you are clear, go back to the text for the words that you need, and ignore the rest.
Be aware of different ways of finding out the meaning of words. For example:
can you guess the meaning of a difficult word in a sentence if you understand what all the other words mean?
can you find similarities between French and English words (eg
can you find links with other French words (eg
are you aware of language patterns (eg
in front of a word often means again:
Use your knowledge of grammar. For example: if you can identify a plural, a verb tense, an adjective, an adverb or a preposition, you will be in a better position to make an intelligent guess at a meaning.
Now decide which strategies will work best for you and practise using them as much as you can between now and the day of the exam. The more you practise them, the more you are likely to remember to use them during the exam itself.
Use your knowledge of France and French-speaking countries. For example, knowing about the French educational system could be very useful if you are working on a text about school.
If you have to write answers in French, be as clear as possible; but remember - you will not be penalised for small mistakes.

This is used to produce very small amounts or specialised electronic products. This might mean producing a single piece of switch gear for a factory machine. Workers in this type of industry need to be highly skilled in a range of different areas and able to work on a number of aspects of the project.
This is the most common type of production in the electronics industry. It involves making a set number of exactly the same product. Some batches will be small, others could be thousands. Batch production might be used to make PCBs for aircraft controls, for example, or control panels for central-heating boilers.In batch production the operation is sub-divided into a number of separate stages, with each stage being completed by different (often computer-controlled) machines. The stages in an PCB batch production process might be:
checking the board, and mounting it into the product
Printed circuit board being checked after manufacture
This is used when very many identical products are required, such as electronic circuits for cars, washing machines and fridges. The products are assembled as they flow along a production line. The operators tend to be semi-skilled.
In-line production plants are very expensive to set up and thousands of products have to be sold to off-set the capital costs. Production is often difficult to plan and breakdowns are costly.
This is where production is heavily automated and runs 24 hours per day. Continuous-flow production is used in oil refining and chemical processing. A considerable amount of electronic control is used in the running and monitoring of these plants.

The development of railways during the 19th century happened because of the work of three main engineers. We have already mentioned Richard Trevithick and George Stephenson, but Isambard Kingdom Brunel also played a key role.

(GWR) in 1833. The railway line linked the towns of London and Bristol and was often referred to as ""God's Wonderful Railway"" because the route was so smooth and it was a perfect example of railway engineering.
The line was so successful that it was later extended to connect to Plymouth and Cornwall. Brunel used his considerable skills on the route and
built the Tamar Bridge and Box Tunnel
One of the reasons why Brunel's railway routes and tracks were so smooth is because, unlike George Stephenson,
he used a gauge of 7 feet 3 inches
. He believed that this gauge was not only the safest, but would allow trains to travel faster and give the passengers more comfort. Unfortunately, 92 per cent of the railway tracks in Britain had already been built at Stephenson's gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches. This led to
the Gauge Act being passed in 1846
, which stated that all train tracks had to be built to George Stephenson's gauge width. Isambard Kingdom Brunel had

She imagines the words colouring 'the clean squares' (line 13) of the hospital. Decide whether you think the coloured words would deface the hospital's clean walls, or give them new life and vibrancy.
'The wild tender circles' perhaps refer to the waves of contractions in the lead-up to the birth. Contractions get closer and closer together as moment of birth nears, as the circles of ripples on a pond are closest to the point where a stone is dropped in. The mother and child shouted (line 16). Was this in pain or joy? Or perhaps both?
Both Clarke and Catrin were changed (line 20) by the birth: Clarke became a mother, someone upon whom a tiny baby depended; Catrin became a child, still dependent upon her mother - but less so than she had been in the womb. However, in some ways nothing changed, because the fight continues: Still I am fighting / You off (line 20).
Catrin has asked to 'skate / In the dark' (line 29). This illustrates Catrin's growing independence, yet perhaps contains other layers of meaning. One student quoted on Gillian Clarke's website points out that In the dark may mean that there are still things that the mother and child have yet to find out about each other; another interpretation suggests it refers to the darkness of the womb.

, with an increased demand for American goods and rapid industrial growth. Why was there a boom and how did it affect society?
America was in a fortunate position as the First World War ended. The war had
directly damaged American society and it had led to increased demand for American goods. This resulted in the rapid growth of industry and farming. The economy grew even faster when the war ended.
The keys to America's economic boom were
. Businesses began to make huge profits.
Industrial production virtually doubled in the 1920s.
America's gross national product (GNP) grew from $78 billion to $103 billion.
The number of households with a radio rose from 60,000 to 10 million.
The number of people filing income tax returns for earnings of more than $1 million a year rose from 65 to 513.
The number of airline passengers grew from less than 6000 in 1926, to approximately 173,000 in 1929.
The economic boom affected society. Jobs were easy to find and were better paid than before. There was a
between prosperity and social change. For example, as middle-class women became better off they enjoyed greater social freedom - they wore make-up, shorter skirts and smoked in public.
(automobiles) grew rapidly. As the cars poured off the production lines there was a need for more rubber to make tyres, glass for windscreens and leather for seats. The man behind the rise of the motor industry was Henry Ford.
- the republican government under President Harding (1921-3) and President Coolidge (1923-9) kept out of foreign affairs, and limited foreign competition by imposing high import tariffs.
- especially in the electrical, chemicals and film industries.
- allowed people to purchase new gadgets such as vacuum cleaners, washing machines and refrigerators. Borrowing increased the amount of money available to spend, and, therefore, the demand for goods.
- firms learned to raise money for expansion by selling shares on the Stock Exchange - this was to cause problems later.

Ford's River Rouge plant in Detroit, Michigan became the largest factory in the world.
. A new Model T Ford cost less than $300 in the mid-1920s.
By 1929, more than 26 million cars were registered in the USA.
During the 1920s, about $1 billion a year was spent on the construction of a national network of highways.
The automobile industry also caused other industries such as steel, rubber, leather and paint to grow rapidly.
Think about this question: Why did the automobile industry have such a big impact on the growth of the American economy?
Now draw a diagram with a Model T Ford at the centre. Use arrows coming from the diagram to show how cars needed other materials such as glass and rubber and so these other industries would also start to grow. Then add other ideas to to your diagram to show the growth of things like roads, hotels and holiday resorts. Finally, add pictures to your diagram to show how Ford's ideas could have been used in other industries. Remember the production line and conveyor belt!

The earliest railways to exist in Britain were operated in mining towns where
wagons would run along a simple track
and a rigged up pulley system would be used to pull heavy raw materials such as coal and iron out of the mines. It is estimated that by the early 18th century, there were almost 300 wooden tracks in Tyne alone along which wagons were pulled.

James Watt invented a stationary system called
in 1781, which could haul wagons along a track more efficiently.
that linked Croydon and Wandsworth. It was the first line to be used to carry passengers as well as heavy goods.
No one knew how to build efficient and fast railways properly.
The navvies who were asked to build early railways were often seen as loutish drunkards.
Financing early railways was also difficult because banks were not sure if they would be successful.
Not only were there problems with early railways, but people also objected to the idea of railways for a number of reasons.
The main reasons people objected to the construction of railways were:
Parliament did not like passing Acts of Parliament for railways
because they were worried that the new fast speeds of trains would cause health problems for passengers.
Farmers and landowners did not like the idea of new railway tracks passing through their farm land
because they believed that the smoke would destroy crops and scare their animals into giving birth prematurely or dying.
at the idea of new railway tracks because they believed that it would hinder fox-hunting.
Some people did not like the idea of
men and women travelling in the same train carriage
by railway companies, but failed to do everything they could to try to prevent them from stealing their businesses.
Examiners will often ask why early railways started in coal mines. Use this Revision Bite to make a list of the reasons why coal mines were the most logical place for railways to be built.

When saved as a GIF using 32 colours, the image is quite patchy and some of the colours are missing. It also has a much larger file size - this time it's11kb.
GIF - Graphics Interchange Format (pronounced 'giff')
Like the JPG, the GIF file format is commonly used on the web. It is ideal for images that have

The table below shows a logo graphic that has been saved both as a GIF and as a JPG.

For everything to run smoothly, a timetable has to be drawn up and preparations have to be made before the candidates arrive:
: The Human Resources manager checks the layout of the room and reminds the rest of the interview panel that they have a meeting at 10:15 am.
: The candidates arrive and take a

to see if they are suitable for the post. They are shown around the business and then given refreshments.
: The interview panel meet. They study the personality test results and look at each candidate's CV. They also look at the person specification to get a clear picture of what they want in a candidate. They may discuss the questions they will ask.
: The interviews begin. The interviewers will be looking for good answers, and will notice the candidates' attitude, the way they dress and their body language.
: At the end of the interviews the panel will discuss the performance of the candidates. The job will be offered to a suitable candidate. This is usually subject to references being satisfactory.
: The job offer has been made. Now references are requested.
Your body can betray what your feelings are at an interview. Different candidates will give different impressions to the interview panel by the way they behave in an interview. Here are a few examples:
A person who sits with their arms and legs crossed and their head down. No eye contact with the interview panel
A person who slouches in their seat, with their legs outstretched, their hands in their pockets, looking out of window.
Sitting straight up in seat, arms resting in lap, looking straight at interviewer (eye contact) and smiling.

Interviews are scary because they ask you lots of questions. You have to get dressed up for them and you can get vey nervous. When you're in the room you have to concentrate and answer the questions the best you can. You must be polite. Each person will take it in turns to be interviewed and at the end you find out who has got the job. You might have to take a test too.
Anthony talks about the interview in a descriptive way. He describes what might happen and how a candidate might behave. However, he has not really addressed the actual question which asks for advantages and disadvantages of interviewing. He needs to relate what he says to the exam question.
For example, he says that interviews are scary because they ask you lots of questions. To answer the question in more detail he could add an explanation of this, for example, a disadvantage of an interview is that it makes people nervous.
He could also add something about how when you are nervous you don't act naturally and the interviewer will not be seeing you at your best.
Anthony could also improve his answer by including other ways of selecting staff and saying whether these might be better or worse than interviews, eg taking on someone from an agency or employing a friend.
The bad thing about interviews is that people get very nervous and that means that the interviewer might not be seeing what they are really like. People sometimes prepare themselves for an interview so again you are not seeing what they're really like. I think it would be better to get them to work for you on a trial basis so you can get to know them and you can see what they can do. Also the people being interviewed might be feeling ill on the day. On the plus side an interview does let you compare people directly because you see them in the same conditions and can ask the same questions. You also see how they act when they are under pressure.
Gemma has answered the question by clearly stating the advantages and disadvantages. Her answer would gain more marks. She could improve her mark even further by writing about how aptitude tests, group tasks and individual tasks can help select new employees.

Bad use of a dictionary can lead to confusion and mistakes.

Don't get into the habit of looking up lots of words just to feel safe - practise doing without a dictionary. For instance when you are doing practice questions in reading, try answering without a dictionary, then look up any words you didn't know afterwards.

Protect the environment - keep to footpaths, don't leave litter or start fires.
Don't interfer with wildlife - don't scare or feed the animals.
Protect resources - don't take too many showers or use air conditioning.
Support local communities - stay in locally owned accommodation and buy produce from local people.
Eat local food and drink - avoid products that have been imported from MEDCs.
Respect local customs and traditions - some communities are offended when tourists wear inappropriate clothes in religious places, strip off on the beach or behave in a rowdy manner. Locals appreciate tourists who try to learn the language and show an interest in their culture.

It provides income to local councils through taxation.
Good communications are needed for transporting the products of quarrying. As a result many remote rural areas benefit from improved access.

2709,"Different parts of your project will need to be written in different styles. For example, you might be asked to design a leaflet for primary school children or write a letter to the owner of a local business. It's important to tailor your writing style to these different audiences.
Most of us switch from formal to informal style when we speak to people, without even thinking. For example, you need to ask different people for a pen. You'd probably say something fairly informal to your friend, but be more formal when speaking to your teacher, and even more formal if you approached a stranger. You might say:
'Got a pen I can borrow? Cheers.'
'Sir, please can I borrow a pen? Thanks.'
'Excuse me, have you got a pen I could borrow? Thank you.'
So, you approach people differently depending on how well you know them and their age group. Generally, we're more down-to-earth and chatty when we know someone well, especially if they are our own age.
It's the same in writing. However, a slightly more formal tone is usually taken in any type of writing. If you're writing for a young audience, think about a more informal style.

A summary is a short version of a long piece of text. Just the important information needs to be included.
When carrying out research, you'll find that you want to make notes about things you have read in books, magazines and newspapers, or seen on the internet. Instead of keeping copies of everything you read, you'll need to summarise the information.
There are different ways that information can be formatted to help you summarise information: bullet points, charts and graphs and tables.
Bullet points are used when you need to make a list of points or want to highlight key issues. Here's an example:

Tables are great for organising information. It's often easier to understand information set out in a table rather than written in a long piece of text.

Finally, the bargain of the month is the SaverStick MLP 700 which stores up to 4GB and available at only 29.99.
Now see how much easier it is to understand all the information when it's displayed in a table.
Charts are often used to display a lot of numerical information. Charts can make statistics easier to understand and will give your report more impact.
Many different types of charts can be used to present information clearly. For example,

Elizabeth tells Jane about Darcy's proposal and the truth about Wickham. As he's leaving anyway, they decide not to tell anyone. Jane still misses Bingley.
Mrs Bennet and the younger daughters want to go to Brighton, but Mr Bennet says 'no'. Lydia is invited by a friend. Mr Bennet allows it, saying no one will be interested in her because she has no money. Elizabeth pleads for the family to be seen with dignity. She sees Wickham and tells him she now appreciates Darcy more after seeing him recently. Wickham says Darcy is still proud.
We find out about the Bennets' own marriage. Mr Bennet fell for his wife's looks, although his feelings for her soon wore off after marriage. This, along with the Collins marriage, teaches Elizabeth a lesson.
She was going to the Lake District with the Gardiners, but the plans change and they only go as far north as Derbyshire. Mrs Gardiner suggests a visit to Darcy's estate, Pemberley, and Elizabeth agrees, as Darcy is away.

5202,"Wilfred Owen mounts a powerful argument against the complacency of those who believe war to be a glorious patriotic duty.
The opening of the poem suggests Owen pities the state to which the soldiers have fallen. Instead of youthful, strong fighters they are 'Bent double', 'Knock-kneed, coughing like hags'. Owen's imagery presents the men as prematurely old and weakened. War has broken these men, and they are described in the most unglamorous, inglorious manner. Owen's bitterness at this transformation is obvious.
Owen's disillusionment with war is also clear from the closing lines of the poem. After describing the horrifying effects of the gas attack he addresses the reader:
'My friend, you would not tell with such high zest To children ardent for some desperate glory, The old Lie'
He is rejecting the accepted attitude back at home that serving your country in war is glorious. He is critical of the 'high zest', or great enthusiasm, used to convince men to go to war. He sees war as brutal and wasteful of young lives. His choice of the word 'children' is also significant; impressionable young men are almost lured to war by the promise of 'desperate glory'.

Food risk and benefit (Ideas about science)
We do not have enough evidence to say for certain how great the risk is for certain actions. For example, the data that we have to link aspartame with cancer comes only from research on laboratory animals. We cannot use this data to predict with certainty how safe it is for humans to eat food containing aspartame.
The precautionary principle means that when there is not enough evidence to assess fully the risk of an action, but it is possible that it may turn out to have a high risk, it is better to avoid the action. This can be summed up as it is better to be safe than sorry.
It is up to each person to assess whether they should apply the precautionary principle to a particular action, such as eating food containing aspartame.

Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.

There are vessels from the heart to every limb. When any physician, priest of Sekhmet or exorcist puts his hands or his fingers to the head, hands, stomach, arms or feet, then he examines the heart, because all the limbs possess its vessels; the heart speaks out of the vessels of every limb.
There are four vessels in his nostrils, two give mucus and two give blood.
There are four vessels in the forehead which then give blood to the eyes; all diseases of the eyes arise through them.
There are four vessels to the head which produce a bald spot and loss of hair.

There are four vessels to the liver; it is they which give to it liquid and air, which afterwards cause all diseases to arise in it by overfilling with blood.

The satellite orbits just 700km above the ground, and takes about two hours to complete each orbit of 45 000km. Thats more than ten times faster than the fastest commercial airliner on Earth.
There are several cameras on board to record the Earth. One of these cameras records radiation in three different parts of the visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, shown as blue bands in the diagram:
The information from the different ranges of wavelength recorded by the cameras are transmitted to Earth as digital signals, using
. The microwave beam spreads out a little when it leaves the satellite aerial just as all waves do when they go through a gap, but the digital signal reaching the Earth still contains all the information. The signals for different wavelengths are combined together to give the beautiful images that we are used to seeing from satellites. The colours in these images are not true colours, as the wavelengths being combined are not the ones to which our eyes are sensitive, but they show all the detail needed to look at the use of land, the effect of global warming on sea levels and temperatures, the amount of cloud cover and its effect on weather.

Visible light recorded by the satellite cameras is sunlight that has been reflected by the land, sea or clouds. Long wavelength infrared is given off by warm objects.

Human gestation is around 40 weeks although infants can survive if born earlier than this. Other mammals have different gestation times depending on their size, the number of offspring and how independent they are when born. Large animals with a small number of independent offspring have the longest gestation.
When humans are born, their heads are relatively large, and their legs relatively short. Through childhood their bodies grow faster than their heads until they reach maturity. To check that development is happening at normal rates, infants regularly have their mass and head circumference measured.

Here are the teacher's comments. The teacher is looking for answers in simple sentences that make sense and give all the information asked for.
How you come to school in the morning
If you like the school and why
T m ar Scoil Mhuire in Ard Mhacha.
Orla gave the name of a school in Irish and a place name in Irish. Make sure you know how to spell your school name correctly.
It is important to use this structure when saying which type of school you attend.
Is maith liom Mata ach is fearr liom Spinnis mar t s furasta.
Orla knew how to spell her subjects and she also gave an opinion - this is important.
Tagaim ar scoil sa bhus gach maidin.
Orla used the correct tense of the verb tar - to come.
Is bre liom an scoil mar t mo chairde uilig anseo.
Orla used a nice phrase to describe how she felt about school and she gave a good reason to justify her point of view.
Read the question very carefully. Make sure you understand everything you are being asked to do.
Think back to your oral preparation or work done previously in class. Is any of it useful here?
Does it make sense? Is it clear and simple? Are the tenses used the correct ones? Have you given an opinion or a point of view?
Have you covered every task asked for? It is a good idea to tick each one off when completed.

of freedom and change, but as the 1956 uprising in Hungary proved, this was not to be the case.
1. The death of Stalin led many Hungarians to hope that Hungary also would be 'de-Stalinised'. In July 1956, the 'Stalinist' Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party, Rakosi, fell from power.
2. During October 1956, students, workers and soldiers in Hungary attacked the AVH (the secret police) and Russian soldiers, and smashed a statue of Stalin.
3. On 24 October 1956 Imre Nagy - a moderate and a westerniser - took over as prime minister.
4. Nagy asked Khrushchev to move the Russian troops out. Khrushchev agreed and on 28 October 1956, the Russian army pulled out of Budapest.
5. For five days, there was freedom in Hungary. The new Hungarian government introduced democracy, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion. Cardinal Mindzenty, the leader of the Catholic Church, was freed from prison.
6. Then, on 3 November 1956, Nagy announced that Hungary was going to leave the Warsaw Pact. However, Khrushchev was not going to allow this. He claimed he had received a letter from Hungarian Communist leaders asking for his help.
7. At dawn on 4 November 1956, 1,000 Russian tanks rolled into Budapest. They destroyed the Hungarian army and captured Hungarian Radio the last words broadcast were ""Help! Help! Help!"".
8. Hungarian people - even children - fought the Russian troops with machine guns. Some 4,000 Hungarians were killed.
9. Khrushchev put in Russian supporter, Janos Kadar, as prime minister.

5486,"This Revision Bite is about how people communicate with each other in a business setting.
It will help you understand why communication is such an important issue and examines various methods of getting a message across in different situations.
Communicating means passing on information, or receiving it from somebody else. Imagine the problems that could occur if this is not done carefully. Here are some examples of what might go wrong:
Delivering the wrong items to a customer.
Delivering correspondence on the wrong date or to the wrong address.
Management using incorrect data when making decisions.
Some methods of passing on information involve writing it down. Other methods use the spoken word (sometimes known as
). The method you choose depends upon:
Whether you need to keep a written record, eg a receipt proves a bill has been paid
Whether speed is important, eg oral communication is often quickest
Who will receive the information, eg a customer would not be happy with a scribbled note; it would be better to send a letter
Whether the message is for somebody inside the organisation or for someone outside, eg a memo is only used inside the organisation
Read through this example of a memo written about a change of venue for a meeting. Then make a note of the

It is only used within a business and so there is no need for a full external address to be shown. However, you might need to show an internal office address, eg room number and building.
Notice that there are usually just spaces for the names of the person sending and the person receiving the memo. However, copies might be sent to other people in the company for reference.
The subject is clear from the heading and the text is brief.
There is no formal signature. Sometimes the originator will sign their name freehand at the bottom.
Read through this example of a formal letter written about an order of goods. Then make a note of the formal letter checklist below:

1228,"To put Romeo and Juliet into perspective, you will need to know a bit about William Shakespeare, the origins of the story, and its influence today.
William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564. His father sold gloves and became an important person in the town. William, one of eight children, was the eldest son, and probably educated at the local grammar school. He married when he was only 18 and his wife, Anne Hathaway, was eight years older than him. They had two girls and a boy (who died aged 11).
Nobody knows how Shakespeare began to write, or when he entered the theatre. But we know he became a leading member of the theatre troupe known as 'The Lord Chamberlain's Men'. The company proved very popular, and later, when King James I granted it the right to perform at his court, became known as 'The King's Men'.
Shakespeare wrote more than 30 plays for 'The King's Men', making it the most important theatre company in the country. He often wrote parts for particular actors, too.
He was very successful and wealthy in his time, and his work has remained very popular ever since.
The basic story, of two young lovers from opposing families in Italy, had been popular for hundreds of years before Shakespeare wrote the play. However, there is no evidence Romeo or Juliet ever actually existed. We think Shakespeare based the play on a poem he had read.
special is how Shakespeare tells the story. It has become perhaps his best-known play.
has been filmed many times and adapted in all sorts of ways. For instance, there are cartoon versions for children, older versions with the rude jokes taken out, and others set with gang fights in the US.
in songs, books, even in ordinary conversation. For instance, a young lad who goes out with lots of girls is often referred to as a real 'Romeo', even if he is actually called Wayne and lives in Nottingham with his mum.
The play also contains a lot of expressions that Shakespeare invented and are still in use today, such as 'on a wild goose chase' or 'fool's paradise'. More recently, builders have started to use the term 'Juliet balcony' (although many of them now spell it 'Juliette balcony'). This is very shallow balcony with a rail in front of a patio door. Oddly enough, there's no mention of a balcony in the play itself. But it has become traditional to have Juliet talking to Romeo from one.

7563,"Relays are a special type of switch which is turned on and off by an electromagnet. Below is a diagram of a simple relay. When a current flows through the coil an electro-magnetic field is set up. The field attracts an iron armature, whose other end pushes the contacts together, completing the circuit. When the current is switched off, the contacts open again, switching the circuit off.
A useful property of relays is that the circuit powering the coil is completely separate from the circuit switched on by the relay. For this reason relays are often used where a safe low-voltage circuit is being used to control a high-voltage circuit. The symbol for a relay makes the separation of the two circuits clear by separating the coil symbol from the switch symbol:
The relays used in schools generally a have voltage between 6V and 15V. When using a diode with a relay, be sure that it is connected across the poles (terminals) of the relay to prevent damage to the transistor from back EMF generated when the relay coil switches off.

4409,"Source analysis - death of Charles II based on Scarburgh's description
The 'cures' tried by Charles II's doctors after he had had a mild stroke - which he might have recovered from quickly today - certainly hastened his death. The following is a modern description of the treatment of Charles II, summarised from a description written by his chief physician, Sir Charles Scarburgh:
When Charles II of England lay dying from a convulsion which attacked him while shaving, the medicos of that day left no stone unturned in helping him along to the Great Beyond. First, he was bled of a pint of blood. Then his shoulder was cut and eight ounces more of blood was extracted by cupping.
Then followed an emetic, a purgative and another purgative. Next, an enema in which they used antimony, sacred bitters, rock salt, mallow leaves, violet, beet root, camomile flowers, fennel seed, linseed, cinnamon, cardamom seed, saffron, cochineal and aloes. This enema was repeated. In two hours, another purgative was given.
The King's scalp was then shaved, and a blister raised on it. They gave him next sneezing powder of hellebore root; they sought to strengthen his brain by giving him powder of cowslip flowers. Purgatives were frequently repeated. He was given drinks of barley water, licorice, sweet almonds, white wine, absinthe, anise seed, extracts of thistles, rue, mint and angelica. When these did not cure him, they gave him a poultice of burgundy pitch and pigeon dung, to be applied to his feet. More bleeding, more purging; they added melon seeds, manna, slippery elm, black cherry water, extracts of flower of lime, lily of the valley, peony, lavender and dissolved pearls. When these did not do the trick, they went at it with gentian root, nutmeg, quinine and cloves. When this failed, he was given forty drops of extract of human skull. Then they forced down his throat a rallying dose of herbs and animal extracts. Then some powdered bezoar stone.
Alas, after an ill fated night His Serene Majesty was so exhausted that all the physicians became despondent. And so, more active cordials, and finally pearl julep [a heart tonic] and ammonia, were forced down the royal patient's throat. Then he died.

Once Gerald has left to go for a walk and get over the news of Daisy's death, Inspector Goole shows a photograph to Mrs Birling. She grudgingly admits that she had seen the girl two weeks previously, when the girl - now pregnant - had come to ask for financial assistance from the Brumley Women's Charity Organisation.
Mrs Birling was the chairwoman and persuaded the committee to turn down the girl's appeal on the grounds that she had the impudence to call herself Mrs Birling and because she believed that the father of the child should bear the responsibility. She says the girl refused to let the father of the child support her because she believed money he had given her previously to be stolen, yet Mrs Birling is proud of refusing the girl aid. She claims that she did her duty and sees no reason at all why she should take any blame for the girl's death.

A temperature of 6 degrees below zero is 6.
If your bank account is 100 overdrawn, then your balance is 100.

You need to be able to work out rises and falls in temperature using negative numbers.
A number line can help us to understand changes in temperature. For example, if the overnight temperature fell to 4C, and by midday it had risen to 7C, then, counting from 4 up to 7 on the number line,
the temperature has gone up by 11C.
At 6pm, the temperature was 3C. By midnight, it had dropped to 5C. How great was the fall in temperature?
If so, well done. You counted down 3, then another 5, to get 8.
If you had problems, look at the number line.
Counting down from 3 to -5 on the number line, we get 8 degrees.
At 7am, Joe recorded the temperature in his garden as being 4C. He went back out outside at 1pm and found that the temperature had increased by 12C. What was the temperature at 1pm?
Starting at 4 and counting up 12, we get to 8.
At 6pm, the outside temperature was 7C. By 6am, the temperature had dropped by 13C. What was the temperature at 6am?
If so, well done. You counted down 13 from 7.
If you had problems, look at the number line:
Starting at 7 and counting down by 13 on the number line, we get to 6. So the temperature at 6am was -6C.
Here is a table showing temperatures in cities worldwide:
You could be asked to find the difference in temperature between two cities, eg, Moscow and London.
Starting at 9, we count up 14 to get to 5. So the difference in temperatures is 14C.
What is the difference in temperature between Moscow and Oslo?
If so, well done. You started at -9 and counted up 4 to get to 5.
If you had problems, look at the number line:
Starting at 9 and counting up to 5, we get 4. So the difference in temperature is 4C.
To do algebra (especially graphs), you will need to know some basic facts about adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing with negative numbers.
a negative number is the same as subtracting:
eg 7 + (3) is the same as 7  3 = 4
a negative number is the same as adding:
eg (5)  (2) is the same as (5) + 2 = 3
? If you had problems, remember that 4  (3) is the same as 4 + 3 = 7
If you had problems, remember that 5 + (-8) is the same as 5  8 = 3

you need some background on the writer himself and his experiences during World War Two. It's also useful to do some thinking about the 'desert island' as it has appeared in earlier stories.
William Golding was born in 1911. After leaving Oxford University, he worked as an actor, producer and writer, and then as a teacher in a boy's public school.
During World War 2 Golding was lieutenant in the Royal Navy, in command of a small rocket ship. While carrying out his duties he ordered the destruction of German ships and submarines and he shelled German troops from sea during the D-Day landings.
US soldiers in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp
Golding was horrified by what war revealed about people's capacity to harm their fellow humans. He was appalled by what happened in the Nazi concentration camps, and by the way the Japanese mistreated their prisoners. He was appalled too by the consequences of the British and American mass bombing against civilians - and even by what he himself did as a naval officer.
During the war the British justified all the destruction they wrought on the grounds that they had 'right' on their side, but Golding came to question this smug assumption. He gradually learned to see all human nature as savage and unforgiving: he knew that even the 'goodies' can become 'baddies'. In the novel Ralph and Piggy get as involved in the dance that leads to the killing of Simon as Jack and his tribe are.
World War 2 ended in 1945. The United Nations was set up after the war to try to ensure that a global conflict never happened again, but in 1954, when
was published, the threat of a nuclear war was still very real. It was entirely plausible to the novel's original audience that an atom bomb really could destroy civilisation.
Most imaginary desert islands are peaceful paradises where the shipwrecked traveller manages to continue living pretty much as before - think of
by RM Ballantyne, published in 1857, 100 years before Golding's book, three young British boys are shipwrecked on a desert island and have to survive without any adults. Brave and resourceful, they thoroughly enjoy their experience and there is never a hint of trouble. As one of the characters, Peterkin, says,
There was indeed no note of discord whatever in that symphony we played together on that sweet coral island.
From his experience as a teacher, Golding knew that the idyllic life of
could never exist in real life. So, he set out to write a novel that showed his ideas about the darker side of human nature starting from the same basis: boys stranded on a desert island, away from all civilising influences.
The island plays an important part in the novel. We see it first as a paradise - it is a place of 'enchantment', where 'flower and fruit grew together on the same tree.' Yet it is also full of dangers.
The table lists some of the things the boys find on their island, with descriptions that suggest either an island paradise - or something more frightening or sinister. You can probably think of other aspects of the island that at first seem welcoming, but turn out to be the opposite (print out the table and add more examples if you can...).
""The white surf flicked the coral reef.""
""...the long, grinding roar of the breakers on the beach ""
""The water was warmer than [Ralph's] blood and he might have been swimming in a huge bath.""
""They were now used to stomach-aches and a sort of chronic diarrhoea.""
""Inside [the lagoon] was peacock water, rocks and weed showing as in an aquarium.""
""The swell... seemed like the breathing of some stupendous creature.""
The boys are initially excited about being in such an apparently perfect place, just as they are excited about being away from adults. Yet they gradually find out that the island is dangerous, just as they find that life without adults and civilisation is dangerous.

If you are asked to give the solution to an equation to a given number of decimal places (d.p.) or significant figures (s.f.), you can be sure there is no exact solution. In this case, you might be asked to solve it through a method of trial and improvement. The question should indicate the degree of accuracy required (1 d.p., 2 s.f. etc).
Have a look at the example below:
An equation such as x + x = 50 does not have an exact solution: the answer is a decimal number. Find the answer correct to 1 decimal place.
We are looking for a number which, when you cube it and add the number itself, you get the answer 50. One way to do this is to use trial and improvement. Start with a guess, then keep on guessing, trying to get closer to the right answer.
3  3  3 + 3 = 27 + 3 = 30 - too small
4  4  4 + 4 = 64 + 4 = 68 - too big
We now know that the answer lies between 3 and 4.
3.5  3.5  3.5 + 3.5 = 42.875 + 3.5 = 46.375 - too small
We now know that the answer lies between 3.5 and 4.
3.6  3.6  3.6 + 3.6 = 46.656 + 3.6 = 50.256 - too big
We now know that the answer lies between 3.5 and 3.6. But it must be closer to 3.6, so the answer is x = 3.6 correct to 1 decimal place.
Have a go at this one. You will need to have a calculator handy.
Solve the equation y + 2y = 40, correct to 1 decimal place.
5  5 + 2  5 = 25 + 10 = 35 - too small!
6  6 + 2  6 = 36 + 12 = 48 - too big!
So the answer lies between 5 and 6.
5.5  5.5 + 2  5.5 = 30.25 + 11 = 41.25 - too big!
5.4  5.4 + 2  5.4 = 29.16 + 10.8 = 39.96 - too small!

Does Source A criticise or support the New Deal?
At first glance, the cartoon could be mistaken for criticising Roosevelt and the New Deal. It looks like Roosevelt is rescuing another person from the sea of Depression and pulling him into his National Recovery boat. Many New Deal critics were opposed to the cost of the New Deal to the American taxpayer.
However, the cartoon is actually criticising the US Supreme Court - the caption gives it away - Roosevelt is saying: ""I'm sorry but the Supreme Court says I must chuck you back again"", and he is shown to be pushing the man's head down. This is because the Supreme Court did not agree with many of Roosevelt's New Deal proposals and, therefore, did not pass them.
This cartoon sympathises with Roosevelt as it shows him unwillingly pushing away the man who needs saving.

Objects fall faster until they reach their terminal speed, which is reached when the upward (air resistance) and downward (weight) forces are equal.
When an object is dropped it gets faster and faster as it falls. This happens because their weight (the force of gravity) pulls them down towards the centre of the Earth.

Many polymers, such as poly(ethene), contain long molecules that lie side by side. These can uncoil and slide past each other, making the material flexible.
Long polymer chains have stronger forces of attraction than shorter ones. By making the chains of a polymer longer, a stronger and less flexible material is produced.
Plasticisers are small molecules that can be added to polymers during their manufacture. They push the polymer molecules slightly further apart, weakening the forces between them and making the material softer and more flexible.

6765,"Crude oil is a mixture of compounds called hydrocarbons. Many useful materials can be produced from crude oil. It can be separated into different fractions using fractional distillation, and some of these can be used as fuels. Unfortunately, there are environmental consequences when fossil fuels such as crude oil and its products are used.
Most of the compounds in crude oil are hydrocarbons. This means that they only contain hydrogen and carbon atoms, joined together by chemical bonds. There are different types of hydrocarbon, but most of the ones in crude oil are alkanes.
The alkanes are a family of hydrocarbons that share the same general formula. This is:
The general formula means that the number of hydrogen atoms in an alkane is double the number of carbon atoms, plus two. For example, methane is CH
. Alkane molecules can be represented by displayed formulae in which each atom is shown as its symbol (
) and the chemical bonds between them by a straight line.
Notice that the molecular models on the right show that the bonds are not really at 90.
Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons. This means that their carbon atoms are joined to each other by single bonds. This makes them relatively unreactive, apart from their reaction with oxygen in the air, which we call burning or combustion.
Boiling point and state at room temperature
Hydrocarbons have different boiling points, and can be either solid, liquid or gas at room temperature:
Small hydrocarbons with only a few carbon atoms have low boiling points and are gases.
Hydrocarbons with between five and 12 carbon atoms are usually liquids.
Large hydrocarbons with many carbon atoms have high boiling points and are solids.
Distillation is a process that can be used to separate a pure liquid from a mixture of liquids. It works when the liquids have different boiling points. Distillation is commonly used to
separate ethanol (the alcohol in alcoholic drinks) from water
Distillation process to separate ethanol from water
Step 1 - water and ethanol solution are heated
Distillation process to separate ethanol from water
Step 2 - the ethanol evaporates first, cools, then condenses
Distillation process to separate ethanol from water
Step 3 - the water left evaporates, cools, then condenses
The mixture is heated in a flask. Ethanol has a lower boiling point than water so it evaporates first. The ethanol vapour is then cooled and condensed inside the condenser to form a pure liquid. The thermometer shows the boiling point of the pure ethanol liquid. When all the ethanol has evaporated from the solution, the temperature rises and the water evaporates.
This is the sequence of events in distillation:
heating  evaporating  cooling  condensing
Fractional distillation differs from distillation only in that it separates a mixture into a
. A tall column is fitted above the mixture, with several condensers coming off at different heights. The column is hot at the bottom and cool at the top. Substances with high boiling points condense at the bottom and substances with low boiling points condense at the top. Like distillation, fractional distillation works because the different substances in the mixture have different boiling points.
Because they have different boiling points, the substances in crude oil can be separated using fractional distillation. The crude oil is evaporated and its vapours allowed to condense at different temperatures in the fractionating column. Each fraction contains hydrocarbon molecules with a similar number of carbon atoms.
The diagram below summarises the main fractions from crude oil and their uses, and the trends in properties. Note that the gases condense at the top of the column, the liquids in the middle and the solids stay at the bottom.
The main fractions include refinery gases, gasoline (petrol), naphtha, kerosene, diesel oil, fuel oil, and a residue that contains bitumen. These fractions are mainly used as fuels, although they do have other uses too.
Hydrocarbons with small molecules make better fuels than hydrocarbons with large molecules because they are volatile, flow easily and are easily ignited.
Fuels burn when they react with oxygen in the air. The hydrogen in hydrocarbons is oxidised to water (remember that water, H
O, is an oxide of hydrogen). If there is plenty of air, we get complete combustion and the carbon in hydrocarbons is oxidised to carbon dioxide:
hydrocarbon + oxygen    water + carbon dioxide
If there is insufficient air for complete combustion, we get incomplete combustion instead. The hydrogen is still oxidised to water, but instead of carbon dioxide we get carbon monoxide. Particles of carbon, seen as soot or smoke, are also released.
Most hydrocarbon fuels naturally contain some sulfur compounds. When the fuel burns, the sulfur it contains is oxidised to sulfur dioxide.
Clouds of smoke and other combustion products are emitted from chimneys
The combustion of a fuel may release several gases into the atmosphere, including:
These products may be harmful to the environment.
Sulfur dioxide is produced when fuels that contain sulfur compounds burn. It is a gas with a sharp, choking smell. When sulfur dioxide dissolves in water droplets in clouds, it makes the rain more acidic than normal. This is called
Acid rain reacts with metals and rocks such as limestone. Buildings and statues are damaged as a result. Acid rain damages the waxy layer on the leaves of trees and makes it more difficult for trees to absorb the minerals they need for healthy growth. They may die as a result. Acid rain also makes rivers and lakes too acidic for some aquatic life to survive.
Sulfur dioxide can be removed from waste gases after combustion of the fuel. This happens in power stations. The sulfur dioxide is treated with powdered limestone to form calcium sulfate. This can be used to make plasterboard for lining interior walls, so turning a harmful product into a useful one.
Sulfur can be removed from fuels at the oil refinery. This makes the fuel more expensive to produce, but it prevents sulfur dioxide being produced. You may have noticed 'low sulfur' petrol and diesel on sale at filling stations.
Carbon dioxide from burning fuels causes global warming, a process capable of changing the worlds climate significantly.
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen at a higher rate since the 19th century
The temperature of the earth has risen over the years
As you can see from the graphs, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased steadily over the past 150 years, and so has the average global temperature.
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It absorbs heat energy and prevents it escaping from the Earths surface into space. The greater the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the more heat energy is absorbed and the hotter the Earth becomes.
Heat is reflected back from the Earths surface
Heat is absorbed by carbon dioxide (greenhouse gas) and as a result becomes trapped in the Earths atmosphere
The Earth becomes hotter as a result
A rise of just a few degrees in world temperatures will have a dramatic impact on the climate:
Global weather patterns will change, causing drought in some places and flooding in others.
Melting of polar ice caps will raise sea levels, causing increased coastal erosion and flooding of low-lying land  including land where major cities lie.
The Triftgletscher glacier, Switzerland, 2003. As the glacier melts further, the lake's water level rises.
Tiny particles that are released when fuels are burned cause global dimming. Like global warming, this process may change rainfall patterns around the world.
The amount of sunlight reaching the Earths surface has decreased by about 2 per cent every ten years, because more sunlight is being reflected back into space. The particles from burning fuels reflect sunlight, and they also cause more water droplets to form in the clouds. This makes the clouds better at reflecting sunlight back into space.
It is likely that global dimming has hidden some of the effects of global warming, by stopping some of the Suns energy reaching the Earths surface in the first place. Governments around the world are introducing controls on pollution. There is the possibility that as the air becomes less polluted by smoke and soot, global dimming will decrease, causing the effects of global warming to become more obvious.

2393,"Abortion is the artificial ending of the life of a foetus in the womb (uterus). A natural abortion is called a miscarriage. Abortion has been legal in England, Scotland and Wales since 1967 when The Abortion Act was passed. A new upper time limit of 24 weeks was introduced in 1990 under The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.
An abortion may be carried out if one of the following conditions applies:
the life or physical health of the mother is at risk
the mental health of the mother is at risk
there is a reasonable chance that the child will be born seriously disabled
Where the mental health of the mother is at risk, or her family will suffer if the pregnancy continues, the latest termination date is 24 weeks. There is no upper limit if the life or physical health of the mother is at risk, or if there is a reasonable chance of a seriously disabled child being born.
In 1974 119,000 legal abortions were carried out in England and Wales, by 2006 this figure had risen to 193,700.
The Christian Church teaches that life is a sacred gift from God:
Then God said, Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
Christian teaching on abortion is complex. An early Christian document, the Didache, condemns it:
You shall not kill by abortion the fruit of the womb.
The Bible appears to say that life begins when the baby is in the mothers womb:
For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mothers womb.
Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.
opposes abortion in every instance. However, if life saving treatment given to a pregnant woman results in the unavoidable loss of a foetus, but saves the mother, then this is accepted and known as 'double effect'.
Roman Catholic teaching is that the foetus is a human being. This is clearly expressed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) which states:
From the first moment of his(her) existence, a human being must be recognised as having the rights of a person  among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life
When Elizabeth heard Marys greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
(Quakers) believe that although abortion should not be encouraged, the life of the unborn child cannot be seen as more important than that of the mother.
movement generally argues that life becomes human life at the point of conception. It says that abortion should not be allowed, but most would allow an abortion if the mothers life was at risk or if pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.
movement generally argues that human life begins much later in pregnancy, or at birth. There are many points of view among pro-choicers, but fundamentally they think that the woman should have full control over what happens to her body.

1620,"To put Romeo and Juliet into perspective, you will need to know a bit about William Shakespeare, the origins of the story, and its influence today.
William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564. His father sold gloves and became an important person in the town. William, one of eight children, was the eldest son, and probably educated at the local grammar school. He married when he was only 18 and his wife, Anne Hathaway, was eight years older than him. They had two girls and a boy (who died aged 11).
Nobody knows how Shakespeare began to write, or when he entered the theatre. But we know he became a leading member of the theatre troupe known as 'The Lord Chamberlain's Men'. The company proved very popular, and later, when King James I granted it the right to perform at his court, became known as 'The King's Men'.
Shakespeare wrote more than 30 plays for 'The King's Men', making it the most important theatre company in the country. He often wrote parts for particular actors, too.
He was very successful and wealthy in his time, and his work has remained very popular ever since.

A number of gears connected together are called a
. The input (eg a motor) is connected to the driver gear. The output, (eg the wheel of a buggy) is connected to the driven gear.
The photograph below shows a simple gear train made up of a couple of spur gears. These are the common gears (or cogs) that look like wheels with teeth around the rim. Next to the photo is a diagram showing how you would draw this gear train in an exam.
In the drawing, the centre of each gear is shown by a cross. Each gear is drawn as two circles, one slightly larger than the other to show where the teeth would be. Teeth do not have to be drawn, but the number of teeth is written next to the gear, in this case 60 teeth and 15 teeth. Arrows indicate the direction that the gears are moving. Note that with two connected gears, they will be rotating in opposite directions.
Where there are two gears of different sizes, the smaller gear will rotate faster than the larger gear. The difference between these two speeds is called the
, and can be calculated using the number of teeth. The formula is:
Gear ratio = number or teeth on driven gear  number of teeth on the driver gear
So the gear ratio for the simple gear train above, if the smaller gear is the driver gear, is:
Gear ratio = 60  15 = 4
In other words, the driver gear revolves four times to make the driven gear revolve once.
If you know the gear ratio, and the speed input at the driver gear, you can calculate the speed output at the driven gear using the formula:
Output speed = input speed  gear ratio
So if the gear ratio is 4 and the driver gear is revolving at 200
= revolutions per minute, a measure of speed of rotation
output speed = 200  4 = 50 rpm

There are some simple ways to reduce heat loss, including fitting carpets, curtains and draught excluders.
Heat loss through windows can be reduced using double glazing. The gap between the two panes of glass is filled with air. Heat loss through conduction is reduced, as air is a poor conductor of heat. Heat transfer by convection currents is also reduced by making the gap is very narrow.
You may wish to view this BBC News item from 2006 about energy efficiency in homes.
Heat loss through walls can be reduced using cavity wall insulation. This involves blowing insulating material into the gap between the brick and the inside wall, which reduces the heat loss by conduction. The material also prevents air circulating inside the cavity, therefore reducing heat loss by convection.
Heat loss through the roof can be reduced by laying loft insulation. This works in a similar way to cavity wall insulation.

of the play, it's helpful to know a little about J B Priestley's life and his political views during the early 20th century - a time of great global change. He wrote An Inspector Calls after the First World War and like much of his work contains controversial, politically charged messages. Keen to pioneer a new 'morality' in politics, Priestley's chief concerns involved social inequality in Britain and the need for nuclear disarmament.
John Boynton Priestley was born in Yorkshire in 1894. He knew early on that he wanted to become a writer, but decided against going to university as he thought he would get a better feel for the world around him away from
. Instead, he became a junior clerk with a local wool firm at the age of 16.
When the First World War broke out, Priestley joined the infantry and only just escaped death on a number of occasions. After the war, he gained a degree from Cambridge University, then moved to London to work as a freelance writer. He wrote successful articles and essays, then published the first of many novels,
, in 1929. He wrote his first play in 1932 and went on to write 50 more. Much of his writing was ground-breaking and controversial. He included new ideas about possible parallel universes and strong political messages.
During the Second World War he broadcast a massively popular weekly radio programme which was attacked by the Conservatives as being too left-wing. The programme was eventually cancelled by the BBC for being too critical of the Government.
He continued to write into the 1970s, and died in 1984.
During the 1930's Priestley became very concerned about the consequences of social inequality in Britain, and in 1942 Priestley and others set up a new political party, the Common Wealth Party, which argued for public ownership of land, greater democracy, and a new 'morality' in politics. The party merged with the Labour Party in 1945, but Priestley was influential in developing the idea of the Welfare State which began to be put into place at the end of the war.
He believed that further world wars could only be avoided through cooperation and mutual respect between countries, and so became active in the early movement for a United Nations. And as the nuclear arms race between West and East began in the 1950s, he helped to found CND, hoping that Britain would set an example to the world by a moral act of nuclear disarmament.
This was the period of the Russian Revolution, two appalling world wars, the Holocaust and the Atom Bomb.

As a result of the wars, women had earned a more valued place in society.
The ruling classes saw no need to change the status quo.
There was a great desire for social change. Immediately after The Second World War, Clement Attlee's Labour Party won a landslide victory over Winston Churchill and the Conservatives.
Priestley deliberately set his play in 1912 because the date represented an era when all was very different from the time he was writing. In 1912, rigid class and gender boundaries seemed to ensure that nothing would change. Yet by 1945, most of those class and gender divisions had been breached. Priestley wanted to make the most of these changes. Through this play, he encourages people to seize the opportunity the end of the war had given them to build a better, more caring society.

6578,"into perspective, you'll need to know a little about William Shakespeare, the city of Venice during the 16th century, and attitudes towards Jews in Shakespeare's England.
William Shakespeare was born in Stratford upon Avon in 1564. His father was a glove merchant and a prominent local dignitary. William, one of eight children, was the oldest son. He was probably educated at the local grammar school.
He married Anne Hathaway in 1582, aged18; his wife was eight years older than him. They had a daughter, followed by twins two years later. Their only son, Hamnet, died aged 11.
Nobody knows how Shakespeare began to write or when he entered the theatre. At some point he joined an acting company called the Queen's Men and then became a leading member of the Lord Chamberlain's Men. They developed into London's top theatre company, performing at the Globe Theatre from 1599 and becoming the King's men when James I came to the throne in 1603.
Shakespeare probably began writing plays in the 1580s and went on to write more than thirty. These would all have been performed by his theatre company: he may have acted some of the roles himself and certain parts would have been written with particular actors in mind. Certainly his work was very popular: by 1597, Shakespeare was wealthy enough to buy New Place, the grandest house in Stratford! The Merchant of Venice was written between 1596 and 1598 and first published in written form in 1600. He also wrote poems, including many love

6369,"Although we eventually discover that Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde are the same person, for most of the novel we are led to believe they are different characters, so we will discuss them separately.
Jekyll is a doctor and experimental scientist.
He has been a sociable person in the past, with a circle of friends including the lawyer, Utterson, and another doctor, Lanyon.
During the course of the novel his behaviour becomes increasingly
His will states that if he disappears he leaves everything to Hyde. His oldest friend, Utterson, knows nothing of Hyde and urges Jekyll to change his will. He fears Hyde has a mysterious, perhaps criminal, hold over Jekyll, and that Hyde might murder him to benefit from the will.
In the last chapter we learn that Jekyll has been carrying out experiments to separate his personality (the 'evil' part embodied in Hyde) from his higher nature. Hyde eventually becomes more powerful and takes over.
He is described as small ('dwarfish') and young.
People react with horror and fear when they see him. But there is no single thing about him that is especially unpleasant; it is as if his spirit affects people.
He is violent, and has no sense of guilt about his crimes. In Chapter 1, Hyde assaults a young girl, and in Chapter 4 he beats an elderly gentleman to death. He has no motive for either of these attacks.
His appearances in the novel are always brief. People only catch impressions of him, before he vanishes into the dark or behind a door.
Utterson is an old friend of Jekyll, and his lawyer.
He is calm and rational, just as lawyers are supposed to be. Rather like a scientist, his approach in life is to weigh up the evidence.
Utterson is 'a lover of the sane and customary sides of life'. Stevenson probably uses him to represent the attitudes of the average reader of his time.
His sense of shock and horror when he first meets Hyde is, by contrast to his normal reaction to things, irrational: 'not all these points together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust, loathing and fear with which Mr Utterson regarded him.'
He spends much of the novel trying to advise and help Jekyll, giving advice about his will and avoiding Hyde, and trying to help him when he shuts himself in his room. Jekyll recognises that he is a good friend, but rejects all his offers of help.
At no stage does he suspect Jekyll and Hyde are the same person. However, he makes observations whereby the reader can, looking back, see the evidence. For instance, he asks his chief clerk, Mr Guest, to look at Hyde's handwriting. When Guest sees that Hyde's and Jekyll's writing is strangely similar, though with different directions of slope, Utterson draws the wrong conclusion: that Jekyll has forged Hyde's handwriting to protect him.
In Chapter 8, Utterson goes home to read the documents found in Jekyll's laboratory and promises Jekyll's servant he will return before midnight. The novel ends with two chapters containing the two documents he goes home to read. The reader never discovers Utterson's reaction to them, or what action he takes. He is left as an uncompleted character. This is perhaps Stevenson's way of showing that sensible, rational people do not always have all the answers.
He and Jekyll were once close friends and went to medical school together.
Lanyon is respectable and conventional. He follows all the rules and obeys the law.
He believes in science and the world of real, material things.
He is a big contrast with Jekyll, who likes to live dangerously and experiment with the
He disagrees with Jekyll's ideas and calls them 'scientific
'. In Chapter 2, Lanyon has not seen Jekyll since he started to become 'too fanciful' and 'wrong in mind'.
Dr Jekyll, on the other hand, regards him as 'hidebound' (conventional and unadventurous) in his attitude to medical science.
Lanyon is the only person to actually see Hyde transforming into Jekyll, something that does not fit the laws of science. When he sees the change, he cannot cope with the fight between his common-sense view of the world and what Jekyll's experiments reveal. ""I ask myself if I believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots."" Not long after he becomes mentally and physically ill, and dies.
A distant relative of Utterson, Enfield is a well-known man about town and the complete opposite to Utterson.
Poole appears briefly in the novel from time to time, notably when Utterson goes to visit Jekyll.
In Chapter 8, he goes to Utterson's house to report the strange goings on in Jekyll's house. He helps Utterson to break down the door.
Sir Danvers is a distinguished elderly gentleman who is beaten to death by Hyde. This is a turning point in the novel.
Mr Guest is Utterson's secretary and a handwriting expert. In Chapter 5, he comments on the remarkable similarity between Jekyll and Hyde's handwriting.

1139,"Most religions offer teaching on war and conflict. And over time religion has been at the heart of conflict between nations.
The Sixth Commandment (from the Ten Commandments, given to Moses) says, You shall not murder, but there are occasions when the Jewish people are told by God to attack people who oppose them.
The famous Old Testament quotation used to justify war:
But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
The words are intended to limit revenge, not encourage vengeance. But revenge is not consistent with the later teaching of Jesus.
Jesus is often described as a pacifist. He taught:
Blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called the children of God.
When he was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane, his disciples wanted to defend him:
When Jesus followers saw what was going to happen, they said, Lord, should we strike with our swords? And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. But Jesus answered, No more of this! And he touched the mans ear and healed him.
There are two occasions in the gospels when Jesus is obviously angry. One of these is in the Temple in Jerusalem:
Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money-changers and the benches of those selling doves. It is written, he said to them. My house will be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of robbers.
The other event takes place outside of Jerusalem,
Early in the morning, as he was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, May you never bear fruit again! Immediately the tree withered.
Most Christians believe that war and fighting are wrong except in the most severe cases and they base their views on Jesus teaching about love:
A new command I give you: love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.
In the past there have been many occasions when Christians have fought wars and when Christian countries have fought each other including:
wars in Vietnam, Korea, the Falklands/Malvinos, South Africa, and Northern Ireland
Some Christians, such as The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), are totally opposed to fighting and during warfare they are conscientious objectors (taking a public stance against conflict). They are prepared to go into battle driving ambulances or doing other duties but they will not fight.
Other Christians are prepared to fight in the armed services and there are always chaplains attached to military units.
Most Christians today would probably not condone any war that was not fought according to the Just War theory. A war is justified if it is fought for a reason that carries sufficient moral weight. The country that wishes to initiate the use of military force against another nation must demonstrate that there is a 'just' cause to do so.
Christians believe that they should protest when injustice is being done against other people, even though they may not be Christians.

He reminds us at various intervals during the play that the ending is inevitable, such as near the end of Act 1:

Even his jokes are barbed and bitter.
as he grapples with his love of Catherine.
This creates a lot of tension, with each scene of conflict becoming more intense than the one that preceded it. The tense atmosphere during the boxing at the end of Act 1 leads on to the shock near the start of Act 2 when an enraged Eddie kisses both Catherine and Rodolpho and starts a fight - which in turn prepares us for the final scene.
. Again, this is often dependent on Eddie. If he is in a good mood, such as immediately the cousins arrive and the

is crucial to the action of the play. For example, Eddie calls the Immigration Bureau after his meeting with Alfieri on the very day that Catherine says that she is going to marry Rodolpho soon because she is scared of him getting caught by Immigration; simultaneously Marco and Rodolpho move out of the apartment, and thereby cause other immigrants - relatives of the Liparis who have nothing to do with Eddie - to be picked up too. From then on, the pace increases quickly to the end.
These examples of unlucky timing give rise to
(where the audience have a better idea of what is going to happen than the characters do themselves). Another example is when the Immigration Officers appear outside the Carbones' apartment just as Catherine is arguing with Eddie over where Marco and Rodolpho if Eddie throws them out of the building. We know their argument is pointless because the officers are about to pounce.

He is thinking that even though he could predict what was going to happen, even he - a lawyer - could do nothing to prevent it.
Probably he is thinking that Eddie's faults are common ones, and that his story should be a warning to us all to be more self-aware.
Perhaps another, equally disturbing thought has occurred to him: that when it finally comes, Eddie's destruction feels not only tragic, but in some way right and appropriate: like the old generation making way for the new.

5711,"On 28 June 1914, a Serbian shot an Austrian. Within six weeks, many of the countries of Europe had become involved in a war that was to cause the deaths of 10 million soldiers, but was the assassination the only cause of war?
Although the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand signalled the rapid slide into world war, this event alone was not to blame. In fact, there were
that had existed for many years in the run-up to the First World War.
You need to think about these causes carefully, when trying to determine who or what was to blame for the war.
In the 1930s, historians such as Sydney Bradshaw Fay argued that there were four underlying long-term causes of the First World War:
- the belief that your country is better than others. This meant nations were assertive and aggressive.
- the desire to conquer colonies, especially in Africa. This brought the powers into conflict - especially Germany, which wanted an empire, against France and Britain, which both already had empires.
- where military concerns influence a country's policy, especially the attempt to build up a strong army and navy. This gave the nations the means and the will to make war.
- in 1882, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy formed the Triple Alliance. Alarmed, France and Britain in 1904, then Russia in 1907, formed the Triple Entente. Thus Europe was divided into two armed camps, obliged to help each other if there was a war.

Would you focus on the victim or the bully?
What theme would you focus on - guilt, peer pressure, regrets?
Scene ideas where the victim is not present
Megan and her friends laugh and joke together, talking about what they've done. Freeze. Megan steps out of the group and speaks to the audience with a direct address, saying that she wishes she hadn't done it, that she feels ashamed, that her parents would be horrified, and that she wonders how she can make amends.
Megan and her friends laugh and joke together, talking about what they'e done. Freeze. Megan steps out of the group as the lights dim, and goes DS (down stage) to sit at a small table as the lights come up. She writes in her diary, speaking out loud about her sense of shame, how her parents would be horrified and her ideas for making amends.
Megan and her friends laugh and joke together, talking about what they've done. Freeze. One of the characters steps out of the scene, leaving Megan and the remaining actor. Megan is now in trouble with a teacher for having bullied the younger child. The teacher questions her, then asks her how she feels. Megan speaks of her shame and how her parents will be horrified. She says she should make amends for her actions and that she deserves punishment.
These scenes would work well using a small group of three people.
Scene ideas where the victim is present
Megan and her friends stop a younger student from moving away from them by positioning themselves around her. They threaten her and ask for her money. They take the money and her bag, throwing it on the ground. They walk away laughing. Megan looks back and the scene freezes. She speaks to the audience with a direct address, saying she wishes she hadn't done it, that she feels ashamed, that her parents would be horrified, and that she wants to make amends. Looking at her friends, she realises she can't do that at the moment.
Megan and her friends stop a younger student from moving away from them by positioning themselves around her. They threaten her and ask for her money. They take the money and her bag, throwing it on the ground. The young girl looks up at the bullies, asking why they want to do this to someone smaller than themselves. The older girls all laugh - freeze. Megan stops laughing and turns to the audience, serious now. She remembers how the same thing once happened to her, and how she felt. She's always felt angry about it since it happened. She realises how the girl feels, and is ashamed. She looks at the frozen image of her friends and their victim, and says that she's not going to do anything about it now, but later she'll give the money back and apologise. She knows that she'll get into trouble anyway, as the girl will tell a teacher.
These scenes will need at least a couple more actors. They focus on Megan's regret, and the guilt she feels about being a bully.
The following scenes use flash-backs into the past to describe the story:
Megan is in the headteacher's office, with the Head (DSL/R). The Head gives the victim's account of what happened. As she tells her account the lights dim and Megan joins the group CS, and re-enacts the scene as the lights go up. The commentary fades out as the scene is played. Freeze. Megan rejoins the Head in her office with her Head bowed. The Head asks what she has to say. She apologises, and says that she's ashamed etc. The Head brings in the victim, and Megan has to apologise - the victim doesn't answer.
Megan is now a mother, whose daughter has been accused of bullying. The scene takes place in the headteacher's office. Megan is horrified to hear of what her daughter has done, and tells of what happened when she was at school. Lights dim. She joins group CS and re-plays the scene. Freeze. She returns to the headteacher's office and it is still in the past (slightly dimmer lighting than previously). The scene unfolds, with a telling off and a statement by (young) Megan about how she feels about what she's done and what her parents will say. Freeze. Lights fully up and the scene is now today. Megan's daughter is told about what happened in the past, and is thoughtful. The headteacher asks that Megan's daughter be excluded from school for a day, to think about what will happen in the future.
These scenes will need more than three actors. Again, they focus on Megan's regret, and the guilt she feels about being a bully.

2529,"is not just a book about a man who creates a Monster. Mary Shelley intended her readers to learn from her tale. It contains many of her ideas on how people should behave. These were shaped by her upbringing, relationship with Shelley, and her reading of the works of many famous authors and philosophers. These ideas can be summed up in the main
The novel begins with Walton describing his own voyage of discovery, which he hopes will lead him to the North Pole. On meeting Victor, he hears of another tale of discovery, that of the secret of creating life itself.
The Monster is also on a path of self-discovery, and all three characters share a powerful desire to acquire knowledge - a desire that ultimately leads two of them to their deaths, and which very nearly kills Walton.
The Monster quite naturally seeks knowledge about where it came from and how to survive in a hostile world. Through patient
, it learns how to speak and read. But the knowledge it gains only leads it to curse its existence.
It knows that it can never be accepted in the world of man, yet craves human company and the love of the father who abandoned it. Finally, through learning of the 'sanguinary (bloody) laws of man', the Monster is taught that it can be acceptable to kill in some circumstances. This knowledge leads to the deaths of many innocent people.
Robert Walton was brought up by his uncle, and is self-taught in the art of sea-faring. This is despite his father's dying wish that his uncle forbid him from embarking on a life at sea. His determination to succeed, shown by his willingness to work ""harder than the common sailors during the day (and devote his) nights to the study of mathematics medicine... and physical sciences"", leads him to believe he can be the first to discover the sea passage to the North Pole. However, his real motivation is self-glory, fuelled by overwhelming ambition. This leads to him failing to assess the dangers of his voyage and knowingly putting the lives of his crew at risk.
Victor Frankenstein also puts others' lives at risk, as well as his own, through his ambitious pursuit of knowledge. He neglects his loving family and allows his health to suffer greatly in his obsession to discover the secret of creating life out of death.
Shelley makes it clear she believes knowledge such as this cannot lead to good. Some benefit may have come from finding a way to the North Pole, but no good is shown to come from Victor's creation of the Monster.
She shows Victor's 'success' to have severe and tragic consequences that should serve as a warning to scientists, past, present and future, that knowledge is a very dangerous thing and should only be used for the good of mankind - and certainly not personal gain.

Instead, it is transferred to its surroundings and spreads out so much that it becomes difficult to do anything useful with it.
Ordinary electric lamps contain a thin metal filament that glows when electricity passes through it. However, most of the electrical energy is transferred as heat rather than light energy. This is the Sankey diagram for a typical filament lamp.
Modern energy-saving lamps work in a different way. They transfer a greater proportion of electrical energy as light energy. This is the Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp.
Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp
From the diagram, you can see that much less electrical energy is transferred, or ""wasted"", as heat energy.
The efficiency of a device such as a lamp can be calculated using this equation:
efficiency = (useful energy transferred  energy supplied)  100
The efficiency of the filament lamp is 10  100  100 = 10%. This means that 10% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy. 90% is transferred as heat energy.
The efficiency of the energy-saving lamp is 75  100  100 = 75%. This means that 75% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy. 25% is transferred as heat energy.
Note that the efficiency of a device will always be less than 100%.

Does the poet use repetition to emphasise certain words?
Does the poet use a definite rhythm throughout the poem, or in part of the poem, which reinforces the meaning?

The poem is set in a vast area of temporary accommodation called Dharavi on the outskirts of Mumbai, where millions of migrants have gathered from other parts of India and there is always a shortage of water because it is not an official living area.
But when a pipe bursts, when a water tanker goes past, there's always a little child running behind the water tanker getting the bits of drips and it's like money, it's like currency. In a hot country in that kind of climate, it's like a gift. And the children may have been brought up in the city and grown up as migrants, but the mothers will probably remember that in the village they came from, they would have to walk miles with pots to get to a well, to the closest water source. So it really is very precious. When the water comes, it's like a god.

So I take it very much from spoken rhythms, but, at the same time, I'm trying to do some bouncing off. I'm really talking about the rhythms of my spoken word, which might be different from the rhythms of someone else's.

Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses towards its subject matter. Attitude can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.

This image of the effect of drought refers to the skin of the earth, which cracks when dry and becomes useless for growing things, and the skin of a seed-pod, which dries up and becomes brittle once it has fallen to earth. But it also reminds us of the pain we feel when our own skin splits...
The rushing water, shimmering in the bright sun, shines like silver; but the word also suggests its value to the villagers - like an outpouring of precious metal, which will make them rich.
Congregation, like blessing, suggests that the outpouring of water is a kind of holy communion, a religious event - 'the voice of a kindly god.'.

Blessing means when you bless someone. At the end of the poem, Imtiaz uses the same word as in the title. It says:

The water is described in ways that show how valuable it is to these people. 'A rush of fortune', and 'silver crashes', make it sound like money, like it was pouring out of a slot machine. 'Blessing' means something that god sends, like when people say they've been blessed with children. When the people are longing for water at the start of the poem it says 'the voice of a kindly god' to describe the sound of water dripping into a tin mug. And when all the local people rush out into the street, it says 'A congregation'. It's as if they are rushing to church with their buckets to worship the god that sends them water, as if god made the pipe burst.

poem. Tatamkhulu Afrika (1920-2002) lived in Cape Town's District 6, which was then a thriving mixed-race inner-city community. People of all colours and beliefs lived together peacefully, and Afrika said he felt 'at home' there.
In the 1960s, as part of its policy of
system of racial segregation and repression of non-white people in pre-democratic South Africa. Apartheid means 'separate development'.
the government declared District 6 a 'whites-only' area, and began to evacuate the population. Over a period of years, the entire area was razed to the ground. Most of it has never been built on.
The poem was written just after the official end of
system of racial segregation and repression of non-white people in pre-democratic South Africa. Apartheid means 'separate development'.
. It was a time of hope - Nelson Mandela had recently been released from prison, and the ANC was about to form the government of South Africa.
Tatamkhulu Afrika's life story is complicated, but knowing something about it will help you to understand the feelings expressed in this poem.
Tatamkhulu Afrika was brought up in Cape Town, South Africa, as a white South African.
When he was a teenager, he found out that he was actually Egyptian-born - the child of an Arab father and a Turkish mother.
The South African government began to classify every citizen by colour - white, black and coloured. Afrika turned down the chance to be classed as white, and chose instead to become a Muslim and be classified as coloured.
In 1984, the poet joined the ANC (the African National Congress - the organisation leading the struggle against apartheid). Arrested in 1987 for terrorism, he was banned from writing or speaking in public for five years. At this point, he adopted the name - Tatamkhulu Afrika - which had previously been his ANC code name. This enabled him to carry on writing, despite the ban.
Of his own sense of identity, the poet said: ""I am completely African. I am a citizen of Africa; I'm a son of Africa - that is my culture. I know I write poems that sound European, because I was brought up in school to do that, but, if you look at my poems carefully, you will find that all of them, I think, have an African flavour.""

Logic circuits are often used to make pneumatic systems safe. For example some pneumatic drills will not work unless a guard is in place. The drill requires two switches to be operated in order to work: the first by putting the guard in place, the second by pressing start.
. In the diagram below, both three-port valve A and three-port valve B have to be pressed before the piston in the single-acting cylinder will outstroke. Valve B will have no air supply unless valve A is open. Valve B controls the air supply to the single-acting cylinder.

. The single acting cylinder will go positive if valve A OR valve B OR both of them are pressed. The shuttle valve provides the OR control. A T-piece may appear to do a similar job, but a T-piece would allow air to escape out of the exhaust port of the 3/2 that was not pressed.

This is called discrete data because the units of measurement (for example, CDs) cannot be split up; there is nothing between 1 CD and 2 CDs.

If we are going to draw a histogram to represent the data, we first need to find the class boundaries. In this case they are 5, 11, 16 and 18. The class widths are therefore 6, 5 and 2.

In this example, the interquartile range is 11 - 4 = 7.
A survey was carried out to find the number of pets owned by each child in a class.
The results are shown in the table:
Remember that there is a total of 31 children in the class.
Therefore, the interquartile range is 4 - 1 = 3.
Note that the interquartile range ignores extreme values. The range includes extreme values.
1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 35.
The interquartile range is 17 - 7 = 10.
The range is 35 - 1 = 34.
In cases such as these, it is often preferable to use the interquartile range when comparing the data.
The cumulative frequency is obtained by adding up the frequencies as you go along, to give a 'running total'.
The table shows the lengths (in cm) of 32 cucumbers.
Before drawing the cumulative frequency diagram, we need to work out the cumulative frequencies. This is done by adding the frequencies in turn.
22 (= 3 + 7 + 12)
28 (= 3 + 7 + 12 + 6)
32 (= 3 + 7 + 12 + 6 + 4)
The points are plotted at the upper class boundary. In this example, the upper class boundaries are 24.5, 28.5, 32.5, 36.5 and 40.5. Cumulative frequency is plotted on the vertical axis.
Cumulative frequency graphs are always plotted using the highest value in each group of data, and the cumulative frequency is always plotted up a graph, never across.
Cumulative frequency diagrams usually have this characteristic S-shape.
When looking at a cumulative frequency curve, you will need to know how to find its median, lower and upper quartiles, and the interquartile range.
of the total frequency, we can read estimates of the lower quartile, median and upper quartile from the horizontal axis.
Quartiles are associated with quarters. The interquartile range is the difference between the lower and upper quartile.
From these values, we can also estimate the interquartile range: 34 - 28 = 6

Then the last two quarters of 2005 and the first two quarters of 2006:
Note that the last average we can find is for the last two quarters of 2006 and the first two quarters of 2007.
We plot the moving averages on a graph, making sure that each average is plotted at the centre of the four quarters it covers:

J'allais  Cherbourg. Le sac tait grand et vert. Dans le sac il y avait un pantalon, un jean, deux tee-shirts, des chaussettes, des chaussures, des baskets et un appareil. Tu peux aller  la gare s'il te plat? Tu peux apporter le sac le 25 aot, d'accord? Merci!
Philip has written a letter without any mistakes and he would get a grade C for this effort.
Look at all the tasks that Philip completed to get a C grade for his answer. The question asked him to:
say where he had lost the rucksack
say how he had lost the rucksack
ask his friend to check at the railway station
He has also looked carefully at the pictures and realised that:
the first train was going to Paris
since he was going to Cherbourg for the boat, he had to change trains at Folligny
the rucksack was quite big and that it had clothes in it
Philip has written short sentences and has remembered the basic rules, for example:
describing an action that happened in the past
and he also remembered which verbs take the verb

This time Philip would have definitely got an A for this effort. Let's look at why:
Philip has answered all the questions in the task.
He has written more complex sentences and joined shorter sentences together with words such as
'J'ai chang de train  Folligny. Je suis descendu du train. Je n'ai pas pens au sac' becomes: 'J'ai d changer de train  Folligny et je suis descendu du train sans penser au sac'.
'J'ai chang  Folligny et le train est parti avec le sac  dos'
means 'to realise', and he has learned the

happened. In his second attempt he is able to say:
'Quand je me suis rendu compte de ce que j'avais fait, le train tait parti'

you will need to know how to use the phrase
Philip has learned how to use pronouns, for example:
Philip has added some nice touches to his letter - he has realised that he needed money and documents to get home and also he has decided that the camera had all his holiday photos in it.

They release enzymes to break down compounds, so that they can absorb the nutrients. We can preserve our food, for example by freezing or canning, to remove the conditions needed for decay to occur.
Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another.
Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
Intensive farming practices include growing high-yield crops, using fertilisers and pesticides and keeping animals indoors. Food production is increased but there are unwelcome side effects.
Organic farming bans chemical inputs and has a less harmful effect on the environment but often produces less, more expensive food.
Hydroponics is the production of food using nutrient-rich solution rather than soil.
Leaves enable photosynthesis to happen. Photosynthesis is the process by which leaves absorb light and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrate (food) for plants to grow. Leaves are adapted to perform their function eg they have a large surface area to absorb sunlight.
Plants use minerals from the soil to build the complex molecules they need to survive and grow. Poor plant growth may be due to a deficiency of one or more minerals. Tests can be done to establish which mineral is deficient or a general purpose NPK fertiliser added.
Plants have two different types of 'transport' tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots.
The element carbon is the present in all living organisms. It's recycled through various processes, which are described in the carbon cycle.
Nitrogen is essential for the formation of amino acids to make proteins. The nitrogen cycle describes the ways in which nitrogen is recycled.
Osmosis is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low water concentration through a partially permeable membrane. Osmosis takes place in all living cells.
Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis through their root hair cells. Plants use water for several vital processes including photosynthesis and transporting minerals.
All substances are made from atoms. Each atom is made of a nucleus - containing protons and neutrons - surrounded by electrons.
The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. The elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in ascending order of atomic number.
The mass number of an atom is the total of protons plus neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and hence different mass numbers) are called isotopes of that element.
A covalent bond is formed between non metal atoms, which combine together by sharing electrons. Covalent compounds have no free electrons and no ions so they don't conduct electricity.
The Periodic Table is an arrangement of the elements in order of atomic number. Elements in the same vertical column are in the same group or family and have similar chemical properties.
Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid using electricity. When ionic compounds are molten or dissolved in water the ions are free to move.
When sulfuric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen is produced at the cathode (negative electrode) and oxygen at the anode (positive electrode). Aluminium is extracted from the mineral bauxite using the process of electrolysis.
All matter is made of atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements, and each one has a symbol. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other.
When atoms of different elements join together they make a compound. Compounds are represented by formulae that show how many atoms of each element are in the compound. Formulae can be worked out from the charge of the ions that make up the compound.
Chemical reactions can be written down as balanced chemical equations.
The Group 1 elements in the Periodic Table are known as the alkali metals. They include lithium, sodium and potassium, which all react vigorously with air and water.
The reactivity of the alkali metals increases down the group. Flame tests are used to identify alkali metal ions in compounds.
The Group 7 elements are also known as the halogens. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, which all have seven electrons in their outer shell.
In a displacement reaction a less reactive element is
Ionic bonding occurs between positive and negative ions, which attract each other and bind together to form ionic compounds. For example, sodium chloride consists of Na
Each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions held in place by electrostatic attraction and forming an ionic crystal lattice. The ions in a crystal lattice are very strongly bonded - a high temperature is required to melt the crystal.
The physical properties of different metals make them useful for different purposes. For example, aluminium conducts heat, which makes it a useful material for making saucepans and gold is shiny, which makes it an attractive material for jewellery.
Metal particles are held together by strong metallic bonds, which is why they have high melting and boiling points. The loose electrons in metals can all move together through the metal  creating an electric current.
The elements in the middle section of the Periodic Table are the transition elements. They're all metals with typical metallic properties eg conducting heat and electricity. They often form coloured compounds.
Transition metal carbonates undergo thermal decomposition - a reaction in which a substance is broken down into at least two other substances by heat.
Transition metal hydroxides are insoluble in water. They can be precipitated out of a transitional metal compound solution using sodium hydroxide solution.

Where an area of sea separates two plates, sediments settle on the sea floor in depressions called geosynclines. These sediments gradually become compressed into sedimentary rock.

Body language is the way in which our bodies
our own or a character's attitudes. An audience or viewer can watch it to pick up on someone's age, emotions, status, or health.
For example, a student being told off by a teacher in a drama can easily tell the audience that she's not feeling sorry for what she's done by:
showing a bored look in her eyes
having her hip stuck out, with her weight on one leg.
In this still from the comedy series 'Little Britain', the schoolgirl character's body language suggests defiance - she has her hand on her hip, and is not making eye contact with the teacher. Notice the teacher character's body language too - his face is stern, and he is looking down directly onto the schoolgirl character.
When you're acting, make sure your body language is
for the character you play. It's important that your gestures communicate to another person in your group what you intend.
When you're considering the body language from a scene or a still image, ask yourself the following:
what is the scene or image trying to communicate to the audience - ie what's it about?
how well did the actors use appropriate body language?
what could the actors improve upon (if anything)?
The body language worksheet can help you think about these points.

We were trying to show one character being teased and taunted by others. We wanted to show that what was happening was upsetting to the victim. During the sequence we chanted insults, which gradually became louder.
The character at the front is the victim, and he shows this by his facial expression (he is looking downwards with a hurt expression) and his body language, which shows tension.
The bullies stand behind him so that they can be seen by the audience. They are leaning in towards him as they chant insults. Their faces show cruel laughter and sneering.
There could be a small alteration of the sequence, with the actor at the centre of the bullies standing a little taller. This could still have shown the audience that the bullies were more powerful, but the character would have been seen more clearly by all of the audience.
A clear sense of the candidate knowing what the scene is supposed to show, and how that has been achieved.

1904,"Immiscible liquids do not mix together. For example, if you add oil to water, the oil floats on the surface of the water. And if you shake the two together then leave them to stand, tiny droplets of oil float upwards. They join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again. To stop the two liquids separating, we need a substance called an emulsifier.
Emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends:
a hydrophilic end - 'water-loving' - that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils; and
a hydrophobic end - 'water-hating' - that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water.
Lecithin is an emulsifier commonly used in foods. It is obtained from oil seeds and is a mixture of different substances. A molecular model of one of these substances is seen in the diagram.
The hydrophilic 'head' dissolves in the water and the hydrophobic 'tail' dissolves in the oil. In this way, the water and oil droplets become unable to separate out. The mixture formed is called an emulsion.

Before drawing the cumulative frequency diagram, we need to work out the cumulative frequencies. This is done by adding the frequencies in turn.

Cumulative frequency graphs are always plotted using the highest value in each group of data, and the cumulative frequency is always plotted up a graph, never across.

It is possible to deduce from the table which salts dissolved to form the mixture of ions:
When sodium chloride dissolves it forms sodium ions and chloride ions.
When magnesium chloride dissolves it forms magnesium and chloride ions.
When magnesium sulfate dissolves if forms magnesium ions and sulfate ions.
When potassium chloride dissolves it forms potassium ions and chloride ions.
When potassium bromide dissolves it forms potassium ions and bromide ions.
You can use the charge on the ions shown in the table to work out the formulae of the ionic compounds.

The skin covers the whole body. It protects the body from physical damage, microbe infection and dehydration. Its dry, dead outer cells are difficult for microbes to penetrate, and the sebaceous glands produce oils which help kill microbes.
If microorganisms get into the body through a cut in the skin, the most important thing to do is close the wound quickly so that no more microorganisms can enter. A scab does just that. The blood contains tiny structures called platelets, and a protein called fibrin. A scab is basically platelets stuck in a fibrin mesh. The animation shows how this works:

3412,", you need to know a bit about the life of author Doris Lessing, the background to the story, and the influence of her writing today.
Doris Lessing was born in 1919, in what is now Iran. When she was five years old, she moved with her British parents to what is now Zimbabwe.
She was brought up in the African countryside and had a generally unhappy childhood. Her mother was very strict and her father very bitter - his farm was not a success and he had been badly injured in World War One.
Lessing was also unhappy away from home. The nuns at her convent school terrified her, and she dropped out school entirely when she was 13. Although she did not go back, Lessing continued to read widely.
She left home when she was just 15 and worked as a nursemaid, in addition to writing stories for magazines in South Africa. She married when she was 19 and had two children. She later left her family, married again and had a third child.
After World War Two, she left her second husband, moved to London with her third child, and became a full-time writer.
Much of Doris Lessing's earlier work is based on her experiences in Africa. The main aspects of
could take place almost anywhere - because the story concentrates on relationships within a family - but the story is clearly set in Africa. There is also a lot of detail that seems to reflect Lessing's English roots, such as cups of tea and sewing.
The story may echo what happened in Lessing's own life: the young girl is desperate to leave home (just like Lessing was) and argues with her grandfather (perhaps like Lessing did with her parents). Even the grandfather's bitterness (he dislikes Steven and feels abandoned by his family) might reflect the views of Lessing's father.
in 2007 - perhaps the greatest honour a living writer can get. It shows just how important her writing has become.

was first published in a collection in 1957. Some aspects of it may seem a little dated, such as the grandfather talking about '

'. However, the main story is as relevant now as it was then.

We must consider the welfare of future generations in our planning for and utilisation of the earths resources.
The dignity of nature as creation needs to be bound up with our responsibility for the preservation of life.

Once you have your idea for your plot, setting and characters, you need to make sure that your writing 'tools' are sharp and accurate.
Apart from enjoying the entertainment, your teacher will be making sure that:
Your sentences are varied in length and complexity.
You use vocabulary in interesting and imaginative ways.
You organise your story into a clear sequence of paragraphs.
Your handwriting is clear and readable (one of your pieces of coursework must be handwritten).
Check your first draft. Would your teacher be able to find examples of all of these above?
Writing reads better when the sentences in your paragraphs

by William Golding. The main character, Ralph, is being hunted by another boy, and Ralph is afraid for his life.
Ralph fumbled to hold his spear so that it was point foremost; and now he saw that the stick was sharpened at both ends.
The savage stopped fifteen yards away and uttered his cry.
Perhaps he can hear my heart over the noises of the fire.
The savage moved forward so that you could only see him from the waist down. That was the butt of his spear. Now you could see him from the knee down. Don't scream. A herd of pigs came squealing out of the greenery behind the savage and rushed away into the forest. Birds were screaming, mice shrieking, and a little hopping thing came under the mat and cowered.
Five yards away the savage stopped, standing right by the thicket, and cried out. Ralph drew his feet up and crouched. The stake was in his hands, the stake sharpened at both ends, the stake that vibrated so wildly, that grew long, short, light, heavy, light again.
Think about how the extracts below create certain effects in William Golding's writing?
2. ""The stake was in his hands, the stake sharpened at both ends, the stake that vibrated so wildly, that grew long, short, light, heavy, light again.""
3. ""Birds were screaming, mice shrieking, and a little hopping thing came under the mat and cowered.""
Match the comments to the correct quotation.
A. The writer shows the character's desperation and fear with a rhythmic list of descriptions within one long sentence.
B. These short sentences create a tense atmosphere. The reader wants to read on quickly to find out what will happen.
C. The writer uses a longer sentence to show that lots of things are happening at once, so that the reader can feel the character's sense of panic.
Now that you understand how these techniques work in William Golding's writing, try them out in your own piece of work. But be careful to get the punctuation right!
Using a wide vocabulary isn't just about swallowing a dictionary - it's about precision, creation of atmosphere and sometimes even sound effects.
: in your first draft, check if you've described the sea as 'blue'. Is there another word or a comparison that you could use to create a more precise effect? A sapphire sea seems more warm and appealing than an inky sea, which might be darker and more threatening. Think about the effect you want to achieve.
: if you've described a spooky setting see how many death words and comparisons you can squeeze into the description. The gravestones might look like decaying teeth. The mist might be like a shroud.
: if you're writing about the wind, the trees might be swaying, the leaves swirling. The use of 's' words together start to sound like the wind itself.

This is used to detect genetic disorders where the symptoms develop later in life, such as Huntingtons disorder. Predictive testing can be valuable to people who have no symptoms but have a family member with a genetic disorder. The results can help to inform decisions about possible medical care.
Genetic tests are not available for every possible inherited disorder. And they are not completely reliable. They may produce false positive, or false negative, results. These can have serious consequences.
A false positive occurs when a genetic test has wrongly detected a certain allele or faulty chromosome. The individual or family could believe something is wrong when it is not. This may lead them to decide not to start a family, or to choose an abortion, in order to avoid having a baby with a genetic disorder.
A false negative happens when a genetic test has failed to detect a certain allele or faulty chromosome. The individual or family would be wrongly reassured. This may lead them to decide to start a family or continue with a pregnancy.

10, 14, 10, 12, 10, 11, 12, 10, 11, 9 and 12.
This gives Kieran the information he needs, but the data is not very easy to read or remember. What can he do to improve on this? One way is to put his results into a table:
This is better - but it would still be difficult to compare his results with those of his classmates.
Kieran therefore decides to describe his results by giving the
number of tracks, and some indication of the
The mean is the most common measure of average. If you ask someone to find the average, this is the method they are likely to use.
10 14 10 12 10 11 12 10 11 9 12
Add the numbers together and divide the total by the amount of numbers.
Kieran only had 11 results, so calculating the mean in this way was not too time consuming or complicated.
Finding the mean from a frequency table
If Kieran had 111 CDs, it is likely that he would have made a mistake while typing the results into his calculator. In cases like this, finding the mean from a frequency table is more efficient.
Work through an example in the activity below to practise reading information from a frequency table.
. To calculate the median of any set of numbers, you need to write the numbers
Put all the numbers in numerical order.
If there is an odd number of results, the median is the middle number.
If there is an even number of results, the median will be the
Finding the median with an odd number of results
Using the same example, find the median number of tracks on Kieran's CDs.
10 14 10 12 10 11 12 10 11 9 12
9 10 10 10 10 11 11 12 12 12 14
The middle number is 11, so the median is 11.
Finding the median with an even number of results
To find the median of the numbers: 5 11 12 4 8 21.
If there are two central numbers, we need to find their mean.
(8 + 11)  2 = 9.5
Finding the median from a frequency table
From the table, we can find the total number of CDs:
1 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 1 = 11 CDs
As the results are in a table, they are already ordered for us. In this case, the median is the 6
Looking at the table we can see that the first 5 CDs have either 9 or 10 tracks. The 6
CD has 11 tracks. Therefore, this is the
For 5 numbers, the median is the (5 + 1)  2 = 3
For 6 numbers, the median is the (6 + 1)  2 = 3.5
Find the median number of tracks on Suzie's CDs.
Suzie has 15 CDs, so to find out how many tracks there are on the (15 + 1)  2 = 8th CD.
The 8th CD has 11 tracks, so 11 is the median.
Put the numbers in numerical order (in a frequency table this will already be done).
Count the total amount of numbers and add one.
Divide this by 2 to find the nth result.
Find the nth result in the numerically ordered list or frequency table.
You will then be able to find the median in the set of results.
The mode is the number which occurs
in a set of data. There can be more than one mode.
Have another look at Kieran's results and find the mode:
10 14 10 12 10 11 12 10 11 9 12
We need to identify the number that appears in this set of numbers the most. Sometimes it helps to list the numbers in numerical order:
Here we can see that the number 10 occurs most often, so
From a frequency table, it is even easier to spot the mode.
There are four CDs with 10 tracks. The other numbers of tracks do not occur four times or more, so 10 is the mode.
When we have a lot of categories, we sometimes need to group the data.
This table shows the shoe sizes of 100 people in a shop:
The groups 10-19, 20-29, 30-39 and 40-49 are called
The class with the most people is 40-49. We therefore call this the
Measures of average in grouped and continuous data
We already know how to find the mean from a frequency table. Finding the mean for grouped or continuous data is very similar.
The grouped frequency table shows the number of CDs bought by a class of children in the past year.
We know that 10 children have bought either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 CDs, but we do not know
If we assumed that each child bought 4 CDs, it is likely that our estimate of the mean would be too big.
If we assumed that each child bought 0 CDs, it is likely that our estimate would be too small.
It therefore seems sensible to use the mid-point of the group and assume that each child bought 2.
Finding the mid-points of the other groups, we get:
As explained previously, the median is the middle value when the values are arranged in order of size.
As the data has been grouped, we cannot find an exact value for the median, but we can find the class which contains the median.
There are 30 children, so we are looking for the class which contains the (30 + 1)  2 = 15
th value. The median is therefore within the 5-9 class.
The mode is the most common value.
We cannot find an exact value for the mode, and therefore give the
10 14 10 12 10 11 12 10 11 9 12
Kieran's highest number is 14, and the lowest 9.
Therefore, the range is 14 - 9 = 5.
Remember that to find the range of a set of numbers, you need to:
Subtract the lowest number from the highest number.
The difference between the highest and lowest number is the range.
We already know that the mean number of tracks on Kieran's CDs is 11. Deepa also found that the mean number of tracks on her CDs is 11. She therefore came to the conclusion that her results were very similar to Kieran's. Is she correct?
10 14 10 12 10 11 12 10 11 9 12
2 20 3 17 20 4 5 19 18 2
Although the mean was identical to the mean calculated from Kieran's results, the data is very different. The number of tracks on Deepa's CDs is either very large or very small. Therefore, the range for Deepa's results is also large. From 2 to 20 = 18

Imagine that you are asked to carry out a survey to find the number of pets owned by pupils in your school. You decide to ask 50 people, and record your results as follows:
0 2 1 2 0 4 1 0 2 2 1 6 1 1 2 8 0 12

3 3 0 1 2 0 1 1 3 0 2 0 3 2
You now have the information you need, but is this the most efficient way to collect and display the data?
Tallying is a method of counting using groups of five.
Because we have used groups of five, it is easy to find the total.
Which numbers do the following tally marks represent?
Using the tally system to record results is much faster than writing out words or figures all the time. For example, if you had to investigate the most popular type of vehicle that passed the school gates, it would be easier to draw tally marks in one of three columns than write: car, car, lorry, bike, car, car, and so on.
By using a tally chart, the data is already collected into groups, and will not require further grouping at a later date.
The easiest way to collect data is to use a tally chart.
When collecting data for the 'number of pets survey', it would have been useful to draw a table similar to this one.
As each person answers the question, we put a tally next to the appropriate number of pets. The frequency column is completed once all of the data has been collected. The table shows the results of a new pets survey:
These frequencies can be displayed in a bar chart, as shown.
Frequency means the 'number of times it occurs'.
In this example, 3 people had no pets, so the frequency of 0 pets was 3.
Remember that the total frequency should be the same as the number of people in your survey. Always check that this is correct.
In this example, we know that 26 people were questioned in the survey. Check this by adding up the frequency totals: 3 + 8 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 26.
When a large amount of data has to be collected, use a

""You're so innocent, you didn't realise. You're too trusting, too kind, you don't know what these people can be like.""
The narrator wishes her daughter was still innocent like a young child. She is shocked and disgusted at the evidence she finds of her growing experience.
The mother also feels guilty and ashamed of her own sexual experience before marriage, and has kept it a secret. This relates to the narrator's obsession with purity.
The word 'white' is often mentioned. And cleanliness is important to her, too.
The daughter, by contrast, is seen as 'dirty', lying 'on a pile of filth', living the most sordid life the narrator can imagine.
What is interesting about these contrasting ideas is that we realise things are not always what they seem. The narrator seems to have high moral standards, but when she was young she broke the rules, too.
""I had to help with the housework but my brother did nothing.""
The narrator seems to have different standards for men and women:
It's OK for men to use bad language, but not women.
Fathers are in charge, and might be strict if you do not abide by the rules.
Men do not like to talk about emotions.
Women should keep the house tidy and learn to cook.
Women should not say how they feel. They should also avoid being rude.
When a man loses his temper, a woman should accept this and not defend herself.
Women who try to make themselves look attractive are 'tarts'.
Girls who are curious about sex before marriage are 'dirty'.
Which of these points do you agree or disagree with?
You may think it is no wonder the daughter ran away. You might also comment that these expectations belong to a different era to the modern day.
""Rows of high heels, all of them too small for her, she was so vain, all of them moulded to the shape of her feet.""
The narrator wants to control her daughter, but finds that she cannot do this.
The narrator feels the need to control her emotions. She finds this increasingly difficult as the story progresses.
The daughter displays a lack of control: she loses her temper, drinks alcohol, binges on food, and does not want to wait until marriage before having sex.
The narrator's mother displayed a lack of control, too: she was ""plump"", said things without thinking, and had rows of shoes that were too small for her - but wore them anyway, rather than sensible shoes.
The narrator finds comfort in the fact that she can lock up the shoes, tie them together, make them clean, and keep them safe and warm in bed.
""They're best in here with me I think, safe and warm in bed. Tucked up tight.""
The narrator could not live up to her father's expectations.
Her daughter is not living up to her expectations.
The narrator is sad that she was not close to her mother.
She recognises the distance between herself and her daughter's generation.
She wishes her daughter was still a baby. She is frightened by the signs that her daughter is growing up.

Boulder clay can be found in areas of the UK such as Lincolnshire and East Anglia. It is easily eroded, and is one reason why the Holderness coast is so vulnerable to wave attack.
Unlike river deposits that are often sorted into different sizes, all glacial deposits are angular and mixed up (unsorted). The extreme of this can be seen in

The long axis of the drumlin indicates the direction in which the glacier was moving. The drumlin would have been deposited when the glacier became overloaded with sediment. However glaciologists still disagree as to exactly how they were formed.
When glacial ice melts, different types of rock are laid down that have been carried along by the glacier. Piles of these deposits are called

Everything else might happen to us: we might get married, be rich, be happy, have children, open our own business or travel the world, but the only real certainty is that we will die.
It is not surprising that people have always asked questions about what, if anything, happens after they die.
Although some people claim to have had near-death experiences (NDEs), and others claim to be able to talk to the dead, or to have seen ghosts, there is no scientific proof that such experiences actually provide a glimpse into a possible afterlife. It is possible, therefore, that when people die, they simply stop living and that there is nothing beyond this life.
Ideas about what happens after death, and its connection with how life is lived on earth, is a fundamental part of all religions. The details may differ between religions, but belief in an afterlife almost always:
helps people to make sense of life, particularly when life seems unfair or at times of suffering (their own, and others peoples)

If you are asked how many days there are in a week, you would find the answer easy - there are 7. How about the number of days in two weeks? Again, the answer is fairly straightforward - there are 14.
What happens when you are asked how many days there are in three weeks, or four or five? If you know the formula you could work this out.
1 week is 1  7 days = 7
2 weeks is 2  7 days = 14

If you get a question about characters in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with the answer.
Question: What do we learn about Miranda in the two extracts?
In the two Key Extracts we learn that Miranda is young and inexperienced, but not necessarily weak. She has a pure heart and sees the best in Ferdinand and even defends Prospero. In the First Key Extract she must do what her father says, even though his behaviour is questionable. In the Second Key Extract, she knows her own mind and goes behind her father's back (or thinks she has) to ask Ferdinand to be her husband.
Miranda can be read as a strong female character. Even though Prospero is a controlling father, Miranda shows from the beginning of the extract that she is beginning to test his power over her.
She relies on her own judgement and questions her father's actions. She stands up for Ferdinand against her father and is on the receiving end of Prospero's ugly temper. She replies with dignity and even tries to excuse her father's bad behaviour to Ferdinand. However, throughout the first extract, she is being unwittingly manipulated by Prospero.
In the second extract she openly defies her father (although it is part of Prospero's plan that she does this). She demonstrates that she is Ferdinand's equal by offering to share his workload. She claims that she is not worthy of him, but then shows her independence by proposing marriage.
Miranda pleads with Prospero to see the best in Ferdinand, but perhaps her father, who is more experienced, is wise to test Ferdinand's love for his daughter. Miranda is open about her feelings for Ferdinand, but in doing so believes that she is betraying her father's wishes. Miranda is sometimes weak and sometimes strong. She is a complex character.
Throughout the two extracts we see Miranda's growing independence. The truth is, however, that although she thinks she is rebelling against her father by following her own heart, her actions are part of Prospero's plans.

Characteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle.

If you follow the circuit diagram from one side of the cell to the other, you should pass through all the different components, one after the other, without any branches.
If you put more lamps into a series circuit, the lamps will be dimmer than before.
In a series circuit, if a lamp breaks or a component is disconnected, the circuit is broken and all the components stop working.
Series circuits are useful if you want a warning that one of the components in the circuit has failed. They also use less wiring than parallel circuits.

Current is a measure of how much
flows through a circuit. The more charge that flows, the bigger the current.
. For example, 20A is a bigger current than 5A.
A device called an ammeter is used to measure current. Some types of ammeter have a pointer on a dial, but most have a digital readout. To measure the current flowing through a component in a circuit, you must connect the ammeter in
Voltage is a measure of the difference in

Diet, drugs and health - Digestion and enzymes
Our teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. Enzymes are needed so that this break-down happens quickly enough to be useful.
Take care - enzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients:
. Carbohydrase enzymes break down starch into sugars.
The saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough, the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet.
. Protease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. Digestion of proteins in the stomach is helped by

Q2. Amelia spends 80 in the local supermarket, correct to the nearest 10. What is the greatest and least amount that Amelia could have spent?
The number of children in the school has been rounded to the nearest 100 to give 800.
The smallest number that rounds to 800 is 750.

So, the smallest possible number of children in the school is 750, and the largest possible number of children is 849.
Note: 850 is exactly halfway between 800 and 900, but 850 rounds up to give 900, so we use 849.
The smallest number that rounds to 80 is 75.
The largest number that rounds to 80 is 84.99.

Did you spot the problem? Remember, care needs to be taken with connectives. Two in a sentence is usually enough, and they don't need to be used in every sentence.

Westall refers to the bands around Ralph's body four times. This isn't because he couldn't think of another phrase. He is emphasising how tightly Ralph is trapped to create a sense of fear and tension. He also allows us to build up a picture gradually, just like Ralph does as he is regaining consciousness.

The cold nibbled at his buttocks and legs; it ran up and down the knobbles of his spine, making him shiver; it invaded his lungs so he could hardly breathe; he felt he had been shivering a long time.
In the extract, the writer intends to create a very creepy, sinister atmosphere. The way that he describes Ralph's imprisonment makes it sound very unpleasant. He is ""pressed"" against a wall that is ""cold as ice"" and the cold is creeping into every part of his body, making him shiver. Ralph also feels as if he can ""hardly breathe"" because of the cold.

The environment is also changed when land is flooded to make reservoirs for drinking water or hydroelectric power schemes. The animals and plants that live in the forest or on the land lose their habitat. They may die out in that region as a result.
Humans have been cutting down trees for thousands of years. We do this to clear land for farming and building, and for wood to use as a fuel or building material.

If you swing round on one leg of a chair, you put four times as much pressure on one point of the floor as you do if you sit properly. This is because four chair legs spread the pressure over four times more area than one chair leg can.

Formal and informal writing - Informal writing
Writing is informal when it reads as though someone is chatting to the reader. In the right situation, it makes your writing seem more friendly and natural.
Which of the following would you NOT write using informal language?
b) An essay about a Shakespeare play
c) A talk aimed at students your own age or younger
e) A story written from the point of view of a character (in the first person)
b) An essay should always be written using formal language. All of the other situations would suit a more informal style.
Tips to make your informal writing more effective
""Dear reader, I'm really glad you've found the time to open this letter.""
2. It's okay sometimes to use the kind of words that are more usual in speech than writing:
""You don't have to put up with bullying. We'll stick together and make it stop.""
3. Contractions sound more natural in certain types of writing eg a talk to fellow students:
""It's good to know that we're all going to work together on this.""
Don't baffle your reader with too much slang.
Think carefully about structure - informal writing is different to speech and needs carefully planned paragraphs to keep it clear and easy to read.
Sometimes there is opportunity to break the rules of Standard English and use English in unexpected ways. Two good examples of writers who achieve this are poet Benjamin Zephaniah and writer Andrea Levy in her book Small Island.
If you're asked to write a story, it would be a mistake for you as the author to use incorrect grammar and slang - but inside speech marks, your characters can!

The key thing about writing to inform is that you stick to the information. You shouldn't really show many of your own feelings, and you definitely don't want to tell your audience how they should feel. Instead, when you inform you make the facts easy to understand, with a clear structure.
Write an information leaflet for Year 6 pupils, telling them about the school day and what they need to know when they start your school in September.
It's important to structure your answer well. Think of the answer in terms of a drawing, like this:
This is a timeline - the arrow is time moving forwards and the four lines are different events in order. Now, you can think of the school day as the arrow, and plan the different events in a typical day. For instance, you could have registration, then an assembly, then two lessons followed by break. It should be easy to add information and detail. The structure also makes it easy for the Year 6 pupils to follow your information. Another way to inform is by subject, as in the diagram below:
These are points linked together. It is not in order of time, but in order of subject. So you could have PE at the centre with all the information connected to PE in the little circles around. For instance, you could have different types of PE kit, the different sports, the sort of exercises you do. Once you have written about PE, you can move on to look at other areas of the school.

Ducklings will follow the first moving object they meet after hatching. They become socially attached to this object and treat it as their mother.
Imprinting lets young animals recognise their mother from a young age. They can follow her for food and protection.
Imprinting is useful if the first moving object they see really is their mother. But ducklings will imprint on people, balls and even cardboard boxes if these happen to be the first things they see.
Geese, chicks, and other baby birds that can walk around shortly after hatching, also show imprinting behaviour. Konrad Lorenz (1903 to 1989) was an Austrian scientist who studied animal behaviour.
He discovered that if he reared geese from when they hatched, they became imprinted on him. They followed him around and preferred to be near him even when they had grown into adult geese. Lorenz won the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine because of his experiments on animal behaviour.

It is possible to balance the see-saw again if someone else gets onto the other end and sits in the correct place. This is because the turning forces are balanced. We say the moments are equal and opposite.
, we need to know two things:
the distance from the pivot that the force is applied.
This is the equation for working out a moment:
Imagine that a force of 10 N acted on a see-saw 2 m from the pivot. This is how we would work out the moment:
Notice that the unit of moment is
(newton metre). Don't get confused with a 'newton meter', which is another name for a forcemeter.
Here is an example of balanced moments. 10N at 2m from the pivot is balancing 20N at 1m from the pivot. The objects create moments of 20Nm that are equal and opposite, so the see-saw is balanced.
A see-saw will balance if the moments on each side of the pivot are equal. This is why you might have to adjust your position on a see-saw if you are a different weight from the person on the other end.
If a nut is difficult to undo with a short spanner, a longer spanner will help. This is because there will be a bigger moment on the nut, when the same force is applied further from the pivot.
Using the same principle you can increase the moment applied by a lever or a crowbar, and this can help you move heavy objects more easily.

The idea of presenting a speech might make you nervous but some people make speeches every day as part of their jobs. Think about your teachers - they regularly stand up before you and present to the class.
You might notice that some teachers are more interesting to listen to than others. It is not necessarily what they say that keeps you interested, but often how they say it. What do your teachers do to keep your attention? Make a list then compare it with the tips below.
Your listeners will switch off if they can't hear you. Use a loud and clear voice, and if you're unsure if your audience can hear you at the back - just ask ""Can you hear me at the back?""
If you speak too quickly, you won't be clear. If you speak too slowly, your audience is likely to go to sleep. Vary your pace for effect and use dramatic pauses where appropriate.
If you speak like a robot, in the same boring tone, your audience will quickly drift off. Speak naturally and use the pitch of your voice to show your emotions.
You don't have to gurn at your audience! But if you don't look like you're interested in what you have to say, your audience won't be either.
Again, keep it natural, but if you stand like a statue, you won't be very interesting to watch or listen to. On the other hand, too much arm flapping and leg hopping will distract your audience from the point you're trying to make.
Use them, but use them effectively. They need to be big enough to see, interesting to look at and relevant to what you are talking about. Don't be tempted to make a big poster to hide behind!
Choose words that are interesting, descriptive and appropriate to your audience. Don't baffle your audience with jargon or slang or lots of big words that are too difficult for anyone else to understand.
If it's appropriate to your audience and task, try to use Standard English. You don't have to be too formal or put on a silly accent, just speak in a way that is easy for everyone to understand.
Most people feel nervous about speaking formally in front of other people. Here are some tips to help you conquer your nerves:
Write your speech out in full and read it several times - this will help you gain confidence in the content.
Prepare small cards with key points of your speech. By now you should be familiar with your speech so these points will help you keep to your structure. Avoid the temptation to read your speech in full - the idea is to test your speaking skills, not your reading skills!
Practice your performance before the real thing. Try practicing at home on your own, and then in front of family or friends. If you have visual aids, be sure to practice using them.

Water expands slightly when it freezes into ice. This is why water pipes sometimes burst in the winter. You might have seen a demonstration of this sort of thing at school - a jar filled to the brim with water eventually shatters after it is put into a freezer.
The formation of ice can also break rocks. If water gets into a crack in a rock and then
and pushes the crack further apart. When the ice melts later, water can get further into the crack. When the rock freezes again, it expands and makes the crack even bigger.
This process of freezing and thawing can continue until the crack becomes so big that a piece of rock falls off.

(Other spirit voices in the air) Bow-wow!
Where should this music be? I'the air or the earth?
It sounds no more; and, sure, it waits upon
Some god o'the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the King my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air. Thence I have followed it 
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
(Song) Full fathom five thy father lies 
Those are pearls that were his eyes.
(Chorus of spirit voices) Ding dong 
(ARIEL and spirit voices) Ding dong bell.
The ditty does remember my drowned father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.
(To MIRANDA) The fringd curtains of thine eye advance,
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
No, wench: it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wreck  and, but hes something stained
With grief (thats beautys canker), thou mightst call him
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,
As my soul prompts it. (To ARIEL) Spirit, fine spirit! Ill free thee
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island 
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here. My prime request,
Which I do last pronounce, is  O, you wonder! 
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me 
And that he does I weep. Myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes, neer since at ebb, beheld
And his more braver daughter could control thee,
If now twere fit to dot. At the first sight
Ill set thee free for this. (To FERDINAND) A word, good sir.
I fear you have done yourself some wrong. A word.
Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Is the third man that eer I saw  the first
That eer I sighed for. Pity move my father
(Aside) They are both in eithers powers. But this swift business
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light. (To FERDINAND) One word more: I charge thee
That thou attend me. Thou dost here usurp
The name thou owst not  and hast put thyself
Upon this island as a spy, to win it
Theres nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
Good things will strive to dwell witht.
(To MIRANDA) Speak not you for him; hes a traitor. (To FERDINAND) Come!
Ill manacle thy neck and feet together.
Sea-water shalt thou drink: thy food shall be
The fresh-brook mussels, withered roots, and husks
He draws his sword but is prevented from moving by
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
My foot my tutor? (To FERDINAND) Put thy sword up, traitor 
Who makst a show, but darst not strike, thy conscience
Is so possessed with guilt. Come from thy ward 
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
Thou thinkst there is no more such shapes as he,
Having seen but him and Caliban. Foolish wench!
To the most of men this is a Caliban,
Are then most humble. I have no ambition
Thy nerves are in their infancy again,
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.

The wreck of all my friends, nor this mans threats,
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
Might I but through my prison once a day
Behold this maid. All corners else othe earth
Let liberty make use of: space enough
(Aside) It works. (To FERDINAND) Come on.

332,"Imitation is a type of behaviour where one animal copies another animal. Humans often imitate each other, often without realising it. When people talk to each other, they may stand or sit in a similar way, and copy each others movements. Scientists think that this happens so that the speakers feel more at ease with other.
Some chimpanzees have been taught sign language by imitating people.
Imitation helps us to learn how to do new things. Your teachers often show you how to do something new, and then guide you as you try to repeat what they did.
Some scientists think that humans are the only animals that copy each other. Other scientists have observed chimpanzees and other primates imitating each other.
For example, chimpanzees can use sticks to spear juicy grubs to eat. Other chimpanzees copy this behaviour. In this way they learn new skills.

You can separate out the fraction into smaller fractions, like this:
Another way to convert an improper fraction is to find how many whole numbers you get, by using a division.

So the whole number part is 3, and the remainder 2 means there are

Writers like to draw you into their text and get you involved. It's up to you to make your mind up about a character, just as it is when you meet someone in real life.
The clues you need to make up your mind about a character are all in the text. Look for the following:
Take another look at one of the extracts from 'Holes'. Stanley has just arrived at the prison camp. What can you tell about the character of Mr Sir, the man in the cowboy hat, from reading between the lines? Some important phrases have been put in bold to give you a few clues.
A man was sitting with his feet up on a desk.
He turned his head when Stanley and the guard entered, but otherwise didn't move. Even though he was inside,
he wore sunglasses and a cowboy hat
. He also held a can of cream soda, and the sight of it made Stanley even more aware of his own thirst.
He waited while the bus guard gave the man some papers to sign.
""That's a lot of sunflower seeds,"" the bus guard said.
Stanley noticed a burlap sack filled with sunflower seeds on the floor next to the desk.
,"" said the man in the cowboy hat. He had
a tattoo of a rattlesnake on his arm
, and as he signed his name, the snake's rattle seemed to wiggle. ""I used to smoke a pack a day. Now I eat a sack of these every week.""
On the surface, this extract doesn't tell us much about Mr Sir, but you've probably begun to
about him. If we read between the lines, we can tell that he likes to make an impression and wants to be seen to be in charge. He is sitting ""with his feet up on a desk"" and has made his appearance even more striking by wearing sunglasses and a cowboy hat indoors.
Sometimes people who act like this can like power a bit too much, and can be bullies. Could Mr Sir be a bully?
When we consider the can of cream soda, we can say that the fact that Mr Sir fails to offer either Stanley or the bus driver anything to drink after their nine-hour, cross-desert journey suggests that he is a
man. That he keeps his own drink in full view of Stanley and the bus driver further suggests that he is cruel and likes to see other people's discomfort.
We learn that Mr Sir stopped smoking recently. We could then expect him to be bad- and short-tempered. The tattoo of a rattlesnake, a dangerous reptile that is supposed to have a bad temper, adds to this impression. The sunflower seeds are, we are led to believe, there to help him as an alternative to cigarettes, but we don't get the feeling of optimism that they'll be successful.
So there we have it; Mr Sir is a bad-tempered, selfish bully!

Explore, imagine and entertain - Ending short-stories
The other problem some writers have is ending the story. It doesn't matter if it's a happy ending or not, but it has to make sense. There are lots of ways of ending, such as:
, where we have to wait until the final moment until we know. For instance, the spy who manages to stop the bomb two seconds before it explodes.
, where we are fairly sure about something, but in the final part everything changes. For example, we then learn that this is a fake bomb, and the real one is hidden somewhere else and will explode in five minutes.
, where the story stops, but we aren't sure what has actually happened at the end. For instance, the bomb is defused and everyone is safe. But then an army commander reports the theft of another bomb... only this time twice as powerful.
However, there are two endings to avoid:
, where a bomb will inevitably explode and as it does, the narrator wakes up - it was all a dream. Some English teachers don't mind this sort of thing, but others hate it. You have been warned.
, where the secret agent suddenly stops worrying about the bomb, retires, and goes off to play golf. This is even worse, and no-one likes it because the ending has nothing to do with the story.
Whatever kind of story you write, decide on your ending and include it in your plan.
Writing that explores, imagines or entertains depends on being creative. You need to experiment a little and not be frightened to try something new.

Q2. Round 8.352 to 1 decimal place
To round to two decimal places, look at the number in the third decimal place. It's a 4, so round down.
To round to one decimal place, look at the number in the second decimal place. It's a 5, so round up.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places then the answer must have that number of decimal places, even if you have to add some zeros.
For example, rounding 3.40021 to two decimal places gives 3.40 (2 d.p.).

We also know the article is about bullying from the first sentence, but Stuart's definition is poor and the whole article is slow to get started.

People often use the word germ instead of microbe, so you might think that microbes are all harmful. But some are useful to us.
Yeast cells are useful to bakers and brewers. Yeast cells can change sugar into carbon dioxide gas and alcohol. This is useful to bakers because the gas helps the bread rise, and it is useful to brewers because it adds the alcohol needed for their drinks.
Bacteria are also useful to us. For example, certain bacteria cause the changes needed in milk to make yogurt and cheese out of it.
Many microbes can cause diseases. For example here are some diseases caused by fungi:

There are millions of species on our planet. It would be difficult if we just tried to describe and name each one individually. Although species can be very different from each other, many of them have similar features that allow us to put them into groups.
In the eighteenth century Carl Linnaeus started the modern system of putting species of organism into certain groups and giving them scientific names. Each species is given a name using Latin words, so that the same name can be used all over the world.
For example, the scientific name for human beings is 'homo sapiens'. Putting different species into different groups according to their features is called

All living things get the energy they need to live from a chemical reaction called
. This process needs glucose as a starting point. First we'll see how respiration works, and then look at how plants use respiration in combination with photosynthesis.
is the chemical reaction used to release energy from glucose. It is called aerobic because oxygen from the air is also needed.
Here is the word equation for aerobic respiration. Energy is put in brackets because it not a substance:
Notice that the word equation for respiration is the reverse of the word equation for photosynthesis. Check back if you are not sure of this.
Plant cells respire, just as animal cells do. If they stop respiring, they will die. Remember that respiration is not the same as breathing, so take care - plants do not breathe.
As we can see from the word equations respiration and photosynthesis are opposites. Respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and produces oxygen.
So what happens to a plant overall? This depends on whether it is in the dark or the light, and how bright the light is.
Plants respire all the time, whether it is dark or light. They photosynthesise only when they are in the light.
Neither gas is taken in or given out, as each cancels the other out
Photosynthesis usually results in a net food gain (net glucose gain), once respiration has been accounted for. This means that there is an increase in the biomass of the plant.
Plants that lose their leaves in winter store food produced during the summer by photosynthesis. They store enough food to last them over winter, and to provide energy reserves for new growth in the spring.

499,"> Drama - Drama from your imagination
Taking part in drama doesn't always involve learning lines from scripts - often you'll be asked to improvise. Usually you will work in groups or pairs to devise a piece of drama from your own imagination. You'll need to be able to think on your feet and become a different character.
This might sound difficult, but you've probably improvised before without realising it - in games you used to play as a child. If you've ever played pirates, nurses or superheroes when you were younger, you were improvising - although don't think running around your classroom with a tablecloth for a cape pretending to be Superman will impress your drama teacher - it probably won't!
As with any English work, you need to think about your audience when you devise drama. Your drama needs to entertain them and keep their attention. Your drama also needs to be believable - your audience is likely to become disconnected if your story or characters are too far fetched.
The story of your drama begins with your character. Ask yourself: what does my character feel, think and react?
Here are two ideas for a character:
You are a journalist who has uncovered a story that will have big consequences and you're about to tell the world. Would your character be confident or scared?
You are a global superstar - singer, actor and producer - and paparazzi follow your every move. You live a glamorous and privileged life, but what are the secrets behind the smiles?
When you have decided on your character, you need to create a scene.
Here are some ideas for a scene based on the characters above. Can you think of any more?
You're about to appear on the most popular morning TV programme and expose your discovery when you suddenly receive a startling phone call. Who is on the phone? What do they say? How do they make you feel?
You've landed a part in a popular soap but you don't get on with the other actors. Should you tell the press the truth or pretend that you all get along?
You've been working late in the library just double checking a few facts for your article when you notice a menacing looking man watching you. Does your character panic or keep calm? Do they run or confront the man? Maybe they are being paranoid?
The press have published some false rumours about you and you're really upset. Your agent has secured a slot on a popular chat show to give your side of the story. Do you accept the offer or decide to lie low? How do you feel?
Your article has been published and has been a massive hit. You're receiving job offers from high profile newspapers and magazines and your life is about to change for the better. How do your family react? What do you decide to do?
You've found out that one of the other band members is planning to leave the group and go solo. You confront them - can you persuade them to stay, or would it be better for everyone if they left?
When you have a rough idea of your character and scene, you can think about what your character might say. If you're given time to prepare you should write a short script. If working in pairs or a group, you could improvise the scene first to get more ideas.
You may be allowed to use props to make your scene more realistic and interesting. Only use a prop if it is relevant, otherwise it could end up distracting you and your audience. If you decide to use props and costumes, always practice with them first.

Your aim is to get all the unknown x terms on one of the equation side only, so start by adding 2x to both sides: 7x - 2 = 12
Next add 2 to both sides: 7x = 14
And finally, divide by 7 to give
As always, you can check your answer in the original equation. So substitute x = 2 back into 5x - 2 = 12 - 2x
(5  2) - 2 = 12 - (2  2)
10 - 2 = 12 - 4
This makes sense, so the value x = 2 is correct.
Add x to both sides to give 5x = 10.
To find x, divide both sides by 5 to get x = 2

Let's look at two examples of how organisms are adapted to such changes.
If you have ever been to the seaside and looked for creatures in rock pools, you are likely to have seen lots of limpets on the rocks.
When the tide is in, limpets move over sea-covered rocks, scraping off tiny bits of seaweed. When the tide goes out, limpets clamp themselves very tightly against the newly exposed rock. This makes it difficult for predators to pull them off the rock to eat them. It also stops the limpets losing water, or being washed away by waves.
The snowshoe hare lives in Canada and other parts of North America.
The snowshoe hare has brown fur during the summer, to help camouflage it amongst the earth and plants. Its fur is white during the winter, to help camouflage it in the snow. This adaptation makes it more difficult for predators to see the snowshoe hare, whatever the season.

You can draw a scatter diagram to represent these marks. As Pete was absent on the day of the German test you do not have enough information to mark his score.
Looking at this scatter diagram there is strong positive correlation between the marks in French and the marks in German, so you can draw a line of best fit to show that trend.
Pete scored 70 in French, so using the line of his best fit, you can estimate that his mark in German would have been 72.
A line of best fit can only be drawn if there is strong positive or negative correlation.

b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.
There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.
So you need to think about TAP (text, audience and purpose) and make a good start to your writing. You should try to 'set a context', which is like setting the scene. So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on.

They have stopped to chat with some boys from school. Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. You can use the bullet points to help you.
After a couple of minutes she realised that her every move was being watched by a group of three girls and she couldn't help noticing how tough they looked. All three were wearing dark blue baggy jeans. She was pretty sure they were Londoners born and bred but thought they could find a job working for the Jamaican tourist board, not simply because of their dark skin but also because of their clothing. One had a T-shirt saying 'I love Jamaica'. Another wore a T-shirt that was a Jamaican flag and the third just had a West Ham football shirt on, but she, like the others, was adorned with yellow, black and green bangles, badges and necklaces. Natalie thought they looked good, but dangerous.
Natalie shifted nervously. She didn't know quite where to look but she had to put on a front. The other three girls made no attempt to hide the fact that they were on Natalie's case. They began to whisper to each other and smile as they stared at her. Natalie felt illuminated in her green satins and began to wish she had chosen clothes which weren't so loud. What are they grinning at? she wondered. Is it my clothes? My shoes? My hair? Do I look too innocent? Suddenly the three girls began to walk toward Natalie. Her heart began to race, the palms of her hands began to sweat. She felt like falling apart but she held herself together.
'You from round here, den?' said the big girl wearing the Jamaican flag.
'Yeah, I wanid to go there but they wouldn't let me, said I had ta go ta Lonsdale Park, said it was nearer. What ya doing here?'
The other two girls continued to look her up and down. Natalie expected trouble and in her mind she cursed the boys for bringing her there and for the way they had got lost in their silly conversation about football and cars.
'I'm just hanging around with my boyfriend and his mates.'
At this point the girl wearing the West Ham shirt reached into her back pocket. Natalie swallowed hard as the girl pulled out a couple of leaflets. After separating one from the other she handed one to Natalie. 'Dat's the place to be, check it out, good vibes, good music. Ya like rap?'
Natalie wanted to kick herself. She had completely misread the situation. They weren't out for a fight, they wanted to find out if she liked clubbing. They wanted to find out if she was one of them, an Eastender.
'Yeah,' Natalie replied, feeling a sense of relief. 'Yeah, rap's cool...' She began to wonder if she sometimes looked threatening and if she herself had been misjudged in the past. For people to be friendly, did they have to have permanent smiles on their faces?
How does the writer show Natalie's thoughts and feelings changing during the extract?
her first reactions to the girls she sees
the way she acts just before, and when, they speak to her
her thoughts at the end of the passage.
Just before the girls speak to her, Natalie seems even more anxious. She is used to being out on the streets of London and feels she needs to 'put on a front' and look tough. She is afraid they may be laughing at her clothes or hair, which makes her seem insecure about herself. However, when the girls come up to speak to her she hides her nerves and answers their questions. The way she uses short answers like 'Yeah' suggests she does not want to give too much away about herself or get into a fight.
When she realises the girls are actually being friendly and want to give her a flyer for a club, Natalie's feelings change completely. She is ashamed of being suspicious and feels like 'kicking herself'. She realises the girls are Eastenders just like her. The writer shows how this makes her think about her own image. She wonders if people think she looks threatening, too. At this point she comes across as an intelligent, thoughtful girl who wants to learn how to judge people fairly in the future.

Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts
A salt is always made when an acid is neutralised by a base. But the exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used.
The name of a salt has two parts:
the first part comes from the metal in the base used
the second part comes from the acid that was used
Where does the name potassium nitrate come from?
These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt:
How can we make copper sulfate? The first part of the name is 'copper', so we need a base containing copper. We could use copper oxide or copper carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'sulfate', so we need to use sulfuric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
copper sulfate + water + carbon dioixde
How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
sodium chloride + water + carbon dioxide
It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced.

They enter the uterus through the cervix and travel to the egg tubes. If a sperm cell meets with an egg cell there, fertilisation can happen. Fertilisation happens when an egg cell meets with a sperm cell and joins with it.

If you were to compare the scores in the two subjects, English and Maths, which measure of average would you use and why?
The range of scores in English (37) is far greater than that in the Maths (4).
The mean score in each subject is 78 which implies that the scores of the students are more-or-less identical in English and Maths. But looking at the actual scores, you can see that this is not the case.
If you compare the medians (71 and 78), you might assume that the students generally scored less in English, (which is partly true, but there are also some much higher scores there too).
If you just state the modal score for each subject (101 and 78), you have no information about the scores of the other students.
So, which is best? It seems that to give maximum information,
a combination of the median and the range would be best.
So, in summary, English has a median score of 71 and a range of 37, and Maths has a median score of 78 and a range of 4.

265,"> Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
When you are persuading people, you usually use a different style. You don't need to show both sides - all you have to do is present your ideas. For instance, imagine you had to persuade people to buy a certain toothpaste. You could write about the great taste, or how clean your teeth feel or how white they are. It doesn't really matter what you find to write about as long as you get them to buy it.
But you wouldn't write about other makes of toothpaste. You don't persuade like this, because it sounds like you aren't sure. So the first thing to remember is:
- if you are writing about how great chips are, keep repeating the idea. Convince yourself how good they are - they might even be a healthy option, because lots of doctors are bound to like them and chips wouldn't be so popular if they weren't really great, would they? Once you have convinced yourself, it's much easier to convince others. So next you need to remember to...
- it's always better to hear how good your idea is rather than how bad other people's are. So write about the things that show your ideas in the best light. For instance, aren't chips just great for a quick snack? Why were chips voted the most popular option in our school at lunchtime? And finally don't be frightened to...
- If you don't seem too sure, or if you can't make your ideas stand out, then you aren't really persuading as much as you can. And if that is the case, you need The Persuaders' Toolkit.
- don't worry about saying the same thing again and again - people forget, so repeat yourself and they will remember. Even when you think they might remember, you can always repeat yourself another time.
- using words such as ""we"" or ""I"" always sounds a lot more convincing. We all know that, don't we?
- why would you use questions? Well, they make people think. They also get your readers involved in what you are writing. So will you use them when you persuade? If not, why not?
- words are your ammunition. In seconds, they can make your friends laugh, or your teacher angry, so why not use them properly to persuade your readers?
For instance, don't just write ""the pressure of doing school work"", because there is no real feeling there. Instead, how about: ""the endless trauma, the desperation and the mindless suffering that school work inflicts on students"".

Stanley didn't have many friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.
What does this extract show us about the main character?
Stanley is another big male, but it is clear that the writer wants us to react differently to him than we did to Jim Wellings in the earlier extract.
Stanley is a lonely boy, because he ""didn't have many friends at home"". He is bullied and teased, even by adults. The fact that the teacher causes him ""embarrassment"" by showing him up in front of the class proves that he feels uncomfortable about his weight.

When you talk about the performance of a play, you should think about how people in the audience feel as they watch it. For instance, the beginning of the first extract is magical and romantic. The tone changes in the middle to one of conflict.
Prospero has lots of asides (thoughts spoken aloud) in the first extract. His role in this scene is made more complex because his character is pretending to be something he is not. The director has to decide whether he wants us to see Prospero as a good father who wants the best for his daughter or a manipulative control freak.
Prospero also speaks to Ariel who is invisible to the other characters on the stage.
When Ariel appears, the director must decide how to present the 'illusion'. Ariel is invisible to the other characters. But it does not necessarily follow that he must be invisible to the audience, too. Try to imagine as many interesting and unusual ways to present Ariel - the 'invisible' sprite - as you can.

In conclusion, both sides of the debate have solid foundations. As has been shown, the arguments for and against have been put forward since boxing began. And, it would seem, the argument will continue for at least the foreseeable future, as compromise seems unlikely. Both sides do agree, however, that the debate is better held whilst boxing is licensed and controlled rather than unlicensed and uncontrolled. The latter would make it, in my opinion, neither sport nor spectacle.
As you can see, the writer clearly signals that the end is approaching by using the connecting phrase ""In conclusion"". It maintains the impersonal approach it set out with by stating that the argument will continue and that ""compromise seems unlikely"".

Humans have instincts, but it is possible for us to overcome natural urges to follow a certain behaviour. For example, a hungry person might want to start eating immediately when they sit down at the dinner table, but they have learned that good manners mean they should wait until everyone is seated and ready to eat.
Most people start smoking before they are adults
People often imitate each other. This can help them learn something new and useful, such as new skill in lessons, sport or at work. It can also lead them to show less useful behaviour. For example, young people may start smoking, drinking alcohol or taking drugs as a result of copying each other to fit in.
Conditioning can be used to change the behaviour of people. Advertisers are very skilled at this. They use pictures of their products which make the them look glamorous or exciting, often by using famous actors or sports people.
By associating the product with attractive images the advertisers are trying to set up a conditioned response to their product. People will respond positively and buy the product.

An empty kitchen roll could be: a trumpet, a phial containing a precious potion, a wand, a telescope, a scroll containing a deadly secret.
A paper plate could be: a steering wheel, a shield, a window into another world, a helmet that allows you to read people's thoughts, a miniature flying saucer.
A plactic cup could be: a gas mask, an ants' nest, a cup containing a liquid that turns you into a monster with just one sip, the home of a very small but very poisonous snake
Once you've come up with an idea, you can create a story together.

Being able to recognise changes in mood and emotion in a script is important as you need to convey this to your audience.
Using these methods, decide how you would express the emotion of anger.
What happens to your face, body and voice when you feel angry? How do you walk when you're in a bad mood? Which gestures do you use to show someone you're angry with them?
Frown, tightly clenched jaw, a tight mouth or even bared teeth.
Tense shoulders, a swift and purposeful walk almost like a march.
Strong and forceful gestures. Perhaps even clenched fists.
Either very loud and out of control or very quiet and menacing.
Maybe if you're very angry you won't pause often, you'll talk very quickly without giving the other person a chance to talk. Or the pauses might be long - a deafening silence!
Now try this with other emotions, eg surprise, excitement, happiness, sadness. See how your body, face and voice change with each emotion.
Another way to practise emotions is to do mood walks - put all the elements together to develop a walk that represents each emotion, then greet (or growl at) people with the appropriate tone of voice.

Ratio - Division in a given ratio
Dave and Lisa win 500 between them. They agree to divide the money in the ratio 2:3.
The ratio 2:3 tells us that for every 2 parts Dave receives, Lisa will receive 3 parts. There are 5 parts in total.
500 represents 5 parts. Therefore, 100 represents 1 part.
Dave receives 2 parts: 2  100 = 200
Lisa receives 3 parts: 3  100 = 300
It's important to notice what order the parts of the ratio are written in. 2:3 is not the same as 3:2.
In the example, the ratio of Dave's money to Lisa's was 2:3. If we swap the order to 3:2 then Dave would get more than Lisa.
To keep it the same as in the example we could say that the ratio of Lisa's money to Dave's would be 3:2
Q1. Amelia and Shabana win a sum of money, which they agree to share in the ratio 5:3.
If Amelia receives 150, how much will Shabana receive?
Q2. A necklace is made using gold and silver beads in the ratio 3:2. If there are 80 beads in the necklace:
A1. Amelia receives 5 parts, which is equivalent to 150. Therefore, 150 represents 5 parts.
Shabana receives 3 parts: 3  30 = 90.
A2. Gold : Silver = 3:2, so there are 5 parts altogether.
80  5 = 16, so 1 part represents 16 beads.
a) Gold = 3  16 = 48 beads
b) Silver = 2  16 = 32 beads

A short-story is easy to write if you:
Have only one or two main characters. It's a short story and you don't have time for any more.
Use people's words and actions as much as possible. Don't try to give lots of background information - let the reader use their own imagination. Remember - creative writing means creative reading too!
Make your characters and plot realistic. How do people really speak and act? Remember, most writers base some of their characters on people they actually know, so who can you use to improve your story? Would your granny make a good secret agent or your uncle a confident contract killer?
Get straight to the point. Don't worry about long openings or lots of detail. Instead, launch right in, hopefully in the middle of some action, like in the example below.
Steve held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - he was too shocked to speak. One moment he had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next he was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
You will also have to decide whether to write in the first person (using ""I""), or in the third person (typically, using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they""). Using ""I"" makes it easier to write about thoughts and feelings, but using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they"" lets you move from person to person, or from place to place. You can choose whichever you feel happiest with. For instance, we can swap the opening of the story into the first person, like this:
I held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - I was too shocked to speak. One moment I had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next I was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
The only thing you shouldn't do is swap the person - dont start with ""I"" and then switch to ""he"", or you'll spoil the story.

Analyse, review and comment - Writing to analyse
This is one version of the speech. You will find comments beneath each paragraph, explaining what the writer has done well.
I'm sure you've all heard the saying ""we are what we eat"". Have you been into the school canteen recently? The selection is similar to that in many schools: a main meal which is usually meat-based, a variety of burgers and pizzas, a dessert and, for the health-conscious, jacket potatoes with one or two cold fillings. The question we are here to consider today is whether this is a reasonable selection, or whether changes could be made in Grange High School's canteen.
The speech begins dealing with the problem straight away. It starts with a short, familiar phrase and a rhetorical question, to involve the audience and make them listen to the speech. The current selection of food is outlined to set the scene, followed by the main question to be tackled. The opening is very friendly and easy to follow. This is a great start.
A survey conducted recently by Year 9 students suggested that many students are happy with the food on offer. They stated that the burgers and pizzas were their favourite food and that they were ""tasty, filling, cheap and quick"". These choices, sometimes called ""junk food"", are the best sellers and the canteen staff say the profit from these makes it possible to offer some of the less popular options.
The writer now looks at the evidence for keeping junk food. They've imagined a survey and comments from the canteen staff - this is fine as it's relevant and makes sense.
Some students admit that the junk food in the canteen is the only reason they stay in school at lunchtimes. Although we are not allowed off site during school times, it is well known that some students do sneak out to local chip shops and other takeaways. A substantial number of students who took part in the canteen's survey said they would be more likely to do this if the canteen offered more healthy food.
The final argument for junk food is explained. The writer introduces a rather controversial point, but softens it with the phrase 'it is well known...' so that no one is blamed. Again this keeps things formal and balanced.
So far, the writing looks really good, but it seems like the conclusion will be in favour of junk food. Is there any way of balancing the argument? Go to the next page to see how this is done.

Writer's tricks - The effect on the reader
You will now be very familiar with the idea that every text is intended to affect its readers in some way.
Every reader is, of course, different too, and sometimes a text will affect you in ways a writer didn't imagine, or you might notice depth in it that others won't. This is particularly true if the text matches your personal experience. A story about your home town might interest you more than one about somewhere else, or a text about smoking might affect you more if you know somebody who is trying to give it up.
Remember, you get marks for noticing the intended effect on the reader. Even if something doesn't interest, horrify, amuse or persuade you, you need to spot what the writer meant to do. It's usually better not to mention your personal opinion unless you are asked to.

Ray, the main character in this extract, has stolen a motorbike and caused an accident that killed someone. He has told nobody, but knows that he can't hide for much longer. He is about to get on a bus, but realises that the one person who can link him to the crime is the conductor of that very bus. Before he can run off, he bumps into Mrs Fitzroy, his best friend's mum.
Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. Write one paragraph for each bullet point.
He hung back, groping wildly for some excuse to prevent him getting on, but the bell rang and the engine increased its impatient rumble and his legs carried him upwards on to the platform, and he felt Mrs Fitzroy clamber on behind. The bus began to move. He turned towards the stairs, but she caught hold of his arm.
""Let's go downstairs. I don't like the smoke."" Again he felt her hand guide him, and he ducked his head and began to walk along the aisle. ""Yeah"".
""This'll do,"" she said, and he turned back and sat beside her - the less fuss he made, the less obvious he was, the better. As he settled, he kept his face bent low, aware of the conductor walking towards them. He brushed past, and, noticing things with a total clarity, Ray saw the dark blue uniform that he was wearing and noted the heaviness and thickness of the material. He heard him clumping up the stairs, and he wondered, absurdly, if he was wearing heavy boots, too.
Mrs Fitzroy was opening the bag which she had on her lap, and Ray felt in his pocket for his fare. If he had the right change, he could just hand it to the conductor without looking up. Yes, he had a ten and two pence piece. He glanced at Mrs Fitzroy and saw to his dismay that she was taking out a pound-note from her purse. That would mean a delay while she got her change - plenty of chance for him to be recognised. Could he offer to pay her fare? It would seem strange, but anything was better than being seen.
What kind of atmosphere does the writer create in this extract and how do they do it?
Ray's thoughts and actions as he gets on the bus
how the writer uses language to create the atmosphere.
In this text, the writer creates an atmosphere of fear and tension. Ray's thoughts and actions at the start of the passage show that he is under a lot of pressure. He tries to think of an excuse to 'prevent him getting on' the bus, but knows that this will just make Mrs Fitzroy suspicious. When he tries to go upstairs, she insists they stay downstairs. Nothing seems to be going his way, and this leads us to believe he may well be spotted by the conductor.
As the conductor approaches, Ray's fears increase which creates more tension. He keeps his face 'bent low' to avoid being recognised, and also notices things 'with a total clarity'. This shows that he is very scared and alert, ready for something to go wrong. When he realises Mrs Fitzroy has no change, he feels 'dismay'. The reader is kept on the edge of their seat waiting for the conductor to come along.
The writer uses language, as well as events, to create tension. The phrase 'groping wildly for some excuse' shows Ray's panic and gives the impression that he feels he has no control over events. The way he notices the 'heaviness' of the conductor's uniform, and wonders if he was 'wearing heavy boots as well' might mean that he is afraid of the man. Ray asks himself 'Could he offer to pay her fare?'. This shows he is tense; he is running through possibilities in his mind. The writer uses Ray's fears to create an atmosphere of tension for the reader.

The Second Key Extract takes place outside Prospero's cave. Ferdinand is carrying logs. He thinks to himself that he doesn't mind the hard work because he is doing it for Miranda,
Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble.
even if her father is cruel and grumpy.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
Miranda comes to see him. Neither of them realise that Prospero is watching them from a distance.
On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance?
Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
but he says he has too much to do, so she offers to carry some logs for him.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
He says he would rather break his back than see her work. Miranda insists again that she should help him.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Looking on, Prospero sees how much Miranda is in love with Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Ferdinand asks Miranda her name and when she tells him, she remembers that in doing so, she has broken her promise to her father.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand admits that he has liked lots of different women in the past
Ferdinand uses the word 'bondage' to describe his reaction to listening to beautiful women talk. It links back to the issue of Freedom and Slavery in the play. Ferdinand means that he has been like a slave to beautiful women in the past.
, but they have always disappointed him with some fault or other in the end.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
However, Miranda, he says, is perfect. Miranda, on the other hand, hasn't met any men except for her father, or any women, except for herself. Even so, she says that she can't imagine liking anyone more than she likes Ferdinand.
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand tells her that he is a prince, possibly a king (although he hopes his father isn't dead). He wouldn't usually put up with having to carry logs like a slave
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
but he knew as soon as he saw Miranda that he'd do anything for her. When Miranda asks him if he loves her, Ferdinand says he loves, prizes and honours her more than anything else in the world. This makes Miranda so happy that she cries. As Prospero watches them together, he is moved.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Ferdinand asks Miranda why she is crying. She says she thinks she isn't good enough for him
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!
but realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else. Ferdinand happily agrees to marry her. They say goodbye and part.
Prospero is happy for them, but he claims that their engagement is no surprise to him as it was all part of his plan. He goes to get his magic book because he has lots of work to do before supper time.

Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand uses the word 'bondage' to describe his reaction to listening to beautiful women talk. It links back to the issue of Freedom and Slavery in the play. Ferdinand means that he has been like a slave to beautiful women in the past.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!

Acids, bases, alkalis and metals are found in the laboratory and at home. They can be irritant or corrosive and must be handled carefully.
How acid or alkaline a chemical is can be measured on the pH scale, using indicators like litmus and universal indicator. Acids and bases react together to form salts and other products too.

Read through the following extract. How does the writer create an atmosphere of cold and loneliness?
Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness - a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.
The extract describes a cold, empty landscape.
The text states that the trees have been ""stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost"".
The land is described as ""desolate"" and it contains ""a laughter more terrible than any sadness"".
This suggests that the place is completely isolated.
The fact that it seems to be full of terrible laughter suggests it is a very cruel area, which would be hard to explore.
If you are going to use quotations from the extract in your answer, remember to set them out properly. Here are some points to remember:
Quotes of three words or less can be used in the sentence you're writing - for example ...when the writer talks about the ""futility of life"" he means...
Longer quotations need to be included on a line of their own and with a space before it (known as an indent) - for example ...the writer describes the landscape as a ""desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold"" he creates a picture that...
Short, well-chosen quotations are better than long, vague ones.

In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Montagues and Capulets have just had a fight in a public place in Verona. Prince Escalus stopped it and warned that if it happens again, those involved will be punished by death.
The first set scene begins with Montague asking Benvolio how the fight began.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
Benvolio tells him that servants from both families were fighting and that when he tried to stop them, Tybalt turned on him.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.
After that, lots of other people joined in until the Prince came and stopped the fighting.
Lady Montague is worried about her son, Romeo. He wasn't involved in the fighting but she wonders where he is. Benvolio explains that he saw him skulking about before dawn. Montague says that this is not unusual behaviour for Romeo: people have seen him crying and sighing on his own before daybreak before.
The audience finds out a lot about Romeo before he even walks onto the stage. What are your first impressions of Romeo?
Montague says he has tried to talk to his son, but he won't open up to him.
Parents and children - You might be able to sympathise with Romeo not wanting to talk about his feelings with his father.
He says he is like a flower that never gets to open because it has been stopped from blossoming by a worm that has eaten into it.
This is a simile to show that no one can get near to Romeo whilst he is in such a bad mood.
When Romeo arrives, Montague and Lady Montague leave Benvolio to try and find out why he is in such a bad mood all of the time.
- Time - There are lots of references to time in this play. The events in this play take place in just less than one week. Romeo and Juliet both feel that time drags whilst they are apart from one another.
Romeo tries to explain that he is in love with a girl who doesn't love him back. He doesn't make himself very clear though and Benvolio has to work hard to get him to tell him about it. Romeo comes up with lots of confusing descriptions of love to try and explain how he feels.
The list of opposites in Romeo's speech ('loving hate', 'heavy lightness', etc) are called oxymorons. They give us an important clue to his character. His confusing speech shows us how confusing the world is to him as a young man. It also shows us that Romeo likes to play with language.
""Here's much to do with hate, but more with love""
- Love and Hate - Romeo is commenting on the street brawl that has just happened: it's about hating an opposing family and feeling love and loyalty towards their own. Taken on its own, the line sums up the play as a whole: it's about two families that hate each other, but more about the love between Romeo and Juliet.
Romeo speaks in rhyme to try to describe how he feels.
Romeo's speeches are often in rhyme. He also likes wordplay, metaphors and similes. Romeo loves to talk about love, but does he really know what love is at this point? You could say that Romeo, at this point is 'all talk and no action'.
He says that love is like smoke made from the hot breath of lovers and that the flames are the sparks in their eyes. But if it doesn't work out, love is a sea of tears. He also describes love as a kind of madness and a poison.
- Love - The language that Romeo uses to describe love gives us an idea of what Romeo believes love to be at this point. For him it's about desire, which sounds like lust rather than true love.
Benvolio brings Romeo back to earth with a straightforward question: who is the girl he is in love with?
Whilst Romeo is pouring his heart out, Benvolio's responses could be performed in a number of ways- sympathetic, impatient, humorous. All three work.
Romeo still won't give him a straight answer though.
Romeo and Benvolio are good friends. We can see this through the way they banter with one another.
He tells Benvolio that the girl is very beautiful but she doesn't want to fall in love. It seems that she is very pure and Romeo says that because she isn't interested in men, her beauty will be wasted!
- Love - We never meet Rosaline in the play and only have Romeo's description of her to go by. It's hard to tell whether she really is a very good girl or whether she simply doesn't fancy Romeo!
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste
Benvolio says that the best thing to do is to forget her. He advises Romeo to look at other attractive girls. Romeo swears that he can never forget her; he'll never find anyone as beautiful as her. Benvolio bets that he will.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.

The second half of the writing focuses on the points in favour of the healthier options. Again, if you want any further information, click the check ideas button to see our comments.
However, this evidence does not show the whole picture. Many students say they would prefer to see more choice in the canteen. They point out that eating jacket potatoes every day is boring, and that the cold fillings are inadequate in winter. It has been suggested that more sandwiches, salads and a bigger range of hot main meals would be much more appealing. Many of these students currently bring their own food to school simply because they feel there is so little choice. These numbers include Grange High's many vegetarians.
Now the writer moves on to the views in favour of healthy food. The impersonal tone is maintained in the first sentence. The formal connective 'However' is used to signal a change in the argument. The writer returns to the facts - jacket potatoes are the only healthy option - and suggests some alternatives. She builds on the evidence mentioned earlier. She is building up towards her conclusion now.
Nevertheless, it remains true that junk food is popular and easy to produce. If students start going off site they may get injured or into trouble, and the school could be held responsible. Therefore, it seems impractical to ban junk food altogether. But is there another answer? I believe there is: the canteen could offer a wider selection, including healthier options, for one term, and see whether it is successful. If it is, and we see more students using the canteen and eating the healthy options, the canteen could make this change permanent.
This detailed paragraph begins to suggest the solution. Formal connectives are used ('nevertheless' and 'therefore') to signal that the argument is coming to an end. She returns to a personal expression, 'I believe there is...' because she is summing up her findings.
In conclusion, the solution seems clear: if a good selection of food is provided then everyone will be happy - and the canteen will almost certainly gain more customers. Thank you for your time.
The final paragraph is short and direct. It sums up the main conclusion of the speech in a positive way: 'everyone will be happy' and 'the canteen will almost certainly gain...' which leaves the audience with a clear picture of her final point of view. Rather than trying to persuade people one way or the other, the speech has tried to suggest a solution where everyone gains. This isn't always possible, but it can be a helpful way of concluding without sitting on the fence and telling the audience to make up their own minds. As you can probably guess, this is an excellent answer.

They think they are going to drown.
The action moves to an island near where the ship is in trouble. Prospero, a magician, and his daughter Miranda, are living on the island with two others.
One is Ariel (a sprite, or elf-like character) - who'd once been kept in a tree by an evil witch, Sycorax. Prospero had released him from the tree with his magic.
The other is Caliban (big and nasty, the son of Sycorax) - who Prospero had been kind to. Both Ariel and Caliban are Prospero's servants.
Prospero, we now learn, had caused the storm on purpose. It was because of something that had happened long ago, as he tells Miranda ...
Twelve years earlier, he says, Prospero was the much loved Duke of Milan, a great city in Italy. Miranda was a young princess.
Prospero was always reading. This meant that his brother Antonio (who is on the ship in the storm) had so much power that he wanted more, and plotted against Prospero, with the help of the King, Alonso.
One night, Prospero tells Miranda, he and Miranda were seized, and sent out to sea alone in an open boat. They were lucky to survive, although Prospero's magic books were on the boat. Finally they came ashore on the island where they now live.
When his story is over, Prospero makes Miranda sleep before calling for Ariel, to find out how the plans he has made for the ship in the storm are going.

Imagine giving some advice to a friend who is being bullied. You'd probably think of a few ideas very quickly:
You could improve your work by adding other types of sentences. At the moment, it's just a list of orders. What about adding a question or two? Like this:
Why don't you talk to someone at school about it?
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now?
This pushes your friend to think about something. It also gives them the opportunity to start talking about it.
Then you could add a statement or two, like this:
Bullying is more common than many people think.
The worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone.
If we combine these ideas and sentences, we have an interesting and varied piece of writing. All we need to add are some connectives, like 'and', 'but', 'so' or 'because'. Now we have writing that makes a real impact and which can offer advice as well as persuading people, like this:
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now? Why don't you talk to someone at school about it? Because bullying is far more common than many people think. And it is far more serious than many people imagine. In fact, it is one of the main reasons for pupils missing school. But the worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone. So don't suffer in silence, tell your family about it and do something now.

Love is strongly linked to magic. Miranda thinks that Ferdinand is a ""spirit"". He thinks that she is a ""goddess"". It is strongly suggested that their love at first sight is simply an illusion.
Miranda and Ferdinand's speeches are very honest and loving. Ferdinand is ""humble"", whilst Miranda talks of her ""modesty"".
When Prospero describes love he uses terms linked to control, e.g ""They are both in either's powers""; his daughter will ""control"" Ferdinand.
Prospero recognises that Miranda and Ferdinand's love is real and beyond their control. He compares it to a disease. He says his daughter is ""infected"".
There are lots of references to freedom and slavery. Prospero promises to free Ariel; he threatens to ""manacle"" Ferdinand. Ferdinand doesn't mind being a slave as long as he has Miranda to love.
Ferdinand uses a metaphor linked to slavery to describe his past crushes. He admits that he only suffers the indignity of being Prospero's slave for Miranda's sake.
The exchanges between characters are short to speed up the action.
The speeches between Miranda and Ferdinand are much longer. The content is moving and romantic.

Variation and classification - Continuous & discontinuous
Some of the features of the different organisms in a species show continuous variation, and some features show discontinuous variation.
Human height is an example of continuous variation. Height ranges from that of the shortest person in the world to that of the tallest person. Any height is possible between these values. So it is continuous variation.
For any species a characteristic that changes gradually over a range of values shows continuous variation. Examples of such characteristics are:
If you record the heights of a group of people and draw a graph of your results, it usually looks something like this:
The more people you measure, and the smaller the categories you use, the closer the results will be to the curved line. This shape of graph is typical of a feature with continuous variation. Weight and foot length would give graphs similar in shape to this.
Human blood group is an example of discontinuous variation. There are only 4 types of blood group. There are no other possibilities and there are no values in between. So this is discontinuous variation.
A characteristic of any species with only a limited number of possible values shows discontinuous variation. Here are some examples:

Human behaviour is affected by many variables. It can be more difficult to study than the behaviour of other animals.
Fieldwork does not always mean you have to work in a field. It means investigations that take place outside the laboratory.
Some scientists spend many hours watching and studying the behaviour of animals. They may be interested in how the animals live alone, group into families or form large groups such as herds.
Scientists can tag sharks to study their behaviour.
Animals can signal to each other. For example, they may call to each other to warn of danger. Some scientists are interested in such signals. They record and study them to try to work out what the signals mean.
Some animals migrate over large distances to find food or nesting sites.
Animals can be tagged by attaching tracking devices to them. Tagging lets scientists follow the journeys the animals make.
The work of Lorentz and Pavlov has been mentioned in this Revision Bite. These scientists studied animal behaviour under controlled conditions.
The behaviour of woodlice is often studied in schools. Several woodlice are put into a choice chamber with four different conditions:
The woodlice are left on their own for a while, and then the number of animals in each quarter is counted. Woodlice prefer dark and damp conditions. The quarter of the choice chamber with these conditions contains most or all of the woodlice.

Romeo and Juliet first key extract - Performance
When you write about performance, mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:
haracters and how you respond to them
anguage used - the detail about love, for example
ssues and ideas - like time, love and hate
Once you understand how the audience should feel, you can decide how you might direct a particular scene. Remember, there are lots of different ways to perform the same scene. A good answer depends on how well you explain yourself.
Here is an example of an answer to a question about performance. Think about how you might answer the same question.
How should an actor playing Benvolio behave?
Benvolio's replies to Romeo could either show that he is a good listener who wants to understand his friend's problems, or that he is amused by what Romeo has to say because he knows that his friend is not serious about this girl.
When Benvolio speaks to Montague, the mood is serious. When Romeo arrives, he has to ask lots of questions because Romeo is evasive. Some of Benvolio's comments could be said in a sarcastic or sympathetic way. The jokes that the two characters share show that they are good friends. Benvolio gives advice at the end of the scene that shows that he doesn't believe Romeo's love for Rosaline is serious.
The way Benvolio behaves towards Romeo shapes the way the audience perceives Romeo. This is important because Romeo is the main character. The audience has to like him and worry about him for the tragedy to work. If the actor playing Benvolio speaks his lines in a patient and sympathetic way, it makes Romeo seem like a young man who finds the world confusing. If Benvolio's lines are spoken humorously, the comedy in Romeo's speeches will be brought to life.

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to advise
Once you can argue and persuade, it should be easy to advise. The trick is to be gentle - it's no good pushing your ideas at your readers, or trying to impress them. Instead, you should come across as friendly, as someone who just wants to help.
For instance, imagine you're writing to advise someone in Year 9 who is moving house and has to change schools. We know that it won't be easy - they'll have to make new friends and cope with all sorts of changes. So you need to be sympathetic and give some ideas you think could help.
The first thing might be to plan each main idea in a separate paragraph because it's easier to follow like this. Then think about how you want to present your ideas. It might be fine to give some information as an order, such as:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone.
You can add information to this - perhaps explaining why and giving an example of what to do, so now your paragraph looks like this:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone. Most people will be glad to help and it's the quickest way to make friends. You can ask a teacher, but it might be better to ask one of the other pupils. Choose a friendly face if you can, and don't be shy - it might be their first day too.
It is not just the information that makes this a good piece of advice, it's also the style. It includes words like ""might"" and ""can"". These make the ideas softer - they are not in your face and pushing you to agree, they just guide you. And they are very simple to use, so make sure you include words like ""should, can, could, might, ought to and may"" - each one turns an idea into a piece of advice.

Avoid using: 'And', 'But', 'Because' or 'So' at the beginning of a sentence.
Words like 'nice' and 'a lot' have no power. Try to think of more descriptive words eg 'delicious' or 'endless'.

In the First Key Extract, Romeo claimed to be in love with a girl called Rosaline. By the early hours of the very next morning, in the Second Key Extract, Romeo is exchanging ""love's faithful vows"" with Juliet.
It could be said that when it comes to relationships, Romeo isn't very faithful. On the other hand, perhaps he has found his soul mate in Juliet.
Romeo seemed to be in love with the idea of love, perhaps even more than he was in love with Rosaline. Apart from saying that she was beautiful, he wasn't very complimentary about her personality.
Romeo is besotted by Juliet; the fact that she is beautiful plays a big part.
Romeo loves the language of love. His speeches are full of confusing imagery as he tries to work out just exactly what love is.
Romeo tries to impress Juliet with his poetic descriptions about love. Juliet's words somehow seem more heartfelt than Romeo's clever poetry.
Montague and Benvolio discuss how moody Romeo has been lately. When he enters the scene, the audience can see for themselves how his mood can swing from despair to humour and back again.
Juliet is a deeply emotional person and is open about her feelings from the start. Romeo seems to get caught up in that wave of her emotion. They go from being complete strangers to committed lovers in a matter of hours.
Romeo stubbornly swears that he could never love anyone other than Rosalinebut as we see in the Second Key Extract, by the very next morning he is planning his wedding to Juliet.
Both characters make decisions quickly and take risks lightly. Romeo and Juliet could both be described as impulsive in their actions.

This is a natural response to a stimulus - food makes a dog's mouth water. The saliva produced is needed to start digesting food and to make swallowing food easier.
Pavlov noticed that they also did this when the person who fed them came into the room, even if the person had not brought any food. Pavlov went on to ring a bell at the start of feeding time, and eventually the dogs produced extra saliva when they heard the bell, before any food was brought in.

rubbish is important because fewer landfill sites are needed, and the materials in the rubbish are re-used.

Other plants die as a result. They use up oxygen as they rot away, and fish and other animals suffocate. This process is called eutrophication.
Smoke from burning fuels makes buildings turn black. With other waste chemicals in the air, it can form smog. This makes the air hazy, especially over large towns and cities. The polluted air can make it difficult to breathe.

Magnets and electric current - Magnetic fields
Before we look at electromagnets let's recap
They fill the space around a magnet where the magnetic forces work, where they can attract or repel magnetic materials.
Although we cannot see magnetic fields, we can detect them using
. The tiny pieces of iron line up in a magnetic field.
It would be difficult to draw the results from the sort of experiment seen in the photograph, so we draw simple magnetic field lines instead.
the field lines have arrows on them
the field lines come out of N and go into S
the field lines are more concentrated at the poles.
The magnetic field is strongest at the poles, where the field lines are most concentrated.

The magnetic field around an electromagnet is just the same as the one around a bar magnet. It can, however, be reversed by turning the battery around.
Unlike bar magnets, which are permanent magnets, the magnetism of electromagnets can be turned on and off just by closing or opening the switch.

When you explain, you don't just write information - you also need to give
. In very basic terms you can think of the difference between informing and explaining in terms of answering a slightly different set of questions:
Explain = What? When? Who? Where? How? Why?
This difference is reflected in the question you will be asked, so our question about the leaflet might look a little different now:
Write a leaflet for both the pupils and their parents, outlining some of the main features of school life in Year 7 and beyond. In particular, explain why pupils have several teachers each day and why the detention system is used.
This is a little harder than the earlier version, but it's still about your school. Therefore, you still need lots of information about the classes, the organisation and the timetable. So you could still use our two basic approaches, timelines and topic centres, like this:
However, you can also put these together, like this:
Now, we can see a number of topics, so perhaps the three big circles represent registration, lesson times and detentions. They occur in that order each day, but the reasons for them are very different. So the smaller circles answer how and why as well as what, when and who. For instance, what are detentions? When do they take place? Who is in charge of them? How do pupils get put in detention? Why does the school use detentions?
This approach gives your answer a very clear structure. The writing deals with a number of subjects in turn and each subject should be in its own paragraph. You can add details and explanations as you write out each paragraph. It makes it easier for you to write and easier for your audience to read or listen to.

Romeo and his friends have left the Capulets' party. Romeo has run away from his friends. Mercutio has been shouting rude jokes because he thinks that Romeo has gone off with Rosaline. Mercutio and Benvolio finally give up looking for him and go home.
The second set extract begins with Romeo hiding from Mercutio and Benvolio in Juliet's garden. Romeo thinks to himself that Mercutio can never understand how he feels because he has never been in love.
""He jests at scars that never felt a wound""
He watches Juliet as she stands on her balcony thinking out loud. He thinks that she is like the sun
Romeo uses lots of words and images that relate to light when he describes Juliet.: 'sun', 'stars' 'brightness'.
and that the moon is jealous of her because she is so beautiful. He says that her eyes are like two stars that are so bright that they would stop night-time from being dark if they were in heaven, and the birds would sing because they would think that night was day.
Romeo uses more words and images to do with light to describe Juliet.
He idolises her and compares her to an angel.
When Romeo says that Juliet is like an angel from heaven, on the one hand, he is saying how lovely she is. On the other hand, you could say that he doesn't really see her as a flesh and blood person. He idolises her. Do you believe that he can really love her when he doesn't actually know anything about her? Or do you believe in love at first sight?
Juliet, not realising that Romeo is hiding in her garden, imagines what she would say to Romeo if he were there. She says out loud that she wishes he wasn't a Montague, but says that it doesn't really matter because she loves him anyway, and hopes that he loves her. After all, a name is just a word; it doesn't really mean that much.
If we used another word for a rose instead of the word 'rose', eg 'poo', the rose would still be a rose, it wouldn't smell like poo just because we used that word. In the same way, Romeo is still lovely even though his name is Montague.
When Juliet is thinking these things aloud on her balcony, she doesn't know that anyone else is watching. Have you ever practiced saying something to someone, even though you know that you would never be brave enough to say it?
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet
When Romeo replies, Juliet nearly jumps out of her skin.
""My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself""
When Romeo calls her 'dear saint', Juliet realizes who he is. Romeo called her 'dear saint' at the party.
Juliet is very worried for Romeo's safety; he is a Montague on Capulet property. Romeo uses very poetic and exaggerated language to describe how he managed to climb over the walls.
Romeo has been quite brave and perhaps foolish to break into Juliet's garden. He likes to takes risks and doesn't think clearly about the seriousness of his actions. He uses poetic language to exaggerate his bravery.
He declares that he'd rather die than live never having the opportunity to love Juliet.
Juliet admits that she is embarrassed that Romeo heard the things that she was saying about him. She asks him if he loves her too, but she doesn't give him the chance to answer.
Juliet is worried that she has shown herself to be too keen on Romeo. In Shakespeare's day, nice girls weren't supposed to show that they were interested in boys.
Juliet's speech is very long! Is she nervous or embarrassed? Is she a chatterbox? Is she so excited about her new love that she can't stop talking about it?
Romeo begins to use poetic language about the moon to describe how much he loves her, but Juliet won't let him finish.
Time - Juliet won't let Romeo finish his sentences! Poor Romeo! We already know how much he loves to speak! Juliet's mind is working very quickly. She is excited, but also worried about how suddenly they have fallen in love.
She says that if he swears by the moon, he might turn out to be just as changeable as the moon (the moon changes its shape throughout the month).
She worries that they have fallen in love so quickly.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.
She tries to say goodnight, but she is excited and passionate about her feelings for Romeo and can't seem to stop talking about it.
""My bounty is as boundless as the sea.
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite""
Juliet's use of imagery seems more heartfelt than Romeo's: her love is as deep as the sea, and the sea never runs out. That's passion!
Juliet's Nurse shouts to her from inside the house. Juliet asks Romeo to wait. As she goes into her bedroom, Romeo thinks to himself that their love seems like a dream.
Love - Is this true love? How could it have happened so quickly? Do you believe in 'love at first sight'? Remember, that same evening that he met and fell in love with Juliet, Romeo was moping about saying that he would never love anyone as much as he loved Rosaline! Romeo might argue though that he didn't really know what true love was until he met Juliet.
Juliet comes back out onto the balcony and tells Romeo that if he is serious about her, she will send a messenger out to him tomorrow to find out where and what time they will get married!
Time - events happen very quickly in this play. In less than a week, Romeo and Juliet fall in love, get married and die.
She says goodnight to him as her Nurse impatiently tells her to come inside.
Romeo finds it hard to say goodnight to her.
Romeo said that he was in love with Rosaline in the first extract. Less than a day later, he claims to be in love with Juliet. Has he really thought about the consequences of marrying Juliet. Perhaps, when you are in love, nothing else matters. What do you think?

Here are some extra tips for group presentations:
Organise the presentation fairly between each group member - ensure that everyone gets their chance to present. If you're shy, don't hide behind your group - you need to take part too!
A group presention needs to come across as a team effort - be careful not to allow over enthusiastic members to dominate.
Work together - if one person is speaking, another person can point to relevant visual aids.
You may be asked to find a poem or an extract from a story to read aloud to your class. Here are some tips to help you with reading aloud:
If you can choose a text you are familiar with this will probably boost your confidence.
Practise your reading using gestures and movement, and don't be tempted to hide behind your book.
Try to look up from your reading several times and make eye contact with your audience.
Vary your pitch and tone and make it relevant to your subject matter. If you're reading something spooky, try to reflect this in your voice. If you're reading a conversation between two characters, attempt to distinguish their voices.
Think about volume and pace - ensure that your audience can hear you clearly.

Prospero is in control of the action. He even slows the pace down at one point to suit his own ends. He could be compared to Shakespeare, moving the plot forward and molding events.
Prospero watches from a distance and comments occasionally but does not interfere. It is as though he is part of the audience.
Is a more gentle and humorous end to what has been a very tense and action-packed scene.
A moving and romantic extract that contrasts with the scene before it which is full of Mercutio's rude jokes.
Ariel is present at the beginning. Prospero uses magic to prevent Ferdinand from using his sword. Ferdinand seems to submit very quickly at the end of this extract, as though magic may have had some part to play.
There is no sign of magic in this extract. The setting is very ordinary as Ferdinand carries logs to Prospero's cave. Any ""magic"" that exists is in the form of the power of love.
Both Ferdinand and Miranda seem bewildered by their feelings.
Ferdinand and Miranda are bursting to reveal their true feelings to each other.

If you get a question about characters in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE (see page 2) to help with the middle part of your answer:
Do you think Romeo knows what love is?
Romeo is obviously a very sensitive young man. He seems to be exploring the idea of love. He may well long to be in love. Some of his ideas about love are confused and confusing.
Romeo does not join in with the street brawl and is sad that the violence takes place. He says that he understands that the violence is more to do with love and loyalty towards family than it is to do with hatred. He has been unhappy for some time and his family is worried. When Romeo talks to Benvolio, he finds it difficult to make himself clear. He is more interested in using language cleverly. When he uses oxymorons like 'heavy lightness' it is as though he isn't really sure what love is. When he talks about Rosaline, he focuses on her beauty. He says he loves her, but he is annoyed by her virtuous personality.
Romeo lives amongst people who will kill others and risk their own lives for the sake of their own family, so he knows about passion. The fact that he won't talk to his father about why he is unhappy isn't very loving. Romeo talks about love in an abstract way. He likes the idea of love, and he might have been influenced by what poets have said about love. It could be argued that if Romeo really loved Rosaline, then he would respect her wishes to remain a virgin. Towards the end of the extract, Romeo seems more interested in sex than true love.

The part that illusion has to play
The example below is about power. Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on how the characters talk about magic and illusion
Prospero is a controlling character who seems to be obsessed with power and status. Ferdinand is a prince, but he has no status on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero pretends not to believe that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne of Naples and insists on taking him prisoner. He calls him a ""spy"", a ""traitor"", and an ""impostor"". He accuses him of lying. He threatens to ""manacle"" him and starve him. He uses his magic powers to prevent Ferdinand from defending himself. He also has control over Ariel and even talks about how his daughter will have ""control"" over Ferdinand when he falls in love with her.
Prospero is only pretending to be cruel and unwelcoming to Ferdinand as part of his plan, but it seems as though he is enjoying himself in the process. Even Miranda is alarmed at his behaviour.
The extract seems to suggest that Miranda and Ferdinand's love for each other will turn out to have a power that is stronger even than Prospero's magic.

Romeo pays Balthasar off and breaks into the Capulet tomb. Paris tries to stop him. Romeo begs him to leave him alone, but Paris thinks he is vandalising the tomb. They fight. Romeo kills Paris. Just before Paris dies he asks Romeo to place him next to Juliet's body. Romeo is sad that he had to kill Paris and takes him into the tomb to be near Juliet.
When Romeo sees Juliet lying in the tomb, he can't believe that she is dead because she looks so beautiful. He hugs her and kisses her. He takes the poison then kisses her again and dies.
Friar Lawrence finds the bodies of Paris and Romeo just as Juliet is about to wake up. Juliet wakes up and asks the Friar where Romeo is. He hears a noise and begs Juliet to come away with him, but when she finds out that Romeo is dead, she refuses to go with him. Friar Lawrence runs away.
Juliet tries to kiss the poison off Romeo's lips. His lips are still warm, but there is not enough poison left on them to kill her. She takes his dagger and stabs herself.
Some watchmen discover the bodies outside the tomb. They also find the Friar who is crying and shaking. Prince Escalus and Juliet's mother and father arrive with Romeo's father. Friar Lawrence tells them all the truth about the wedding and their children's deaths. He feels so guilty that he asks the Prince to punish him, but Prince Escalus won't because the Friar is a holy man. Prince Escalus blames Montague and Capulet, but he also blames himself for not doing enough to stop the violence. Capulet and Montague decide to end their rift. Montague offers to have a statue of Juliet made. The play ends as the Prince says that this is the saddest story ever told.

To add and subtract numbers always begin counting from zero.
When dealing with positive numbers count to the right.
When dealing with negative numbers count to the left.
Imagine moving up and down a number line to get to the answer.
Starting from zero, count up to 4. Then subtract 5. Then subtract 3. The answer is -4.
Calculate: - 2 + 9 - 10 + 6
If you wrote the answer 3 or +3, then well done!
When adding or subtracting negative numbers, remember that when two signs appear next to each other and are different, then you subtract. When two signs are next to each other and they are the same, you add:
a) 10 + - 7 = 10 - 7 = 3
b) 4 - -3 = 4 + 3 = 7

Solids cannot flow because their particles are only able to vibrate and cannot move from place to place.
Liquids can flow because their particles can move over each other. When water is poured into a glass, the particles of water move over each other and into the corners of the glass. The particles keep on moving over each other as the water takes the shape of the glass. The animation shows how this works.

Gases can flow because their particles can move in all directions. When a Bunsen burner is connected to a gas tap and turned on, natural gas flows through the rubber tubing.

Measures of average - Mean and modal class
Calculating the mean and modal class for grouped data is very similar to finding the mean from an ungrouped frequency table, except that you do not have all the information about the data within the groups so can only estimate the mean.
This table shows the weights of children in a class.
To estimate the mean weight, you know that 7 children are between 30kg and 40kg, but you don't know exactly how much they weigh, so assume that they all weigh 35kg (the midpoint of the group).

Using laboratory techniques scientists can alter the genetic code within the DNA of a living organism. They can add genes from a different species to an organism's DNA
For example, GM can be used to alter the DNA in a bacterium so that it produces insulin. This is a human hormone and valuable to people with diabetes. Bacteria reproduce quickly, so a lot of insulin can be made quickly and used to help people suffering from diabetes.
Some people are concerned that there may be negative aspects to GM.
For example, there are people that believe GM is unethical and should be banned.
Other people are concerned that there may be unexpected long term problems of using GM, producing changes that could not be reversed. Such changes could create new pathogens or ""superweeds"" by the GM organisms breeding with other species. This could cause the natural balance of living organisms in the environment to be upset.
Scientists, society and individuals need to think about the advantages and disadvantages of genetic engineering.

When Ariel brings the men back, Prospero places them in a magic circle. After telling them off for the wrong things they have done, he releases them from his spell, so they can now wake up.

The two extracts deal with some deep issues. You will need to discuss how these are brought out. Some of the 'big' themes are:
If the question asks you to comment on how the theme of power is explored, consider these points:
In the first extract, Ariel's songs calm the storm and make Ferdinand believe that his father is dead. This puts Ferdinand in a weak position which makes it easier for Prospero to manipulate him. Ariel's magic powers are responsible for much of what happens in the play.
Ariel only performs his magic so that he can win his freedom. Prospero has power over Ariel because Ariel owes him a debt of gratitude.
It could be argued that Prospero's assertion of power and authority over Ferdinand is unnecessarily harsh.
Prospero is obsessed with power and authority having had his title taken from him by his brother Antonio.
As a prince, Ferdinand's royal power becomes redundant on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero sees Miranda and Ferdinand's love as a power that he can use to manipulate Ferdinand.
Miranda seems powerless under her father's control on the island. She rebels against him, but even her rebellion was part of Prospero's plan.
Miranda and Ferdinand's love is a power that exists independently of magic.

A simple sentence generally has one main verb and communicates one idea. For example:
There can be several words in the verb, so
- has two words in the verb.
- has three words in the verb.
However, in each example there is just one main verb and idea. This is the simplest type of sentence and usually it's very easy to understand.
A compound sentence generally joins two simple sentences together. We typically use words like 'and', 'or' and 'but' to join the ideas. For example:
It was cold but we still went to town.
It was raining and we stayed indoors.
This makes the two ideas equal in the sentence - if we take away one part of it, we are left with a simple sentence again. These are very common when we are speaking and they are not difficult to understand.
A complex sentence communicates more than one idea, so it's like a compound sentence in a way. However, the ideas are not equal. This is because one part is like a simple sentence, so it can stand on its own. The other part can't - it needs something else to support it. For instance, look at this sentence:
You can't persuade me to go to town, no matter how hard you try.
We can take away the first part, but then we are left with:
Now this is not a simple sentence and it doesn't stand on its own - it needs something else to make sense.
We use complex sentences a lot when we speak, but it's important to use them in our writing too. In fact, these are the most difficult sentences to get right.

Here is the opening paragraph of a text about boxing:
Boxing, amongst other hand-to-hand fighting, has been with us for thousands of years. Originally it was nothing more than bare fist fighting between two willing, and sometimes unwilling, competitors for the entertainment of others. Some people argue that it is a relatively safe, disciplined, highly skilled and technical sport that brings enjoyment and employment to a great many people. Others claim that it is a dangerous and barbaric spectacle that has no place in the civilised world. This article will explore each side's claim in more detail.
Why is this an effective opening for the text?
It is totally in keeping with the title.
It uses a formal, impersonal tone, which is appropriate for an argument text.
It gives a summary of both sides of the argument.
Let's consider some alternative beginnings and see if they are suitable. Decide what you think of each one and then read our comments below.
This article will talk about the damage that can be inflicted when two men stand face-to-face with the sole intention of knocking each other out with their fists. It will go on to argue that boxing, or legitimate assault, has no place in the twenty first century.
This extract certainly gets straight to the point. Although this beginning is quite formal, it is certainly not impersonal as the writer lets the reader know exactly what they think about boxing. The reader can be sure about what the answer to the question in the title will be from the first sentence.
The bell goes and the two warriors approach each other. They are quick. They are strong. They are hard. They are ready to hurt and be hurt.
A left fist launches and connects with a nose. The crowd are on their feet. Cheering. Wanting more. Wanting blood.
This is prose rather than a non-fictional argument. It uses descriptive and figurative language. It could be the opening of a short story or a novel.

We can show photosynthesis in a word equation, where light energy is shown in brackets because it is not a substance:

The oxygen produced is released into the air from the leaves. The glucose produced can be turned into other substances, such as starch, which is used as a store of energy. This energy can be released by

During the past three years, mobile phones have become more and more popular. Growing numbers of our students bring them to school, and parents encourage this as they can stay in touch with their children and know they are safe. However, many of our students keep their phone on during the day which can disturb lessons. A number of phone thefts have also occurred recently, both in and out of school. I would like to call a meeting to discuss this issue with staff, parents and students. I don't want to ban them, but we must agree on how they can be used sensibly and safely.

Different planets take different amounts of time to make one complete turn, so they have different lengths of day.
The Sun lights up one half of the Earth, and the other half is in shadow. As the Earth spins we move from shadow to light and back to shadow and so on. It is daytime in the UK when our part of the planet is in the lit by the Sun. And it is night-time in the UK when our part of the planet is facing away from the Sun.

The simplest complete circuit is a piece of wire from one end of a battery to the other. An electric current can flow in the wire from one end of the battery to the other, but nothing useful happens. The wire just gets hot and the battery goes flat.
To do something useful with the electric current, we need to put an electrical

Ariel tells Prospero what has happened to the ship and its passengers and crew. He tells how he appeared on the ship as a flame (he is after all a magic spirit), and frightened the passengers so much that they had jumped in to the sea. Only the crew remained on the ship.
Prospero wants to be sure that the crew and the passengers are safe. Ariel tells him how he saw to it that the passengers were washed up on the island in separate groups. He made sure the ship was safe, and that the crew were sleeping peacefully. He had sent the rest of the fleet back to Naples, with everyone believing that their king's ship had been sunk, and its passengers drowned.
Ariel now changes the subject, and says he's getting impatient. He reminds Prospero there is a time limit on how long he had to be Prospero's servant, after his release from Sycorax's spell. Ariel wants his freedom, and reminds Prospero that he's been a good servant.

Prospero, in reply, reminds Ariel of the horror he was released from. He tells him that he needs him to work for two more days and then he will be free. Prospero sends him off to keep watch over the washed-up passengers.

Food chains - Getting carbon dioxide, light and water
Remember that the equation for photosynthesis is:
carbon dioxide + water (+ light energy)
Let's see how plants get the carbon dioxide and water they need for this process.
Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves. The carbon dioxide
through small holes in the underside of the leaf called stomata. (One of these holes is called a stoma. The plural is stomata.)
The lower part of the leaf has loose-fitting cells, to allow carbon dioxide to reach the other cells in the leaf. This also allow the oxygen produced in photosynthesis to leave the leaf easily.
A leaf usually has a large surface area, so that it can absorb a lot of light. Its top surface is protected from water loss, disease and weather damage by a waxy layer.
The upper part of the leaf is where the light falls, and it contains a type of cell called a
. This is adapted to absorb a lot of light. It has lots of chloroplasts and is shaped like a tall box.
Turgid plant that's watered regularly and a flacid plant without enough water.
Plants get the water they need for photosynthesis through their roots.
The roots have a type of cell called a root hair cell - these project out from the root into the soil. Roots have a big surface area and thin walls, which allow water to pass into them easily.
Note that root cells do not contain chloroplasts, as they are normally in the dark and cannot photosynthesise.
The water absorbed by the root hair cells passes through the plant in
tubes, and eventually reachers the leaves. If a plant does not absorb enough water, it will wilt or go floppy. Without water it may also not photosynthesise quickly enough, and it may die.

Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.
For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.
By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.
You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:
Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:
In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:
To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:
Divide both sides by 2, to give:
a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7
b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7
When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers.
For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7.
7 + 5 does equal 12, so your answer is correct.

Remember that iron and sulfur react together when they are heated to make a compound called iron sulfide. What are the differences between a mixture of iron and sulfur, and iron sulfide? Here are some of them:
The mixture can contain more or less iron, but iron sulfide always contains equal amounts of iron and sulfur.
The iron and sulfur atoms are not joined together in the mixture, but they are joined together in iron sulfide.
The iron and sulfur still behave like iron and sulfur in the mixture, but iron sulfide has different properties from both iron and sulfur.
You can separate the iron from the mixture using a magnet but this does not work for iron sulfide.

The two extracts deal with some deep issues. You will need to discuss how these are brought out. Some of the 'big' themes are:
If the question asks you to comment on how the theme of time is explored, consider these points:
Montague and Benvolio discuss the ""ancient quarrel"" and how it escalated so swiftly because of the quick tempers of servants from each opposing family along with Tybalt's ""fiery"" reaction.
Time passes slowly for Romeo whilst he is in a bad mood. He hides himself away during the daytime.
Romeo is impatient to have a physical relationship and does not want to wait for Rosaline.
Romeo gets over Rosaline quickly and falls for Juliet suddenly. Juliet falls in love just as quickly with Romeo.
Having spent one evening together they are planning their wedding for the next day.
Can love happen so quickly? Maybe Romeo and Juliet have not considered the consequences of their relationship so it was bound to go wrong from the start. Or maybe this a classic example of love at first sight: sudden, powerful, and beyond the control.

What sort of atmosphere is Wells trying to create and how does he use figurative language to do this?
The writer is trying to create an atmosphere of fear and tension in the extract. He describes the passage as being ""draughty"" and mentions that it is underground. This makes it seem creepy and ghostly. The fact that the character only has a candle to light his way makes the story seem old-fashioned, and also creates drama because we know that the draught could blow it out! The way the echoes ""rang up and down"" and the fact that the man stops because he thinks he hears a sound, adds to the ghostly effects.
The shadows also help to create a sinister atmosphere as they flicker around and make it even harder for the man to see what's ahead. The writer uses figurative language such as personification to describe them. He says that they ""cower and quiver"", come ""sweeping up"" and that they ""fled"". All of this makes them sound alive, or perhaps like ghosts. The words used are all linked with fear, so that even the shadows seem to be afraid of what's in the corridor. This is very eerie and helps to create a very tense atmosphere.

If you are given a question about the language in this Key Extract, here is how to use
(see page 2) to help with the middle part of your answer:
When talking about language, the things to concentrate on are:
Whether there might be another meaning behind the first most obvious one
The example below is about the language of love. Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on Romeo's descriptions of love.
Love is an excellent subject for poets. Romeo enjoys using lots of different poetic devices to explore the idea of love.
The idea of love seems to be making Romeo's brain ache. He comes up with a list of oxymorons (pairs of opposite words eg 'loving hate') to try and find the right definition of love. He makes up some vivid metaphors for love, but comes closer with his descriptions to lust. He thinks love is a kind of madness or even a poison. He thinks that he loves Rosaline. He compares her to a Roman goddess and complains that Cupid keeps missing her heart with his arrows. He focuses on her beauty and talks about his problems getting her to love him back as though it is a kind of battle.
At this point in the play, Romeo doesn't seem to understand what true love is. It is possible that he has got some of his romantic ideas from stories. He likes talking about love, but some of his opinions don't sound very loving. We never meet Rosaline in the play, but you may think to yourself that she is wise not to encourage Romeo's advances. They don't sound respectful or honourable. In fact, it could be argued that Romeo's ideas about love are funny or silly, and show him up to be immature and shallow.

Romeo and his friends decide to gate-crash the party. Romeo has a bad feeling about the outcome of this evening, but decides to let fate take its course.
Capulet is having a great time at his party. People are dancing. Romeo and his friends arrive wearing masks. Romeo spots Juliet. He thinks to himself that he didn't really know what true beauty was until he saw her. He doesn't know that she is a Capulet. Tybalt recognises Romeo from his voice and threatens to kill him because he is a Montague, but Capulet stops him. Romeo and Juliet flirt and finally kiss. The Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet and he is dismayed. He leaves with Benvolio. Juliet is distraught when the Nurse tells her who Romeo is.
The Chorus recaps events for us: Romeo has forgotten Rosaline and is now in love with Juliet. Juliet feels the same way.
Romeo runs away from his friends. Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline.
Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom. Juliet doesn't know that he is there at first and, talking to herself, declares her love for him. She is shocked and embarrassed when he replies. They have only met that evening, but they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and what time their wedding will be! They find it difficult to part.
Romeo goes to see Friar Lawrence, the priest, who is worried that he has spent the night with Rosaline. When Romeo says that he wants to marry Juliet, Friar Lawrence tells him off for falling in love so easily, but agrees to the wedding because he thinks that it might be a solution to the rift between the Capulets and the Montagues.

Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew. Were you by when it began?
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
I drew to part them. In the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
O where is Romeo? Saw you him today?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun
Peered forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad 
That westward rooteth from this city side,
So early walking did I see your son.
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood.
I, measuring his affections by my own,
Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Being one too many by my weary self,
And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
I neither know it, nor can learn of him.
Have you importuned him by any means?
Both by myself and many other friends:
Is to himself  I will not say how true 
But to himself so secret and so close,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.
See where he comes. So please you, step aside.
Ill know his grievance or be much denied.
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, lets away.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeos hours?
Not having that which, having, makes them short.
Out of her favour where I am in love.
Alas, that Love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Alas, that Love, whose view is muffled still,
Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Heres much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs:
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers eyes;
Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.
What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.
This is not Romeo: hes some other where.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will 
A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.
A right good mark-man! And shes fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Well, in that hit you miss. Shell not be hit
With Cupids arrow. She hath Dians wit,
And in strong proof of chastity well-armed,
From Loves weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide th encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
O, she is rich in beauty  only poor
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
Be ruled by me: forget to think of her.
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
To call hers  exquisite  in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing fair:
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who passed that passing fair?
Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
Ill pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

396,"> Writer's tricks - Persuading the reader
Some persuasive texts aim simply at persuading us to do something, particularly charity leaflets, holiday brochures and adverts. Others may try in more subtle ways; newspaper and magazine articles may try to persuade us to agree with a certain view.
Try to convince us to do or agree with something, such as spending money or agreeing with a certain belief.
Contain a mixture of fact and opinion.
Emphasise key points by using subheadings, repetition, memorable phrases and emotive language.
Often use a personal style so that the text seems to speak directly to the reader.
Show clear links between points, such as ""if you donate 20 you will be helping a sick animal"" or ""using our deodorant will attract women"".
Stories can also be persuasive as well. A writer may want you to like or dislike a character. The way that they describe a character can persuade you to do either of these. Look at this extract from 'Jane Eyre':
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at the table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye with flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mamma had taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate health'.
How does Charlotte Bront try to persuade, or convince, us that John Reed is an unpleasant character in this paragraph?
She makes him sound unattractive, with his ""dingy and unwholesome skin"" and ""heavy limbs"".
She suggests that he is greedy as he ""gorged himself habitually at the table"". She suggests that this is why he is so unhealthy, so that we don't feel sorry for him.
She makes him sound spoilt because his mother is keeping him home from school, even though his so-called ""delicate health"" is his own fault.

271,"> Preparing, planning and checking - Punctuation
The most important thing with punctuation is to make sure your sentences are correctly marked at the start and end:
The starts are easy; they should all have capital letters.
The endings have full stops (or the equivalent, such as question marks). However, endings cannot have commas. Commas are only used inside sentences, never right at the end of one.
One quick way to check is to read your work to yourself (it doesn't have to be aloud). If you 'run out of breath' or need to pause in your reading to add emphasis, ask yourself whether a comma or a full stop is needed. If so, put one in.
Other areas which often cause problems are:
If you have included the actual words that somebody speaks, make sure you put them inside speech marks. Remember to close the speech marks as well as open them!
Always use question marks when writing a question whether it is direct or rhetorical. Look out for rhetorical questions in persuasive texts eg ""How long will it be until all our countryside is destroyed?"". Writers use rhetorical questions to emphasise a point and they do not expect the reader to genuinely answer the question.
Be careful when using exclamation marks as overusing them can spoil a text. They should be used only to show excitement, surprise, shock or humour eg ""Stop the car!"" she yelled.
To show when a letter has been missed out:
Remember: ask your teacher for some advice if you feel unsure about any aspect of punctuation.

Ariel brings Ferdinand (the King's son) to Prospero's cave. Ferdinand thinks he's the only survivor from the shipwreck. Miranda, who has seen no other man but her father during her time on the island, sees Ferdinand and thinks he must be a spirit - while Ferdinand thinks Miranda is a goddess. The two young people fall in love, but Prospero is not pleased, and makes Ferdinand his prisoner.
On another part of the island we discover one of the groups of shipwreck survivors. They begin to wake up. They're surprised that their clothes seem fresh and new.
Ariel's magical song puts them to sleep again - all except Sebastian (the King's brother) and Antonio (Prospero's brother). Antonio convinces Sebastian that they should kill the King (Alonso) so that Sebastian can take his place. Fortunately everyone else wakes up again, before they can carry out their plan.
Elsewhere on the island, Trinculo, a jester who was on board the ship, comes across Caliban. Trinculo's drunken friend Stephano turns up, and gives Caliban strong alcohol. This makes Caliban believe that Stephano is more powerful than Prospero (who Caliban hates).
Meanwhile, Ariel, who has made himself invisible, watches the three drunken clowns. He causes havoc by whispering the accusation ""thou liest"" in Caliban's ear, then Stephano's. They become confused and fight.
Caliban reveals his plans to destroy Prospero and take over the island. Stephano drunkenly agrees. Caliban is delighted that Stephano has agreed to his plan and they sing to celebrate. Ariel plays a tune to accompany their singing which frightens both Trinculo and Stephano.
Caliban tells them not to be afraid in a moving speech that describes the beauty and magic of the island. Stephano, Trinculo and Caliban follow the sound of the music.

Ten-year-old Jessica Lovato, from the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe in New Mexico, joined the celebration. To her, visiting the museum was ""a great learning experience!""

Native American artifacts, such as these baskets, will be on display at the National Museum of the American Indian.
A wealthy New Yorker named George Gustav Heye collected most of the new museum's items throughout the early 1900s. He was interested in Native American culture and traditions.
There are about 800,000 Native American objects included in the museum's collection. The museum plans to display about 8,000 artifacts at a time.
The 4 million people who are expected to visit each year won't just find ancient objects--although there are plenty of them to see. Officials say the new museum also teaches people about Native Americans in modern times. Along with ancient pieces, such as beadwork, pottery, and carvings, visitors will also find newer ones, such as modern art and beaded sneakers.
The museum has been a work in progress for 16 years. Twenty-four Native American tribes helped build and plan the museum. They even reviewed the traditional dishes served in the museum's caf.
Symbolism abounds in the five-story building, which is made of limestone from Minnesota. The building's curved exterior resembles rocks shaped by wind and water over thousands of years.
In honor of many types of Native American dwellings, the museum's entrance faces east, in the direction of the rising sun. Inside, an electronic welcome sign greets visitors in 150 Native American languages.
Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today, each with its own culture. Native Americans have lived in North, South, and Central America for more than 20,000 years. When European explorers first arrived in North America, they thought they had landed in the East Indies. Those are islands located near Asia. That is why the explorers called the people living in the Americas ""Indians.""
To many Native Americans, the new museum has been a long time coming. ""[It is] long overdue,"" said Lawrence Small, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
Now that it is officially open, Native Americans hope the new museum keeps their culture alive. ""This will be a good education tool for everyone that wants to learn about the Indian people,"" a Cherokee woman told

In recent years, the red-haired apes have found themselves out on a limb. Wildlife experts warn that they may die out, or become
, within the next 20 years. Scientists estimate that only 30,000 orangutans are left in the wild.
Today, orangutans can be found only in tropical rain forests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, in Southeast Asia. They are
creatures, which means they eat, sleep, and travel mainly in trees.
To search for food, orangutans swing from branch to branch. They like to dine on leaves, flowers, bark, and sometimes insects.
""Orangutans spend most of their time in the trees and won't cross open grounds, so the only way they can [move]... is through the trees,"" said one wildlife expert. ""We need to maintain these forest [areas] so that orangutan populations of the future have the opportunity to continue to survive.""
What is causing the numbers of orangutans to decrease at an alarming rate? The main reason is the destruction of their rain forest
Humans pose the greatest threat to orangutans for a number of reasons, say experts. People cut down trees for lumber. This illegal logging is destroying much of the animals' homes. Many countries, including the United States, buy the lumber. It is often used in shelves, picture frames, and floors.
Forest fires and farming are also to blame. As forests are cleared to make way for plantations, orangu-tans lose parts of their habitat.
In addition, orangutans have fallen victim to the recent boom in the illegal pet trade. People steal baby orangutans from the forest to sell them as pets.
To help bring these animals back from the brink of extinction, wildlife groups are working to protect orangutans and stop illegal logging. The government in the area is also involved in the effort to help orangutans. Police go into national parks to prevent illegal loggers from cutting down trees.
""Help is needed to save these amazing creatures,"" orangutan expert Cheryl Knott told
. ""If we can save the rain forest for orangutans, we can save it for other animals as well.""
The average life span for orangutans is about 50 years. Experts hope that orangutans born today will still be swinging through the trees at that age.
The orangutan got its name--which means ""person of the forest""--for a reason. Orangutans are remarkably intelligent. In the wild, scientists have spotted these clever creatures using sticks as tools to open fruit. Orangutans have been observed using large leaves as umbrellas to shelter themselves from heavy rains. Sometimes, the apes even use leaves as cups, from which they drink water.
Are there any endangered animals in the area where you live? What can people do to help them?

This winter, scientists are sending a small robot into the Great Pyramid for a second time. In 2002, they sent the robot through the pyramids tight passageways.
After crawling through the corridors and drilling through a thick stone door, the robot revealed nothing but another closed door! This time, scientists hope to solve the puzzle of what lies behind door number two.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest pyramid in Egypt. Giza is located on the Nile River, near the capital of Cairo. The Great Pyramid is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Those structures were built between 4,500 and 2,200 years ago. Of the ancient wonders, only the Great Pyramid remains today.
The ancient pyramids were built as burial places for

Christopher Columbus may be going on one more journey. Scientists have opened a tomb in Spain that they believe contains his bones. The bones are traveling to a laboratory in Spain for testing.
Scientists are trying to solve a mystery: Where is Christopher Columbus buried? The Dominican Republic-an island in Central America-also claims to have the remains of this famous explorer.
In 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain and arrived in North America. He made four trips altogether. Before he died in 1506, he asked to be buried on the island that is today the Dominican Republic. It is part of the area he explored on his third and fourth trips.
When Spain lost control of the island, his body was moved. Spanish officials think it was taken to the island of Cuba before possibly being moved back to Spain. However, the Dominican Republic says the Spanish travelers took the wrong remains. By testing the bones, Spanish scientists hope to get to the truth of the matter.

The caption under Samuel Alitos college yearbook photo reads: ""Sam intends to go to law school and eventually to warm a seat on the Supreme Court."" His dream may soon come true. Alito, 55, is President George W. Bushs latest pick for a position on the countrys highest court.
The president chose Alito to replace Justice Sandra Day OConnor, who announced her retirement in July. In 1981, OConnor became the first woman in history to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.
Bush had first nominated Harriet Miers, a White House lawyer, to take OConnors place. However, Miers withdrew her nomination after coming under fire partly for a lack of experience. Miers had never been a judge. OConnor is serving on the Supreme Court until a replacement is confirmed.
Alito grew up in New Jersey in a family that valued learning. Both of his parents were teachers. He has argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court, losing just two.
As a federal judge, Alito has also served on a lower court for the past 15 years in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. With 29 years of legal experience, Bush says, Alito ""has more prior judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in more than 70 years.""
To become a Supreme Court justice, a nominee must be approved by the Senate. A series of Senate confirmation hearings, where Alito will answer questions about his views on laws, are set to begin on January 9, 2006. Senate leaders hope to have a final confirmation vote on January 20.

As secretary of state, Rice advises the president on foreign affairs and works with world leaders on important issues. WR talked to her about Iraq and her job as head of the State Department.
WR: When Iraq announced its draft constitution yesterday, what role did the State Department play?
We were following the Iraqi constitution very closely. It started with a phone call to our ambassador in Baghdad, and then I talked to [President Bush] about what was going on. I probably was on the phone to Baghdad yesterday six or seven times just following what was going on and seeing if there was anything that we could do back here.
WR: Some people say its a mistake to try to build a democracy in Iraq. How do you respond to critics?
I say shame on anybody who says that people ought to live in
. [That is a type of government ruled by someone unjustly. Rice is referring to Iraqi life under former ruler Saddam Hussein.] When are we going to learn that human beings want to be free? And its not as if theres a choice in between. You either are free or youre not. And the people of Iraq are now free.
WR: Youve traveled more than any other secretary of state in your first six months in office. Did a particular experience stand out for you?
I went to Phuket in Thailand, where the tsunami had taken place. And there were all of these American college students there helping out in the schools. And it reminded me whats really great about Americans.
WR: What is a typical day like for you?
I usually get up about 4:30, and I exercise first. I get into the office about 6:30. I read the newspaper before I leave home, but [my staff] prepares for me reports from around the world. International politics is a 24-hour schedule, because while were asleep, the rest of the world is awake. ... My day [may include] meeting with foreign ministers. I go over to the White House for meetings at least three or four times a week. I talk to the president pretty much every day.
WR: Youve repeatedly said that you dont want to run for president in 2008. Why dont you want the nations top job?
(laughs) I do have a lot of respect for people who run for office. But I think you have to have a kind of fire to want to do that, and I justI dont.
WR: What did you want to be growing up?
I wanted to be a concert pianist. I could read music from the time I was 3 1/2 years old, and so I studied really hard. I still play [today].
WR: As a child, did you believe you could be anything you wanted?
I did. Even though I was growing up in Birmingham, Alabama, at the time when it was segregated, my parents never let me think that there was anything I couldnt do.
WR: You like football. Is your dream still to be commissioner of the National Football League (NFL)?
Well, yes. Now, if the NFL commissioners job comes up sometime soon, then the president and I are going to have to talk.

A lightning bolt that crackles through the air can reach a temperature of 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun! The intense heat from lightning causes the surrounding air to expand, resulting in the loud sound known as
Thunder is nature's warning to head indoors. As meteorologist Ron Holle from Tucson, Arizona, told
, ""When thunder roars, go indoors."" A
Holle also recommends following the 30-30 rule. If you hear thunder less than 30 seconds after you see lightning, head indoorsthe storm is only about 6 miles away. After the storm ends, wait 30 minutes before going outside. To determine how far away lightning is, count the seconds between the flash and the thunder. Every 10 seconds equals 2 miles.
Lightning strikes the ground in the United States about 25 million times each year! Although getting hit by lightning is unlikely, it is important to stay safe. In the United States, about 60 people are killed each year by lightning.
To stay safe, follow the golden rulehead for cover. ""There is no place outside that is safe from lightning,"" Holle said firmly. ""There are two safe placesinside a [permanent] building or a metal-topped vehicle.""
Lightning expert Ron Holle shared the following tips with
Find shelter in a building or a metal-topped vehicle (not a convertible), and close the windows.
If you're caught outdoors, stay away from open spaces and avoid standing near tall objects, such as trees.
Avoid using electrical equipment, such as computers, TVs, and phones. (Cell phones are safe to use.)
Stay away from sinks and showers. Lightning can travel through water pipes.

155,"Report Points to Mice As Asthma Cause
17 million Americans suffer from asthma. About 5 million kids suffer from asthma.
Each year, more than 3 million kids visit the doctor's office because of asthma attacks.
When you run hard and play hard, you may have trouble catching your breath. Some kids, however, lose their breath even when they're not running or playing. Those kids have
, a disease that makes it hard to breathe.
For many years, scientists have known that cigarette smoke, dog and cat
, dust mites, and cockroaches can trigger asthma attacks. Dander is tiny bits of fur and skin. Now scientists have added a new culprit to that list--mouse dander.
Scientists studied dust samples from 608 U.S. homes with children ages 4 to 9 who suffered from asthma. The scientists found many things in the dust, including evidence of mice. About 95 percent of the homes had at least one room that had mouse dander.
The scientists then tested the kids in each of the homes to see if mouse dander triggered asthma attacks in them. The dander triggered attacks in 18 out of every 100 kids.
As a result of those tests, Dr. Robert Wood of Johns Hopkins University concluded that mice trigger many asthma attacks. In fact, he said, the ""mouse is second in line [after the cockroach in causing asthma attacks].""
Mouse dander was found in many of the houses, even though not all of them had mice. Sometimes, kids tracked dander from mice and other animals into their homes when they came in from outside. Sometimes, the dander was from mice that had been in the home in the past.
Daniel, who lives in Clarksville, Maryland, suffers from asthma. Last year, scientists collected and studied dust from his home. The scientists found cat dander in the dust, even though his family didn't own a cat. It was cat dander that was triggering Daniel's asthma attacks, said Daniel's doctor.
To keep cat dander out of their home, Daniel and his mother frequently wash the floors, walls, and other surfaces. As a result, Daniel's mother said Daniel hasn't had an asthma attack in the last year.
Many kids who suffer from asthma might be able to breathe more easily if they could find ways to keep the dander of mice, cats, and other kinds of animals out of their homes.

Don't expect the rovers to find little green aliens on the fourth planet from the sun. Instead, they will be on the lookout for signs that water once flowed on Mars. They will also search for evidence that some ice exists under the planet's surface. Scientists say that evidence of water on Mars can mean that life once existed on this planet.
Unlike Earth, Mars is dusty, very cold, and dry. ""We're going to look for signs that tell us that Mars may have been warmer and wet in the past,"" said a
Still, Mars is more like Earth than any other planet in the solar system. It has mountains, valleys, ice caps, and dry riverbeds.
The Red Planet even has seasons, wind and dust storms, and a rocky surface.
The seven-month journey for the rovers won't be an easy one. So far, only three of nine spacecraft that Americans and Russians have sent to Mars have completed the journey without breaking apart or failing.
The rovers were launched from a rocket and will travel through space in a protective shell. They will use parachutes and air bags to bounce to their landing sites. They will land on opposite sides of the planet.
The rovers are equipped with robotic arms, special tools, and cameras. As part of their mission, they will drill through rocks on Mars' surface and take pictures of them.
Then, they will then send the pictures back to Earth for scientists to study. Each rover can travel about the length of a football field each day.
""We will be using the rovers to find rocks and soils that could hold clues about [the possibility of water in] Mars' past,"" said another NASA scientist.
Missions to Mars typically occur when the two planets are close to each other. Mars recently made its closest pass to Earth in 60,000 years. On August 27, Mars was only about 34 million miles from Earth.

87,"Journey to the Center of the Earth
What's under your feet? If you look at the ground, that question is answered easily. But dig a little deeper-about 4,000 miles deeper. That's where you will find Earth's core.
No one has ever journeyed to the center of Earth. However, scientists are trying to figure out what's there.
For a long time scientists believed that Earth's core is made of solid iron and nickel metals. Now, according to a new theory, or idea, a powerful nuclear reactor is located in Earth's core.
Earth may not be the only planet in the solar system that houses a nuclear reactor. Some scientists say nuclear reactions occur at the centers of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
All four of those planets give off, or radiate, more energy than they get from the sun. The scientists say a large energy source must lie hidden deep inside those planets.
Inside Earth's core, atoms, or tiny particles, of uranium split apart. When the atoms split, they give off lots of heat.
Scientist J. Marvin Herndon says the nuclear reaction in the core triggers volcanoes, moves the giant plates of rock that make up Earth's surface, and causes a magnetic field to surround our planet.
Earth has a magnetic field similar to a magnet's. Just like a magnet, Earth has a north pole and a south pole. The north pole has a positive magnetic charge; the south pole has a negative charge.
Earth's magnetic field changes over time. Over long periods of time, the magnetic poles move around. Sometimes the magnetic field completely disappears.
Herndon says the nuclear reaction at Earth's core causes those changes. He says the nuclear reaction changes. Sometimes it gives off lots of energy. At other times, it gives off less energy. And sometimes it stops for a short time.
If there is a nuclear reactor in Earth's core, someday it will stop completely. That would cause volcanoes to stop erupting, Earth's plates to stop moving, and the magnetic field to disappear forever.
The magnetic field protects Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. If the field disappears, life on Earth would end. But don't worry about that. The nuclear reaction in the core will not stop for 2 billion years, Herndon says.

or scientists who study space, met in Europe. The astronomers voted that there would be eight planets instead of nine. Those eight ""classical"" planets include Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
Why did astronomers give Pluto the boot? For starters, they came up with a new definition for a planet. A planet must be nearly round and must
or circle, the sun. Its orbit should not cross the orbit of another planet. Plutos orbit
Since its discovery in 1930, astronomers suspected that Pluto was an oddball when compared with the other planets. New technology has shown that its orbit is oval-shaped. Pluto is also smaller than the other planets. Even Earths moon is larger.
Orbit and size werent the only problems. Pluto is made up of material that is different from that of the other planets. While the others are made up of rocks or gases, Pluto consists mostly of ice.
Pluto appears to be similar to other objects in the Kuiper belt. Its status as a planet began to look bleak when 2003 UB313 was discovered three years ago. That Kuiper belt object, nicknamed ""Xena,"" is larger than Pluto. The discovery prompted astronomers to begin thinking about reclassifying the objects in our solar system.
Dont pity Pluto, though. It still has a place in space. Pluto is now one of a group of smaller space objects called
One member is the largest asteroid, called Ceres (SIHR-eez). The other space object is 2003 UB313.

races toward Pluto, scientists hope the craft will offer clues to how our solar system was formed 4.6 billion years ago. Many scientists believe that objects in the Kuiper belt are leftovers from the formation of the solar system.
Plutos downgraded title isnt stopping scientists from learning more about the dwarf planet. ""We will continue pursuing exploration of the most scientifically interesting objects in the solar system, regardless of how they are categorized,"" says NASA official Paul Hertz.
Pluto meets only two of the three new requirements:
 It has to be nearly round.
 Its orbit should not cross another planets orbit.
Pluto was discovered in 1930, long after the other planets, by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh (19061997). He wasnt the person to name it, though. Venetia Burney, an 11-year-old British girl, gave Pluto its name. She thought the new planet should be named for the Roman god of the underworld.
Not all astronomers agree with the decision to change Plutos status. Why might some oppose it?

King (19291968) dedicated his life to helping others. As a boy growing up in the U.S. South, King witnessed African Americans being treated unfairly. At that time, the South was
or separated by race. Under the law, African Americans were not allowed to attend the same schools as white people and had to sit in the backseats of buses. African Americans also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains.
When King was older, he worked to change those unjust laws. During the 1950s and 1960s, he gave speeches and organized peaceful marches and protests.
Beginning in 1955, King led the famous Montgomery bus boycott to protest segregation. For 381 days, African Americans

King gained national attention from the boycott. As a result of his work, civil rights laws were passed.

The King memorial is scheduled to be completed in 2008. The design uses water, stone, and trees to represent the themes of justice, democracy, and hope. The King memorial will also include a boulder called the Stone of Hope, from which will emerge a 30-foot figure of King. The memorial will contain a circular stone wall chiseled with King's words.
King's dream was for all people to be treated fairly and equally under the law. The design of the memorial is based on a line from his historic ""I Have a Dream"" speech: ""We will be able to hew [cut] out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.""

Scientists are amazed by the discovery. ""By itself, the villa is a notable finding, but it acquires even more value because it is the place where one of the greatest poets in Rome lived,"" explained Gaetano Messineo, one of the scientists at the dig.
City officials in Rome plan to put up a building around Ovid's ancient villa to protect it. But the area will not look as it did in Ovid's time. A dump and a four-lane highway now block the views of the Tiber River that Ovid wrote about in his poetry.

One of the most historic regions in the United States is in trouble. The 175-mile-long area of land stretches through Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
The area is home to more American history than any other slice of land in the country, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

The region at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains includes many battlefields from the Civil War (18611865).
As people construct new houses, roads, and buildings, they are destroying acres of history. Officials say the region has lost more than 150,000 acres of farmland in the past 20 years. That is an area slightly smaller than New York City.

Many Californians have had similar problems. Since December, power companies have had trouble meeting the demand for electricity in the Sunshine State. In January and March, more than a million Californians sweated through
, which happen when power companies turn off electricity in an area for a short time.
Several factors contributed to the shortage, said Lawrence J. Makovich, a scientist who studies energy use. One problem is that California doesn't have enough power plants to supply all the electricity the Sunshine State needs. In addition, prices have risen for the fuels used in power plants to produce electricity, Makovich said.
The energy crisis may become worse this summer as Californians turn on air conditioners. According to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the state will probably be 10 percent short of the amount of electricity it needs.
This summer, the electricity crunch may spread to other parts of the country. In some areas, prices for electricity have been on the rise.
Many states are taking steps to solve the shortage. In California, Gov. Gray Davis is urging people to save energy.
""Yes, we have a power shortage, but we are far from powerless,"" Davis said. ""By reducing our electricity demand by even a small amount, we can reduce the price, avoid shortages, and lower energy bills.""

Millions of citizens across the country watched in horror as terrorists used hijacked airplanes to attack two of America's most famous landmarks--the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Another stolen plane crashed in Pennsylvania.
The destruction caused by the hijacked jetliners stunned eyewitnesses. ""It was like the building had been hit by an asteroid,"" Marty Singer said of the World Trade Center in New York City.
Another eyewitness compared the attack on the twin towers of the World Trade Center to a terrible storm. ""Giant balls of flame burst out of the walls,"" Hugh Smyser said. ""Glass and aluminum sheathing [outer material from the buildings] came down like a huge snowstorm.""
Although the attacks took place in New York and our nation's capital, every U.S. citizen felt the impact of the attacks. Many states and communities closed public buildings, parks, and monuments. Events, such as baseball games, were canceled. Many businesses and schools were closed, as everyone mourned the victims of the savage attacks.
The flames from the burning landmarks forged a new bond among Americans. Thousands lined up to donate blood for victims injured in the attacks. Firefighters, rescue workers, doctors, nurses, and volunteers worked tirelessly. Millions of Americans sent canned goods, snack foods, bottled water, and money to help the victims and rescue workers.
As Americans came together to help one another out during the crisis, people throughout the world knew that life would never again be the same. ""This is one of the few days in life that one can actually say will change everything,"" said one European leader.
U.S. authorities said soon after the attacks that the terrorists who hijacked the four planes from three airports must have planned their assaults carefully. Here's what happened, beginning at 8:48 a.m. on September 11.
A plane hijacked from an airport in Boston, Massachusetts, crashes into one of the 110 story towers that made up the World Trade Center in New York City. As the building burns, a second plane hijacked from Boston slams into the other World Trade Center tower 18 minutes later.
A third hijacked jet, which took off from an airport near Washington, D.C., crashes into the side Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac River from the capital. The Pentagon houses the offices of most of the branches of the U.S. military.
One of the World Trade Center towers collapses. Fifteen minutes later, a fourth hijacked place crashes in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, about 80 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. The other tower collapses almost 25 minutes later.
Ash and debris from the collapsed towers cover victims and rescue workers.
Rescue workers comb through the rubble of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon looking for survivors. At the same time, law enforcement officials look for clues to find the terrorist who staged the brutal attacks.

643,"History in the Making: Surviving the Great Depression
In 1929, the U.S. stock market crashed. It marked the start of a period of hardship called the Great Depression. The U.S. economy suffered from low wages and reduced spending and production. Many people lost the money they had invested. During the 1930s, millions of people lost their jobs. Many families had trouble making a living. Abby interviewed her grandmother, Edith Russell, about this period.
What hardships did the Great Depression cause you and your family?
Things became scarce and unavailable. We had to go without things and work harder.
Did your dad have a job during the Depression?
My father farmed his own land. Farming was not very profitable during this time. [However,] those who worked outside of farming probably only earned $1 a day.
Yes, we always had enough to eat. We always grew a huge garden with plenty of vegetables. We canned our own food; made bread, butter, and baked goods; and butchered meat.
How old were you then? What was it like to go to school?
I was around 8 years old. I really enjoyed going to school. I attended a one-room schoolhouse in the country. The big downfall was that I had to walk 3 miles to and from school.
When the banks failed in 1929, did your family have money in them? If so, did your family lose all of its savings?
No, we didn't have much money in the bank. My father wasn't [trustful] of banks and kept most of his money hidden right at home. However, the little he had in the bank was lost.
Did you have enough money to buy clothes and shoes?
I got a new pair of shoes once in a while for the winter, but in the summer I would go barefoot. Mama sewed most of my clothes. I only had about three different outfits.
What did you and your family do for entertainment during these years?
Our main entertainment was having the neighbors over to play ball. Once in a while, we got to listen to the radio.
What effect did the Great Depression have on the way you live your life today?
I always think back to those days and greatly appreciate everything I have today.

A new study shows that the number of ocean creatures is on the rise.

The goby fish is among 106 new

About 1,000 scientists from 70 countries are participating in the ocean count. They will finish their study in 2010.
Water covers about two-thirds of Earth's surface. The five main oceans are the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian, the Arctic, and the Southern.
This map shows the five main oceans.
So far, scientists have discovered nearly 15,500 species of fish in the world's oceans. They are among 230,000 known plants and animals living beneath the ocean's surface.
Scientists believe that they may find up to 2 million life-forms by the time they complete their count. ""We have barely skimmed the surface,"" said one scientist.
Why are scientists conducting the study? They want to learn more about the oceans, which are among the least-known parts of Earth's surface.

Carl Mehling knows that isn't true. A paleontologist studies dinosaurs.
With the click of the mouse, a computer shows Mehling that it would be impossible for the giant dinosaur to run that fast because of its size. ""The power of some of these computers is far beyond what scientists could figure out on paper just a few years ago,"" Mehling told
. ""The computers answer questions we wouldn't even have thought of asking."" Now, ""Dinosaurs,"" an exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City (where Mehling works), explores the modern world of paleontology.
In the past, scientists relied only on
to learn about dinosaurs. Fossils are the remains of plants and animals from long ago. When a plant or an animal dies, it usually rots away. However, if it is buried quickly by mud or sand, parts of it may be preserved. Over millions of years the remains can turn into a fossil. Fossils can be bones, teeth, footprints, or nests of eggs.
When a dinosaur fossil is found, scientists carefully dig around it and study it. They photograph, measure, and record each bone's position. Then the bones are dug up and often taken to a museum where the fossil is rebuilt.
Today, advanced technology allows paleontologists to examine fossils in fresh ways. By creating computer models, scientists can tell how bones fit together and how these ancient creatures moved.

fossil was discovered by Barnum Brown in 1902 in Montana, long after these ancient creatures roamed Earth. Dinosaurs first appeared on Earth 245 million years ago, during the Mesozoic Era. They died about 65 million years ago.
What caused dinosaurs to become extinct? Scientists don't know for sure, but they have different
or possible explanations. One theory is that a huge asteroid or comet struck Earth. The collision likely filled the air with a huge cloud of dust and blocked out most of the sun's light and heat. As a result, many plants and animals would have died out.
In addition to using computers to study dinosaurs, scientists also use special X-ray machines to look inside fossils. They hope that new technology may one day answer ancient mysteries like what color dinosaurs might have been.
""Every time a new technique comes up, the old fossils are pulled out again and looked at anew with brand-new eyes,"" Mehling says. ""It's cool.""

A new company called PlanetPortal has invented WebRemote, which is a cross between a TV remote and a video game control pad. WebRemote makes navigating the Web as easy as pressing a button.
In the past, Net surfers had to type in long, difficult Web addresses to find their favorite sites. Now they can program WebRemote with their favorite Web addresses in the same way they program a telephone with phone numbers.
With WebRemote, couch potatoes can surf the Web and channel-surf without leaving the comfort of their sofas. Now someone needs to invent a remote that will bring soft drinks and snacks from the refrigerator.

The Statue of Liberty is the only major national landmark that has not reopened since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Although the grounds are open, officials say the 305-foot-tall monument is closed because of security and safety concerns.
The group that cares for the statue is raising $7 million to make safety improvements so it can reopen. However, there is a possibility that only the
, or base, of the statue will open again.
People may never be able to climb the narrow spiral staircase to the crown again. Safety experts say that evacuating people from the crown of the statue in an emergency might be too difficult.
The Statue of Liberty is one of the world's most powerful symbols of freedom. Millions of

France gave the Statue of Liberty to the United States. It was a gift to celebrate the friendship between the two countries during the American Revolution (1775-1783). During the Revolutionary War, France helped the United States gain independence from Great Britain.

The unpiloted X-43A jet flew nearly 5,000 miles per hour. That is equal to seven times the speed of sound. The aircraft made a 10-second powered flight and then glided for six minutes before plunging into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.
Before taking off on its own, the jet launched from the wing of a plane in midair.
A rocket, which was later released, helped boost the jet's speed.
""Everything worked according to plan. It's been wonderful,"" said NASA's Leslie Williams. ""We've been waiting a few years.""
NASA attempted to fly a similar unmanned jet three years earlier. However, a failure in the launch system caused the flight to explode.
In 1947, American pilot Chuck Yeager became the first person to fly at
speed, or faster than the speed of sound. NASA hopes its record-breaking feat will lead to a new era of supersonic flight for military, business, and space ventures.

Most kids who play football get minor bruises and scrapes. Some injure their knees and even break bones. Others get head concussions. But a 10-year-old girl died on September 2. Doctors said a football injury probably caused the fatality.
Taylor Davison, who lived in Illinois, liked to play football. She was the only girl who played in a football league of 400 players.
Taylor played full-contact football. During a practice in August, she complained of a headache and fell down. Three days later, she died. Doctors said she died as a result of a severe blow to the head, possibly caused by a tackle.
Doctors do not know how many child athletes are injured on the playing field each year. ""There is a serious lack of data about what types of injuries are occurring, said Dr. Reginald Washington, a doctor of sports medicine.
Although not enough is known about sports-related injuries among children, Washington and other doctors say kids and coaches can follow certain safety tips. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh give this advice:
Coaches should receive first-aid training. They should also be trained to recognize whether a child athlete has a severe head injury.
Leagues should have rules that require kids to take time off from playing after they have suffered an injury-especially a head injury.
To make sure they are safe, kids should always wear the proper safety equipment when playing any sport.

Everyone loves pizza, but should it be used as a reward for reading?
Should kids be reading for pizza? A nationwide reading program is drawing criticism for putting pizza front and center. Since 1985, the restaurant chain Pizza Hut has been running the Book It program, which rewards students for reading with personal pan pizzas. Now some people are taking a slice at Book It. They say the program promotes poor eating habits and gives Pizza Hut free advertising in public schools.
""It's clear that Pizza Hut's Book It has no place in public schools. ... It promotes junk food,"" says Susan Linn, a cofounder of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. The group has called for schools to stop participating in the Book It program.
Nearly 22 million children in 50,000 U.S. schools take part in Book It. Since the program began, more than 200 million pizzas have been given away. Each year, from October 1 through March 31, students read books to meet monthly reading goals set by teachers. When students meet their goal for the month, they get a certificate for a personal pan pizza.
""We're really proud of the program,"" says Leslie Tubbs, the director of Book It. ""We get hundreds of e-mails from [past participants] who praise it and say it helped them get started with reading."" In 1988, President Ronald Reagan honored the program for promoting

It took them a little more than a year to complete their journey, covering a total of 48,000 square miles. They traveled across the country in a mobile home.
Although the kids attend school in Missouri, they were home-schooled during their trip. Their parents said the trip was a chance to teach their sons about the history of the United States. As part of their schooling, the kids used their textbooks from their school.

247,"Is silencing parents a winning idea for kids' sports?
Loud parents are a growing problem at youth sporting events. Nearly 60 percent of people think that parent behavior in youth sports is worse today than it was five years ago, according to the National Association of Youth Sports. ""Parents are trying to yell and scream to make their kids play better, and that just doesn't work,"" sports expert and former coach Gregory Dale told
Dale and other sports experts are fans of an idea called ""Silent Saturdays."" Silent Saturdays are special game days during which parents aren't allowed to yell, scream, shout, or even speak. They can only clap to celebrate good plays and whisper to each other. Sports programs from California to New Jersey have instituted Silent Saturdays. Is quieting the sidelines a good call?
Silence helps keep parents' behavior under control.
Some sports leagues think zipping parents' lips is a great idea. The Dynamo Soccer Association in Bourbonnais, Illinois, started having Silent Saturdays last year. ""We're not trying to punish parents,"" Dynamo Soccer board member Ben Smith told
""It's just a stress-free day for the kids.""
At first, some parents were skeptical, or unsure, of the idea. But Smith says the quiet games were a big success. Instead of shouting, parents held encouraging signs and applauded. Everyone could hear the kids talking to each other on the field during the games. ""There was no negative criticism throughout the day,"" adds Smith. This year, the Dynamo board is considering two Silent Saturdays, and nearby soccer leagues are giving the program a try.
Parents should be allowed to cheer on their kids.
Silence doesn't work for everyone. For example, two grandparents in Bourbonnais were disappointed because they had traveled to cheer at their grandkids' game, but they had arrived on a Silent Saturday. Some experts think keeping family members quiet isn't the solution. ""Parents hate it,"" Jim Thompson, head of Positive Coaching Alliance, told
""If you want parents to be positive, this is not the best way to do it.""
Thompson says the solution is to train parents to cheer in a way that promotes
or fair play. Thompson prefers ""Honor the Game Days"" to Silent Saturdays. What's the difference? ""Rather than telling parents to be quiet, at Honor the Game Days, [we tell parents] how to support their kids,"" he says.

The statues, one 120 feet tall and the other 175 feet tall, were of the religious leader Buddha (BOO-duh), the founder of Buddhism.
Many art and history experts say the statues were historic treasures. ""They were among the most stunning [statues] I've ever seen,"" said. Professor James Fisher of Carleton College in Minnesota.
The Taliban, the religious group that rules most areas of Afghanistan, ordered the destruction of the two statues. (
In 1996, the Taliban seized the Afghan capital, Kabul, and took control of most of the country. The Taliban and a large majority of people who live in the country are Muslims. They practice a religion called Islam.
The Taliban said their holy book, the Koran, forbids the creation or worship of statues. Before the statues were destroyed, a Taliban leader said, ""Because... these statues are there to be worshipped, and that is wrong, they should be destroyed.""
Throughout the world, leaders were outraged after learning that the Taliban planned the destruction of the huge statues. World leaders and officials from the United Nations (U.N.) tried to stop the destruction. Iran, a country where most people are Muslims, asked the Taliban not to blow up the statues. Japan, a country where Buddhism is widely practiced, threatened to withhold money that the country had planned to send to Afghanistan.
Now many people are mourning the loss of the statues. ""It is [horrible] to witness the... destruction of [historic monuments], which were the [history] of the whole of humanity,"" said a U.N. representative.

Fifty years ago, one brave woman's refusal to give up her bus seat changed history.
Honor the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest and the start of the Montgomery bus boycott with our classroom play.
During the 1950s, the law in the South prevented black
people from having the same rights as white people. At that time, the South was
by law. Black people were forced to sit in the back of public buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, drinking fountains, and other public facilities.
Those laws made Rosa Parks angry. She was a well-known leader in the African American community of Montgomery, Alabama. For years, Rosa Parks had stood up to unfair laws against African Americans. She worked courageously with other African American leaders to change them. She also was one of the first women in Montgomery to join the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to fight for
, or equal rights under the law.
Rosa Parks had refused to move from her seat on city buses in the past. Drivers simply forced her off the bus. But 50 years ago, on December 1, 1955, her action changed history. She refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person and was arrested. Her arrest led to the Montgomery
. During the yearlong boycott, African Americans refused to ride public buses. As a result of the boycott and Rosa Parks's courage, the law was changed to provide equal seating on buses. It marked the beginning of the struggle to end segregation.
SCENE 1: Downtown Montgomery, Alabama, December 1, 1955
Rosa Parks, 42, boards a city bus on her way home from work as a seamstress.
At the time, buses are divided into two sections. The section at the front of the bus is for whites only. The section for black people begins five to 10 rows back. Holding her head high, Rosa Parks sits down in the first row of the ""colored"" section.
After the bus grinds to a stop, a few white people get on. They quickly fill the empty seats in the ""whites-only"" section. One white man is left standing. According to a city law, black people are to give up their seats in the colored section if no seats remain in the white section.
There are white people who want to sit down.
You know white people and black people can't sit in the same row. Are you going to stand up?
Then I'm going to have you arrested.
A few minutes later, two police officers board the bus and walk toward Rosa Parks.
Did the driver tell you to stand?
Why do you all push us around?
I don't know, but the law is the law, and you're under arrest.
SCENE 2: Rosa Parks's house, that night
Rosa Parks is released from jail on bail that day. She and other Montgomery civil rights leaders meet at her house to discuss the bus boycott.
For years, civil rights leaders have been planning a bus boycott to fight segregation. They are waiting for the right time and the right leader to spark the boycottand Rosa Parks is that person. They know Rosa Parks has the courage to stand up to segregation. Because most of Montgomery's bus riders are black, the bus companies will lose money if black people refuse to ride the buses.
I know one thing, I will never, ever ride another segregated bus againeven if it means I have to walk to work.
You have to stand up for what you believe in.
Rosa, how would you feel about making your arrest a test case against segregation? We may be able to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.
I don't like being in the spotlight, and I don't want to put my family in danger.
Rosa, this may be our best chance to fight segregation laws.
Good. In the meantime, we're going to boycott the buses.
The next day, community leaders meet to discuss the boycott. At their request, Martin Luther King Jr. agrees to lead it.
SCENE 3: Montgomery courthouse, a few days later
Rosa Parks approaches the courthouse steps with her husband for her trial.
The steps of the courthouse are packed with people. Some bystanders threaten Rosa Parks. Others shout their support.
Your place is in the back of the bus, lady!
Oh, she's so sweet. They've messed with the wrong one now!
After Rosa Parks and her husband manage to push their way into the courtroom, the trial begins. The bus driver takes the stand.
I politely asked her to move to the back, which is required by city law. She refused to listen.
Rosa Parks is not called to the stand. Instead, her lawyers speak on her behalf.
I find Rosa Parks guilty of violating the city law. She must pay a $10 fine plus $4 in court costs.
The crowd of supporters in the courtroom reacts angrily to the verdict.
You haven't heard the last from us.
Despite the boos from supporters, the guilty verdict was exactly what Rosa Parks and her lawyers wanted. Their case eventually made it to the nation's highest courtthe Supreme Court.
Montgomery's black community continued to boycott the buses. On November 13, 1956, their efforts finally paid off. The Supreme Court ruled that Alabama's segregated buses were against the law. After more than a year, the boycott ended.
At the urging of photographers, Rosa Parks boarded a bus on December 20. This time, she sat in the front seat. (See the cover.)

Ballard believes the wreck should be left alone. ""The site is a memorial, and it is better to bring people there through advanced technology rather than ravage the site through salvage,"" he said.

The new museum opened in August 2004 on the northern bank of the Ohio River. That river once marked the line between slavery and freedom. Historians believe that thousands of slaves who escaped through the Underground Railroad from the South, where slavery was allowed, crossed the Ohio River.
The Underground Railroad was not a real railroad. During the late 1700s to mid-1800s, the Underground Railroad was actually a secret system of safe routes that runaway slaves could use as they fled from the South to free Northern states, Canada, and Mexico.
The Underground Railroad covered hundreds of hidden routes. Most slaves escaped through Ohio, Indiana, and western Pennsylvania. Slaves made their way to freedom any way they could. Most hid during the day and traveled at night.
Along the way, a vast network of black people and white people called
risked their lives to provide escaped slaves with food, clothing, and shelter. An abolitionist was someone who worked to end slavery.

Artifacts, paintings, and murals are at the heart of the Freedom Center. Along with films, the exhibits recount the story of slavery in the United States, the dangerous road to freedom, and the continued struggle for liberty around the world today.
A slave pen found on a farm in Maysville, Kentucky, serves as the museum's centerpiece. Built in 1830, the wooden pen is about the size of a small house. Slaves were locked up in the pen for months before they were sold at auction to the highest bidder.

""The Underground Railroad wouldn't have existed if it wasn't for brave people who took a risk to stand up for freedom,"" said DeVillez. ""The museum is a learning center that teaches lessons of courage and the fight for freedom that exists even today.""
Some key people fought against slavery during the mid-1800s.
Harriet Tubman was a former slave who became the most famous conductor of the Underground Railroad. From 1850 to 1860, she led about 300 slaves to freedom. Tubman once said, ""On my Underground Railroad, I [never] run my train off [the] track, and I never [lost] a passenger.""
Harriet Beecher Stowe was a teacher and a minister's wife from Ohio who wrote
in 1852. The book was about a cruel slave master who beat a slave named Tom to death. Her book convinced many people that the horrors of slavery needed to end.
Frederick Douglass was born a slave in Maryland in 1817. He escaped in 1838 to New York and moved to Massachusetts, where he founded

What do those dreams mean? No one quite knows for sure, but scientists are getting closer to solving the puzzle. They are using new technology to study how the sleeping brain works.
Although there are still many mysteries about sleep, scientists know that everyone needs sleep to boost brain power and keep the body healthy. School-age kids need at least nine hours of sleep each night to perform their best in school.
So can a good night's sleep help Christina do her best playing ice hockey and the flute? Can sleep help
""Getting a good night's sleep is good for your brain and body and helps you grow,"" sleep expert David Dinges told
. ""You're less likely to be tired the next day, you're less grouchy, more alert, and perform better in school and in sports.""
While you're snoozing, your brain doesn't shut down. Your brain stays busy and goes through five stages of sleep each night.
, sleep. It gets that name because your eyes move around quickly under closed eyelids. Your brain becomes very active during REM sleep. Most dreaming takes place during that sleep stage. Your body cycles through REM and non-REM stages several times a night. Each cycle lasts about 90 minutes.
Everybody dreamsalthough scientists don't know exactly why. Scientists have different
, or ideas, about why dreams are useful. One theory is that dreams help make sense of the day's events. Some scientists think that dreams help the brain sort and store information.
The latest evidence shows that dreams may help people master new physical skills, such as playing an instrument or riding a bike. Both dreaming and getting a good night's sleep may also help people improve their problem-solving skills. In one study, scientists divided volunteers into groups to solve a math problem. The group that received more sleep solved the problem more often than the group that didn't receive as much sleep.
Why do we remember some dreams but not others? When you wake up affects how vividly you recall your dreams. If you awaken during REM sleep, you're more likely to remember the details of a dream. If you wake up during another stage, you might not remember your dreams as wellor at all.
Whether or not you remember your dreams, it's important to get into a healthful sleep routine. ""The enemies of sleep are staying up late to play video games or watch TV,"" said Dinges.
Like people, all warm-blooded animals dream. Some animals sleep a little, and others sleep a lot. The amount of sleep an animal requires depends on its needs. Take a look at the sleep patterns of some creatures.

Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.

The most recent spacecraft to journey to the fourth rock from the sun is

Recent photos taken by Mars Odyssey show that Mars has water. Because it is very cold on Mars, the water is frozen. Most of the water is frozen under the surface of Mars.
Even though lots of ice crystals are mixed in with the Martian soil, Mars doesn't have as much water as Earth has. Mars has lakes of water, not oceans of water. In fact, scientists say that if you collected all the water on Mars, it would fill a lake about twice the size of Lake Michigan.
There is evidence that some of the frozen water locked under the surface of Mars might melt every once in a while. Some of the water is only 18 inches below the surface. Molten rock deep beneath the surface of Mars might heat the ice. The melted ice might mix with salt deposits in the Martian soil and flow down steep canyon walls.

271,"Do you know the words to the Pledge of Allegiance by heart? If you're like most kids in the United States, you probably have said those words countless times.
Now the pledge has found itself in a firestorm of controversy. Next year, the Supreme Court will decide whether to ban the phrase ""under God"" from the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools.
Last year, a federal appeals court in California ruled that the pledge is
because it contains the phrase ""under God.""
If something does not uphold the principles of the U.S. Constitution, it is considered unconstitutional.
According to this lower court, the words ""under God"" suggest the government
, or supports, religion. That violates the First Amendment. The First Amendment of the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and press. People often refer to this freedom as the separation of church and state.
The court's decision affects nearly 10 million schoolchildren in nine western states. The states that are part of the lower court's ruling include Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. The ruling does not apply to public schools elsewhere in the United States.
Michael Newdow of California brought the case to court. He argued that his daughter, now in the fourth grade, should not have to listen to the pledge recited daily, because of its reference to God. ""I'll keep fighting to uphold the Constitution,"" he told CNN.
The Elk Grove School District in Sacramento, California, didn't agree. In response, the school district asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. The Supreme Court has the power to overturn the lower court's ruling.
The Pledge of Allegiance, written by Francis Bellamy, is published in a Boston magazine called
On Columbus Day, about 12 million American schoolchildren say the pledge for the first time.
The words ""my Flag"" are changed to ""the flag of the United States."" A year later, ""of America"" is added to the end of that sentence.

Once the case begins next year, the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., will likely be the scene of protests. People on both sides of the debate will want their voices heard.

587,"Florida is the 23rd largest state in the United States. Key West is the southernmost part of the continental United States.
Moving slowly and silently through more than a million acres of wetlands in Florida, water is the lifeblood of the Everglades. However, for the past few decades, the Everglades has been losing its lifeblood.
President Bill Clinton plans to sign a new bill into law that may breathe new life into the Everglades. The bill is called the Everglades Restoration Act. The act will help restore parts of the Everglades to the way they were many years ago, say supporters. Critics of the plan say that it does not go far enough to restore the Everglades.
The Everglades is like a shallow, slow-moving river that covers millions of acres. The ""river of grass,"" as the Everglades is called, is 50 miles wide and 120 miles long. It flows from Lake Okeechobee into Florida Bay.
A large part of the river of grass is contained within the Everglades National Park. The park covers about 1.5 million acres (about the size of Delaware). Many plant and animal species, including alligators, panthers, egrets, and manatees live in the park.
An alligator suns itself in the Everglades. Manatees, many kinds of birds, and panthers can be found in these wetlands.
The Everglades Restoration Act will spend about $8 billion to restore the river of grass over the next 30 years. The act will be managed in part by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
One important part of the act calls for the removal of dams, dikes, and flood control gates. The Corps of Engineers began installing many of those devices in 1948 to control the flow of water in the Everglades. Those devices protect towns and farms from flooding and provide
By removing dams and closing canals, the Corps of Engineers will restore the flow of water in the river of grass to the way it was more than 100 years ago. That's when people first began to drain water from the Everglades.
The act will also improve water treatment plants. Those plants clean wastewater coming from farms or towns near the Everglades. The improved plants will allow less water pollution to flow into the Everglades. The Corps of Engineers will also build reservoirs, relocate roads, and shut off drainage canals.
The maps show (1) how water flowed through the Everglades before farms and towns began draining water from the Everglades, (2) how water now flows through the Everglades, and (3) how water may flow when the plan is completed.
Many people, from environmental groups to private citizens, applaud the act. ""This is as major a restoration as one would hope for,"" said Charles Lee, a spokesperson for the Florida Audubon Society.
Critics of the plan, however, say it does not go far enough toward restoring the wetlands. For example, the Everglades once covered 9 million acres, say officials from the Sierra Club, an organization that works to protect the environment. The Corps of Engineers drained much of that land so it could be used as farmland and to build houses. More of that land should be returned to the way it used to be before the 20th century, Sierra Club officials have said.
Whatever disagreements people may have, all agree that the restoration of the Everglades will take a long time and a lot of hard work. Once the act becomes law, said Stuart Applebaum of the Corps of Engineers, it will be time to ""roll up our sleeves [and get to work] for the next 30 years.""

Today, Americans create more garbage than ever before. In the early 1900s, most items were packed in containers that could be used again. Now, most of the food we buy, from cereal to milk, comes in boxes and cartons that can be thrown away.
So what happens to trash after it is tossed out? Some trash ends up in

605,"Soaring high above California's coastline stand the magnificent redwood trees. Redwoods are the world's tallest known trees and are also some of the oldest. Some scientists are concerned about a disease that is threatening the ancient giants. It is called sudden oak death.
The disease has scientists alarmed. First identified in 1995, sudden oak death has spread along hundreds of miles of California's coastline and jumped into southern Oregon. In addition to attacking oak trees, it has spread to redwoods, Douglas firs, and other types of trees and shrubs. One of the worst outbreaks of the disease has occurred at California's Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park.
Scientists recently discovered the organism responsible for the disease. It is a fungus that causes oozing red blobs to grow on diseased oak trees. On younger redwoods, it dries up leaves and kills sprouts. According to scientists, redwoods are hosts for the disease. A host is an organism on or in which another organism lives.
The disease first showed up in rhododendron plants in the Netherlands in 1993. Scientists are concerned because the spread of the disease could pose a threat to the redwoods' ecosystem, an environment where plants and animals coexist. Scientist David Rizzo said that anytime you have a strange organism, there is cause for concern.
Coastal redwoods can grow upwards of 360 feet. Some are taller than the Statue of Liberty, which stands about 300 feet.
The diameter of redwoods can measure about 20 feet.
Named California's state tree, the redwood can live more than 2,000 years.
In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Muir Woods a national monument dedicated to protecting and preserving the mighty redwoods.
In 1904, a fungus from Asia began killing chestnut trees in New York. Over the next 50 years, the disease killed about 3.5 billion trees and almost wiped out an entire species. Scientists want to prevent this from happening in California or elsewhere in the United States.
Studies show this disease spreads rapidly during the wet months of spring. The coming months could be vital in tracking the disease. Current weather forecasts predict that this spring will be rainier than the last two springs. ""We have to get familiar with the symptoms and the treatments,"" said another scientist, ""because we don't know how much farther it will spread.""

The graph shows percentages of people living in the U.S. from some ethnic groups. The figures add up to more than 100% because some people said they were from more than one ethnic group and were counted more than once.

The census counted 281.4 million people in the United States. More than 72 million of those people are kids under age 18. That means that about 26 out of every 100 people are kids!
The census also showed that U.S. kids are more
diverse than ever before. That means that today's kids have ancestors who came from a greater variety of foreign countries. ""The nation is more diverse in the year 2000 than it was in 1990, when the last census was taken,"" said Jorge del Pinal of the U.S. Census Bureau.

Much of that minority increase is due to immigration to the United States, the census reported. One in five kids has at least one parent who moved to this country from another country.
Del Pinal added that kids are more diverse than their parents because the number of marriages between people of different races is four times higher than it was in 1990. Two out of every five kids are part of at least one minority group.
Nearly 3 million kids have parents who have different ethnic backgrounds. For example, one parent may be from Asia and another from Europe.

620,"Honest Abe's Library: Lincoln's Papers Get a New Home
A group of librarians in Springfield, Illinois, has been booked up. The librarians are busy making sure the world's largest collection of information on President Abraham Lincoln gets to its new home safely.
The documents are on their way to the new Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library. The library is located in Springfield--the capital of Illinois. It is scheduled to open this fall.
The library will be the new home of the Illinois State Historical Library. Although the new library is only blocks away from the old one, the move hasn't been easy.
The six-week move involved several trucks and an army of people to help pack and transport nearly 12 million items. Of those items, about 47,000 books, maps, prints, documents, and other items are related to Lincoln.
Abraham Lincoln was president during the Civil War (1861-1865). The U.S. Civil War was fought between the Northern states and Southern states. One of the main issues of the war was that the South wanted the right to own slaves. The North wanted to
More than 600,000 Americans died in the Civil War--more than any other war in history. The Civil War ended when the South surrendered.

399,"Students in Colorado are riding a school skateboarding trend.
Skateboard class is rolling into schools! For sixth grader Carlos Cervantes, learning to skateboard takes a lot of work, but its worth it. ""[On] the first day of class, I was scared, but I tried it,"" the 12-year-old told
""After two days of practice, I felt more comfortable.""
Carlos is learning to skateboard in an after-school program at West Middle School in Aurora, Colorado. Skateboards are now finding their way into the regular school day as well. Douglass Elementary in nearby Boulder is the first public school in the country to offer skateboarding in gym class.
Douglasss physical education (PE) teacher Richard Cendali starts his skateboarding class by teaching students how to put on their safety gear and how to fall without getting hurt. Then kids start rolling around the gym. ""Sometimes theyre so excited, they fall. Theyre screaming, Im doing it! Im doing it!"" says Cendali, laughing. ""Its such a thrill to see those kids succeed and see their smiles.""
PE instructors around the country have started teaching classes such as skateboarding, in-line skating, yoga, and even rock climbing. Experts call these sports ""the new PE."" These individual sports are designed to help fight childhood
by getting kids involved in fun physical activities. Obesity is the condition of being dangerously overweight. Another goal of these nontraditional activities is to promote lifelong fitness habits.
Since 1980, the percentage of young people who are overweight has more than tripled. The time students spend in PE class, however, is decreasing. Many schools have dropped gym classes to save money or to provide students with more classroom time. Only 8 percent of elementary schools offer gym class to students every day, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Because students have less PE time, teachers are searching for ways to keep kids moving. ""[Skateboarding] is a great activity that keeps kids engaged in physical movement and gives them new skills and interests,"" says West Middle Schools afterschool program coordinator, Lindsey Johnson.
Some people say skateboarding not only offers health and fitness benefits but also teaches life lessons that could help kids with their schoolwork. Students who are learning to skateboard often spend hours practicing a new trick before they get it right. ""Skateboarding teaches kids to believe that if they stick with something, they will ultimately succeed,"" says education expert Richard Sagor of Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon.
Carloss skateboarding teacher at West Middle School, Eric Klassen, agrees. ""A baby will attempt to walk 600 to 900 times before [he or she] is successful,"" Klassen says. ""We tell students that they shouldnt say I cant do it unless theyve tried 600 to 900 times.""
Klassens students take his advice to heart. ""It took me 600 times to learn one new trick,"" says Martin Carrera, 11.
Over the last decade, team sports have dropped in popularity while individual sports, such as skateboarding, have been on the rise. This trend may affect the kinds of activities PE teachers offer in gym class. Learning individual sports gives all students an opportunity to exercise, whether they make it onto a school team or not.
Imagine that your school offers a skateboarding class. Would such a class have a positive effect on you? Explain.

forest animals in Rudyard Kiplings famous story The Jungle Book. When Kipling wrote his classic childrens book in 1894, more than 40,000 tigers roamed the forests of India. Today, there are only a few thousand left.
Wildlife officials recently started conducting Indias largest

""Its five minutes to midnight for the tiger,"" says Callum Rankine of the World Wildlife Fund. ""This is an issue affecting not just India but tigers worldwide.""

There is a high demand for tiger body parts in Asia. In China, healers use bones, tails, and other body parts to make traditional medicine. People make clothes and rugs from the animals thick black-and-orange coats. Some people eat tiger meat. Poachers can make more than $70,000 per animal by selling its body parts.
Humans also compete with tigers for land. Millions of people now live in or near areas where tigers prowl. Developers build roads through forests, loggers clear forests for lumber, and farmers use the land for crops. All those practices destroy the tigers habitat.

Some countries in Asia, such as Thailand, have good conservation policies, but others are still far behind.
is the protection of species. Wildlife officials are especially concerned about the fate of the large cats in India, where poaching is a huge problem, even in protected land areas.
Wildlife officials are using new computers, hightech cameras, and radio collars to track and count Bengal tigers in India. This state-of-the-art equipment will make sure that no cat is counted twice. The task force will also work closely with the Chinese government to help stop the illegal trading of tiger parts. It plans to educate farmers and ranchers about how to live with the tiger. Smith stresses that people who live closest to the majestic beasts need to help protect them from disappearing. He is involved with projects in several Asian countries where the endangered cats live. Smith says these projects have been successful because wildlife officials work closely with local people.
""This approach is powerful because these village rangers soon become recognized in their villages as experts,"" Smith says. He explains that it motivates people to make good decisions about the tigers future.
Sunita Narain, one of Indias top environmental officials, agrees. ""The country has no choice but to make peace with the communities that share the tigers home,"" she says. ""If not, we will lose the war of conservation, tiger by tiger.""

On September 11, 2001, help was needed immediately. Terrorists had crashed airplanes into the World Trade Center in New York City, New York, and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. Police officers and firefighters weren't the only ones to respond. More than 200 search-and-rescue dogs used their noses to help find victims.
Deja Vu, a German shepherd from Pennsylvania, hunted through piles of

So she organized a study to track the dogs' health.
Today, more than five years later, Otto has surprising results: Many of the dogs are fine. In fact, the dogs in her study are just as healthy as other search-andrescue dogs not involved in the 9/11 recovery efforts.
Deja Vu is no exception. ""We were concerned [about] what the dogs were inhaling and walking through,"" Deja Vu's handler, Pat Thompson, told
""But Deja Vu has remained in good health.""
The study results are surprising because thousands of people who volunteered at the disaster site now have

sometimes reacts differently than a human's immune system does. That system protects the body against diseases and infections. For example, respiratory problems such as asthma are unusual in dogs. Otto and other researchers say that may be why the search-and-rescue dogs haven't developed any breathing disorders.
The scientists also think the dogs in the study may be healthier than the people who worked at the sites because most of the canines spent less time at the disaster sites than their two-legged counterparts. Many rescue workers who developed breathing problems spent months volunteering after the attacks. The dogs in Otto's study spent an average of 10 days helping.
Scientists may never pinpoint the exact reason that most of the dogs in Otto's study are in good health. But Otto hopes to continue the study for as long as the dogs live. She wants to stay on the lookout for any health problems that may develop over the next few years.
She plans to use the information she gathers to protect search-andrescue dogs on future disaster missions. ""No piece of equipment can ever do the job that these dogs do,"" Otto told
Each human has a unique scent, like a fingerprint. That scent comes from a mixture of sweat and tiny flakes of skin, called

The workers have no time to spare. I'm getting a sneak preview as they prepare for the 77th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.
More than 2 million people will line the parade route. Another 60 million people will watch on TV. I meet with John Piper and his talented team, who produce every detail of the huge parade.
Piper is in charge of the studio. His crew designs and builds the floats and giant balloons that appear in the parade.
The 2003 Macy's parade lineup features 15 giant helium balloons and 27 smaller balloons. Also included will be 29 floats, some of which contain cold-air balloons called ""falloons."" Ten marching bands and 30 groups of clowns will spice up the festivities.
""We don't do anything small,"" Piper tells me.
The first giant balloon to fly in the Macy's parade was Felix the Cat, in 1927.
The parade has featured 170 giant balloons in its history. No more than 15 balloons are used each year.
Kermit the Frog stretches 78 feet, making it the longest balloon in this year's parade.
A record six different Snoopy character balloons have appeared in the parade over the years.
In 1957, a massive downpour caused the Popeye balloon to dump gallons of water on spectators below.
To prove his point, Piper leads me up two flights of stairs. Here, Macy's balloon experts-called ""balloonatics""-work their magic. In one area hang models of the parade's newest giant balloons. The balloons include ""Strike
Up the Band"" Barney, Sesame Street's Super Grover, and an all-new Garfield.
Garfield has flown in 15 Macy's parades, but this year he will have a friend-his teddy bear, Pooky.
In a large room next door, I watch as Piper checks the 49-foot-long Garfield balloon for leaks. On Thanksgiving morning, more than 50 Macy's ""handlers"" will steer the balloon 2.5 miles along the skyscraper-lined streets of New York City.
Downstairs, head painter Beth Lucas puts the final touches on an 8-foot-tall eagle. The giant bronze bird will be at the center of the ""Spirit of America"" float.
Nearby, other workers hammer away from atop a wooden frame that will become the ""Bridge to the Future"" float. The float will feature the newest Hess toy truck and race cars.
All the Macy's floats are weatherproof. When folded, they must be no more than 12.5 feet tall and 8 feet wide. That size allows them to fit through the Lincoln Tunnel on their way from the New Jersey studio to New York City.
Piper tells me that working on the parade is a dream come true. ""When I was a kid, my two favorite things in the world were cartoons and things that fly,"" he adds. ""The Macy's parade puts both of them together.""

According to the study, which was paid for by the U.S. government, more than 5 million kids, ages 6 to 19, have suffered some hearing loss. That's more than one out of every ten kids. Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss.
Amanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. ""It was assumed in the past that children wouldn't have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage,"" Niskar said.
Niskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a ""problem for children,"" she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems.
Hearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems.
For example, hearing loss ""can influence [a] child's ability to learn in the classroom,"" Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions.
Niskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead.

The Earth Day Network wants people to rely more on clean sources of energy that don't pollute the environment. Some of those sources include sun, wind, and hydrogen power. For example, scientists are experimenting with hydrogen-powered cars that do not release harmful exhausts into the air the way today's gasoline-powered cars do.

Kids really can make a difference. Just ask 15-year-old Ryan Hreljac (HURL-jak) of Kemptville, Canada. When he was 6, he learned about the shortage of safe drinking water in some parts of the world. Today, Ryans Well Foundation has raised more than $1.5 million to build more than 200 wells in 11 countries, most in Africa.
During his mission to raise money, Ryan became pen pals with Akana Jimmy, an orphan who lived in Africa. In Jimmys tiny village of Agweo, Uganda, there was no clean water until Ryan raised enough money to buy the village its first well. A new book tells the story of their life-changing friendship

In 1998, Ryans first-grade teacher told the class that polluted water was causing thousands of children to become sick and even die. For Ryan, a lack of clean water was unimaginable. His teacher said the cost of building a well in Africa was just $70. Determined to help, Ryan spent months doing household chores to earn enough money to pay for a well.
Later that year, Ryan proudly took his savings to WaterCan, a Canadian organization that helps provide safe drinking water to impoverished countries. To his disappointment, Ryan was told that the cost of building a well was much higher: $2,000.
or promised, to continue raising money. Word of his mission spread, and soon the media picked up his story. To Ryans astonishment, people started sending him donations. By 2000, Ryan, then 9, had raised enough money to build his first well. With help from Canadian Physicians for Aid and Relief, Ryan chose Jimmys village as the site for the well.
Ryans well changed the lives of the people in Agweo and especially affected Jimmys life. Thats when the two boys became pen pals. They became friends when Ryan traveled to Uganda in 2000 to help complete the well.
In 2003, Ryans family arranged to bring Jimmy to their home in Canada. ""We used to live as friends,"" Jimmy, now 17, says, ""but now we live as brothers.""
The two teenagers hope their book will raise awareness about unsafe drinking water and prompt people to take action to help. ""The situation is difficult, but you have to start somewhere,"" Ryan says. ""We need to work harder to make the world a better place.""

Is your backpack weighing you down? If so, consider lightening your load. A recent study shows that lugging around a bulky backpack that doesn't fit correctly can lead to poor
If someone tells you that good posture is important, that person is referring to the position of your body when you stand, sit, or walk. Carrying around too much weight in your backpack can force you to bend forward. Slouching over can round your shoulders and cause your upper back to curve.
Over time, the extra stress on your back can create posture problems. Some doctors think those problems may lead to neck and back pain.
Thirteen children, ages 8 and 9, participated in the backpack study. They walked about 1,130 feet. That is about the average length of a child's walk to school. The kids walked with backpacks that weighed 9 to 13 pounds. The children also walked without backpacks.
The study's researchers found that the heavier the backpack load, the more children bent down to support its weight. Afterward, some kids complained that their lower backs and shoulders hurt.
Heidi Orloff, one of the researchers, said that she could tell when the backpacks were too heavy or the kids were tired. ""The kids' chins drop to their chests,"" she told
An estimated 40 million school-age children in the United States use backpacks. Some health groups say that more than half of those students may be carrying backpacks heavy enough to affect their posture.
When worn correctly, backpacks have many benefits. They have lots of compartments that help you stay organized. Compared with shoulder bags, backpacks are a better way to carry around the items you need for school. Your body's strongest muscles-in the back and stomach-support the weight of a backpack. A shoulder bag often puts strain unevenly on your body.
However, most health experts recommend that kids carry backpacks that are no more than 15 percent of their body weight. That means a 70-pound student should wear a backpack that weighs less than 10 1/2 pounds. Orloff also said that spot checks around the country show that many children are carrying backpacks that weigh between 20 and 25 pounds. Now, that's quite a burden!
Below, you'll find some tips to help ease your load. Your back will thank you!
Choose a backpack that is the right size for your body.
Use both shoulder straps and fasten the waist strap to balance the weight evenly.
Adjust the shoulder straps so that the backpack is close to your body.
Pack only what you need and place the heaviest items closest to the center of your back.
What are other ways you can help improve your posture?
That means you should bend at the knees when you pick up your backpack.

For years, Michael Newdow of California has fought to have the phrase removed from the pledge. He continually argues that because of the pledge's reference to God, his elementary school daughter should not have to listen to it recited daily.
Last year, the case did not make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Given the recent lower court's ruling, it is unclear whether the Supreme Court will now hear the controversial case.

According to the federal court, the phrase ""under God"" suggests that the government supports religion. That violates the First Amendment to the Constitution.

Experts say the UFO seen in October was most likely a meteor, or space rock streaking through Earth's atmosphere. Other UFO sightings, however, remain a mystery.
For years, the U.S government has been studying UFO sightings. Much of the information that the government has gathered on UFOs is top-secret.
Now a new group wants the government to tell everyone what it knows about UFOs. The group is called the Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFI).
""It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the real nature of this phenomenon,"" said John Podesta. Podesta is a former White House official and a CFI member.
The members of CFI asked the government to release information about specific UFO sightings. One such sighting happened in December 1965.
On that cold night, people in western Pennsylvania saw a bright light streak through the sky. The light looked liked it crashed behind some hills.
The mysterious object might have been a rock from space. A space rock that crashes into Earth is called a meteorite. However, several witnesses claimed that soldiers searched the area where the object ""crashed."" They say the soldiers loaded a car-sized object onto a truck, placed a tarp over the object, and drove it away-never to be seen again.
The members of CFI claim that the U.S. government has never released information about the sighting and the object. ""We can't come up with a reason why this information is being withheld. The government won't even acknowledge that the incident took place, but we know that it did,"" said one CFI member.
For now, the exact nature of some UFOs remains a mystery. CFI members hope that the answer lies in secret government papers. They say they are only searching for the truth and they want everyone to know the truth.

684,"Polar bears reign as the kings of the Arctic. Yet there is trouble underfoot for those snow-colored creatures and other wildlife as their icy habitat slips away.
The Arctic is the icy, cold region located around the North Pole. In November, scientists from eight countries released a report saying that the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of Earth.
In the report, scientists predict that at least half of the summer sea ice in the Arctic will melt by the end of this century. The scientists blame
for the Arctic thaw. That is the gradual rise in Earth's temperature.
Arctic ice is melting at an alarming rate. Winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen between 4 and 7 degrees Fahrenheit. During the past 30 years, polar bears have lost more than 386,000 square miles of ice--an area larger than the states of Texas and Arizona combined.
More than 20,000 polar bears live in the Arctic regions. Disappearing sea ice threatens polar bears and other cold-weather animals. Polar bears use the ice as a bridge to hunt seals, their primary source of food.
As the sea ice disappears, the mighty
, or hunters, catch fewer seals and risk starvation. Seals also depend on the ice to rest and give birth. Scientists fear that polar bears, seals, and other animals that rely on the ice could be wiped out by the end of the century if the warm-up continues.
Some of the 4 million people who live in the Arctic have also found themselves on shaky ground. As the frozen land thaws, buildings and roads have weakened.
Inuits (IH-nyoo-wets), a group of native people in the region, fish and hunt Arctic animals, including polar bears. They depend on those animals as their main source of food. Inuit hunters are also falling through thinning ice.
Rising sea levels have forced some people in the Arctic to move their coastal villages inland. The report warns that melting ice could cause sea levels to continue to rise--up to 3 feet by the end of this century. Towns and cities along coastlines around the world could flood as a result.
The warm-up also affects other parts of the planet. Arctic ice and snow reflect heat from the sun into space. Without the ice and snow, the planet would be much warmer. ""The polar regions are essentially the Earth's air conditioner,"" said scientist Michael McCracken.
Who cranked up the thermostat on the Arctic? Scientists say human activity is to blame for global warming. People use
, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to power cars, heat homes, and create electricity.
Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Burning those fuels gives off gases that trap heat from the sun and add to the overheating of the Earth.
To protect life in the Arctic, scientists say people need to limit their use of fossil fuels. ""Climate change is not just about the future,"" said scientist Pal Prestud, who worked on the report. ""It is happening now.""
The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Those gases collect in a layer and trap heat from the sun. The layer of gases is like the windows in a greenhouse. The process is called the

The jaw-dropping thrill ride shatters the world's record for roller coaster speed and height. Of the more than 1,000 roller coasters in the United States, it is the latest ""extreme"" coaster to be built.

enable roller coasters like Kingda Ka to move for most of the ride. According to scientists, energy is the ability to cause change. At the beginning of the ride, Kingda Ka blasts passengers to a speed of 128 miles an hour with technology similar to the kind that launches Navy jets from aircraft carriers. Each train on Kingda Ka is hooked up to a
cable. Liquid under high pressure is pushed through the cable. Along with motors, the hydraulic power rockets the coaster skyward.
After reaching the top of the first hill, the coaster works in the same way your bike does when you roll, pedal-free, down a slope. When a roller coaster is stopped, it has
, or stored energy. At any moment, the coaster can move, so it has the potential for motion.
As the roller coaster starts cruising, gravity takes over and converts the potential energy into
, which is the energy of motion. The repeated changes of potential energy to kinetic energy and then back again drives the roller coaster.
Kingda Ka covers 3,118 feet of track and lasts less than a minute. To roller coaster buff Steve Urbanowicz from New Jersey, the new ride is a scream! ""The ride seems like it's over really quickly, but Kingda Ka packs eight high moments of drama into those 50 seconds,"" he told
Urbanowicz, 46, speaks from experience. He has ridden 876 roller coasters around the world. In fact, he has taken more than 5,000 rides on one in particularthe wooden Cyclone at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, where the first true American coaster opened in 1884. ""I loved going to amusement parks when I was a kid and never grew out of it.""
Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division (reproduction number LC-USZ62-63945)
This illustration from 1886 shows passengers getting a one-minute ride for 5 cents aboard Coney Island's coaster.
The idea for the roller coaster was born in Russia in the 1600s when huge blocks of ice, supported by wood, were made into sleds. Straw or fur covered the icy seats.
Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, is credited with beginning America's amusement park history, in 1875. The nation's first coaster opened there in 1884 and cruised all of 6 miles an hour!
Some of the best coasters of all time were built during the 1920s. That era reigns as the golden age of amusement parks. By the end of the decade, the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression caused many parks to close.

New Mexico Rep. Ben Rios wants Gov. Gary Johnson to pardon Billy the Kid, who used several names, including William H. Bonney, Henry McCarty, and Henry Bonney.
In 1878, Billy the Kid shot and killed Sheriff William Brady. In April 1881, the Kid was sentenced to hang for shooting Brady. Before the sentence could be carried out, however, Billy escaped from jail, killing two deputies. After Billy escaped, Sheriff Pat Garrett tracked him down and shot him to death in July 1881.
The descendants of Sheriff Brady say that pardoning the Kid would be another crime. Bennett Brady, the sheriff's great-grandson, said, ""He doesn't deserve pardoning.""

136,"Latest Finds at La Brea Tar Pits
A saber-toothed cat leaps from behind a bush. It moves toward the side of a stream. It's a hot day, and the cat is thirsty. What the cat doesn't see is the shallow pool of liquid asphalt that is covered by a thin layer of sand. As the cat nears the stream, it steps into the sticky black asphalt.
The bones from about 2,000 saber-toothed cats have been pulled from La Brea.
Soon, all four paws are stuck in the muck, and the cat is trapped. Struggling to get free, the cat becomes covered in the asphalt. Several days pass, and the cat, still stuck in the asphalt, dies of starvation.
Now, 35,000 years later, that sandy streamside spot is known as the La Brea (BRAY-ah) tar pits in Los Angeles, California. Last month, scientists finished their annual dig at La Brea's Pit 91.
The scientists unearthed nearly 1,000 fossils and spent time studying those fossils. ""The information we captured will tell us more about what life was like in this area 35,000 years ago than we've ever known before,"" said scientist Chris Shaw. By studying the fossils pulled from the tar pits, scientists are learning more about how Earth's environment has changed through time.
Shaw has been working at the La Brea site for nearly 30 years. ""My favorite part of the job is when I'm actually in the pit digging,"" Shaw told
. He added that he has become used to being covered in dirt and asphalt. ""It's like working in a big sandbox.""
Shaw spends much of his time at the George C. Page Museum in Los Angeles overseeing the huge collection of fossils pulled from La Brea. The museum holds thousands of fossils of prehistoric animals that died in the tar pit.
Some of the animals that fell into La Brea include woolly mammoths, bison, horses, ground sloths, western camels, and llamas. Many of the fossils that have been collected are from about 25,000 to 35,000 years ago.
During that time, Earth was cooler and was just coming out of one of many ice ages.
During ice ages, when Earth's temperature cooled, great sheets of ice, called
, formed at Earth's poles and over huge areas of land.
Digging at Pit 91 has stopped until May 2001. In the meantime, Shaw and other scientists will study the many fossils they have pulled from La Brea.
After 30 years, Shaw still loves his work. ""The coolest thing about doing fieldwork,"" Shaw said, ""is realizing that the fossil you're touching has not seen the light of day for about 30,000 years.""

The bears are back after being on the brink of extinction in and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is located in the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana.
Now the U.S. government may remove the grizzly from its list of endangered species in this area. ""The future of the Yellowstone grizzly bears is bright,"" says Chris Servheen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
That wasnt always the case. The numbers of grizzlies began to shrink in the early 1900s largely because ranchers hunted the animals and farmers destroyed their
By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears still lived in the Yellowstone area. That year, the grizzly was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which offers special protection to animals facing extinction. Today, wildlife experts estimate that more than 600 bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone.
Grizzly bears live in other parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as well as Washington state and will remain on the list in those areas. Grizzlies in Alaska, which number about 30,000, have never been on the list because that population is healthy.
Its Not Time Yet Not everyone thinks its a good decision to remove grizzlies from the list. Some wildlife officials fear that if the bear is removed from the list, its habitat around Yellowstone could be used for logging, oil drilling, and development. Others worry that the bears will be hunted again. ""We would love to see the grizzly bear delisted, but its not ready,"" says wildlife supporter Louisa Wilcox. ""If you want to protect bears for future generations, you have to protect the habitat they need. This plan doesnt do it.""
Should grizzlies no longer be listed as an endangered species? Why or why not?
The grizzlys return isnt the only species success story. Take a look at some other animals that are being saved, thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists.
In 1963, only 417 pairs of bald eagles nested in the United States. There are now more than 6,400 pairs, and the national symbol may soon be removed from the list of endangered species.
Hawaiians used to hunt this reptile for dinner. Now they swim alongside the turtles near some islands. The number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400 a year. There were only 67 in 1973.
Pollution and habitat loss have made it hard for sea otters to stay afloat. In 1938, there were only several hundred otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500.

They spend most of their time in eucalyptus trees.
A koala eats about 2 ? pounds of eucalyptus leaves each day. Koalas eat so many leaves that they often smell like eucalyptus cough drops.
Eucalyptus leaves are not very nutritious. As a result, koalas spend up to 18 hours a day sleeping. That helps them store up energy.
Bill Ellis shakes the branches of a tree where a koala named Yellow rests.
As volunteers hold a plastic sheet to catch Yellow, Ellis (in the red-and-blue cap) gently pushes her into a sack.
Volunteers hold Yellow in the sack as they adjust a radio collar around her neck. The radio collar will help scientists track her. They also place a colored tag in her ear to help tell her apart from other koalas on St. Bees Island.

361,"The Heat Is On: Will Global Warming Affect Animals?
Polar bears in Alaska are having trouble catching one of their main meals--ringed seals. To get to the seals, the bears often walk across islands of ice floating in the water.
Ice throughout Alaska is melting earlier and faster in the spring than it did several years ago. So polar bears don't have as much time to catch seals before the ice melts. As a result, polar bears are catching fewer seals.
Ice along Alaska's coast is melting because the temperature is higher worldwide. In the last 100 years, Earth's temperature has risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit.
. Global warming is changing the environment worldwide. As a result, many plants and animals are being affected, say scientists from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
As temperatures rise, more and more animals will have to
, or move, in order to survive, said scientist Jay Malcolm of the WWF.
Many plants and animals that can't adjust or migrate will not survive the rise in temperature, said WWF scientists. In some areas of the world, the WWF says, as many as two in ten species of plants and animals will die out by the year 2100.
Here are some examples of how global warming is affecting some animals in North America.
The numbers on the map show where each animal can be found.
The black guillemot (GIL-uh-maht) is a bird that lives on an island off Alaska's coast. It eats Arctic cod, a fish that lives in water under ice. Rising temperatures have caused much of the ice to melt. The Arctic cod has moved to other parts of the sea where water is still covered with ice. The guillemot no longer has enough fish to eat.
The American bistort is a plant that lives in Mount Rainier National Park. The Edith's checkerspot butterfly drinks nectar from bistort flowers. The warming temperatures have caused the butterflies to hatch earlier, before the flowers bloom, so the butterflies don't have enough food right after they hatch.
Global warming is actually helping some animals.
The Mexican vole lives in areas with warm temperatures. It is spreading northward into Arizona and Colorado because of the rise in temperatures there.
For years, red fire ants lived in the warm southern part of the United States. Today, because of rising temperatures, they are spreading northward.
Scientists have learned that global warming is already affecting Earth. ""We should not expect the effects of global warming to take place 50 years in the future,"" said scientist Rafe Sagarin. ""It's happening right now.""
Scientists agree that Earth has been getting warmer for the last 100 years. They don't agree on
Gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming. Carbon dioxide in the air traps heat from the sun, causing Earth's temperature to rise.
Volcanoes and forest fires release carbon dioxide into the air. Some scientists blame the rise in temperature on volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and other natural events.
Other scientists blame human actions for the rise in temperature. They say Earth has always had volcanoes and forest fires, so why is Earth warming now? Those scientists say the carbon dioxide from automobiles and factories is causing the recent increase in global warming.

How exactly does a new word make its way into the dictionary? It takes about 10 to 20 years for a new word to become a common term used by a lot of people.
Deciding which words make the cut is the job of editors. They spend a lot of their day reading newspapers and magazines to find out what new words and phrases are popular. They also get ideas from the movies and the Internet-and even from slang usage. They enter new words into a computer system.
Noah Webster, America's first dictionary editor, began a similar system. He started putting files of words on cards in Springfield, Massachusetts. There are now millions of words on file. Talk about wordy!

As if grades weren't enough to worry about, some students now have weight on their minds too. The number of overweight children in the United States has more than doubled in the past 20 years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Being
or severely overweight, can lead to health problems later in life.
As a result, schools in several states, from California to Pennsylvania, have started sending home ""BMI report cards."" Those schools send home a report of a student's
BMI is a calculation of weight and height that tells whether a person is overweight for his or her age.
Should schools send home BMI reports? People on both sides of the debate are weighing in.
Some lawmakers say BMI reports alert parents to their children's health and help combat obesity. In 2003, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee helped launch the first program to report students' BMIs. Obesity rates in that state have since stopped increasing. Pediatrician Joe Thompson helped plan the BMI program for Arkansas schools. He explains that the reports in Arkansas are sent home separately from report cards. ""The misconception is students are being graded on their weight,"" he told
""Just like a school screens for vision or hearing, this is a health approach to raise awareness about a risk.""
Not everyone thinks that reporting students' BMIs is a good idea. Parents have complained that the reports damage their children's self-esteem. Some parents say kids also worry that they are being ""graded"" on their weight. Opponents of BMI reports argue that schools that label students overweight are acting unfairly. The critics point out that many school cafeterias serve fatty foods. Parent Brett Levy from Chicago, Illinois, believes that schools should teach kids to lead healthy lifestyles instead of reporting their BMIs. ""Telling a boy or girl [a] BMI is not education,"" he told
Schools should issue BMI reports for students.
Schools should not issue BMI reports for students.

The long gray line is what all the students who have ever attended West Point are called. The term refers to the color of the uniforms that the
, or military students, wear. It also reminds the cadets that they are part of a long tradition, which celebrates its 200th anniversary this year.
On March 16, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson founded a school to train military officers and teach engineering. The school was established at West Point, which had been used as a fort.
The school's first class of students was smaller than the one that entered this year. In 1802, only two students were enrolled at the school. The youngest was 10 years old!
When West Point was founded, the United States was much smaller than it is today. The country extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River.
Until 1817, West Point did not have a set course of study. In that year, Sylvanus Thayer was appointed the superintendent of West Point. He developed the school's curriculum and turned West Point into one of the best schools in the United States. George Woodbridge, who graduated from the school in 1826, explained Thayer's accomplishment, saying, ""His object was to make [us] gentlemen and soldiers.""
The officers who graduated from West Point helped build and defend the United States. They explored the vast areas west of the Mississippi River. They designed the roads, bridges, dams, railroads, and canals that the United States needed as it grew. They also helped design some of our greatest buildings and monuments. For example, they worked on the Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the base of the Statue of Liberty.
Many of the school's graduates have gone on to play important roles in U.S. history. They have been famous generals and U.S. presidents. Both President Ulysses S. Grant and President Dwight D. Eisenhower were generals and graduates of West Point. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, also graduated from West Point.
Even though all West Point graduates serve America in different ways, they all share important lessons learned at the academy. For example, they learn about taking responsibility for one's actions. They also share the school's motto. ""Always there echoes and reechoes in my ears [the motto]: Duty. Honor. Country,"" said General Douglas MacArthur, a West Point graduate.
George Washington Whistler graduated from West Point in 1819. He spent most of his career building railroads. He also built steam locomotives.
While building his first locomotive, Whistler also built the first American train whistle. He placed his whistle on top of the locomotive. He called his locomotive the Whistler. The sound of Whistler's whistle can still be heard on old steam locomotives.

Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two major candidates for president stand on important issues. This week's issue is
In 2002, President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act. This education law provides states with government money so they can help improve their school systems.
The law is meant to ensure that schools are doing enough to help students who are struggling learners. Bush says that the law helps students perform better in reading and math. Under the law, schools are required to measure students' progress through testing. Schools in which many students don't perform well on the tests have two years to improve. Otherwise, students have the option to transfer to different schools.
Senator Kerry voted for the No Child Left Behind Act. If elected, he will continue to support this law. However, Kerry wants the government to give states more money to enforce the education law and make sure schools receive the money they need.
In addition, Kerry proposes to increase the number of high school graduates. To do that, he plans to reduce class sizes and break up large, failing high schools. He also wants to begin a program in which college students mentor (help) middle school students plan for their futures.

More class time can improve test scores, according to a recent report by the research group Education Sector. As a result, schools are experimenting with tacking on an hour or more to the school day.
Elementary and middle school students at Fletcher-Maynard Academy in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have gone to an eight-hour school day. Fletcher-Maynard Academy is just one of 10 schools in Massachusetts trying out the new schedule. Lawmakers in Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, and Washington, D.C., are also debating extended school hours.
People in favor of longer school days say kids need to learn more to stay competitive in today's world. The additional hours enable teachers to spend more time on each subject. Fletcher-Maynard principal Robin Harris likes having the extra hours. ""Teachers can be a little more creative,"" she told
Students aren't just spending the extra time with their heads in a book, though. Harris explains that her students get longer recesses and more snack time. Parent Dawn Oliver says her 11-year-old daughter, Brittany, is an advice columnist for a magazine at her school in Fall River, Massachusetts. ""The kids get so involved in these things because it's not all book work,"" says Oliver.
Critics argue that extended school days could be too long for today's busy kids. And extra school time might prevent students from exploring other interests. Some students have complained about having to stay later. They are concerned that they wouldn't be able to concentrate during the last classes of the day.
Other people point out that longer school days
with, or get in the way of, after-school sports and clubs. ""The day is long enough already,"" student Cameron Villers from Ansonia, Connecticut, told
""After-school activities would be affected. Nobody wants to be at school from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m."" If schools have different schedules, planning athletic games could prove difficult.

602,"Something to Go Nuts About: New Treatment May Help Kids With Peanut Allergies
Peanuts may seem harmless, but to some kids they mean trouble. About one and a half million Americans are allergic to peanuts. Between 50 and 100 people, mostly kids, die each year from peanut allergies.
For kids with peanut allergies, help may be on the way in the form of a new drug called TNX-901. Monthly shots of TNX-901 are not a cure, but they may save lives. Results suggest that the drug reduces the chance of a serious allergic reaction if peanuts are eaten accidentally.
Eating just the tiniest amount of peanuts can make kids with peanut allergies very sick. For some of those kids, an allergic reaction can occur from just touching or smelling peanuts. Symptoms include stomach pain, hives, and tightness in the throat.
""I get an itchy rash all over my body when I eat peanuts, so I hope the new injection will help,"" said an 11-year-old girl.
It may be years before the treatment is available to the public. More testing needs to be done before the drug is approved. Researcher Donald Leung said the new drug could ""help lift a cloud of fear that people with peanut allergies live under every time they eat."" That is something that kids with peanut allergies won't find nutty.
These eight foods are the cause of most food allergies:
tree nuts (such as walnuts and cashews)
About 7 million Americans have food allergies. People can be allergic to almost any food.
If you are allergic to any food, it is important to read labels carefully. Always ask an adult if you are not sure about what is in your food.

But some Americans acted differently. Instead of helping others, they attacked innocent Arab and Muslim Americans.
Some individuals vandalized mosques (the buildings where Muslims practice Islam, their religion). Others attacked anyone they thought looked to be from the Middle East.
Dr. Abdullah Khoui, of the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C., condemned the attacks while defending his religion.
""What took place, no sound mind would approve of it, and no religion at all in the world would accept it,"" Khoui said. ""Islam does not approve of what took place.""
Arshad Majid, of the Islamic Center of Long Island, N.Y., said that Islam promotes peace.
""We're concerned that the actions of a small number of extremists is likely to paint with a very broad brush the large population of God-fearing, peace-loving Muslims in America,"" Majid said after the attacks.
President George W. Bush agreed with the Islamic leaders. While visiting a mosque, President Bush commented on the attacks on Muslim and Arab Americans. ""That's not the America I know,"" he said. ""That should not and that will not stand in America.""
Muslims practice the religion of Islam. Islam was first preached by the prophet Muhammad about 1,400 years ago.
In the 600s, Muhammad had a dream in which Allah, the Arabic name for God, called him to be a prophet. Islam means ""submission, commitment, and peace"".
Islam teaches that human diversity, or difference, is a sign of the richness of Allah's mercy. In other words, according to religious experts, Islam promotes peace.
Those experts add that the September 11 attacks do not represent Muslim beliefs. The majority of the 1.2 billion Muslims worldwide practice peace and tolerance toward others.

Hispanic Americans are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. Those parts of the world include Spain, Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and most countries in Central America and South America. In the United States, many Hispanic Americans are also called Latinos.
As of June, about 39 million Hispanic Americans are living in the United States. That number marks a jump from the 2000 census count. At that time, Hispanic Americans numbered about 35 million. Today, the total population of the United States is estimated at more than 288 million people.
Currently, 1 out of every 6 kids in this country is Hispanic. Officials estimate that by 2020, 1 out of 4 children will be Hispanic American.
Hispanic Americans have influenced food, music, and customs in the United States. Hispanic Heritage Month marks a time for Americans to celebrate the traditions and history of Hispanic people. It takes place from September 15 to October 15.
People in communities around the country will celebrate the month with festivals. Many students will recognize the month by learning about the important roles Hispanic people have played in our countrys history.

that to understand the history of the United States, people should learn about the contributions of different groups, including Hispanic Americans.
People sometimes refer to the United States as a ""melting pot."" That phrase means that people from many different countries have settled here. People of Hispanic heritage, along with people from other cultures, help make the United States strong.
From science to sports, people of Hispanic heritage have contributed to the history of the United States. Take a look at some of these well-known people.
Dr. Novello was born in Puerto Rico. In 1990, she became the first Hispanic American to serve as the U.S. surgeon general. That is the doctor who leads our country on health issues. She worked to improve healthcare for Americans, especially children, women, and minorities.
Gary Soto is an award-winning Hispanic American author. He writes fiction and poetry for adults and children. His writing is based on his experiences growing up as a Mexican American in California. His books, including
Baseball in April and Other Stories and Taking Sides
, are popular with many young readers.
In 1990, Ellen Ochoa became the first Hispanic American woman astronaut when she was accepted into NASAs training program. Ochoa, whose fathers parents were from Mexico, flew her first space shuttle mission in 1993. Since then she has clocked more than 720 hours in flight.

A recent study shows that how kids answer those questions tells a lot about whether they are headed for trouble. The study says kids who spend their free time aimlessly often get into trouble.
The study, called the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, was funded by the federal government. More than 90,000 kids between the ages of 12 and 18 took part in the study. Those kids attended 134 different U.S. schools. The study followed them from 1994 to 2000.
About half of the kids in the study said they were not involved in dangerous activities. But 25 percent said they had tried a cigarette, 26 percent said they had picked up a gun, and 47 percent said they had tried alcohol.
The study found that kids who spend their free time hanging out with nothing to do, who get poor grades, or who don't talk with their parents are eight times more likely to take part in unhealthful activities later on, such as smoking cigarettes or trying drugs.
Kids who hang out with friends who drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or have tried drugs are likely to do what their friends are doing, said Robert Blum. Blum is one of the doctors who conducted the study. In other words, kids tend to act like their friends, Blum said.
""How young people do at school and what they do with their free time are the most important [ways of predicting] risky behavior,"" said Blum.
Kids should get involved in interesting activities, Blum advised. Instead of hanging out with kids who are already trying what the study calls ""high-risk activities,"" Blum said that kids should play sports, read, talk with parents, or do homework.
The National Longitudinal Study finds that kids who are involved in activities usually don't get into trouble. Here's a story written by a
kid reporter about a few kids who know how to spend their time:
There are a lot of good kids. I know three of them who live in my hometown, Lockport, Illinois.

Snakehead fish arrived in the United States from China and Korea, most likely as pets. When their owners no longer wanted them, they threw the fish into nearby lakes and streams. Snakehead fish now live in several states, from Maryland to California.
Snakehead fish aren't the only accidental arrivals. In the Great Lakes region, fingernail-sized zebra mussels hitchhiked from Russia in the water tanks of ships. Now the mussels clog pipes that provide drinking water to homes and schools.

Skin may not seem very important, but it is. It protects your body from burns, dirt, germs, and dangerous rays from the sun. It keeps fluids inside your body. And it contains all the nerves that allow you to feel things.
Skin is the largest organ in your body. If you stretched out an adult's skin into a flat sheet, it would cover an area of about 21 square feet. A square foot is a square whose sides each measure 1 foot.
Skin may cover a large area, but it is very thin. It is only about 1/8 inch thick. Despite being so thin, skin is made of three layers. The outermost layer is the epidermis. Just below the outermost layer is the dermis. Beneath those two layers is the subcutaneous tissue.
The epidermis contains a chemical called keratin. Keratin makes skin tough and waterproof. Keratin keeps germs out of your body.
The dermis is mainly made of blood vessels and nerve endings. The dermis provides the epidermis with food and oxygen.
The lowest layer, the subcutaneous tissue protects the body from blows. It also regulates the body's temperature.
All three layers of your skin protect you. Because your skin protects you, you should protect it by keeping it clean and eating a healthful diet. You should use sunblock when you are in the sun. If you take care of your skin, it will last a lifetime.

: You should let a cut breathe.
: Contrary to popular belief, cuts do not need to breathe. ""The open cut or scrape should be covered,"" said skin expert Dr. Amy Harned. According to Dr. Harned, it's important to wash the wound first. Then, apply an antibiotic ointment and cover the cut with a bandage. Leaving a cut uncovered can allow germs to infect it.
: Eating carrots will improve your eyesight.
: Carrots are rich in vitamin A, which helps keep your eyes healthy. According to eye expert Dr. Timothy Wingert, ""Eating carrots will not improve your eyesight. But eating carrots is part of a well-balanced diet. Carrots have nutrients that help your eyes to function properly."" Carrots also make a tasty snack.
: You can hurt your eyes by sitting too close to the TV.
: There is some truth to this advice. According to Dr. Wingert, sitting too close to the television for long periods of time makes eyes tired and can cause eyestrain. ""Generally, it is more comfortable on your eyes to view the television from at least 5 feet from the screen,"" he says. So, back up from that television or, better yet, turn it off!

119,"Doctors are always on guard against germs. They frequently wash their hands. Now, however, doctors are being told not to wash their hands with soap and water.
Instead of using soap and water, the doctors use a special gel. The gel kills germs and saves time. Doctors often take more than a minute to wash their hands with soap and water. The gel speeds things up.
What's more, constant washing and drying with soap and water dries out hands. The gel causes fewer problems, so doctors who use it are less likely to skip a cleaning.
Killing hospital germs is important. About 2 million hospital patients are infected by viruses each year. About 90,000 die from viruses they got in the hospital.
If you're not working in a hospital, using soap and water is good enough. All of us need to keep hands clean to keep germs away. Washing hands is important, especially before eating and before leaving a bathroom, where many germs live. It is important to keep your hands clean at school, too!

The robot played the song ""When You Wish Upon a Star."" After its performance, the 4-foot-tall droid bowed its head and waved its arms in response to the audience's applause.
Although the musical droid doesn't have a name yet, it is the latest in a string of

Other humanoid robots created by Japanese companies have been getting plenty of attention even without playing the trumpet.
Japanese scientists introduced ASIMO (ah-SEE-moh), the world's first stair-climbing robot, in 2000. The 4-foot, 115-pound ASIMO's many talents include walking, holding objects, speaking Japanese, and recognizing faces. ASIMO recently finished a world tour. The tour included several stops in U.S. cities so kids and adults could learn more about it.
Like ASIMO, QRIO (KYOOR-ee-oh), can talk and recognize faces. QRIO, which was unveiled in Japan in December 2003, can also run, jump, throw a ball, dance, and even belt out a tune.
In March, QRIO conducted Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in Japan. Before the rehearsal in front of a live audience, the robot grumbled, ""I'm feeling nervous.""
Today, robots come in all shapes and sizes. Many robots are used in factories. They help build cars, inspect computer parts, and package food. Robots speed up production on assembly lines and help save companies both time and money.
Robots also perform tasks that are difficult or dangerous for humans. Robots have explored the far reaches of space and traveled into active volcanoes.
that when robots were first introduced in the 1960s, they performed only jobs that were ""dirty, difficult, and dangerous."" That, however, is starting to change. Today's engineers hope that the new breed of humanoid robots will improve people's lives.
Many people are excited that humanoid robots may one day be able to lift people confined to beds or wheelchairs. The robots may also be able to help elderly people with chores such as vacuuming and taking out the garbage. Some people, however, worry that robots may take away jobs that are now performed by humans.
Although the humanoid robots have been busy making public appearances, they aren't for sale yet. If you really want a robot that will clean your room and help out with chores, you still have to wait a bit longer.
1. QRIO shows off some dancing skills. QRIO stands for ""quest for curiosity."" Why do you think the robot was given that name?

Earth's atmosphere is made of several layers. Ozone is a gas that makes up one of those layers. That layer stretches from 6 miles to 30 miles above Earth's surface.
Ozone is an important gas. It protects life on Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. Without ozone, life couldn't exist. The dangerous solar rays are called ultraviolet rays, or UV rays. UV rays can cause sunburn and skin cancer.
The pie chart shows the two most abundant gases in Earth""s atmosphere.
Scientists first noticed the ozone hole in the 1970s. Since then, each year, the hole has opened above Antarctica for a few months in the fall. The largest hole formed in 2000. It was three times larger than the United States. This year, unusually severe storms caused the hole to split, say scientists.
Cold temperatures in the atmosphere over Antarctica and chemical pollution cause the ozone hole. Chemicals that used to be in aerosol cans, air conditioners, and refrigerators made the pollution. To protect the atmosphere, people stopped using those dangerous chemicals in the mid-1990s.
Although the chemicals are no longer used, they stay in the atmosphere for a long time. Scientists say the ozone hole will continue to form for a long time. But it should start getting smaller.

Rocky Mountain moose are on the moveand they're flying firstclass. Wildlife workers are using helicopters to send Utah's moose to Colorado. In exchange, wildlife officials in Colorado are capturing bighorn sheep to send to Utah. The animal swap is part of a plan to keep the moose and sheep populations in both states healthy.
Rocky Mountain moose are on the move.
One of the largest moose hauls took place in January, when a single helicopter team captured 24 of the animals in a day. The moose are now roaming free in the Grand Mesa National Forest in Colorado, where the appearance of calves indicates that the moose population is growing. Colorado workers planned to hold up their end of the bargain by capturing 20 bighorn sheep to send to Utah in February.
""This year was a major group move,"" Stephanie Duckett, a biologist with the Colorado Division of Wildlife, told
Biologists are scientists who study living things. Duckett works at Grand Mesa, which didn't have any moose two years ago. ""So far we have moved 90 moose to the mesa,"" she says. Most of those animals came from Weber County, Utah, where the moose population is in trouble.
The moose in northern Utah are threatened by
That means there are too many animals for the environment to feed and support. Overpopulation can lead to animal starvation and disease. ""It's bad for the population and bad for the environment,"" says Duckett.
Wildlife officials often try to prevent overpopulation by issuing permits that allow hunters to kill more animals during hunting season. That wasn't an option with Utah's moose; many of them live on private land where hunting is
or not allowed. Instead, wildlife officials decided to make a trade.
""Here in northern Utah, we have too many moose, and we've lost a lot of our bighorn sheep population,"" Utah wildlife manager Justin Dolling told
Colorado had a healthy supply of bighorn sheep to send to Utah, and Colorado had plenty of room for Utah's extra moose.
Once they had a plan, wildlife officials had to find a way to safely catch the wild mooseone of the largest animal species in North America. They turned to animalcapture expert James Innes and his experienced team of helicopter ""moose muggers."" A moose mugger is an animal worker trained to capture a moose without harming it. ""We have zero tolerance for
Innes's helicopter chases a moose into a clearing by flying over the forest before dropping a net to catch the animal. Once the moose is down, a moose mugger jumps out of the hovering helicopter and secures the animal's legs. ""You have to use every trick in the book to tie them up,"" says Innes.
Once the moose is secured, it is placed in a canvas bag that hangs from the helicopter and then flown to a base camp. There, a veterinarian, or an animal doctor, gives the moose a checkup before it is placed on a truck and taken to its final destinationGrand Mesa.
Wildlife managers tackled the moose overpopulation problem in Utah by sending moose to areas where they would have enough food. The map shows how moose and bighorn sheep were swapped this year to keep both groups of animals healthy.

Adult moose are too large to be hunted by other animals. Human hunters are their only predator. Half of all moose scalves are killed by wolves, grizzly bears, or black bears.
How might other animals living in the same environment be hurt by moose overpopulation? How does the animal swap help solve that problem?

137,"Standing atop a hill this summer in the dense jungles of Guatemala, a country in Central America, scientist Arthur Demarest felt his feet sink into the jungle vines.
Demarest plunged into a deep, tangled snake hole up to his armpits. Hearing snakes slithering around him, Demarest froze. For half an hour, the scientist didn't move, waiting for the snakes to settle down so he could climb out safely. While stuck in that snaky situation, Demarest looked around and realized the pit was actually part of a jungle-covered three-story building.
As soon as he got out of the hole, Demarest and his team of scientists explored the hill. They found that it was an ancient palace built by the Maya people. The Mayan civilization covered parts of Mexico and Central America, and reached its greatest power between the years 250 and 900.
Demarest's team also discovered a city surrounding the palace. The Maya people called the city
, which means ""place of serpents."" The palace at Cancun was built more than 1,300 years ago by the Mayan king Tah ak Chaan.
So far, Demarest and his team have counted 170 rooms in the palace, which has 11 courtyards and covers an area the size of two football fields. Because of its sturdy limestone walls, the palace is in extremely good condition, Demarest said.
Demarest said Cancun is different from other Mayan cities. Unlike the other Mayan cities, Cancun doesn't have temples or evidence that there was warfare. ""The basis of power among the Mayan [kings] was religion and warfare,"" explained Demarest. ""Apparently, Cancun needed neither.""
The drawing shows an artist's idea of what the Cancun palace might have looked like.
Demarest said the city must have been very powerful. But its leaders were more focused on
, or widespread buying and selling, than on religion or warfare.
Located near the Pasin River, Cancun was a thriving trading center for the Maya. ""That river,"" Demarest said, ""was really the superhighway of the Mayan world.""
Jade, a semiprecious stone, is everywhere at the site, Demarest said. Scientists even uncovered the remains of a woman who had jade false teeth! Finely carved jade statues were found in the graves of workmen.
Demarest estimates that it will take about 10 to 15 years to
, or dig out, Cancun. In his 20 years of uncovering Mayan ruins, he said, Cancun is ""by far the most spectacular.""
The snakes must think so, too. ""A buried palace is exciting to us,"" said Demarest, ""but it's even more exciting to snakes. They love it! This place is full of snakes.""
Why might studying ancient cities be important?

Some coin collectors say U.S. coins should have a greater variety of pictures. For instance, they want to take the image of Abraham Lincoln off the penny. They want to remove the drawing of Thomas Jefferson from the nickel.
""After almost 100 years, even Lincoln himself would probably say enough is enough,"" said coin collector Fred Weinberg.
Weinberg and others say the presidential portraits are boring. Instead of presidents, the critics want to see patriotic scenes.
""I'm not putting down dead dignitaries, but the public wants to see something new to stimulate pride and interest, not just in coins, but in history,"" Weinberg said.
Officials at the U.S. Mint, which makes coins, say they are looking into the possibility of change. The mint could have a new nickel in 2003, a new dime in 2004, a new half dollar in 2005, and a new penny in 2006.
U.S. coins have honored presidents for almost a century. In 1909, President Abraham Lincoln became the first president to be pictured on a coin.
Later, other presidents were pictured on coins. George Washington's image was added to the quarter in 1932. Thomas Jefferson's picture replaced that of a Native American on the nickel in 1938. Franklin Roosevelt's image appeared on the dime beginning in 1946. John F. Kennedy was pictured on the half dollar beginning in 1964.
Not everyone agrees that a change in change is good. Some people want to keep their loose change exactly the way it is.

Today, ancient Assur is in ruins. Desert sand has covered over much of the 3,500-year-old city. Now Assur faces a new threat: water.
Assur is located in what is now Iraq, a country in the Middle East. Many parts of Iraq are covered by desert. Water is hard to find in the desert areas. To increase the amount of water, Iraqi officials are building a dam on the river Tigris.
The dam will trap the river's water. As the water rises, it might flood Assur and many other nearby ancient ruins.
Scientists worry that floodwaters will destroy artifacts hidden beneath the desert sand. Assur has already been the site of some amazing discoveries.
Scientists recently discovered four hidden tombs at Assur. They found ancient coffins, gold, jewelry, and gems. They also dug up the remains of two ancient Assurian queens.
Scientists used modern medical equipment to study the queens' bodies. They learned about some of the medical problems the ancient queens suffered from. The bodies showed evidence of dental cavities, sinus infections, and poor nutrition.
Michael Mller-Karpe, a scientist who studies ancient Assyria, said, ""The Assyrian queens have just begun to speak to us, and we are looking forward to more answers.""

""You can't save Assur if it's [near] a dam,"" said scientist Peter Miglus. The soil beneath the ancient city would soak up water like a sponge. The water in the soil would destroy what's left of ancient Assur.
For now, scientists are scrambling to uncover the secrets hidden for centuries in Assur and other nearby communities. Meanwhile, some people are looking for ways to save the ancient cities. ""We don't want the slightest damage to Assur,"" one Iraqi official said.

How do changes taking place in the Supreme Court affect the lives of all Americans?
States is now in sessionwith a brand-new leader. John G. Roberts Jr. was recently sworn in as the 17th chief justice.
The Supreme Court is the highest court in the nation. The Court is made up of nine judgeseight associate justices and one chief justice. Justices are appointed for life. The retirement or death of a justice can create an opening on the Supreme Court.
or chose, Roberts to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. O'Connor, the first woman justice, had announced in July that she would retire. But on September 3, Chief Justice William Rehnquist died.
Bush then asked the Senate to consider Roberts for the chief justice position. The chief justice is considered the justice with the most influence on the Court.
""One of the most [important] decisions a president makes is his appointment of a justice to the Supreme Court,"" said Bush in his announcement of Roberts's nomination. ""The decisions of the Supreme Court affect the life of every American.""
At press time, the president had nominated Harriet Miers to take over O'Connor's position. If Miers is confirmed, she will be the third woman to serve on the Supreme Court, after O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
John Roberts was born in Buffalo, New York, on January 27, 1955. In high school, he was captain of his football team. He also wrestled, sang in the choir, and edited the school newspaper. After graduating from law school, he assisted then Associate Justice Rehnquist. He is married to a lawyer and has two childrenJosie, 5, and Jack, 4.
The Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., heads the judicial branch, one of three branches of the U.S. government. The other two branches are the legislative branch and the executive branch. Each branch has a different job.
The authors of the Constitution created the three branches to ensure that no branch had too much power. That system is called
The legislative branch makes laws. That branch is also called Congress and is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The executive branch carries out laws made by Congress. That branch is headed by the president. The judicial branch
or explains, the laws. Many courts across the nation make up the judicial branch.
A case makes its way to the Supreme Court through lower courts. The Supreme Court has the power to overturn rulings made in lower courts. Once the Supreme Court rules on a case, the decision is final. All lower courts must follow its decision in similar cases.
How does a person become a Supreme Court justice?
1. The president nominates a person to serve as a justice.
2. A group of senators, called the Senate Judiciary Committee, asks the nominee his or her opinions about various laws and cases.
3. The Judiciary Committee votes on the nominee.
4. If the nominee is approved by the Judiciary Committee, all 100 U.S. senators vote. (There are two senators for each state.)
5. A nominee is confirmed if he or she receives 51 votes. Roberts was confirmed by a Senate vote of 78 to 22.
Roberts is the youngest chief justice since John Marshall led the Supreme Court more than 200 years ago. At age 50, Roberts is likely to be chief justice for a very long time. The chief justice decides which cases the Court will hear. In many cases, the chief justice speaks first and leads the debate.
During his swearing-in ceremony, Roberts said to President Bush, ""There is no way to repay the confidence you have shown in me other than to do the best job I possibly can do, and I'll try to do that every day.""
Do you think Supreme Court justices should be appointed for life? Why or why not?

The United Nations was set up in 1945 shortly after the end of World War II (1939-1945). Its main purpose is to help countries work for world peace.
Currently 192 countries belong to the United Nations. Their representatives in the U.N. General Assembly try to solve world problems, such as hunger and disease.

Griswold, who is a radio traffic reporter by day, runs a ""bat hospital"" in her Connecticut home. While you wont find these little creatures stretched out on hospital beds, you might find one or two of them snuggling up to Griswold.
At her home, Griswold cares for bats that are sick, injured, or orphaned. She has taken care of bats with injuries, such as a broken wing, as well as babies that have lost their mothers.
She has also cared for bats that were stranded in the winter because they had forgotten to travel south during the colder months. With the help of a

But Griswold is no stranger to bats. She grew up on a farm where they were a common sight. So it was no surprise how quickly she took to an orphaned baby bat she found squeaking on the ground outside her house ten years ago. She took the bat in and fed it milk from a goat on her farm.
To her delight, the little creature survived the night. Today, the bat--which she named Poppy--still lives with her. She did not release Poppy back into the wild because it identifies more with humans than with bats.
This bat lady, however, doesnt keep Poppy all to herself. Poppy is one of the winged creatures that Griswold brings with her on school visits. In fact, this Halloween she is speaking at a Connecticut school. Griswold, who teaches kids about bats, is on a mission to change their reputation.
. Many people, she says, are afraid of bats, but theyre actually gentle, shy creatures that are important to the environment.
Bats pollinate plants, spread seeds, and, most important, eat insects. ""There is no animal worldwide that eats more bugs at night than bats do,"" said Griswold, who is full of bat trivia.
However, the number of bats worldwide is in serious decline. They often lose their homes when people cut down trees.
But Griswolds message seems to be spreading. After she spoke to a Brownie troop, the members built bat houses in their town. The project turned into a community effort. ""The kids are making such a huge difference,"" she said.
There are almost a thousand species of bats worldwide. Bats come in different colors, shapes, and sizes. Some have huge ears and unusual faces. In fact, a bats face can teach you about its habits. Read on about some of these creatures.
Vampire bats can be found in Mexico, Central America, and South America. They drink blood, but its usually from cattle and horses--not people. A heat sensor on its nose helps it find blood close to the surface of its victims skin.
Egyptian fruit bats live mainly in Asia and Africa. They eat fruit and nectar. Their long noses help them locate ripe fruit. Fruit bats use their sharp teeth to chew fruit.

On Inauguration Day, Bush is scheduled to stand outside the U.S. Capitol before thousands of citizens, the men and women of Congress, and members of the U.S. Supreme Court.
Bush will put his hand on an open Bible held by the chief justice of the United States. Bush will then recite the same Oath of Office that was spoken by the first U.S. president, George Washington, in 1789. The

After Bush recites the Oath of Office, he will give a speech that may set the tone of his presidency. Many people will be listening carefully to his speech, because the 2000 presidential election was the source of bitter debate.
The first inauguration ceremony was performed in New York City, which was then the nation's capital. On April 30, 1789, George Washington took office. Since then, the ceremony has changed.
Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, walked to the White House after his ceremony in 1801. Bush will arrive at the White House in a long parade of limousines and Secret Service vehicles.
James Monroe, the fifth U.S. president, gave the first outdoor inaugural speech in 1817.

A year may be only 365 days, but a lot can happen in such a short time. Below are just a few of the many important events that took place this past year.
It was a tough summer for many people in the western United States. Wildfires burned about 7 million acres of land--six times the size of the Grand Canyon National Park. The fires forced thousands of people to leave their homes. Many people returned home and found charred rubble.

In 1801, Thomas Jefferson was the first president to be inaugurated in Washington, D.C. In 1809, the first organized inaugural ball was held in Washington, D.C., for James Madison. In 1817, James Monroe's inauguration was the first to be held entirely outdoors. Over the years, inauguration traditions have evolved from simple events to elaborate ceremonies.
Since George Washington's time, presidents have used inaugural addresses to unite the country and inspire people. Abraham Lincoln gave his second inaugural speech in 1865, not long before the Civil War ended. He used his speech to draw the country together.
Other presidents' inaugural words are still quoted today. When Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural speech in 1933, the United States was at the height of the Great Depression. That was a time when many people were out of work. He brought promise with his words ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.""
When John F. Kennedy took office in 1961, he encouraged people to help their country. His speech challenged Americans: ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.""
What message will President Bush convey? He will likely continue the message expressed in his victory speech. ""A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation,"" he said. ""We have one country, one Constitution, and one future that binds us. And when we come together and work together, there is no limit to the greatness of America.""
George Washington's second inaugural speech, in 1793, was the shortest on record. At only 135 words, it lasted just eight minutes.
In 1841, William Henry Harrison gave the longest inaugural address. At 8,445 words, it lasted almost two hours!
In 1925, Calvin Coolidge's inaugural speech was the first broadcast on the radio.
Harry S. Truman's speech in 1949 was the first to be shown on television.
After Jimmy Carter was sworn in as president in 1977, he became the first president to walk the parade route instead of riding in a car.
In 1997, Bill Clinton's inauguration was the first to be transmitted over the Internet.

On Ellis Island, more than 95 percent of travelers were processed quickly and allowed into the United States. On Angel Island, many Chinese immigrants were held for weeks, months, and sometimes even years. After being cruelly questioned by officials, more than 30 percent of immigrants were sent back to China.
Angel Islands doors closed in 1940 when China and the United States became

More than 200 poems are on the walls of Angel Island. The following two poems were recently translated:
Its been a long time since I left my home village
Who could know Id end up imprisoned

With hands on their partners' shoulders, fourth and fifth graders from P.S. 211 in New York City twirled and whirled on the dance floor. After seven months of training, they competed in the ninth annual New York City public school ballroom dancing competition in June.
This school year, another group of students has started training. They hope to take home the grand-prize trophy.
The competition, called Grand Colors Finals, marks the end-of-the-year celebration of American Ballroom Theater's Dancing Classrooms. The students qualify for the competition in semifinals, similar to spelling bees.
The dancing program started in 1994 with one fifth-grade class of 30 students. It has grown to more than 7,000 students in 68 New York City schools. The 2003-2004 season of Dancing Classrooms captured the attention of filmmakers. It was featured in the recent

Ballroom dancing is a style of partner dance. Ballroom dancing has been around since the Middle Ages (from about 500 to 1500). It now includes the waltz and the tango as well as more modern dances, such as disco, the Macarena, and the electric slide. Students in the Dancing Classrooms program master five dances from around the world for the final competition.

Leaping from his rowboat, Australian crocodile hunter Steve Irwin lands on top of a fierce 12-foot-long crocodile. Covered with mud, Irwin wrestles with the reptile and finally ties up its snout and legs. The out-of-breath hunter then stands in front of the croc and declares, ""She's a beauty!""
Irwin is the star of the hit TV show

Irwin, age 38, has been interested in animals and the environment since he was a child. He grew up in a wildlife park in Queensland, a state in Australia. For his sixth birthday, Irwin's parents gave him a 12-foot snake called a scrub python. At age 9, Irwin captured his first crocodile. Ten years ago, Irwin took over the park that his parents had started. Five years ago, his show aired on American TV for the first time.

For example, Irwin was recently on the Australian island of Tasmania. Irwin was working with the World Wildlife Fund to rescue stranded whales. He wants to call attention to whale hunting in the South Pacific Ocean. ""This practice [whaling] has to stop,"" Irwin said.
Not everyone agrees that Irwin's show is good for animals or the environment.
Kent Vliet does not like ""the haphazard way in which [Irwin] handles snakes and gets bitten."" Vliet is a reptile expert who has worked for the National Geographic Society. Vliet fears that viewers might copy the croc hunter's dangerous moves and get hurt.
Instead of wrestling animals, Vliet said, Irwin should talk more about protecting endangered animals and the environment.
For now, the croc hunter said he will keep on wrestling crocs and snakes and bringing people up close with some of Earth's endangered animals. ""I will continue to put my life on the line to save wildlife,"" he said. ""This is my passion, and it won't stop.""

Venice attracts millions of tourists each year for its beautiful art and architecture. People weave their way through the city on boats because there are no streets. A maze of long

Venice is sinking at a rate of 1.57 inches per year, according to scientists. The Italian government has proposed the building of floodgates to control the flow of the sea.
Scientists hope to turn the tide in favor of Venice. They want to pump huge amounts of water into the ground through sturdy pipes. Scientists expect the water will expand the sand underneath and prop up the city. They hope to test the project on a small area over the next few months.
In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads.
Scientists behind the plan say that the pipes will work along with the floodgates to help save the city. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnt carried out in a careful way.
Everyone, however, agrees that saving the sinking city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose tremendous part of [history],"" Melissa Conn of Save Venice, an organization dedicated to helping preserve the city, told reporters.
Venice in Italian means ""city of canals.""
About 1.6 million people live in Venice.

Museum officials were stunned. The men had left a very important vase. Although the vase was in pieces, the good news was that it could be fixed.
""This is one of the most important pieces from the Baghdad museum, and I am delighted it has been returned,"" said a museum official. ""It is reason for people all around the world to celebrate.""
Why, exactly, would the return of a vase be cause for celebration? It was the famous Vase of Warka. The 5,000-year-old
, or man-made object, is one of the world's first sculptures. The images on the vase are important because they link the past to modern times.
Along with many valuable objects, the vase was stolen from the museum after the fall of Saddam Hussein's government in April.
At that time, mobs of thieves and rioters, or
, tore through the museum. They smashed ancient objects. Thieves ran off with prized treasures. Among the lost objects were carvings, jewelry, paintings, and statues.
One museum official referred to the looting as the ""crime of the century."" He said that it wasn't just a loss for Iraq, but that it was ""a loss for all mankind.""
. That means they could never be replaced. Some of the lost objects dated back 10,000 years, to the beginning of civilization.
Many people blamed U.S. troops for failing to protect the museum as Saddam's government fell. They pointed out that U.S. forces had managed to guard the oil reserves. U.S. government officials defended themselves, saying that American troops were focused on taking control of Baghdad.
Officials estimate that about 3,000 pieces from the museum's entire collection of 170,000 items are still missing. The losses were not as large as experts originally thought. Some valuable pieces were hidden in underground vaults. Other pieces were taken by people for safekeeping and then were returned.
Some of the stolen objects are slowly making their way back to the museum. Museum workers are trying to ensure the safe return of other objects. They began a ""don't ask; don't tell"" policy.
The policy allows thieves-like the ones who brought back the vase-to return stolen goods without punishment. Countries around the world are involved in recovery efforts. They are helping to compile a list of the stolen items. However, as one expert pointed out, ""It's going to be a long time before we know for sure what's missing.""
Modern-day Iraq is the site of ancient Mesopotamia. In Greek,
means ""the land between rivers."" There, about 5,000 years ago, the first cities sprang up between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
The area between the two rivers is often referred to as a cradle of civilization. That's because mathematics, science, and one of the first written languages developed there.
Here are some of the Iraqi National Museum's valuable artifacts and their status at the time
This 5,000-year-old stone statue of a woman praying was still missing.
This life-size marble head of a woman is one of the earliest pieces of sculpture. About 5,000 years old, it was stolen during the looting.
How did looters steal from world history when they ransacked the museum?
Originally thought to be missing, this tablet is a record of the world's earliest writing. It was found on the museum's second floor, away from the riots.

Governments have promised more than $3 billion in aid. ""The world is coming together in a manner we have never ever seen before,"" said United Nations official Jan Egeland.
It's not just governments helping out. People are making a difference in ways large and small, with companies donating millions of dollars and kids organizing bake sales to raise money.
Officials say an early warning system could have saved thousands of lives. A warning system was established in 1965 for countries that border the Pacific Ocean. The United States is part of that system.
What other problems may arise after the tsunami?
Because tsunamis are rare in the Indian Ocean, countries in that area did not have a warning system. World leaders are working to create a system that will warn and help protect people in all countries.

The scientists went to Sicily to learn from the 3,000-year old volcano. One of the things they wanted to learn is how to predict when a volcano will erupt.
Dozens of vulcanologists bravely climbed Mount Etna each day. They hoped that the mountain of fire would be a good teacher. ""We will probably learn more about this volcano during this eruption than had been learned in 3,000 years"", said Borris Behnke, a German scientist.
Climbing Mount Etna is more dangerous than climbing some other volcanoes. The scientists risked being burned by the rivers of lava flowing down the volcano. Hot lava flowed from both the top of the volcano and from many
, or holes, along the volcano's sides.
Etna was also hurling huge rocks into the air. ""Some of them are bigger than cars and some might be as big as trucks,"" said Behnke.
Some of the scientists didn't need to climb Mount Etna. Over the past few years, scientists had placed hundreds of sensors on the volcano. The sensors gather data about the lava flow and send the data by radio to scientists located a safe distance from the volcano.
The sensors also record earthquakes. Earthquakes in a volcanic area can mean that the volcano is about to erupt. In the days before Mount Etna erupted, the sensors had picked up more than 2,600 small earthquakes.
Behnke says that lava may erupt from Mount Etna for at least six more months. During that time, he plans to climb the volcano many times, risking his life to learn firsthand what is happening.

The U.S. Congress passed the act last year. As a result, as of February 27,2001, the United States will grant citizenship to adopted kids who are under 18 years old and have one parent who is a citizen.
Every year, U.S. families adopt about 20,000 kids from foreign lands. Kids who were adopted from other countries were not considered U.S. citizens right away. Sometimes, they had to wait years before they could become citizens.
The Child Citizenship Act was written by Rep. William Delahunt. Years ago, he adopted a child, Kara, from Vietnam and knows firsthand how hard it can be for an adopted child to become a citizen. He hopes that the act will encourage more U.S. families to adopt kids from other lands.

(BEE-dees), come in colorful boxes and in different flavors, such as chocolate, grape, and strawberry. Michael Eriksen, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said bidis ""are candy-flavored and cost less [than other cigarettes], so they appeal to some kids.""
Bidis are not candy. They actually contain even more deadly poisons than other kinds of cigarettes. The American Lung Association says bidis contain five times more
than other cigarettes. Tar is a chemical that causes disease. Nicotine is a drug that makes people crave cigarettes.
Health experts also say people who smoke bidis have to puff longer and harder than they do with other cigarettes. That means smokers breathe in more poisons.
In every state, it is illegal for kids to buy cigarettes, including bidis. The U.S. government has also banned the importing of bidis because child laborers often make them.
The laws, however, are being broken. Recently, a group of kids in Oregon went undercover to help the police. The kids, ages 8 to 15, were able to buy bidis in some stores.
Health experts say the best way to stop kids from using cigarettes is to give kids the facts about how deadly cigarettes are. Another way to keep kids from smoking ""is to get adults to quit, because they are the biggest role model for kids,"" said health expert Greg Conley.
Smoking kills parts of the lungs that allow a person to breathe. It causes illnesses, such as bronchitis and emphysema.
Smoking blocks vessels carrying blood to and from the heart. It can also lead to heart attacks.

The 2001 campaign is paying special attention to scooter-related injuries. Because more kids are riding scooters, doctors expect a rise in scooter accidents.
In 2000, more than 30,000 people went to emergency rooms for scooter-related injuries, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said. Most of those injured were kids age 14 or younger.
Because many scooter accidents result in head injuries, some cities and states have passed helmet laws. The New York City passed a law requiring scooter riders under age 14 to wear helmets. Fourth graders from Connecticut, asked their state government to pass a similar law.
Scooter accidents may be on the rise, but bicycles account for more injuries than scooters or any other product except cars, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign.
In 1999, 340,000 kids age 5 to 14 were treated in hospital emergency rooms for bicycle-related injuries, SAFE KIDS reported. The most common bicycle-related injuries are injuries to the head.
The best way for kids to protect their heads while riding bikes is by wearing helmets. But the National SAFE KIDS Campaign says only 15 percent to 25 percent of kids who ride bikes wear helmets while riding.

At the center of the debate is Arnold Schwarzenegger. The former actor was elected governor of California in 2003. Schwarzenegger was born in Austria, a country in Europe. He became a U.S. citizen in 1983. The Constitution blocks him and the nearly 13 million foreign-born citizens in the United States from the Oval Office.
People who support a change to the amendment say the Constitution denies foreign-born American citizens equal rights. They argue that 60,000 immigrants currently serve in the U.S. military.
Supporters also say that the Constitution has been amended in the past. Amendments to outlaw slavery, give women the right to vote, and limit a president to two terms in office were added.
Others say that the requirement is unfair, especially because the United States is supposed to be the land of opportunity. ""You cannot choose the land of your birth,"" said an advocate in a television ad. ""You can choose the land you love.""
Others argue that people born in foreign countries should not be allowed to run for president because it can cause conflict. They think that those people may have

Should the Constitution be amended so that a foreign-born person can become president?
Many historians say that the nation's founders included the requirement for a reason. The founders feared that foreign countries could influence a leader's loyalty.
""I don't think it's unfair to say the president of the United States should be a native-born citizen,"" said Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. ""Your [loyalty to your country] is driven by your birth.""

Last month, workers in Oklahoma loaded about a dozen pieces of historic Route 66 onto trucks. Each of the 3,000-pound pieces then made a 1,400-mile trip to Washington, D.C., where they will become part of an exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
Route 66 has been called the ""Main Street of America."" It once stretched 2,400 miles, from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California. The road connected eight states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
In the 1920s, engineer Cyrus Stevens Avery of Tulsa, Oklahoma, envisioned a road connecting the Midwest and the Pacific Ocean. During the 1930s, Route 66 was completed and was soon lined with hundreds of businesses.
The road became so popular that it inspired a 1960s TV show,

have in common? Both movies were made for kids and are rated G, which means they are OK for everyone to watch. But two scientists say those movies and many others should be rated ""V"" for their violent content.
The two scientists--Kimberly Thompson and Fumie Yokota--work for Harvard University. They watched 74 G-rated movies and said, ""We were surprised that every single movie had some act of violence."" The violence in the movies ranged from insults to attacks.
One in five TV shows for kids has no educational content, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center.
The two scientists also found that, in 46 of the movies, at least one character was hurt. And they found that, in 37 of the movies, at least one character was killed.
Most of the movies contained nearly ten minutes of violence, the scientists said. The most violent movie the scientists watched was
. That movie has 24 minutes of violence, Thompson and Yokota said.
Violent programs can also be found on TV. The Media in the Home Survey, conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, recently found that more than one-quarter of all children's TV shows had four or more violent scenes in each episode.
Some scientists say that watching too many violent TV shows and movies could make some kids violent. Watching violent shows could make some kids ""think it's no big deal for somebody to be smacked in the head with a hammer,"" said Yokota.
Scientists also worry that kids might imitate the violent acts they see on TV and in movies. Joanne Cantor, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin, said TV and movies usually don't show the effects of violence. Instead, shows often make violence look funny. Kids who think violence is funny might hurt other people without thinking about the pain they're causing.
You can protect yourself from violent TV shows and movies. First, you can limit the amount of TV you watch. The American Pediatrics Association says kids should watch no more than two hours of TV a day. Next, watch TV and movies with your parents. Talk with your parents about what you are watching on TV, and discuss what would happen if the same things happened in real life.
You and your parents can use the Internet, magazines, and newspapers to learn more about TV shows and movies. For instance, you can read TV and movie reviews on the ""Kids-in-Mind"" and ""Screen It"" Web sites.

Marsupials have three types of cones in their eyes. Most mammals, including dogs and horses, have only two types of cone cells. That leaves them unable to see blues or reds.
Australia is home to most marsupials. This continent is often called the ""land down under."" That is because it lies in the Southern Hemispherethe half of Earth below the equator. Much of central Australia is desert. The Australian desert is called the outback, because it is so remote. More than 90 percent of the Australian population lives along the coast.

The biggest cities in the Asian nation of India are not much different from New York City or San Francisco. Towering buildings scrape the sky. Cars, trucks, and buses clog the busy roads. McDonalds restaurants and Barista coffee bars dot the avenues. Over the past 15 years, India has become one of the fastestgrowing countries in the world, second only to China.
In March, President George W. Bush made a three-day trip to the worlds largest
(A democracy is a form of government in which people vote to elect their leaders.) There, Bush and Indias Prime Minister Manmohan Singh talked about science and technology, trade and investment, and a clean environment. They also agreed on an energy proposal that both countries hope will help India meet its rapidly growing demand for electricity.
Experts predict that India will continue to grow, and by 2040 the country will boast the worlds third-largest economy, after the United States and China. The United States wants to develop a better business relationship with India.
Bush believes that trade is important to help India overcome its poverty. Even though the economy there is improving, a large portion of the population is still poor. More than 300 million people in India live on less than $1 a day. That number of people is larger than the population of the United States.
As India develops, it will require more electricity to power homes and businesses. Today, many cities in India suffer frequent blackouts because the country doesnt generate enough electricity.
During Bushs visit, he and Singh made an important agreement. The United States will share nuclear technology and fuel with India. In return, India will allow international inspectors into 14 of its 22 nuclear plants (see
The plan will allow India to reduce its dependence on
such as oil and coal. Fossil fuels are formed in Earth from plant and animal remains over millions of years. In addition, the United States and India will work together to develop new technologies for producing clean and safe energy.
The new agreement, however, is not a done deal. The changes still have to be approved by the U.S. Congress. Many U.S. leaders think India should not be allowed to have nuclear technology. India has refused to sign a treaty that outlines rules for using nuclear technology.
However, Bush continues to emphasize the importance of trade with one of the worlds fastest-growing economies. In 2005, trade between India and the United States was $25 billion and is expected to reach $40 billion by 2009.
""The United States and India, separated by half the globe, are closer than ever before,"" Bush says. ""The partnership between our nations has the power to transform the world.""
How might Indias growing economic power affect other countries?
Currently, India gets 56 percent of its electricity from coal plants and just 3 percent from nuclear power. Coal, when burned, causes air pollution. Nuclear power plants, however, release almost no pollution.
Nuclear energy is created by the splitting of the nucleus of an atom. That process is called nuclear fission. Many countries today use nuclear energy. Some experts predict that by 2050, nuclear power will provide 25 percent of Indias electricity.

With the help of the Seneca Park Zoo in Rochester and other officials, Blake's fourth grade class and a class at another elementary school will plant seeds for a blue lupine garden near the local airport.
Blake said it's important to help endangered species because ""every part of life has its place in the ecosystem."" An ecosystem is made up of plants and animals that depend on one another for survival.
When he grows up, Blake plans to be either a zoo veterinarian or an entomologist, a scientist who studies insects. Either way, he's off to a good start!

More than two-thirds of the Himalayan glaciers are already melting. This could spell disaster for countries such as China, India, and Nepal, which depend on rivers fed by melting snow from the glaciers for water.
Despite the loss of a few feet, Everest is still the highest point above sea level. Its peak lies on the border between China and Nepal. The mountain was named after Sir George Everest, who mapped much of South Asia between 1830 and 1843.

""We found that kids who were [light] TV watchers were [thinner]. The kids who were the fattest were those who watch a lot of TV,"" said Dr. Carlos Crespo. Crespo and Dr. Ross Anderson wrote the study.
The doctors said kids today watch more TV than kids did 30 years ago. Today, one in three kids watches four or more hours of TV a day. Watching that much TV, they said, is unhealthful.
According to the doctors, kids are not entirely to blame for watching too much TV. Part of the problem comes from a lack of safe places for kids to play.
Crespo and Anderson aren't against watching TV, as long as kids limit the time they spend in front of the tube.
""There are a certain number of hours in the day you're supposed to sleep [and] do your homework,"" said Crespo. ""You're supposed to go to school, and then there is a certain amount of hours that you are free to do whatever you want. If you spend that time watching TV, then you spend less time doing physical activity.""

Peacekeepers from the United Nations (U.N.) helped to free Alhaji. In 2001, he addressed the U.N., asking that organization to help children around the world who are forced to fight in war zones.
""We ask this body on behalf of Sierra Leone to do all they can to bring our sad story to an end,"" he said. ""We want to be able to move about freely in all parts of the country.""
Sierra Leone is just one of an estimated 41 countries around the world that use child soldiers. While the most offenses occur in Africa and Asia, the problem also exists in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East.
Most children who become soldiers come from very poor countries. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers estimates that 300,000 children are fighting as soldiers. In some countries, boys and girls as young as 8 years old are being recruited, or called upon, to fight.
Protecting children in war and conflict zones has become a top job for the United Nations. And the U.N. has made significant progress. In a report issued in December 2002, the U.N. named 28 governments and armed groups that use children to fight their battles.
International law prohibits countries from using children who are younger than 15 years old in combat. However, several U.N. conventions condemn, or do not approve of, having anyone under 18 serve as a soldier. If a country recruits child soldiers, it is violating, or breaking the rule of, international agreements.
Why us it important for governments around the world to protect children?
The U.N. wants to save children like Alhaji Babah Sawane from suffering. The report sends a strong message to governments everywhere: They will be held accountable for their actions.

732,"Now you can take a trip to Mars without ever leaving Earth.
A kid reporter journeyed to Mars aboard Disney's new space ride. Find out how close her ride was to the real thing.
kid reporter Sonia Mia Diaz blasted into space on August 22. This 10-year-old from Florida was on a journey to Mars.
Sonia Mia rocketed to Mars aboard a new ride called Mission: SPACE. She experienced the ride during its opening week at Walt Disney World's Epcot Center in Orlando, Florida.
After her mission, Sonia Mia interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the ride's creators. Sonia Mia learned that Disney worked closely with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to develop the new space attraction. The ride lets people experience what a trip to Mars might be like in the future.
On her journey, Sonia Mia never actually left the ground. The ride gives people the feeling of blasting off and traveling through space. ""We really wanted people to feel as close as they could to what it's like to be an astronaut,"" said Bryan.
Sonia Mia read quotes about space exploration as she waited in line. Information about space history fills the attraction. There is even a moon car called a lunar rover on loan from a museum.
Before boarding the shuttle, Sonia Mia and three other riders were given different roles for the mission. Those roles included commander, pilot, navigator, and engineer.
Sonia Mia was assigned to be the engineer. In real life, Sally Ride, the first U.S. woman in space, performed the same role.
After Sonia Mia strapped herself in, the shuttle moved into launch position. The countdown began, and the shuttle blasted off! During the mission, Sonia Mia and her team used buttons and joysticks to perform the tasks associated with their roles. The ride lasted about 4 minutes.
The mission was as intense as Sonia Mia had hoped. What was her favorite part? The liftoff! ""I liked the intensity of the blastoff and the air pressure on my face,"" she said.
So how did the ride live up to a real space shuttle mission? Weekly Reader caught up with NASA astronaut Winston Scott to ask him that question.
Scott launched into space on two shuttle flights. He tested out Mission: SPACE and gave it a big thumbs up. ""It's a thrill a minute,"" he said.
Although no astronauts have been to Mars yet, Scott said the ride's liftoff was realistic. The feeling of moving up the launch pad and being forced back into your seat were similar to those felt on a shuttle.
However, he points out, there are differences. In an actual launch, astronauts feel about three times the force of
. Gravity is the force that pulls things toward Earth.
The blastoff on the ride was also shorter than an actual liftoff. And, he said, riders don't experience weightlessness. On a real space shuttle, astronauts become weightless because there is no gravity.
For many people, the ride brings to mind the courage of space explorers. As Sonia Mia pointed out, ""Going on the ride made me think about how brave astronauts are.""
Sonia Mia Diaz interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the forces behind Mission: SPACE. Here's what Sonia Mia learned.
Imagineers are people who work for Disney.
In general, Imagineering is about storytelling. We build attractions that put people who visit our parks into different worlds and stories. We also use technology to tell stories.
What was your role in creating the ride?
I'm the senior show producer, which is like being a movie director. A movie director guides people and directs the show, including the lighting, music, artists, and motion you experience on the ride.
Where did your team get the inspiration for Mission: SPACE?
People have always had an interest in space. The time and technology were right to create this new space attraction. We worked closely with NASA to develop the science and technology behind the attraction. No one has ever put people into a ride system like this before.
Before the ride, I was warned not to move my head or close my eyes because of motion sickness. I didn't feel sick, but might a person if he or she does those things?
That could happen if you move your head, because of the technology used to create the ride. We give those recommendations because we want people to feel most comfortable. Some people can move their heads, and it doesn't bother them at all.
How many times have you been on Mission: SPACE?
At last count, I've ridden it more than 400 times!

Should humans be afraid of sharks, or should sharks be afraid of humans? Debate this issue.
The above incidents took place in Florida during October. After reading such stories, many people might think that they should not swim in Florida's waters. But shark experts say that would be an overreaction. As scary as they are, shark attacks are rare.
The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) says you are more likely to be hit by lightning than be bitten by one of the more than 350 shark species. In fact, each year about 500 people are hurt by lightning in the United States. In 1999, only 58 shark attacks occurred

Not all sharks are meat eaters. Basking sharks, for example, eat
, tiny plants and animals that float in water. As a result, basking sharks don't have teeth.
Shark Expert Rodney Fox explained, ""Sharks do not like humans; we are too bony. A lot of people who have been bitten by sharks have survived because the shark spat them out.""
One reason that shark attacks may seem more common than before is that more people are using shorelines for recreation, said George Burgess of ISAF.
Sharks that do bite humans have often mistaken people for other kinds of animals. For example, ISAF officials say sharks attack surfers wearing dark-colored wetsuits more often than they do anyone else. To a shark, the wetsuits make surfers look like seals, a favorite food.
Some shark experts say sharks should fear people, not the other way around.
One of the biggest threats to sharks, said Burgess, is
. Finning happens when a fisher catches a shark, cuts off its fins, and tosses the dead fish overboard. The fins are used to make delicacies such as shark fin soup.
Conservation groups are urging governments to protect sharks.

Terry Rex's fourth graders at Wings Park Elementary School in Oelwein, Iowa, are using a new kind of classroom technology. Instead of writing with pencils on exam papers, the students use remote controls to take tests.
""It's more fun,"" Courtney Ricchio, 9, told
""I don't have to write, and my hand doesn't get tired."" The remote controls are part of the Classroom Performance System (CPS). When students use CPS to take a test, the questions appear on an electronic screen. Students key in their answers on the remote-control response pad.

""Since it's on the computer, it's more fun than a worksheet on your desk.""
Some teachers think using CPS to grade a test is more

These lucky animals are getting some extra room to stretch out! Giant pandas at the National Zoo, in Washington, D.C., have a bigger home. The zoo opened its Asia Trail in October.
The zoos three pandas may be the stars of the show, but they arent alone. Six other threatened or endangered Asian species have new
or homes, on the trail. The animals with new homes are red pandas, fishing cats, sloth bears, Asian small-clawed otters, clouded leopards, and Japanese giant salamanders.
The $53 million makeover doubles the space for those animals. ""This is a giant leap forward for the National Zoo,"" says its director, John Berry.
The Asia Trail is part of a 10-year project to improve the zoo. Before the exhibit was

The pandas are among the zoos most popular attractions. They draw huge crowds, which are expected to reach a record 3 million people this year. The pandas new habitat includes waterfalls and shallow pools, along with more rocks and leafy trees to climb. Fog machines even help model the pandas wet natural environment in China.

Scientists working in Argentina are finding larger and larger dinosaurs. About a dozen years ago, they discovered
, a plant eater that was longer than three school buses placed end to end. Now, a scientist says he has uncovered an even larger plant eater.
Jorge Calvo is leading the team of
, scientists who study fossils, who found the giant plant eater. Calvo says the newly discovered dinosaur lived 87 million years ago, stood 52 feet tall, was 130 feet long, and weighed 100 tons. ""It would be safe to say, this is the biggest [dinosaur],"" said Calvo.
The giant plant eater is not the only dinosaur fossil that scientists have recently found in Argentina. Scientists have discovered an area that stretches for hundreds of miles and is loaded with dinosaur fossils. So far, they have found four previously unknown dinosaur species in the area.
The Age of the Dinosaurs began about 225 million years ago and ended 65 million years ago. Scientists divide that huge period of time into three shorter periods, called the Triassic Period, the Jurassic Period, and the Cretaceous Period. The first dinosaurs probably developed about halfway through the Triassic Period. Different dinosaurs lived in each of those three periods.
The dinosaurs discovered in Argentina date from the Jurassic Period. Paleontologists don't yet know much about the dinosaurs that lived during the Jurassic Period. ""Jurassic Period fossils are very, very rare,"" said scientist Gerardo Cladera.
During the Jurassic Period, Earth's temperature was warmer than it is today. The warmer temperature caused glaciers to melt and the sea level to rise. The oceans flooded much of the land, leaving little land area where dinosaur fossils could be preserved.
Calvo's newly discovered dinosaur stood taller than a three-story-high tree. Despite its size, the towering plant eater was preyed on by
, the largest known meat eater. It stood 12 feet tall, had large, serrated teeth, and hunted in packs.
The giant plant eater would have been no match for a pack of hungry giganotosaurs. ""By working as a team, these predators would be able to eat even a giant plant eater,"" explained paleontologist Thomas Holtz.

624,"This map shows where Mount Vesuvius is located.
(veh-SOO-vee-uhss) majestically stands over the Italian landscape. The scenic mountain rises 4,200 feet high southeast of the city of Naples, which is located in southern Italy. But many people living in this region fear Mount Vesuvius. That's because it is an active volcano.
Nearly 2,000 years ago, Vesuvius exploded with tremendous force. Deadly smoke, gases, and rock shot more than 9 miles high in the air. That is about one and a half times the height of Mount Everest, the world's tallest mountain.
A thick black cloud engulfed the region and blocked out the sun. An avalanche of boiling
poured from the volcano at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. Lava is melted rock from a volcano.
The explosion sealed the ancient city of Pompeii (pahm-PAY) under a blanket of rock and ash. A mudslide wiped out the nearby town of Herculaneum (her-kyuh-LAY-nee-uhm). Many people died as a result of the volcano's fury.
Although many eruptions have occurred since then, Vesuvius hasn't exploded with such force since that devastating day. The last major eruption occurred in 1944.
Scientists warn, though, that it's only a matter of time before Mount Vesuvius erupts with tremendous force again. ""It won't be tomorrow, it won't be next month, and maybe it won't be next year,"" a scientist who monitors the volcano told
. ""But [Vesuvius] is overdue [to explode].""
Today, nearly 600,000 people live in the 18 towns surrounding Vesuvius. This high-risk area is known as the ""red zone.""
Officials estimate that they would need two weeks to evacuate all the people living in the red zone. According to scientists, anything within 4 miles of Vesuvius could be destroyed during the first 15 minutes of an eruption.
The volcano's past, however, hasn't stopped people from moving into the area. In fact, Italian officials are concerned about the overcrowding of people in the red zone. To encourage people to move away from this area, they have put a plan in place.
Some families are being offered $36,000 to move to safer locations. The goal is to persuade about 150,000 families to move from the area near the volcano within the next 15 years.
In 1995, the government also created a national park near the top of Vesuvius. That limits the number of people living there.
""Vesuvius is the most dangerous volcano in the world on account of the number of people living under it,"" said the president of the Naples region. ""The smaller the population, the smaller the danger Vesuvius represents.""

So how does interest work? Say you deposit $100 in a savings account. If the banks interest rate is 2 percent per year, the bank will pay you an additional $2 after one year. (2 percent can also be expressed as a decimal: .02)
To calculate 2 percent of $100, multiply $100 by .02. Therefore, 2% of $100 = $2.

One flight crew took Hurricane Isabel by storm. Called
, they actually flew a plane into the center of Isabel in mid-September.
Isabel packed winds of up to 100 miles per hour by the time it hit land. The storm walloped the coasts of North Carolina and Virginia and then moved inland.
The hurricane caused massive flooding and damage. More than 4.5 million people lost electricity. At least 40 deaths were blamed on the storm.
Despite the devastation, Isabel could have been worse. Thanks to the work of Hurricane Hunters, weather forecasters accurately predicted the storms path. Many people received warning and fled, or
Hurricane Hunters are a special part of the Air Force. They found out how dangerous Isabel was before it battered the coast. The experienced fliers and scientists gathered information about the size, strength, and path of Isabel.

The plane contains equipment that records weather. In the eye of the storm, Hurricane Hunters released small tubes attached to parachutes. Each tube was about the size of a can of tennis balls. The tubes sent information about wind speed, power, and moisture back to the crew.
As part of their job, Hurricane Hunters help forecasters rate storms. Hurricanes are rated on a scale of 1 to 5.
A storms rating is based on wind speed and potential for damage. Before hitting land, Isabel was a Category-5 storm. That is the most powerful type.
Satellites in space and other weather instruments are used to measure hurricanes. However, forecasters say that Hurricane Hunters provide the most accurate prediction of the path and strength of a hurricane.

Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks.
The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8? hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said.
Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said.
In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should.
Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school.
Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep.
Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' ""

Whoosh! Within seconds, a spark sets off large flames. The flames of a wildfire tear through a forest, destroying thousands of acres of trees and brush and threatening the homes of people and animals.
From California to Colorado and from Alaska to Arizona, firefighters have been battling thousands of wildfires this year. Wildfire season began in June and will last through November. So far, the flames have destroyed more than 3 million acres in the United Statesan area about the size of New Jersey!
The states in red show where the most wildfires have occurred this year.
Most wildfires are started naturally, either by lightning or from the sun's heat. Others are accidentally started by careless humans who leave campfires burning.
Hot, dry weather has caused most of this season's wildfires to spread. ""This year is unique,"" Rose Davis, an official at the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center, told
. Davis explained that the Northwest is suffering a
. A drought is a long period of dry weather with little rain. In the Southwest, heavy rains in the spring caused a lot of new grass to grow. The new grass burns quickly when it dries out.
Firefighters have been fighting the scorching flames from the ground and the air. Specially trained firefighters called
parachute from planes or helicopters to reach
fires. Because smoke jumpers leap into out-of-the-way areas, they carry enough food and water with them to survive for several days.
Although wildfires can be very dangerous, they are not all bad. In areas where few people live, officials monitor the wildfires. Sometimes, officials allow them to burn because the fires help the environment and keep forests healthy. ""If fires are going to spread to people's homes and property, we have to put them out,"" smoke jumper Lori Messenger told
Wildfires are like nature's housekeeperand forests come back to life after fires. ""Fire is a natural part of our forests,"" says Messenger. ""The fires kill the less healthy, diseased trees. They clean out the brush to make space for animals to graze on the new grass that grows.""
Some plants also need heat from a fire to help them release their seeds, which grow into new plants after a fire. Fire is nature's way of recycling dead plants into the soil. The dead plants help return nutrients to the soil.
Although some animals die, many creatures have ways of protecting themselves. Large animals, such as deer, moose, and buffalo, head to safety. Small animals, such as snakes, toads, and mice, burrow in the ground.
""It's important to realize that fires are an important part of what happens in a forest,"" says Messenger. ""It's a complicated balance, and people who manage the forest have to make good decisions about what fires will be fought and what fires will be left to burn.""
What qualities do you think a person needs to be a smoke jumper?

Each year, however, 15 million kids worldwide die from diseases, including hepatitis, cholera, and diarrhea, Arntzen said. Most of the children who get those diseases live in the poorest countries in the world, mainly in Asia, Africa, and South America.
Arntzen says it's impossible to send a doctor to vaccinate kids in every village in the world. Even if doctors could go to every village, many poor people couldn't afford to pay for the vaccinations.
That's why scientists are working on ways to change fruit and vegetable seeds. They want to make vaccines part of the plants, explained Arntzen. If the scientists are successful, people in poor countries could use the seeds to grow food that would protect them from some diseases. That way, an apple a day would not only keep the doctor away, but would keep deadly diseases away as well.

Michael, age 7, quickly went into the living room where his mother was sleeping. He woke her up, and the two quickly left the house. They ran to a neighbor's house and called 911. The fire was quickly contained by firefighters.
Michael had recently participated in his school's ""Great Escape"" project for Fire Prevention Week. Michael and his family knew how to exit their home safely during a fire. Firefighter Terrence Campbell of the Glenwood Fire Department said that Michael showed good fire safety behavior. He acted quickly to help his mom leave the house and report the fire, as well as by using a home escape plan to escape danger. ""I feel that his actions from the 1999 ""Great Escape"" project helped Michael know what to do,"" Campbell said.
An escape plan also helped save the lives of the Walker family in Ontario, Canada. Shortly after 3 a.m. on February 18, 1999, a fire began in the ground floor apartment below the Walker apartment. The family awoke to find their apartment filling with smoke.
Everyone reacted immediately. The family put their home fire escape plan into action, and everyone left the building right away and went to their meeting place outside. By the time they got there, flames were racing through the apartment.
Earlier in the school year, 9-year-old twins Ashley and Ryan Walker participated in their school's ""Great Escape"" fire safety program. Mr. Walker says the twins helped the family know what to do when the fire began. ""They pushed the fire procedures,"" he said. ""They learned them at school and had us practice how to get out.""

This drawing shows what the moon base might look like.
Only 12 people have set foot on the moonso far. The last time was in late 1972, when two astronauts walked on its surface. Their final visitthe longest of anylasted just three days. Now astronauts are preparing for another mission to our space neighbor. This time, though, they plan to stay there.
NASA recently announced plans to build a permanent base on the moon. Astronauts could be living and working there by 2020, according to the U.S space agency. The goal is to prepare astronauts for a trip to Mars in the future.
Under the plan, four-person crews will begin with weeklong missions to the moon. By 2024, when more equipment has been set up, astronauts will be able to
or live, on the moon for as long as six months. Astronauts will travel in roving vehicles to explore the area near the
Unlike Earth, the moon has no air, wind, or weather. Its dusty
or surface, is covered with deep craters. So how can humans survive on the moon?
NASA hopes to establish a lunar outpost near one of the moon's poles. ""These locations experience sunlight for longer periods of time than other locations on the moon, which will make it possible to use solar power,"" NASA official Michael Braukus told
Solar power is energy from the sun that can be used to generate electricity.
It is also likely that the polar regions are rich in natural resources, such as oxygen and hydrogen. While on the moon, astronauts plan to use natural resources for water and fuel.
The moon is the only place beyond Earth that humans have visited. About 238,900 miles away, the moon is Earth's closest space neighbor.
On July 20, 1969, Americans Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the moon. Those space pioneers traveled to the lunar surface on the

or stop using, its aging space shuttle fleet by 2010. For their trek to the moon, astronauts will travel aboard the new
crew exploration vehicle, which is being developed. The vehicle, a modernized version of the
craft, will attach to a lunar lander.
The moon mission is part of President George W. Bush's longterm space plan. The proposed base is the first step in the bold plan to prepare astronauts for their ultimate destinationMars.
Because Mars is so far from Earth, traveling there will require humans to stay for long periods of time. Astronauts will not be able to bring enough supplies for the entire mission. They will have to use the elements on Mars to survive.
""By demonstrating we can survive on another world for a long time, we build confidence that we can venture much farther from Earth and stay for longer periods of time,"" says Braukus of NASA.
While some supporters are jumping over the moon about launching a new era of space exploration, not everyone is pleased with the plan. Critics warn that it will be difficult to fund the moon program. So far, NASA has not put a price tag on the mission but welcomes participation by other countries to help carry out its plan.
In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched
the first artificial satellite in space. The U.S. space program was established as a response. The ""space race"" between the two countries had begun. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy challenged Americans to send a person to the moon by the end of the 1960s. The time line shows some U.S. space milestones and NASA's plans for the lunar base.

""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

252,"The Southeast: Exploring the 'Land of the Flowers'
Long before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, Spaniards had explored and settled large parts of what is now the United States.
One of the regions the Spanish explored first was the Southeast. Hernando de Soto and 600 followers were the first European explorers to journey through the Southeast. For nearly four years, de Soto and his followers wandered through the region.
After sailing from Cuba in 1539, de Soto landed in Florida. An earlier Spanish explorer, Juan Ponce de Len, had named the land
, after a Spanish word meaning ""flowery"".
La Florida was much larger then present-day Florida. It covered most of the area in what are now the southeastern states. One of de Soto's men described the animals the explorers found. ""There are many lions and bears in Florida, wolves, deer, jackals, cats and rabbits (also live there),"" he wrote.
Many different groups of Native Americans lived in La Florida. They grew corn, beans and squash. They also fished and hunted.
Because the native groups did not trust de Soto, they often left their villages before the Spaniards arrived. The Native Americans had good reason to fear de Soto. He captured and enslaved some of them.
De Soto and his men were mainly looking for gold. The search for gold led them out of present-day Florida north to what is now Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
After reaching North Carolina without finding gold, the explorers turned west and crossed the Appalachian Mountains. Upon hearing rumors of gold, de Soto led his men into Tennessee and south to Alabama.
In southern Alabama, the Choctaw Indians attacked the explorers. They killed many of de Soto's men, and some of his supplies were taken.
De Soto's expedition then turned northwest through Alabama and into present-day Mississippi. In May 1541, de Soto reached the Mississippi River, near what is now Memphis, Tennessee. Then they crossed into Arkansas, where in May 1542, De Soto died.
The explorers then retreated to the Mississippi River, where they built boats, which sailed down the river to the Gulf of Mexico. Only about half of the people who had landed with de Soto in Florida survived the trek across the Southeast.

As soon as historians learned what the writing on the box meant, they wanted to know more. For example, they wanted to know if the Jesus mentioned in the carving was Jesus of Nazareth.
The writing on the box poses a problem. James, Joseph, and Jesus were very common names at the time the box was made. Historians had to use math to
how many people named James had a father named Joseph and a brother named Jesus. They learned that only 20 people could have been the James mentioned in the carving.
Of the hundreds of bone boxes that have been found, only two others mention a brother's name. Historians say the Jesus mentioned on the box must have been a very important person.
Did the bone box belong to a brother of Jesus? Some historians say Jesus had brothers or half-brothers. Others say Jesus only had cousins.
Regardless of whose bones were placed in the box, the discovery is important to historians. ""This is something that provides a bridge over time,"" said one historian. ""My reaction is not so much excitement as it is awe.""

According to officials at the Worldwatch Institute, half of the world's languages are spoken by fewer than 2,500 people. Those languages may die out by the end of this century. About 100 people in Russia speak Udihe. Six people in South America speak Arikap, and only one person, Marie Smith of Alaska, speaks Eyak.
As people move from their homelands, they learn new languages and often forget their native languages. As increasing numbers of people move, their languages die out. Manx, a language from the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, died out in 1974. Ubykh, an ancient language from Europe, disappeared when the last man who spoke it died in 1992.

mothers line up at feeding centers with their hungry children in hopes of receiving food and medical care. The people in this western African country are suffering from a hunger crisis after a severe food shortage.
Niger is the second-poorest country in the world. The United Nations estimates that 2.5 million of Niger's 12 million people live on less than one meal per day.

One of the most historic regions in the United States is in trouble. The 175-mile-long area of land stretches through Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
The area is home to more American history than any other slice of land in the country, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

The region at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains includes many battlefields from the Civil War (18611865).
As people construct new houses, roads, and buildings, they are destroying acres of history. Officials say the region has lost more than 150,000 acres of farmland in the past 20 years. That is an area slightly smaller than New York City.

582,"Tourists Put Pressure on World's Monuments and Parks
Some of the World's most important monuments and parks are being loved to death. Many sites around the world are in bad shape because of a recent sharp increase in the number of tourists worldwide. The causes of damage range from everyday wear and tear to pollution to
, or the destruction of property on purpose.
Each year, hundreds of millions of tourists visit special places around the world. In fact, according to the World Tourism Organization, by the end of this year about 668 million people will have made tourist trips. By 2020, the organization said, that number may more than double, to 1.5 billion tourists!
The problem is that a large number of visitors can damage a monument or park. The thousands of cars and buses that carry tourists to a site create air pollution. Air pollution can discolor and damage monuments made of stone and other materials. Huge numbers of tourists also cause garbage to pile up. And sometimes tourists take pieces of monuments away with them as souvenirs.
These are some of the special places that are suffering from too much attention:
. These are two of the biggest national parks in the United States. Millions of tourists each year crowd into these areas. As a result, air pollution, garbage, and other damage have marred these awesome sites.
. Located in Peru, a country in South America, Machu Picchu is the site of an ancient city in the Andes Mountains. A people called the Incas built the city almost 600 years ago for Incan royalty. Garbage tossed aside by tourists, as well as air and water pollution, are now problems at Machu Picchu.
. The Parthenon is a temple that was built almost 2,500 years ago in Athens, a city in the European country of Greece. Air pollution has pitted and discolored the marble that the beautiful building is made of.
. Located near the town of Dunhuang, in north-central China, these caves are covered with delicate paintings and carvings. However, the breath of the 300,000 visitors who pass through the 492 caves each year is damaging the artwork, which is between 700 and 1,700 years old.
To help preserve such important places, new rules are being written by organizations such as UNESCO, which is a part of the United Nations. UNESCO is working with governments worldwide to limit the number of tourists who visit some special sites.
UNESCO is also working to educate sightseers about how to avoid damaging the places they visit. As one student who works with UNESCO said, ""You have to protect the past to reach tomorrow.""
If you are visiting a monument or national park, here are a few rules the U.S. Park Service says you should always follow:
If you are camping, take your trash and leftover food out with you when you leave.
When visiting a monument, don't touch sculptures, paintings, or other artwork.
Leave any artifacts, plants, stones, or other things where they are.
If you see someone damaging a monument or throwing garbage on the ground in a park, tell a park ranger or another park official.

Those kids have been offering comfort to one another; collecting clothes, food, water, and other supplies to send to rescue workers; and raising money to help the victims' families.
As kids have reached out to help others, they've learned about what their country stands for. English teacher Nan Bartow of New Haven, Connecticut, has been teaching for more than 30 years. She said, ""Kids are more patriotic than ever before.""
Many other teachers agree with Bartow. ""The students are saying, 'We are proud to be Americans' and that they appreciate everything they have,"" said Cynthia Elwood, a principal in Arlington, Texas.

In Georgia, Parker Pratt, age 10, and Mac Conway, age 9, opened a lemonade stand and collected about $60 for charity.
Teachers and students at the Academy Hill School in Wilton, Maine, declared Friday, September 21, Red, White, and Blue Day. Everyone at the school wore the colors of the American flag to school that day.
In Stow, Ohio, 7-year-old Alexa came up with an idea that enabled her class to raise $113. ""I saw people who were crying because they didn't have houses or anything and they lost their sisters and brothers,"" she said.
In Oklahoma, kids and their parents collected more than 40,000 teddy bears to give kids in 350 schools in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.
""It is especially hard for children to understand what has happened, but they know how to show love,"" said Sue Hale, who helped coordinate the donations. Many kids wrote and attached special notes to the bears they donated. They said the bears and notes would help give thousands of kids hope for a bright future.
If you are looking to help the victims and families of the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. you might contact the following organizations. Each of these organizations has a long history of helping disaster victims.
* The American Red Cross can be contacted at 1-800-HELP-NOW.
* The Salvation Army can be contacted at 1-800-SAL-ARMY.
* The United Way has set up the September 11 Fund to help victims and their families. You can learn more about the fund at

When the bees from those hives flew over the communities, they dropped the waste. Because it was a good year for bees, there was a lot of waste. Luckily, the bee goo is made mostly of pollen and is harmless.

If you have had a cavity, you have probably felt the bite of a dentist's whirling drill as it cuts into your tooth. Soon, however, the dentist may no longer need a drill.
Tooth decay is a disease. So dentists at Harvard University decided to fight the disease that causes cavities. ""We decided to try to beat the disease, rather than just drill and fill [cavities],"" said dentist Daniel Smith.

, or germs, that live on teeth. The germs make an acid that causes cavities.
The vaccine is a new way to prevent tooth decay. Brushing after meals and cutting back on sweets are two other weapons used to fight cavities.
, a chemical that strengthens teeth, also fights cavities. Fluoride is added to water and toothpaste. But many countries can't afford to put fluoride in water, and fluoride doesn't kill cavity-causing bacteria.
""[Tooth decay] is an epidemic worldwide,"" Smith said. ""Even if you have fluoride, you still have the bug [that causes tooth decay].""
So far, the scientists have tested the vaccine on rats. The rats that took the vaccine didn't get many cavities.
Now the scientists want people to try the vaccine. If it works, dentists may have a lot less drilling to do--other than drilling it into people's heads to remember to take the vaccine!

Can a windup laptop make learning easier for children in poor areas of the world? The team behind the One Laptop per Child program hopes so. The groups goal is to provide up to 7 million students in Thailand, Nigeria, Brazil, and Argentina with laptop computers.
The governments of those countries would buy the low-cost laptops. Called ""the green machine,"" each computer will cost about $100. The lime-green machines are powered with a windup crank that produces electricity. They are designed that way because many poor areas dont have electric power.
Beginning this month and into November, 500 children in Thailand will receive computers. Thailands prime minister said his government plans to provide each elementary student in Thailand with a free computer ""because books will be found and can be read on computers.""
The team behind the project hopes to meet its goal by 2007. After that, the group plans to take the program to China, Egypt, and Mexico. A number of U.S. educators are also interested in the machines. They say the laptops will help children whose families cant afford computers.

When you come home from school, does your pet dog run to you barking and wagging its tail? Does your cat purr when you pet it? Many pet owners believe that tail wagging and purring are signs that pets are happy.
Most scientists are not sure that animals feel emotions. They say animals never feel happy or sad. In fact, they say, animals probably don't feel love, anger, hate or other emotions either.
Scientist Joseph LeDoux studied rats to find out whether the rodents have emotions. He found that rats do feel at least one emotion--fear. He also found the part of the brain that seems to control fear in rats. In humans, that part of the brain controls fear and some other emotions.
Even though LeDoux says rats feel fear, he doubts that other animals have emotions in the way humans and other primates do. ""A whale may behave as if it's in love,"" he said, ""but you can't prove what it's feeling, if anything.""
A number of scientists say animals do have a range of emotions. Some scientists who have studied such animals as dogs, cats, elephants, lions, and whales say those animals feel emotions. Scientist Joyce Poole studies elephants. She has written that pachyderms often show grief when a relative dies. She says elephants have ""deep emotions.""
Jane Goodall, studies chimpanzees. She says she has seen chimps playing and chasing one another for fun. Goodall also says chimps feel grief. After Flo, a 50-year-old chimp, died, one of her sons, Flint, refused to eat food. Flint's brothers and sisters tried to get him to eat, but they couldn't. Three weeks later, Flint died. Goodall says Flint ""died of grief.""
More recently, scientist Marc Bekoff watched an elk run back and forth through a patch of snow, jumping into the air as it completed each back-and-forth pass. Bekoff said the animal was feeling the ""joy of life.""
Bekoff said he can't prove that animals have feelings, because animals can't talk. But, he said, animals can communicate feelings in other ways. ""I can't prove that another human being is feeling happy or sad,"" he said, ""but I can [guess] how [he or she is] feeling through body language and facial expressions."" Both people and animals use
-- gestures and movements--to communicate without words.

The Liberty Bell is about to get a new home. This fall, it will move from its current location at Liberty Bell Pavilion in Philadelphia to a new building down the street.
Why the change of address? It is part of improvements being made to the area where the bell now hangs.
Moving the bell, which weighs 2,080 pounds, could be tricky. Movers want to make sure that no additional harm is done to the bell's famous crack.
During the move, scientists will attach wireless technology to the bell. That technology will sound an alarm if strain from the move causes the crack to enlarge. Earlier this year, scientists conducted a test using wireless technology, and the crack did not appear to change.
""The bell is fragile because of the way it was [made],"" said one historian. The bell was built mostly of copper.
In 1752, the bell was brought to Philadelphia from England. The bell was rung to mark special events. It became a symbol of freedom in the United States. It was rung to call people to the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence on July 8, 1776. That document was signed on July 4, 1776.
This is not the first time the Liberty Bell has moved. From 1885 to 1915, the Liberty Bell traveled across the country, taking part in several World's Fair exhibits. During those years, it visited more than 400 cities and towns, including New Orleans, St. Louis, and San Francisco.
The last time the Liberty Bell changed location was in 1976.
At that time, it was taken from Independence Hall to its current nearby home. Many people consider Independence Hall the birthplace of the United States. Both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were signed there.
The Liberty Bell cracked the first time it was rung in 1752. However, the bell was rebuilt twice in its early years. The Liberty Bell cracked again sometime between 1817 and 1846. How it cracked remains a mystery. According to one report, its famous split occurred in February 1846 while it was ringing to celebrate George Washington's birthday.

This copper brooch belonged to one of the Vikings.
, or dug up, after a metal detector user discovered two copper brooches in the ground. The worker informed archaeologists, who believe the site dates back to the 10th century. It is one of only a few Viking cemeteries found in England.
The Vikings were pirates and warriors, known for their sea faring voyages. From the late 700s to 1100, the Vikings lived in Scandinavia. That region of Europe includes the present-day countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
Viking sailors spread fear throughout Europe. They raided and conquered coastal villages in Europe and along the Mediterranean coast. During their raids, Vikings captured slaves. They also
, or stole, treasures, such as silver and gold.
For their voyages, Viking sailors crafted swift, narrow
that could navigate the stormiest seas. The Vikings were the master shipbuilders of their time. Vikings also worked as farmers and craftspeople. Others hunted and fished.
The Vikings' claim to fame may have been their fearsome raids, but they were explorers and traders too. They were among the earliest explorers to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to North America.
The Vikings traveled to other parts of Europe, the Mediterranean, Greenland, and North America.
One of the most famous Vikings was explorer Leif Eriksson. He reached North America almost 500 years before Columbus arrived in 1492.
Longships varied in size, but many were between 60 feet and 90 feet in length.
A larger ship could carry about 50 raiders at a time.
Strong winds allowed a longship, which had one large sail, to reach speeds of up to 17 miles an hour.
Vikings used multiple oars to row the ship when there was no wind.
The front end of a longship curved upward and was adorned with a wood carving of a snake's or a dragon's head.
Over time, the Viking raiders lost their power as people learned to defend against their attacks. Today, the remains of Viking villages can be found throughout Europe and North America.
Archaeologists plan to study the burial ground in England to learn more about the life of the Vikings. Based on the objects found, they believe the site was once a Viking settlement.
Vikings were known to bury valuable items with the dead. As one historian put it, the site will allow experts to ""uncover the secrets of a time capsule more than 1,000 years old.""

Temperatures are on the rise in Antartica. What does that mean for emperor penguins and other wildlife?
Emperor penguins and other Antarctic wildlife ""feel the heat"" as their icy home melts away.
In the hit documentary March of the Penguins,
emperor penguins make an amazing journey. They cross the vast continent of Antarctica, a frozen area that surrounds the South Pole. The penguins leave their ocean homes and cross the ice on a dangerous trip. They are blinded by blizzards and toppled over by strong winds. But each winter, they do this to lay their eggs and raise their chicks.
That cycle of life may be in trouble though. Scientists have discovered an alarming rise in temperatures around Antarctica. ""The region at the peninsula has warmed up about 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 40 to 50 years,"" Wayne Trivelpiece, a scientist who studies Antarctica, told Weekly Reader.
A recent study also shows that the ocean near the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed since the 1960s. A
is a stretch of land surrounded on three sides by water. A change in temperature could spell trouble for penguins, whales, seals, and other creatures at the South Pole.
Although researchers are certain about the increase in temperatures, they are still unsure about the cause. Many scientists blame
the gradual rise in Earths average temperature.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth. Temperatures there rarely reach above freezing. Although it is too cold for humans to permanently live there, many animals swim in the icy waters surrounding the continent. Penguins, for example, waddle across the ice and dive into the cold ocean waters in search of food. They eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called
In warmer water, however, krill have trouble surviving. ""Warming temperatures have led to a decline in sea ice,"" says Trivelpiece. ""Sea ice holds the food that krill need to survive. Without the ice, there is less food for krill and without the krill, the penguins are not surviving.""
These changes could upset the balance of the food chain and endanger larger animals and birds. A loss of penguins could leave leopard seals and whales hungry. (See
.) ""A very small change in temperature [can] completely change the whole food chain,"" says Trivelpiece.
Its not just emperor penguins and other creatures that may be in trouble. People who live thousands of miles away may be affected by melting ice.
As glaciers and sheets of ice melt, they add to the worlds sea level. When ice on land falls into the ocean and melts, it raises the water level. It is like dropping ice cubes into a glass of water. A 4-foot increase in global sea level would drown low-lying coastal areas.
The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air. Those gases collect in a layer and trap the heat from the sun. The process is called the

Some heat from greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is necessary. Without them, Earth would be too cold to support life. But burning fossil fuels can release too much carbon dioxide into the air, which can cause temperatures to rise.
Scientists are working to persuade governments to reduce their use of greenhouse gases. Experts say that if greenhouse gases continue to gather in the air, temperatures will likely be higher by 2100 than any time in human history. ""Our research teaches us a lesson that even a small change in the environment can have a big effect,"" says Trivelpiece.
What are some ways that people can reduce their use of fossil fuels?
is a system of animals and plants in an area that depend on one another for food. At the top of the Antarctic food chain are large animals, such as whales. They eat seals, which eat penguins. Penguins munch on tiny shrimplike animals called krill. Krill eat tiny ocean plants called phytoplankton. A loss of smaller animals in the food chain could leave larger animals hungry.

visited the Westcoast Ostrich Show Ranch near Cape Town, South Africa. South Africa is a country in Africa.
Ostriches are the world's biggest birds. They have plump, round bodies covered with feathers, and long, skinny necks covered with soft fluff. Male ostriches weigh up to 350 pounds and can grow up to 8 feet tall. That's a foot taller than basketball player Shaquille O'Neal!
Ostriches don't fly. Instead, they use their wings to attract mates, alert other ostriches to danger, and keep their balance. Being stuck on the ground doesn't slow ostriches down, though. They can run as fast as a car can travel--up to 50 miles an hour for about 30 minutes.
At the farm in South Africa, the ostriches roam an area of flat land almost the size of 200 football fields. The workers at the farm take care of the ostrich eggs--the biggest of all bird eggs. At almost 3 pounds, each egg is about the size of a football. Even though an ostrich egg looks fragile, it is very strong. You could put a 300-pound weight on the egg without cracking its shell. Believe it or not, even a baby elephant could sit on an ostrich egg!

Scientists say the newly discovered moon is 3 miles wide. It is the smallest of Jupiter's known moons. Scientists used to think that Leda, a moon discovered in 1974, was Jupiter's smallest moon. Leda is between 5 and 10 miles wide.
Scientists have not officially named the newly discovered moon yet. For now they are calling it S/1999 J1.

Republicans and Democrats compete for control of Congress.
The countdown to Election Day has begun. On November 7, Americans will head to the polls to vote in the
Midterm elections happen in the middle of a presidents term in office. (Voters choose a president every four years. The next presidential election is in 2008.)
Members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate meet in the Capitol in what is called a joint session.
Midterm elections give voters a chance to choose people to represent their state in
Members of Congress make up the U.S.
Congress, the legislative branch of government, makes our nations laws.
On Election Day, candidates will compete for 33 of 100 seats in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Elections for governors will also be held in 36 states.
Members of Congress typically belong to one of the two main
in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about government goals. This election will decide whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party controls Congress for the next two years.
Republicans currently have control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Republicans have had the upper hand in the House since 1994. Republicans have also controlled the Senate for most of the past 12 years.
A party controls the House of Representatives or the Senate when its members win a
or more than half, of the seats in it. (See
.) Why is control of Congress so important? The party in power can more easily accomplish its goals and shape U.S. law.
For months, representatives from both political parties have tried to win over voters. Their members have been speaking about important issues, or problems, our country faces. Some of those issues are the war in Iraq, gas prices, and health care. (See
""Our country is facing some serious challenges here and around the world,"" Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told
""At home, our economy has made it harder and harder for working people to make ends meet."" He added that ""the war in Iraq and emerging threats from other nations present new challenges to our national security.""
""Our top priority is to ensure that we continue to keep Americans safe while spreading freedom and democracy abroad,"" Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told
""Republicans will also work to keep taxes and healthcare prices low so that families have more money to spend on things that are important to them.""
Which party will come out on top in this election? Its up to the voters to decide.
Here are some key issues on voters minds this election season.
Recent polls show that Americans support for the war in Iraq has dropped. President George W. Bush and many Republicans say the war is an important part of making the United States safer. Many Democrats say its time to rethink U.S. strategy in Iraq.
Gas prices have been high for the last year. Only recently have they begun to dip. Many voters are worried about the high cost of gas. They want to hear plans for making gas more affordable.
About 45 million Americans dont have health insurance. If they get sick, it will be difficult for them to pay for medical care and drugs on their own. Voters are looking for ways in which the government can make health care more affordable.
Which election issues are most important to you and your family? Why?

A team of scientists might be ditching the phrase ""oh, rats!"" from their vocabulary. They are experimenting with ways that rats may help find people who are buried as a result of earthquakes or other disasters.
Like dogs, rats have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out survivors. The rodents are also small enough to crawl almost anywhere. Dogs can be limited in their searches because of their larger size.
The scientists trained the rats to recognize the scent of people. To do that, researchers implanted electronic devices into the brains of the animals.
The electronic devices affect the rat's brain so that it picks up the scent of a person and then plans how to locate the person. Signals from the rat's brain are relayed to a radio transmitter that scientists attach to the rodent's back.
Rescue teams then will be able to track those signals and follow the rat's path. That will help rescuers determine where to start digging for survivors. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next nine months.

Our classroom play celebrates Philadelphia's hometown hero. Discover how his hard work helped to improve the lives of all Americans.
Honor the 300th birthday of one of our countrys greatest thinkers, inventors, and statesmen with our classroom play.
Each morning, Benjamin Franklin asked himself, ""What good shall I do today?"" And that is how he lived his life.
His can-do attitude launched him into the history books as one of Americas most famous citizens. Ben was a printer, a writer, an inventor, a community leader, and a founder of our nation.
Ben was born in a cottage in Boston on January 17, 1706. He attended school only between the ages of 8 and 10. Bens education was cut short because his family was poor and needed him to work.
His love of learning, however, stayed with him throughout his life. Ben read all the time. He often went without food to buy books! At 12, he began his lifelong love of printing.
In honor of the 300th anniversary of Bens birth, our three-act play looks at some key events in the life of this great American. Find out how his good deeds helped shape the history of our country.
ACT 1: Ben the Young Man, Boston, 1718-1723
Bens older brother, James, owns a printing press that publishes a very popular newspaper,
In 1718, Bens father decides that 12-year-old Ben should work for James.
At that time, Ben signs a document promising he will work for his brother until he is 21, without pay. In return, his brother is to provide Ben with food and clothes.
Ben likes to read and is a good editor and proofreader. Over the next few years, he learns all about printingand even begins writing letters to the newspaper under a different name. Thanks to Bens sense of humor and clever writing in those letters,
becomes one of the most-read newspapers in Boston.
James finds out that the letters are from his brother and he becomes jealous of Ben. James is furious and vows never to publish any of Bens writing again. He also finds fault with Bens work, even though Ben rarely makes errors.
I know I am a better printer than he is.
You cant leave! You have to work for me until you are 21!
Youll never find a job in this city! Youll come crawling back to me.
But Ben never comes back to his brother. Instead, he leaves in the early morning and runs away to New York City, in hopes of finding work as a printer. After not finding a job there, he heads to New Jersey where he boards a boat to Philadelphia.
The journey is three days long, and Ben is dirty, hungry, and penniless. But Philadelphia is a lively city, and Ben loves it.
ACT 2: Ben the Community Leader, Philadelphia, 1723-1740s
After arriving in Philadelphia, Ben works to establish himself as a printer. In 1728, he opens a printing shop and begins publishing his own newspaper,
A few years later, he also publishes
The book includes weather forecasts, recipes, and jokes. It also contains some of Bens sayings, such as ""Well done is better than well said."" The almanac becomes a best seller and makes Ben wealthy.
Although Ben works to better himself,it is also important to him to help the community. He considers Philadelphia his hometown and works to make life in the city better.
Ben starts projects to pave and sweep Philadelphias streets. He redesigns the citys streetlights so that roads are safe at night.
Ben also helps set up the first public library, hospital, and volunteer fire department. At this time, most houses in Philadelphia are made of wood and stand side by side. When a fire breaks out, it can destroy an entire neighborhood.
Extra! Extra! Fire destroys row houses on Market Street!
We need to train men to fight fires so that this doesnt keep happening.
Ben persuades more than 30 men to form the Union Fire Company.
We nominate Ben as our fire chief.
Ben is appointed fire chief. He makes sure that firefighters are trained to put out fires and rescue people.

The Union Fire Company meets once a month to discuss fire prevention. Ben also publishes fire prevention tips in his newspaper.
Bens ideas for Philadelphia help shape how fire departments, hospitals, libraries, and post offices work in other cities.
ACT 3: Ben the Statesman, Philadelphia, 1776
Along with his work in Philadelphia, Ben helps change the course of American history.
At the time, America is made up of 13 Colonies ruled by Britain. England has passed many laws that the Colonists think are unfair.
Ben works to mend the relationship between the Colonies and Britains ruler, King George III.
Despite his efforts, the Colonies decide to break away from Britain. They fight Britain in the Revolutionary War (1775-1783).
Ben is appointed to the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence. This document frees the Colonies from Britains rule.
We have to decide who should write the Declaration of Independence.
I wont. Many people disagree with my opinions.
I cant. I am not a writer.
I am unsure about independence from Britain.
You must write this very important document. Your writing style is perfect.
When Thomas Jefferson finishes his draft, he shows it to Ben.
Ive made small changes. For example, you wrote, sacred and undeniable, and I changed that phrase to make it stronger.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.
On July 4, a group of representatives from the 13 Colonies approve the Declaration of Independence and some people sign the document.
This for King George, so he can read it without his glasses.
On August 2, Ben and others also sign the document. They know they are risking everything for freedom from Britain.
Seven years later, in 1783, Ben negotiates the treaty that ends the Revolutionary War. In 1787, at age 81, he signs the U.S. Constitution.
Ben Franklin dies on April 17, 1790, at the age of 84. He is buried in Philadelphia. In honor of the 300th anniversary of his birth, people across the country will celebrate the life of this remarkable man.
If you could award a medal to Ben Franklin for one of his achievements, which accomplishment would it be? Why?

Saying that a penny has ""virtually no value,"" Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona wants stores to stop using the penny. He has introduced a bill in Congress that would require stores to round prices to the nearest nickel.
Kolbe says that most people don't usually use their pennies. He says people just toss the coins aside.
Critics, however, disagree with Kolbe. They argue that if Kolbe's bill becomes law, people will pay more for many of the things they buy. The critics claim stores will round most of their prices up, not down.
The penny is the oldest currency authorized by the U.S. government. The government first minted the 1 cent coin in 1787. Since then, the U.S. Treasury Department has made more than 300 billion pennies.

Nine-year-old Alex Warford, a student in Edwards's class, says, ""I think it's a great idea because they lost all their things.""
A hurricane forms when warm, moist air rises from the ocean's surface. The air pressure drops, and the winds cause a mass of clouds to form around an eye. The eye is the calm center of the hurricane.
The rising air cools and condenses, and heavy rain falls. The eyewall is a solid ring of thunderstorms around the eye. The strongest winds and heaviest rains are located there.

A new study shows that kids need to lessen their backpack loads.
Chances are youre carrying a heavy burdentoo much weight in your backpack. A new study warns that American kids need to reduce their backpack loads and spread out the weight.
Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, have shown that too much pressure from an overloaded backpack may cause shoulder pain. In addition, an uneven backpack load may lead to pain in the lower back.
Five girls and five boysall 13 years oldparticipated in the study. The kids wore identical backpacks, fitted on the shoulder straps with measuring devices called pressure sensors.
The children first carried 10 percent of their body weight, then 20 percent, and finally 30 percent. With each increase, the kids reported that their pain worsened.
According to previous studies, children typically carry loads that are about 22 percent of their body weight. The new study confirmed that 22 percent of body weight is too high.
Each year an estimated 7,500 emergency room visits result from injuries related to backpacks and book bags, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The researchers hope their information will encourage backpack makers to design wide, well-padded shoulder straps to help spread the weight.
The researchers also hope the results of their study will encourage kids to
or lessen, their loads. ""The weight in the backpack should be minimized as much as possible,"" Brandon Macias, one of the studys lead authors, told
Here are some tips to help you wear your backpack safely.
Dont carry more than 15 percent of your body weight. This means that if you weigh 100 pounds, you should not wear a backpack heavier than 15 pounds.
Choose a backpack that is the right size for your body.
Pack only what you need, and load heaviest items closest to your back.
Always wear both shoulder straps, and fasten the waist strap to balance the backpacks weight evenly.
Adjust shoulder and waist straps so the backpack fits snugly to your body and the weight is evenly balanced.
If your backpack is too heavy, consider using a book bag on wheels, if your school allows it.

Before we got in the tank, we put on special brown overalls called

When the belugas followed directions, Boris rewarded them with squid and herring. Those are part of a belugas diet in the wild. We playfully clapped the belugas tongues. Belugas dont use their teeth to chew food. They swallow their food whole.

A condor's wingspan is 9.5 feet across. That's about as wide as two kids lying down head to toe.
Wildlife experts say the condors did not die from the heat. Instead, the experts believe the huge birds died from lead poisoning. They say the condors had swallowed lead shotgun pellets.
, which means they eat the remains of dead animals. The condors probably ate the remains of an animal that had been shot by a hunter. As they ate the dead animal's flesh, the birds ate the deadly pellets.
If swallowed, lead can make an animal sick or cause death. Lead stops the body from making red blood cells. It can also damage an animal's organs, including the brain and liver.
The five poisoned birds were among 35 condors that have been released in Arizona since 1996. The release program has cost millions of dollars.
After the dead condors were found, wildlife experts recaptured and tested the 16 birds left in the Arizona group. All the birds were healthy and were soon released.
Members of the Peregrine Fund have been releasing and watching the condors set free in Arizona. Jeff Cilek, of the Peregrine Fund, told
that saving California condors is important. ""Condors are good for the environment. They [eat] dead animals,"" Cilek said.
California condors are among the world's largest birds. A hundred years ago, the birds were found in many parts of the United States. Today, the condor is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's list of endangered species. That means the number of California condors is so low they all could disappear someday.
Why are scavengers an important part of the food chain?
Peregrine Fund officials say there are 150 California condors left on Earth. Forty-eight of those birds are living in the wild; the rest are in zoos.
Although the loss of five birds is a ""serious setback,"" Cilek said his group is looking to the future. Peregrine Fund officials recently announced plans to release 12 more California condors in Arizona this winter.

Adkins and Heller have built a new robot that is so small, it can sit on a dime. The tiny robot weighs less than 1 ounce, has tracks like those on a tank, and carries a camera. For power, it uses three button cells (the batteries in watches).
So far, the robot cannot do many tasks. Recently, the robot steered itself through a small maze, but it moved at only 20 inches per minute. ""It can't zip along as fast as a spider or ant yet,"" said Heller.
In the near future, however, Heller plans to make faster and smaller robots. He foresees swarms of miniature robots doing all kinds of tasks. Police officers could send the small robots after crooks, and the bad guys would never know they were being tailed. Repair workers could send worker robots into tight spaces.
Perhaps in the future, swarms of minirobots will do many of the tasks, such as housecleaning, that people do today.

Wildlife officials in Florida have set up speed traps. The new speed traps, however, are not along highways. They are in the state's waterways.
The officials want to stop boaters from speeding in areas where manatees, or sea cows, live. Manatees are endangered mammals that live in water. Speedboats often collide with the slow-moving sea cows. Officials hope the new speed traps will slow down boaters.
Last year, boats injured or killed 78 manatees. During the first six months of this year, 48 manatees were injured or killed by boats.
State and wildlife officials blame the increase in manatee injuries and deaths on the number of boaters. ""There are more boats [on the water] now, so that's causing more [manatee] deaths,"" said Nancy Sadusky, an official of the Save the Manatee Club.

Now Farid Dadashev, age 11, is doing something to stop the fighting.
A few years ago, Farid said, ""I don't want to be a soldier when I grow up. I want to be a teacher."" Because of that desire for a peaceful life, Farid started the Child Peace Network. He sent out a petition to kids calling for peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia. So far, 10,000 kids from three countries have signed that petition.
In January, Farid traveled to the United Nations (U.N.) in New York City to talk about how the kids in his country are suffering from the war.
Azerbaijan and Armenia have been fighting over a region called Nagorno-Karabakh. Both countries claim the region belongs to them. Most of the people who live in that region are Armenian, and in 1988, the people of Nagorno-Karabakh began asking for independence or to join Armenia.
In 1991, that request turned into a bloody conflict between the two countries. The fighting lasted until 1994, when a cease-fire was declared. Although the cease-fire continues, the two sides have not settled their differences, and fighting still breaks out.
""The war affects everyone in Azerbaijan,"" Elmira Suleymanova, Farid's grandmother, told
from her home in Baku, Azerbaijan. ""No one can feel safe. One night, an entire community was burned to the ground.""
According to the U.N., the years of fighting have left 1 million people homeless. About 30 percent of those refugees are kids under age 15, said Farid.
No one knows if Farid's petition has had an impact on the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But last month, the leaders of the two countries met to discuss peace.

or get rid of, the penny for years. The recent news prompted him to re-introduce a bill to remove the penny from circulation.
Do the coins bearing President Lincolns face still make sense? People on both sides of the debate have put in their two centsworth.
Nearly 60 percent of Americans stash their pennies rather than spend them. For many, the penny is annoying. The coins are hard to spend. Vending machines and parking meters, for example, dont accept them. Cashiers often are frustrated when people pay with them.
""The penny has been a nuisance for years, and now it costs more than one cent to make the penny,"" Kolbe told
His plan calls for rounding ""all final sales, up or down, to the nearest nickel.""
Kolbe and others point out that pennies are expensive to produce. Pennies account for more than half of the U.S. Mints coin production. It will cost about $44 million dollars to produce pennies this year. That is nearly $14 million more than it cost in 2005.
Mark Weller of the group Americans for Common Cents believes that efforts to remove the penny will fail because Americans want to keep the coin. ""Two-thirds of the public think its important to have the penny in circulation,"" he told
Weller and others fear that rounding up prices to the nearest five cents will hurt consumers. ""Consumers lose without the penny,"" adds Weller.
He also says that many charities depend on these coins. Last year, children in New York City donated more than 65 million pennies, adding up to more than $650,000.
Americans may also be hesitant for the penny to vanish because of what it represents. ""The penny is part of American history and tradition,"" says coin collector Sylvester Neal. ""It would be like getting rid of the flag.""

Check out these fun facts about the penny:
The penny was first minted in 1787. Benjamin Franklin suggested its original design.
Since 1787, the U.S. Mint has produced nearly 300 billion pennies. Lined up edge to edge, those pennies would circle Earth about 137 times.
The U.S. Mint produced more than 7.7 billion pennies in 2005. Those coins weighed 38.5 million pounds. That is equal to the weight of about 2,500 male African elephants!
A copper penny contains less than 3 percent copper. The penny is mostly made of zinc.

610,"History in the Making: Japan Invades Hong Kong
War broke out between China and Japan in 1937. An undeclared war was fought until 1941, when China, as well as the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, declared war on Japan, Germany, and Italy. In 1941, Japan invaded the British colony of Hong Kong, which is part of present-day China. Connie interviewed her grandfather, Locksley Siu, who was in Hong Kong during the Japanese invasion.
How old were you when World War II began?
World War II in Hong Kong was from 1941 to 1945. The Japanese army occupied the former British colony when I was 11 years old.
Where did you live, and did you have a car?
Altogether, eight people lived in [an] apartment of 500 square feet. Our apartment was in Wan Chai, on Hong Kong Island. Most people did not have cars. My dad had an old bicycle.
Did you still go to school during the Japanese occupation?
Yes, I continued to go to school for the first year. Later the school was closed because the school ran out of money. During the occupation, students were required to learn Japanese. Japanese teachers taught us Japanese.
Did you have enough food to eat every day?
No, we did not have enough food. We only ate vegetables, beans, and potatoes, but no rice at all. Meat was very costly and in short supply. When we were really hungry, we drank water. Sometimes we had to pick up grass and leaves from trees to eat.
How did the Japanese soldiers treat the Chinese people?
They were rude, and they hated Chinese people. We had to salute the Japanese soldiers when they passed by. Otherwise they would kick [us] in the back.
How was life affected by the occupation?
There was little freedom. The Japanese forbade people to go out after 11 at night. There was no traffic during the curfew. There was a lack of electricity for lighting; instead, we used candles. The only entertainment at night was the radio. The Japanese government took all Hong Kong dollars away. The Japanese government forced us to use Japanese yen. Roads such as Queen's Road and King's Road were changed to Japanese names.
Do you have any comments about the occupation?
More than 60 years after [the end of] World War II, there are still many people  who live in fear, hunger, and poverty because of wars. I hope that you will think more of those less fortunate.
I learned that there was little freedom under the occupation. I should be grateful that I live in a country where I am not forced to do things that I don't want to do. I'm going to do something for the less fortunate, just as my grandpa told me.

97,"Hiram Bingham lived for adventure. In 1911, the American explorer trekked through the jungles of Peru. He was searching for clues to explain how the once-mighty Inca Empire had disappeared.
His journey through the Andes Mountains in South America was not easy. Bingham hacked his way through thick forests and climbed slippery slopes. One wrong stop could have sent him plummeting off a cliff.
After crawling up a snake-infested mountain, Bingham stumbled upon one of the greatest finds of the last century. He uncovered ruins from the ""lost city"" of Machu Picchu (MAH-choo PEE-choo).
Until Bingham's discovery, the ruins remained hidden for more than 400 years. Machu Picchu, which lies high atop a peak, is an ancient city that belonged to the Incas. Its name means ""old peak.""
Thanks to a traveling museum exhibit, people in the United States can go back in time to experience Incan life in Machu Picchu. The exhibit, called ""Machu Picchu: Unveiling the Mysteries of the Incas,"" is currently on display at the Chicago Field Museum.
""It is the first exhibit of its kind,"" museum project manager Hillary Hansen told
. ""It is the largest traveling exhibit of Inca objects.""
that Bingham collected are on display--from ceramic jars to copper and bronze jewelry. Artifacts are objects that people made long ago.
Machu Picchu is an ancient city that belonged to the Incas.
The Incas were people who ruled one of the largest empires in South America. Their empire extended from present-day Colombia into western Argentina.
Their vast civilization began to spread in about 1200. It lasted through the mid-1500s.
When Bingham discovered Machu Picchu, he thought he had found the birthplace of the Inca Empire. Since that time,
have learned that the city served as a summer residence for Incan kings. (Archaeologists study artifacts to learn about the past.)
The Incas built Machu Picchu between 1450 and 1470 for the ruler Pachacuti. The royal family would relax, hunt, and entertain foreign visitors there.
Machu Picchu wasn't just a home for nobles. About 500 common people lived in the stone city and worked for the royal family as farmers, artisans, and servants.
The city was abandoned in the mid-1500s, not long after the Spanish
(conquerors) arrived. The Inca Empire collapsed under Spanish rule.
Today, Machu Picchu is a popular tourist attraction. Nearly 400,000 people visit the ancient grounds each year.
Scientists still research the area to unlock more mysteries about the Incas. ""In the scheme of things, we still know very little about Machu Picchu,"" said Hansen.
Machu Picchu, which is located in Peru, was a city of palaces, temples, farms, and small houses.
Many of the buildings at Machu Picchu are made of large stones. The stones are so tightly wedged together that a piece of paper cannot fit between them.
Machu Picchu's farmland was carved into steps because it was hard for farmers to plow up and down the mountain. That allowed farmers to plant crops on the flat parts of the land and prevented rain from washing soil downhill.
The Incas had no writing, no money system, and no knowledge of the wheel. How do you think they created such a large empire?

258,"The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle's grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles.
The disease attacks an infected bird's brain and spinal cord.
At first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird.
In recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year.
Although the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased.
By the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild.
Wildlife experts are especially concerned because they don't know much about the disease, including what causes it. ""We have some ideas, but we don't have any answers,"" John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said.
Experts also don't know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. ""This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn't noticed,"" Fischer said.
While wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Scientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America's bird--the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn't true in 1782.
Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol.
""I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country"", Franklin wrote. ""He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird"".

676,"Hours before giant waves pounded coastlines in South Asia, many animals started behaving strangely. In Sri Lanka, elephants trumpeted frantically and fled to higher ground. Bats and flamingos deserted low-lying areas. Many other animals escaped unharmed.
Wildlife experts are amazed that many animals survived the tsunami. The series of huge waves killed thousands of people in South Asia and East Africa about two months ago. Experts say animals might have sensed the approaching waves and moved to higher ground.
""I think animals can sense disaster. They know when things are happening in nature,"" said an official at the national wildlife department in Sri Lanka.
Elephants' sharp senses may have warned them about the tsunami.
Other stories of odd animal behavior before the tsunami have also surfaced. Giant waves flooded low-lying parts of Yala National Park in Sri Lanka, uprooting trees and killing hundreds of people. Wildlife officials reported, however, that few animals died. The park is home to hundreds of animals, including elephants, monkeys, leopards, tigers, deer, and water buffalo.
In Thailand, elephants carrying tourists from Japan bolted for the hills, and other elephants broke free of their chains. In one fishing village, nearly 1,000 locals escaped safely after birds squawked madly.
Although some animals in South Asia successfully fled to higher ground before the tsunami, other animals were not as lucky. Many dogs and other pets lost their owners in the tsunami and are homeless, sick, and without food or water. Cows, goats, and other farm animals are also roaming aimlessly. Many of those animals are drinking polluted water. Rescue groups have been sending animal food and
to the area. Veterinarians are doctors who care for animals.
Why might animals have known trouble was on the way? Forget special powers. Instead, experts say that animals have better senses of hearing, smell, and sight than humans do. Those sharp senses help warn animals when natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes, are about to happen.
""It doesn't surprise me that animals had an early warning of the tsunami,"" animal expert Michael Dee of the Los Angeles Zoo told
. ""The senses of certain species are far stronger than what any human has."" Dee points out that dogs, for example, have a stronger sense of smell than humans and that cats can see better in the dark than people.
Scientists say that animals might have felt the vibrations from the earthquake that set off the tsunami. In addition, many animals, including elephants, pigeons, and dogs, can also pick up
. That is a sound that is too low in pitch for humans to hear.
""Elephants can hear or feel other elephants grumble up to 2 miles away, so they probably felt the earthquake,"" said Dee. ""Their first
would be to move away from the direction of the sound."" An instinct is a natural, untaught behavior or reaction.
Before the tsunami struck, animals may have started to flee because they saw other creatures running. ""Animals take their cues from other animals,"" said Dee.
How animals sense danger has fascinated people for centuries. Most scientists are quick to point out, however, that nothing has ever been proven.
Will animal instincts be used to create a warning system about natural disasters anytime soon? ""I wouldn't count on [it],"" said Dee.
In the meantime, animals are helping out in other ways. For example, elephants are assisting in the cleanup of areas hit by the tsunami.
Scientists say that elephants can pick up vibrations from earthquakes through their broad feet.
Elephants' toenails are in the skin and not attached to the toes.
Elephants' soles have sensitive foot pads that detect vibrations, such as those from an earthquake. That signals elephants to move to more stable ground.
In what other ways might animals' sharp senses be helpful?

Now some lawmakers in Maine want people to pay a 5-cent deposit on each cigarette they buy. If the bill passes, people could return used cigarette butts to get a deposit back.
The lawmakers who introduced the bill say they did so for two reasons. First, such a plan would lead to fewer crushed cigarette butts littering the landscape. ""I think [the law] could work to reduce waste,"" said Maine lawmaker Scott Cowger, who cosponsored the bill in Maine's House of Representatives.
Second, a cigarette deposit law would raise money for antismoking education programs in Maine schools. The bill's sponsors admit they expect only a small percentage of people will redeem cigarette butts.

598,"On April 14, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln was watching a play at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. As the president watched, John Wilkes Booth pointed a gun at the back of Lincoln's head and fired a shot. The dying president slumped forward, grasping an American flag.
For most of the last century, the flag that President Lincoln had touched was missing. This summer, officials at the Connecticut Historical Society said that they had discovered the flag in the society's basement. How did a flag from one of the darkest days in American history wind up in the historical society's basement?
After the shooting, the flag that Lincoln had grasped was given to a Civil War veteran from Connecticut. He gave it to his son, who gave it to the historical society in 1922. The flag ended up in the basement, where it lay, forgotten, for 76 years.
In 1998, a society librarian was in the basement. ""I looked down and saw what looked like a flag in a box,"" the librarian said.
The flag was in tatters, so the society spent the next three years repairing it and making sure it was the flag that our 16th president had touched.
Now visitors can see the flag at the society's museum. ""The flag makes history real,"" Susan Schoelwer, of the historical society, told
The American flag has changed many times. Here are some of the changes:
1607-1775: The British flag was flown by the 13 British colonies.
1775: The first U.S. flag had 13 stripes, with the British flag in one corner.
1818: The U.S. flag had 13 stripes and 20 stars.
1960: The current flag with 50 stars was made official.

The quake, which was the strongest to hit India in 50 years, left devastation and heartache in its wake. Initially, rescue workers had little hope of finding survivors under rubble from toppled buildings. However, miraculous rescues did occur. For example, a rescue team saved a 4-year-old girl trapped under tons of concrete several days after the quake had struck.
Disaster experts say that the quake caused more than $5 billion in damage. It will take years for the people affected by the disaster to recover from it.

The 30-foot-wide wings carried Leden about 35 feet into the air. Her flight lasted for 17 seconds.
The plans for Leden's flight were 500 years in the making, but she was airborne for a fraction of a minute.
The story of Leden's flight begins in Italy in the late 1400s. Italy is a country in Europe. At the time, Italy was caught up in the Renaissance. Many great artists lived during the Renaissance.
One of the greatest artists of the Renaissance was Leonardo da Vinci. Though da Vinci is best known for his art, he was also an inventor. He drew many machines that wouldn't actually be built for centuries. For example, he drew pictures of an armored car, a helicopter, a hot-air balloon, and a submarine.
Between 1490 and 1505, da Vinci made several drawings of a glider. A glider is an aircraft that doesn't have an engine. It glides on air currents. The wings that Leden used were based on da Vinci's glider.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
A glider based on drawings made by Leonardo da Vinci recently flew.
Leonardo da Vinci was an artist during the Renaissance.
A glider does not have an engine.
Aircraft experts worked to turn da Vinci's drawings into reality. They carefully followed the drawings. ""In its early stages, it looked like a bird's skeleton, and that's how Leonardo's drawings showed it,"" Leden said. When completed, the birdlike glider weighed 110 pounds.
No one knew whether the glider would actually fly. Some people worried that if it did fly, the glider might also crash. ""It was the most dangerous flight of my life,"" Leden said after she flew the glider.
Leden flew da Vinci's glider a total of 20 times. Each flight was short, but she didn't crash. Later, Leden said the glider flights were ""very, very thrilling. It shouldn't have worked, but it did!""

Shaw, who is blind, said he felt like Cuddles from a television program. Shaw and his wife contacted the Guide Horse foundation in Kittrell, North Carolina. ""Horses make excellent guides,"" said trainer Janet Burleson. ""It is very common in the wild state for a blind horse to bond to a sighted horse that it uses as it' guide.""
Guide horses are usually between 26 and 27 inches tall and weigh between 80 and 100 pounds-about the same size as many guide dogs. However, not just any small horse can be a guide horse, says Burleson. It needs to have the right personality and intelligence level. Like a guide dog, Cuddles has been house trained. She will tap her hoof on the door when she needs to go outside. Unlike guide dog, however, she doesn't sleep in the house. Instead, she sleeps in a small barn.
Shaw says that everyone wants to pet Cuddles because the tiny horse is so cute. But people should not pet Cuddles or any other service animal. Petting can distract a guide animal from its job of keeping a blind person safe. Cuddles and Shaw have traveled many places together, including the Empire State Building in New York City. ""Every time I hear the gasps of amazement from an onlooker who has just realized that Cuddles is not a guide dog, I smile Shaw says.

To the spectators below, Bello's stunt looked dangerous-and it was. But Bello knew a secret. He was using science to help keep himself safe.
Bello began performing circus stunts when he was 9 years old. He walked on a thin wire that was stretched 9 feet off the ground.
To stay on a wire without falling, Bello needs to keep his center of gravity low. An object's center of gravity is usually located in the middle of the object. That is where the object's weight is centered.
By crouching and keeping low, Bello keeps his center of gravity low. The lower his center of gravity, the harder it is for Bello to fall.
Bello often carries a heavy metal stick when he performs. The stick bends downward, lowering his center of gravity.
Bello also uses Newton's first law of motion when he performs. That law is named for Isaac Newton. He was a scientist who lived about 275 years ago.

""The mites are decimating the hives,"" Kevin Hackett of the U.S. Department of Agricultures research program for bees told

Why are honeybees so important? Farmers depend on honeybees to

Experts estimate that nearly one-third of the food that humans eatfrom apples to zucchiniis pollinated by bees. ""Crops that are pollinated are the tasty things that people like to eat, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts,"" says Hackett.
Farmers are feeling the effects as mites destroy the
or large group of bees, inside the hive. Beekeepers who manage hives rent honeybees to farmers to pollinate their crops. The bee shortage has driven up prices, making it expensive for farmers to rent honeybees. Each year, bees typically pollinate crops worth about $15 billion. Crop loss due to the bee shortage is costing farmers billions.
Farmers in California are particularly hurting because about 80 percent of the worlds almonds are grown there. Almond tree blossoms need honeybees to pollinate them.

Troubled waters are ahead for the world's fish. Those finned creatures and shellfish, such as crabs and clams, may be a rare sight by 2048, according to a fouryear study. The study, recently published in the journal
was conducted by a team of 14 researchers in four countries.
If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
The study warns that ocean life is being wiped out because of overfishing and pollution.
Global warming (a rise in Earth's temperatures) and habitat loss are also to blame for the decline in seafood.
Although the world's sea life is in serious danger, it's not too late to reverse the problem, says the study's lead author, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. The researchers have called for measures to protect current fish populations, such as reducing large-scale fishing and pollution. ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we don't change things,"" Worm told reporters.
The loss of ocean life will cause more than just a shortage of seafood. It could spell disaster for ecosystems too. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that work together as a unit to live. A declining fish population would cause a disaster up and down the food chain. Larger animals, such as seals and dolphins, depend on fish for food. Without enough fish to eat, those animals would be in trouble.

Volcanoes can remain quiet for years and then erupt violently, sometimes without warning. Using the latest technology, scientists hope to better
Mount St. Helens is located in Washington.
Scientists say Mount St. Helens is one of the most closely monitored volcanoes and the most active volcano in the lower 48 states. Mount St. Helens is also among 13 active volcanoes that are located in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. That range is home to several powerful volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier and Mount Hood.
Although scientists say a large eruption at Mount St. Helens is unlikely, they are cautious because of the volcano's history. Officials have sealed off a 5-mile area around the volcano.
Mount St. Helens erupted with tremendous force in May 1980, blowing more than 1,300 feet off its top and killing 57 people. The blast destroyed thousands of acres of forest and scattered ash for thousands of miles. Mount St. Helens continued to rumble until 1986 but has been quiet since that time.
How can scientists tell when a volcano will awaken from its slumber? ""We measure earthquake activity, changes in the mountain, and volcanic gases,"" said Driedger.
Although scientists can't tell exactly when or with what force a volcano will blow its top, they rely on advanced equipment to help them predict eruptions. Special devices called
are installed around volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens to detect earthquakes. Earthquakes always strike before a volcano erupts.
Volcanoes are mountains where hot, liquid rock called magma deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure can cause magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the crater at the top of the volcano and vents, or cracks, along its side. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called lava. Once lava cools, it hardens into rock.
Scientists use special global positioning instruments to measure movements on the slopes of the mountain--a clue to the buildup of
. Magma is red-hot molten rock located inside the volcano. It is called
when it pours out of the volcano.
As magma rises, volcanoes release carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Sensors on helicopters test the air for gases that signal rising magma. ""The gases are like telegrams that tell us what's going on inside the volcano,"" said Driedger.
More than 500 million people around the world live near active volcanoes. Monitoring volcanoes is a dangerous job, but scientists take precautions to stay safe.
""By watching volcanoes, we learn how they work,"" said Driedger. ""The more we know, the better prepared we can be to save property and lives.""
Besides volcanoes, what natural disasters are hard for scientists to predict? Why?

""I cried when I saw my house,"" Chakia Boutte told
The 12-year-old's New Orleans neighborhood looks different from the way it looked a year ago. Chakia points to a block of homes that were damaged when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast. ""All these houses used to be fixed up,"" she says. Chakia's own home flooded in the storm last year.
More than 1,300 people died in the storm, and many more lost their homes. Hurricane Katrina is the costliest natural disaster in American history. Relief and recovery costs from the storm are nearing $100 billion.
Some areas are coming back to life. Along the Mississippi coast, homes and businesses are being rebuilt. Volunteer camps are full of people eager to help.
Other places look as though Katrina passed through one month, rather than one year, ago. In New Orleans's Lower Ninth Ward, abandoned homes sit waiting to be
or torn down. Overturned cars and uprooted trees line the streets. The air smells of mold and garbage.
This fall, Chakia will attend school in Texas. She has lived there since her family fled the hurricane. Other families are returning to New Orleans. About 55 of the city's 128 public schools are scheduled to reopen in time for the new school year. Though the public school system will be able to accommodate 34,000 students, only 20,000 are expected to attend.
""Parents have been very reluctant to bring young children back to the city,"" New Orleans City Councilmember Cynthia Hedge-Morrell told
In New Orleanss Lower Ninth Ward, flooded homes floated off their foundations during the hurricane. Here, a home sits on top of an overturned truck.
In New Orleans, about half of the city's former population of 450,000 has returned. Electricity and phone service are still out in the hardest-hit areas. The city's roads are full of potholes. Mail delivery is slow. Grocery stores, banks, and hospitals remain boarded up.
The federal government has invested billions in a program known as the Road Home. The program will provide money for Louisiana residents to rebuild or sell their storm-damaged houses.
The most urgent task is protecting New Orleans against another hurricane. The
structures that prevent floodingcollapsed during Hurricane Katrina.
Although the damaged levee system has been repaired and improved, it is still not designed to handle a storm like Katrina. The Army Corps of Engineers is preparing plans for Congress that will propose ways to protect New Orleans against the strongest hurricanes.
On the Gulf Coast, people speak of life in terms of ""before Katrina"" and ""after Katrina."" ""My life before the hurricane was so beautiful,"" says Myeisha McDaniels, 13. ""I had just made the dance team. My mom was just letting me go to the movies by myself. I was mad the hurricane came and messed everything up.""
Myeisha and other kids who have returned to New Orleans want to help rebuild the city. As part of a summer program called Gulf Coast WalkAbout, kids built bus stop benches and planted flowers in a park that had flooded during Katrina. They also reflected on their hurricane experiences.
In a journal entry, 12-year-old Duriel Harris wrote: ""I am now used to a whole new lifestyle. ... Every day now is different from my pre-Katrina days.""
Over the summer, kids in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas participated in the Gulf Coast WalkAbout program. They helped rebuild their communities. Here are some of the projects kids in New Orleans completed.
Kids painted trash cans, picked up litter, and planted flowers at a park that had flooded during Hurricane Katrina.
Kids recorded their hurricane experiences. Duriel Harris, 12, explains his family tree. His familys home was flooded in the storm.
After noticing that people were sitting on stoops or overturned buckets as they waited for buses, kids built two bus stop benches.
Why might some families have chosen not to return to New Orleans?

Soft-drink companies are in fizzy competition. Many people in the United States are overweight. In the face of the nation's growing health and nutrition problems, many schools have banned soft drinks and other high-sugar snacks from vending machines.
As a result, the pressure is on for soft-drink companies to find new ways to stay in school. Some companies, such as Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, are introducing new milk-based drinks in different flavors to be sold in schools.
Some experts claim, though, that the milk-based drinks are still too high in sugar. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration won't allow the makers of those products to use the word

As part of a deal with New York City, Snapple will be the only drink company to have vending machines in the city's schools. To meet the city's rules banning high-sugar foods from schools, Snapple had to create four new 100-percent juice drinks.
Not good enough, say some nutrition experts who claim the new Snapple drinks have more calories and sugar in them than soft drinks have. Unlike orange juice and grapefruit juice, the new juices contain only small amounts of nutrients and vitamins. ""The fact is... they are pretty much the same as a [soft drink],"" said one expert.
Why is it important to read food labels carefully?
Other nutritionists disagree. They say the new juices and milk products are an improvement over previously available choices.

""The combined impact of too many tourists stomping all over these important sites plus climate change is having a severe [effect],"" Susi Moser, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told
The last nine years were the hottest since scientists began tracking Earths temperature in 1861. Some scientists say global warming will create more
or powerful, hurricanes. Researchers predict that the heat will cause glaciers in the Antarctic to melt. That will cause ocean levels to rise.
Those changes could destroy the Everglades, the CFS report says. Stronger hurricanes could threaten the areas plant and animal species, including American crocodiles and manatees. Rising seawater could flood the swampy region.
Its important to protect the 2,358-square-mile landmark, Jan Michael Jacobson, director of the Everglades Institute, told
""The Everglades primarily is valuable because it is a unique habitat,"" he said.
The historic temples of Kathmandu, Nepal, were built between 1300 and 1800. They draw millions of tourists each year.
The Great Barrier Reef and Kathmandu are facing a different threattourists. The Great Barrier Reef attracts about 1.8 million tourists a year, who pump billions of dollars into Australias economy. Visitors can also damage the delicate system of coral reefs.
Tourists are endangering Kathmandu, too, CFS officials say. The valley is in the shadow of Mount Everest, the worlds tallest mountain. The report warns that skiers and climbers hoping to tackle Mount Everest and other Himalayan peaks may harm Kathmandus ancient temples.
The effects of global warming are already being felt. More than 150 countries are working to stop the rising temperatures. They have
emissions. Those gases contribute to global warming.
As for the Great Barrier Reef and Kathmandu, the CFS report recommends limiting the number of tourists allowed to visit the sites. But some people say that visiting endangered landmarks could encourage tourists to fight for their protection.
Many cars and factories burn fossil fuels. That releases greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the air. Those gases form a layer and trap the suns heat close to Earth.
That process is called the greenhouse effect. The layer of gases acts as a window in a greenhouse doesit lets in heat but doesnt let much out. The result is global warming, a worldwide rise in average temperature.
There are 788 World Heritage Sites, but becoming one is not easy. Landmarks must meet one of 10 requirements. For instance, a site must represent a unique culture or a significant period in history. Independent groups
or examine, each landmark. Then an international committee, which is part of the United Nations, votes on the new sites. The Great Wall of China and the Statue of Liberty are included on the list.

Glaciers are found in the polar regions around the world and in mountain valleys. The glaciers in South America are some of the largest outside the polar regions.
Because of the region's rough terrain and harsh weather, scientists have trouble reaching the area by foot. To study the melting of the South American glaciers, scientists recently relied on satellite technology.
Scientists discovered that glaciers in this area are rapidly melting.In fact, they are melting twice as fast as they were just a few years ago. Erik Rignot, an expert who studied the glaciers, referred to the South American ice fields as the ""fastest area of glacial retreat on Earth.""
As the glaciers melt, their water flows into lakes or oceans. As a result, the meltdown is causing sea levels to rise. If ocean levels rise by even a foot, the water could flood the world's coastal cities.
What is causing the glaciers to pull a disappearing act? Warmer temperatures and less snowfall from

It's not just that the South American glaciers are on thin ice. Scientists warn that about 90 percent of the world's glaciers are melting from global warming.
Some scientists say that people contribute to Earth's warmer temperatures. Harmful gases are released into the air when people burn certain fuels for electricity or for driving cars.
To help solve the problem, some scientists say people must work to reduce the effects of global warming. ""Once the glaciers have melted, that's it [for them],"" said one scientist.
Glaciers are large sheets of moving ice and snow. As snow accumulates, or builds up, on a glacier, the weight causes the snow underneath to turn into ice. The ice becomes so heavy that it forces the glacier to move.
As glaciers slowly move, they carve out the land beneath them, carrying away rocks and soil. Glaciers erode, or gradually wear away, the land.
What are some ways people can help prevent global warming?
Over hundreds and thousands of years, glaciers create different landforms, such as lakes.

Do Florida panthers have nine lives? Scientists sure hope so! The wild cats are on the brink of
During the early 1900s, hundreds of the large, light-brown cats roamed the southeastern United States. Today, panthers can be found only in southern Florida. Wildlife officials estimate that only between 80 and 100 panthers are left in the Sunshine State.
What is causing the sharp decline in the panther population? Hunting and habitat loss are mainly to blame. During the mid- to late 1900s, millions of people flocked to Florida for its warm climate and inexpensive land. As people built homes and roads, panthers were squeezed out of their habitat.
In 1967, Florida panthers were placed on the endangered species list in the United States. The list was created to protect animals that are on the edge of extinction.
Today, wildlife officials are working to keep the wild cats out of
, or danger. Workers have installed fencing along 40 miles of public roads in south-western Florida to prevent panthers from colliding with cars and other vehicles.
Officials are also making efforts to save the land where panthers live from further development. ""We have to protect what's left of their habitat,"" panther expert Bob DeGross told
A panther is about 10 times as large as a house cat. Adult males can weigh up to 150 pounds; females typically weigh about 70 pounds.
Panthers are skilled hunters. They mainly prey on white-tailed deer and wild hogs but will also eat armadillos, raccoons, and even alligators.
Panthers became Florida's official state animal in 1982.
Baby panthers stay with their mothers for about two years, learning to hunt and survive.

And they're off! Teams of specially trained dogs are racing to the finish line across one of the toughest terrains in the world.
Along a jagged trail of snow and ice, the teams battle Alaska's below-zero temperatures. They are competing in the Iditarod (igh-DIT-ah-rod) Trail Sled Dog Race, which kicked off on March 6.
The Iditarod is the longest sled dog race in the world. This year, about 90 sled dog teams are running the roughly 1,110-mile route.
The race, now in its 32nd year, starts in the city of Anchorage and ends in the city of Nome. The stretch of land the teams must cross is almost equal to the distance from New York City to Miami.
A team of 12 to 16 dogs tow each sled. It can take more than two weeks for teams to complete the race. In 2002, a record holder completed the race in 8 days, 22 hours, 46 minutes, and 2 seconds.

During their journey, mushers set up camp to make sure the dogs get enough food, water, and rest. The mushers and dogs are required to stop for at least one 24-hour period and two 8-hour periods.
Not surprisingly, dog mushing is Alaska's state sport. Before mushing became a popular sport, dog teams served as an important form of transportation.
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, miners discovered gold in Alaska. Thousands of people traveled there for the gold rush.
During that time, sled dogs helped people get from place to place and transported gold, mail, and supplies. ""Dog teams were important to settling Alaska during this time,"" race director Joanne Potts told

In January 1959, Alaska became the 49th state. More than twice the size of Texas, Alaska is the largest state.
Alaska's nickname is ""The Last Frontier"" because much of the land is wilderness that remains unsettled.

Fourth grader Annie Inglese knows how important it is to get the right amount of sleep each night. ""If I don't get enough sleep,"" she says, ""I have trouble getting up in the morning.""
Sleep experts say that kids who do not get a good night's sleep on a regular basis put their safety at risk. Delaying bedtime for other activities can lead to accidents, such as falling off a bike or getting hurt on the playground.
In addition to preventing injuries, children who get enough sleep on a regular basis tend to get better grades and be in a better mood. ""Sleep is just as important as nutrition and exercise in our overall health,"" says Dr. Carl Hunt, a sleep expert with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Estimates show about 1 out of every 4 adults does not get enough sleep. Sleep experts think that number may be just as high for kids. According to the NIH, children ages 7 to 11 need at least nine hours of sleep each night.
Most kids and families today have busy schedules that can keep them from getting enough sleep. Plus, watching television, chatting on the Internet, and playing video games all compete with valuable sleep time.
Going to bed at the same time each night will help you get a good night's sleep. If you have trouble falling asleep, Dr. Hunt advises you to unwind with quiet time. Reading or listening to soothing music can help bring on sleep.

765,"Larry Stevens lives in a remote, quiet area of Hawaii. Recently, that changed when new neighbors moved into the area. The noisy neighbors are two kinds of frogs.
Even though the coqui and greenhouse frogs are each only about the size of a dime, they make a huge racket. Instead of making soft chirping or gentle croaking sounds, the frogs chirp as loudly as a lawnmower. ""You'd never believe so much noise could come from a creature that small,"" Stevens said.
Scientists say the frogs in Stevens's backyard recently arrived in Hawaii. They came from islands in the Caribbean Sea, south of the United States mainland. Scientists think the frogs were accidentally shipped to Hawaii in flowerpots.
Since arriving in Hawaii, the foreign frogs have spread to 150 areas. In some areas, more than 8,000 can be found on a single acre of land. Each one is adding to the noise level.
The frogs are more than a noisy nuisance; they are causing other problems, as well. They eat insects that birds and other frogs used to eat. Each night, each thunderous frog can eat at least six insects.
The number of frogs is increasing because no other animals prey on them. If the foreign frog population keeps growing, other frogs and birds in Hawaii might not have enough insects to eat and might starve.
Some officials worry that the frogs might cause some people to leave Hawaii because of the racket. ""We get a lot of complaints from residents,"" said Fred Kraus, a spokesperson for the state. ""Some [have] threatened to leave the state.""
Residents of Hawaii are trying to capture the shrill frogs, which live in trees. Recently, Stevens and some of his neighbors went out looking for the noisy critters. They used ladders to climb into trees and capture frogs. ""We got them all,"" he said.
However, within a few months of the frog roundup, more frogs moved into Stevens's neighborhood. ""It was hopeless,"" Stevens said. ""There were just too many [frogs to capture]. Now they're out of control.""

200,"Scientists recently discovered three previously unknown species of mouse lemurs. The find is important, because the numbers of lemurs left in the wild is dwindling.
Scientists found the lemurs on Madagascar, an island nation off the southeast coast of Africa. Madagascar is home to more than 30 species of lemurs. Most lemurs are the size of small rodents, but some can grow to be as large as a medium-sized dog. Lemurs are usually
animals, which means they mostly sleep during the day and come out at night.
The discovery surprised scientists. ""It's incredibly rare to discover a new species of primate, let alone three new species,"" said Steven Goodman of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.
Lemurs live only in the island nations of Madagascar and Comoros.
The smallest lemur weighs about 1 ounce.
The newly discovered species live only in the rain forests along Madagascar's west coast. They weigh a few ounces and eat beetles, fruits, and plants.
All lemurs on Madagascar are in trouble, however. Scientists fear that lemurs are in danger of becoming extinct.
One threat is from people cutting down the trees in which lemurs live. The trees are being cleared to create farmland. Another threat to lemurs comes from hunters who are trapping the primates for food.
To protect lemurs and the rain forests in which they live, wildlife officials in Madagascar have set up special parks and nature reserves. Loggers and hunters cannot cut down the trees or hunt the animals in the nature reserves.
Scientists hope that the special areas are large enough to protect all the species of lemurs that are living today. Scientists are especially concerned because there may be undiscovered species that need protection. ""So many areas of Madagascar haven't been [explored],"" said Dean Gibson of the Duke University Primate Center. ""I think there are more [species] to find.""

: How have your friends and family reacted to your fame?
: They don't treat me any differently. They see me as Dan. I wouldn't want my friends to see me as Harry.
: In what ways has your life changed since the first movie came out?
: It really hasn't changed that much. I am often recognized as Harry Potter. But I don't mind that.
: When you grow up, do you want to continue acting?
: I think I will take it one film at a time. After this film, I will do the third [Harry Potter] film. After that, we will see how it goes.
If you could play a role in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which role would you play? Why?
: What have you learned about making movies that you didn't know before you played Harry Potter?
: It's hard work. It is a lot of fun, but at the same time it's really a challenge.

472,"Experts hope 2006 will be the year the world is polio-free.
Will polio be declared a disease of the past?
World health groups are fighting a war
with a crippling and sometimes deadly diseasepolio. Their efforts are paying off. Polio has been wiped out in 10 African countries, according to a recent report.
Since mid-2003, nearly 200 children in those 10 western and central African countries were
for life, but no new cases have been reported since last June. When people are paralyzed, they are unable to move different parts of their bodies and may be unable to walk.
The disease raced across Africa and into Asia after people in Nigeria refused the polio
mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think well get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told
She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria.""
Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly
disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havent been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims.
With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world. On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government approved the use of a vaccine that stopped people from getting the disease. Jonas Salk was the doctor who invented the first polio vaccine.
A boy in Africa receives an oral polio vaccine from a WHO (World Health Organization) worker.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world thanks to Salk, it still threatens children in Africa and Asia. Major efforts were recently under way to
or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been
Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door.
To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November.
After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Its uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives.""
Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization.
Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why?
Jonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.
From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Roosevelts death, Salks vaccine was declared officially safe.
In October 2005for the first time in 26 years in the United Statesfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnt at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.

What Should You Do to Avoid the Flu?
There have been a lot of empty desks in schools across the United States this winter. Many kids have stayed home while sick with the flu bug that is raging across the country.
Chances are if the flu hasn't made you sick yet, it has infected someone you know. Experts say the flu season struck more than a month earlier than its normal start. It began in October and spread quickly. Flu season typically runs from December through April.
""Most of us are convinced this was a hard flu season on children,"" said one flu expert. Hospitals and doctors' offices have been jammed with sick patients, especially kids. Some schools even closed because the flu outbreak was so severe.

Unlike a cold, the flu usually strikes suddenly and without warning. Some

Someone who has the flu virus can easily infect other people. The flu is highly

The flu virus spreads through the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Other people can catch the flu by breathing in the airborne germs.
You can also get the flu by coming in contact with places where germs hang out-such as computer keyboards and door handles-and then touching your mouth or nose.
Although there is no cure for the flu, health experts say that getting a

This season, many people lined up to get the vaccine in the form of flu shots. Each year, the flu virus changes. Scientists develop a vaccine to protect people from the type of virus that is spreading.
Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that ""there's still plenty of flu out there,"" this organization has some good news. It reports that the number of flu cases appears to be on the decline.
At press time, health officials say only five states report that the flu is widespread. That number is down from 45 at the flu's

What Should You Do to Avoid the Flu?
To keep flu germs from spreading, practice these healthful habits:
Wash your hands often with soap and water.
Cover your nose or mouth with a tissue when you sneeze or cough. Remember to throw away the tissue!
Avoid touching your nose, eyes, or mouth. Germs can easily enter your body there.

Do you skip breakfast most mornings? If you're like most kids, you probably do!
A new school year can be a good time to get into the habit of eating a healthful breakfast, say experts. Recent studies show that eating breakfast boosts both your health and your brainpower.

and a balanced diet during the day will help your body get the nutrients it needs.
The old saying is true-you are what you eat! That's because your health depends on what you put into your body. Here are some nutrients you might find in breakfast foods:
Complex carbohydrates found in foods such as cereal provide your body with energy. Your body stores up the energy and uses it when you need it!
Protein also supplies your body with energy and helps fight infection. Eggs and cheese are good sources of protein.
Vitamins and minerals help the body grow. Milk and other dairy products provide your body with vitamin D and calcium, a mineral that helps build strong teeth and bones. Fruits and vegetables are good sources of vitamins and minerals. You should eat at least five servings of them a day.

Make a breakfast sundae. Top a bowl of yogurt with fresh fruit and granola.
Toast cheese on whole-grain bread. Wash it down with a glass of cold orange juice.
Got milk? Enjoy a cup with a peanut butter and banana sandwich.
Breakfast eaters also have another reason to smile. Eating breakfast in the morning helps keep tooth decay at bay.
A new study found that kids who do not eat breakfast are more likely to have tooth decay than kids who do. Why? Kids who skip breakfast tend to reach for sugary snacks during the day.
Experts say that if you find yourself crunched for time in the morning, don't rule out breakfast. Being creative with your morning routine can help you make time.
You might try planning your outfit the night before or getting up 10 minutes early. Some families even set the breakfast table before going to bed.
Leaving time for breakfast will give you the brainpower you need in school and will keep you going until the lunch bell rings. ""Breakfast really helps to start your engine!"" says Campbell.

George Washington and Abraham Lincoln are taking a step out of the history books. Two new presidential museums are using the cutting edge of technology to tell the stories of past U.S. presidents.
A group of students from nearby Rockledge Elementary School recently took a trip to Washington's home in Mount Vernon, Virginia. There, they saw a lifelike statue of Washington mounted on his horse during the Revolutionary War (17751783). The statue is an exhibit in a new museum at Mount Vernon.
""It was cool!"" 10-year-old Jack Eghtessad from Woodbridge, Virginia, told
describing the statue. ""It didn't look fake.""

or changing, the way kids learn about presidents. Recently, historians have started using more special effects to tell the stories of famous leaders. The new Mount Vernon museum has been open for only four months, but already it has drawn more than 90,000 visitors. February 19 will be the first Presidents' Day it is open.
Experts used paintings, historical documents, and the latest digital technology to create three statues of Washington for Mount Vernon. One of the statues shows Washington at age 19. Another statue depicts him at age 45, leading the Continental Army in the fight for
or freedom, against the British. The third shows him at 57, when he became the first U.S. president. (See
The museum is also home to a special-effects theater that plays a
or true-to-life movie, about Washington's life. As the film plays, the theater's seats rumble with the cannon fire of major battles. Fake snow even falls from the ceiling as the film shows Washington crossing the Delaware River in a surprise attack on the British military in 1776.
""We are, in a way, definitely on the cutting edge,"" says Ann Bay, the Mount Vernon museum's educational director. ""We were inspired by the Lincoln museum.""
Springfield's Lincoln museum reopened with new special-effects exhibits in 2005. Since then the museum has averaged more than 12,000 visitors a week. Visitors can see a life-size re-creation of Lincoln and his family, use interactive computer stations, and tour the ""ghost library.""
make it look as if ghosts of Lincoln and other historical figures appear in the room. Lincoln historian Thomas Schwartz told
that the special effects draw students into Lincoln's story. In one exhibit, visitors watch as an electronic ticker counts the more than 618,000 Americans who were killed while Lincoln was president during the Civil War (18611865). They see Lincoln's sad reaction to the huge death toll.
""These are real people that had real tragedy, real joy, and real emotion in their lives. People need to understand that,"" Schwartz says. He thinks that special effects help get that point across to visitors.
This life-size model of Washington at age 19 gives visitors a glimpse of the first U.S. president in his youth. Washington was born into a wealthy Virginia family. His first job was mapping out land. He then joined the British army and fought in the French and Indian War (17541763). During the Revolutionary War (17751783), he led the Continental Army against the British to win American independence. In 1789, he was elected the first president of the United States.
Unlike Washington, Lincoln did not have enough money to pay for school. This wax statue shows Lincoln teaching himself by reading between chores. He went on to become a successful lawyer, and in 1860 he was elected the 16th U.S. president. He led the country during the Civil War (18611865) between the states in the North and the South. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation ended slavery in 1863. He was killed in office shortly after the war ended.

The previous record was 69 on March 13, 1990. ""For this early in the year, its a heck of a deal,"" says weather expert Joe Schaefer. ""What happens after that is anybodys guess.""
After the thunderstorms caused the series of deadly twisters, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for Michigan and Indiana. If a

For many, there is no escaping the tornadoes wrath. ""It was over before you knew it,"" Greg Kospar of Bentonville, Arkansas, told reporters after the storm. ""The house is gone.""

""We thought we might find a handful of new species,"" says Joel Despain, a cave expert for the parks. ""It was amazing to find 27.""
Why had the cave creatures gone undetected? Though it is rare to find unknown animal species on Earths surface, the same is not true for caves. Like the deep sea, caves are difficult to reach and havent been explored as thoroughly as the surface.
Discovering so many unknown species was thrilling for Jean Krejca. She is a scientist with Zara Environmental, the Texas-based group that led the project. ""You get the feeling that youre Lewis and Clark, charting undiscovered territory,"" says Krejca. ""Caves are one of the last frontiers.""
This millipede is one of the less strange creatures scientists find in caves. Creatures are often blind and have no pigment.
The creatures are unique not only because they are found just in caves but also because some are found in only a single cave or a specific part of a cave. ""There are usually more creatures at the caves entrance because there is more food there,"" scientist Rob Myers of Zara Environmental told
""The farther back in a cave, the more you find creatures have adapted to cave life. What you find is more and more strange. The creatures are often blind and have no pigment.""
A creature such as the pill bug, for example, doesnt need pigment in its skin because it doesnt have to protect itself from the sun. And the daddy longlegs probably developed such big jaws to quickly grab prey, which is scarce inside caves.

Scientists will also study the new species to determine whether their populations are healthy. Cave animals can teach scientists a lot about the environment because the creatures are sensitive to changes in the
An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that interacts with the environment. If cave creatures decline, it could signal problems or changes in the environment.

That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
. The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
. A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
. That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
. Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's As Easy As One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
. The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
. The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
. We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.
? Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

School may be out for Muggles this summer, but class will be in full swing at Hogwarts. On July 13, the fifth Harry Potter film,
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,

the seventh and final book in the hugely popular series written by J. K. Rowling. Actor Daniel Radcliffe returns in the role of Harry. Daniel talked to

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,
Harry is sick of being famous. How about you?
I'm feeling pretty good. I don't think of myself as being famous. On the set, you're there to work. It's a very fun job to do, but it's a job, and you do it and that's that.
Like Harry, you're getting older. How well does the character reflect your experience growing up?
I think it's a very accurate portrayal in terms of Harry's confusion and fear of growing up, and the challenges he knows it's inevitable he will face. That's what Harry Potter is about for me. It's not magic. It's not good versus evil. It's about a loss of innocence, going from a little kid to a young man.
Speaking of good versus evil, fans begin to learn more about Harry's least favorite teacher, Severus Snape, with the forming of the Order of the Phoenix. Whose side do you think Snape is on?
That is the ultimate question. [What] if I go out and say deep down, he's a really decent chap, [and he turns out to be bad]? I don't want to commit myself.

31,"visits India and finds hope after tragedy
A year after the devastating tsunami that hit southern Asia, rebuilding efforts continue in full force.
Each day, 10-year-old Sarjm walks through the hot sand and past
the rubble where homes used to stand. He can see and even taste the ocean. The ocean used to make him happy. It provided fishermen like his father a way of making a living.
But on December 26, 2004, the ocean turned black and changed his village. It left behind destruction and fear. A memorial outside his school is a constant reminder of the 49 schoolchildren who lost their lives in the tsunami that struck on that date.
Debris of beach resorts washed away in the December 26 Indian Ocean tsunami at Khao Lak, Thailand, seen December 30.
The young boy talks about how his older brother and younger sister were both ""taken by the black wave."" Clapping his hands together, he told
Sadly, it is a story shared by thousands of other children. Sarjm lives in Kottapalli, a fishing village located at the southernmost tip of India. India was one of 12 countries devastated by last years tsunamione of the worst natural disasters in history. The series of gigantic waves, which resulted from an undersea earthquake, flattened coastlines and reduced fishing villages to rubble. More than 280,000 people died.
Now, one year later, many people are still homeless. But slowly, smiles are returning, and laughter once again rings through some of the fishing villages. Relief agencies have been working to help rebuild homes, schools, and lives with donations from people around the world.
Some of those donations came from American students who
or came together, to raise money to help people affected by the tsunami. From schools in small towns to those in big cities, students held bake-a-thons, participated in read-a-thons, and even sold their own belongings at garage sales. The pennies, quarters, and dollars are helping rebuild homes and bringing hope to children whose hearts and lives were shattered.
Nine-year-old Selso, who lives in a fishing village near Sarjms village, was one of those children. Before the tsunami destroyed his home, Selso, his sister, and his three brothers had never had a toilet or electricity in their house. Their house had only two rooms, and at night they all slept together on the dirt floor. ""We knew people who died, but my family was lucky,"" Selso told Weekly Reader. ""We only lost our home.""
Selsos mother used to worry about scorpions and snakes getting inside, but now all that has changed. Volunteers from Habitat for Humanity worked with Selsos family to construct a new home with electricity and plumbing. Habitat for Humanity volunteers build homes with families who have suffered. The organization plans to build 10,000 homes in the area during the next two years. ""This is the happiest day for my family,"" says Selsos dad, Michel. ""My children now have a safe, dry home where they can do their homework.""
With the help of relief agencies, some schools have also opened. Many are housed in temporary locations under thatched roofs. Classrooms are also beginning to receive textbooks and other much-needed supplies.
""When a school opens in a disaster zone, everyone feels a sense of hope,"" said Carol Bellamy, the executive director of the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), after the disaster. The U.S. Agency for International Development is another organization that has helped build playgrounds where children can enjoy new equipment.
As rebuilding efforts continue, many children remain terrified of the ocean. Volunteers have worked with Sarjm and other kids to talk about what happened. ""I was afraid to go back to the ocean,"" Sarjm says, ""but we were taught that the tsunami was very rare and would not happen again. I am not afraid to look at the water anymore.""
Why is it important to feel safe? What makes you feel safe at home? at school?
After the tsunami, countries in southern Asia began to put together a plan for a warning system in the Indian Ocean. Earlier this year, the U.S. government also announced a plan to improve the U.S. warning system by 2007. Under the plan, the number of devices that monitor waves from a tsunami will be increased. The warning system would provide an alert for U.S. coasts ""within minutes, and in some cases, within seconds of a tsunamis formation,"" according to scientist John Marburger.

Even though cell phones are a hot fad, some scientists are ringing an alarm about them. The scientists say that cell phones might pose a health threat.
In the United States, more than 90 million people use cell phones. Many of those people are kids. For kids, cell phones are about more than phone calls, says Anne Charlton of the University of Manchester in England. ""It's all about the cool factor,"" Charlton said. She added that a cell phone is not just about making calls, it's also a fashion statement.
Most cell phone users don't think about the health risks the phones might pose. Some scientists warn that cell phones give off radiation that might be harmful to users. One recent study shows that cell phone radiation might increase a person's chance of getting some kinds of cancer.
Other medical experts say cell phones don't pose a health threat. They point to studies that have not found any link between phone use and cancer.
Scientists say that people can protect themselves from cell phone radiation. One way is to use a headset instead of talking directly into a cell phone. Or, for an even simpler solution, people can make shorter calls.
When the first cell phones were sold, they all had the same ring. Today, most cell phones can be made to ring one of several different tones. But at least one cell phone manufacturer plans to change that.
Nokia plans to start making phones that play pop tunes when they ring. Users could choose tunes by the Spice Girls, Enrique Iglesias, Lenny Kravitz, and many other artists.
By choosing pop tunes instead of the standard ringing sound, cell phone users can program their phones to match their personalities and moods, explained a company spokesperson.

Past presidents aren't the first people to be depicted on $1 coins. Female leaders Susan B. Anthony and Sacagawea have appeared on the coins. Anthony dedicated her life to fighting for women's rights in the 1800s. Native American guide Sacagawea led explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on their westward journey to find a route to the Pacific Ocean.
The idea of rotating coin designs comes from the 50 State Quarters Program. Those quarters began circulating in 1999. The state quarters program has been very popular, introducing millions of people to coin collecting. The U.S. Mint hopes the presidential coins will be as successful.

489,"Going, Going, Gone! African Monkey Declared Extinct
In 1933, a discovery in Africa excited scientists around the world. They had found a
, or kind, of monkey that they had never seen before--the Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey. Now, only 77 years after it was found, that monkey is extinct, scientists recently announced.
No one has seen a Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey for more than 20 years. In 1988, scientists declared the monkey an endangered species. For the last seven years, scientists searched for the monkey in Ghana and Cte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), two countries in western Africa. They found no sign of the animal.
""If [the] red colobus were present near any of our survey routes, it is likely that we would have seen one,"" said scientist John Oates.
Scientists blame the animal's extinction on hunting and the destruction of the forests where it lived.
Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was the first primate --which includes monkeys and apes--to become extinct in nearly 300 years. But scientists say it will not be the last. They worry that many of the 600 other primate species may die out within the next 100 years. Twenty-five species may die out within ten to 20 years. More than 120 primate species may become extinct before the end of this century, said Ross MacPhee of New York City's American Museum of Natural History.
Endangered primates live in Africa, Asia, and South America. Many of those primates live in areas where people are poor and need to hunt for food to survive.
Scientists fear that unlimited hunting could kill off more primates. ""Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was eaten by people. The last ones probably went into someone's pot,"" said scientist John Terborgh.
MacPhee explained that the best way to help primates is to protect them and the areas where they live. ""As long as there are a few individuals, and as long as humans leave them alone, they'll come back [from near extinction].""

Another paleontologist agrees that T. rex was not built for speed. However, she argues that T. rex could have caught slow-moving prey. ""I think it was partly a scavenger and partly a hunter. It could have killed old or weak animals.""
The exhibit leaves it up to visitors to judge for themselves. Recently, a show of hands from a group of kids suggested it was likely a combination of killer and scavenger.
""The answer is that we will probably never be certain,"" said Horner. ""But as long as we keep asking the questions, we are serving science.""

Anyone who's ever had a toothache will tell you that it can be very painful. Since ancient times, humans have tried different ways to stop the rot. Here are a few:
Ancient Egyptians placed a live mouse on a person's gums to relieve a toothache. They believed mice could cure toothaches because the rodents have good teeth.
One ancient Roman author wrote that tying a frog to a person's jaw would make teeth stronger.
Ancient Romans believed that boiling earthworms in olive oil and then using the oil as eardrops would relieve a toothache.

Scientists think the ancient tool served double duty. They believe that people used the tiny spoon to clean their ears! The bristles were probably hog hairs.
Although the toothbrush has been around for several hundred years, people have been caring for their teeth since ancient times. In fact, some scientists say that ancient Egyptians used stalks of grass to clean their teeth. They also believe that people long ago used tooth powders made of charcoal to clean their teeth.

""What should I wear today?"" That's a question you might ask yourself in the morning. For some kids, the answer is the same every daya school uniform.

Uniforms would contribute to ""building pride within our school and community,"" Elmira Superintendent Raymond Bryant told

Elmira is one of many school districts across the country considering a uniform policy. Ten years ago, 3 percent of all public schools
or required, that students wear uniforms. By 2004, that number had risen to 14 percent. Some school officials support the policy, hoping that uniforms will encourage students to focus on their work. Opponents, however, say students should be allowed to express themselves through their clothing.
Uniforms make schools better places in which to learn, supporters say. They argue that dress codes often improve discipline and lessen bullying and teasing. ""I think [uniforms help] students focus on their academics and not the latest fashion,"" principal Megan Mannion told
Her school, Rankin Elementary School in Akron, Ohio, has had a uniform policy since 1995.
""The best thing I like about our uniform is the style, especially the shirts and sweaters,"" says Rankin fourth grader Clifton Harris. It's not just the look that makes the grade. Others argue that the new uniforms cut costs. ""You save money to buy casual clothes for home,"" adds Rankin student Asmar Epps.

Her classmate Wade Fleetwood agrees. ""Kids should be allowed to wear different styles of clothes.""
Some parents are worried about the expense. Elmira would offer uniforms at a price between $16 and $26. ""What's the school district going to do for people who can't afford them?"" asked one Elmira father at a recent public meeting.

The problem, said the scientists who work with Keiko, was that he wouldn't stay with the other killer whales, or orcas. Every time Keiko's handlers took him out into the ocean for a ""walk,"" he returned to his pen.

Sugary snacks and high-fat foods are on their way out as schools change their lunch menus.
School lunch will never be the same. Move
over, French fries, extra-cheese pizza, and chocolate chip cookies. Cafeterias in some schools across the country are making over their menus. Lunch trays are now filled with yogurts, sandwiches on whole-wheat bread, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Vending machines now offer nuts, bottled water, and granola bars.
In 2005, 17 states passed new nutrition laws to limit unhealthy food in schools. Texas removed deep-fried foods from school menus. Connecticut banned the sale of soft drinks and high-fat snacks in vending machines, school stores, and cafeterias. New Jersey passed one of the toughest school nutrition laws in the country. Next year, no schools in that state will be able to sell foods or drinks that list sugar as the main ingredient. Those items include candy and soda.
School officials and lawmakers say that cutting down on high-fat, high-sugar snacks in schools will encourage healthy eating. ""By no stretch of the imagination does it solve all the problems,"" says Connecticut lawmaker Donald E. Williams Jr. ""But its very important that we provide the right models in our schools.""
What is bringing about all the changes? More than 9 million children and teens ages 6 to 19 are considered overweight, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over the past 25 years, the percentage of overweight kids has tripled.
Studies show that obesity at a young age can lead to health problems later in life, such as diabetes and heart disease.
is the condition of being severely overweight. ""Childhood obesity just cant be ignored anymore,"" Julia Lear, director of the Center for Health and Health Care in Schools, told
School lunches arent entirely to blame for the obesity crisis, but many experts believe they are a good place to start. ""Schools play an important role in improving the nutrition of young people,"" says Lear. More than 26 million children buy lunch at school each day. Educators and lawmakers hope that providing good food choices in school will lead to making good food choices at home. (See ""

Not getting enough exercise is also to blame for kids putting on the pounds. Exercise burns calories. A
is a measure of the amount of energy from food. Kids today arent moving as much as they did in the past because they spend more time playing video games, watching television, and using computers.
Schools are becoming creative with physical education. Gym class isnt just about team sports anymore. Schools are finding new ways of encouraging physical activity in kids, from karate to yoga. Kids are also learning about physical fitnesshow to lift weights, monitor their heart rates, and keep food journals.
""A lack of physical activity is a huge problem in all parts of our lives,"" Sheryl Stanley of PEforlife, an organization that promotes physical education in schools, told
""Kids need to be active. Get out there and play.""
The U.S. government is helping kids get a handle on healthy eating. The U.S. Department of Agriculture released a new food pyramid to help kids make better food choices and encourage exercise. The pyramid focuses on a diet of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and calcium-rich foods, such as milk and cheese. It also recommends that kids eat only a small amount of oils and fats. The child climbing the pyramid reminds kids to do something active for at least 60 minutes each daybike ride, walk the dog, play a favorite sport, or dance!

When it comes to food, color rules! Bright fruits and colorful veggies are the key to a healthy diet. They provide the body with important nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, and help fight illness. Health experts recommend that kids eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day.

Many adults think that kids spend their money as soon as they get it. That may be true for some young people, but not for 9-year-old twins Gabriel and Dylan Greene.
For the past three years, Gabriel and Dylan have taken part in Save for America. Save for America is a program that teaches kids the importance of saving money. The program also teaches kids
Last year, 750 schools and 90,000 kids took part in Save for America. Combined, those kids saved $1 million. Since the program began 12 years ago, kids have saved nearly $50 million!
One of the schools that takes part in the Save for America program is Setauket Elementary School, Setauket, New York. Every two weeks that school has Banking Day. Nearly 200 kids from the school deposit money on Banking Day, including Gabriel and Dylan.
Each boy deposits about $5 in his bank account on Banking Day. So far, Gabriel has saved $350, and Dylan has saved $340.
The kids who participate in Save for America save money and learn valuable lessons that they will use for the rest of their lives. Dylan explained that he has learned that saving money for the future can help him obtain the things he wants and lead a better life as an adult.
Save for America also helps kids sharpen their math skills. Gabriel said the program has improved his skills, especially in addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
The kids who take part in Save for America can use their money for a variety of things. Gabriel recently withdrew some of his savings to buy a new scooter. However, he's saving most of his money for college.
Dylan also has reasons for saving his money. ""You should save up all the money that you need,"" he said, ""and you should give some of the money [to] the kids in America that need more [food, clothes and other necessities].""

Change is on the way for vending machines in New York City schools. Beginning in September, candy, soda pop, and other sweet snacks will no longer be offered in school vending machines.
It's not just vending machines that are getting a makeover. In a move to make cafeteria food more healthful, New York City schools will also cut the amount of sugar, fat, and salt in school lunches. That means beef ravioli, potato salad, ice cream, and macaroni and cheese might disappear from lunch trays.

School officials in New York City hope the changes will help students make more healthful choices. Other school districts around the country are also making similar changes. Some schools are even removing their vending machines.
Many schools use the money from vending machines to pay for sports and other programs. However, health officials say that schools don't need to remove vending machines if they offer more nutritious items in them.
Poor diets and lack of exercise have led to an increase in extremely overweight, or

Another study shows that about 20 out of every 100 third graders and 21 out of every 100 sixth graders in New York City are obese. Being overweight can lead to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.

Eight-year-old Mikia Kirton remembers the water rising as Hurricane Katrina hit the city of New Orleans. ""We had to swim out,"" she tells
. ""We had life jackets on."" Mikia stayed at shelters with her family before moving to Houston, Texas.
That was one year ago, but change is still a part of Mikia's everyday life. This year, she will live with her grandmother in Texas while her mother returns to work in New Orleans.

Mikia's family is one of many whose lives have changed since Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast. More than 1,000 people died in the storm. Many more lost their homes and had to move to other states.
Those who return home face the huge
or job, of rebuilding. New Orleans was one of the hardest-hit areas. Streets are still a mess. Homes are empty. Playgrounds remain closed.
Most of the city's schools were destroyed in the storm. About 55 of 128 schools are expected to reopen this fall. Some students will attend classes in trailers. They will be separated from friends who have not returned to New Orleans.
Some kids who returned to the city have helped with the repairs. As part of a summer program, they planted flowers in parks and built benches at bus stops. The kids also talked about what had happened. ""I am now used to a whole new lifestyle,"" 12-year-old Duriel Harris wrote in a journal. ""Every day now is different from my pre-Katrina days.""
Many of the kids in the summer program created projects about their lives. Here, Duriel Harris, 12, explains his family tree. His family is rebuilding their home. It was flooded with 6 feet of water from Hurricane Katrina.
Why might some families have chosen not to return to New Orleans?.

A recent study showed that extra sleep can help kids perform better in school.
Do you ever stay up late to play video games or watch TV? If so, you may want to think twice the next time. Experts say even one extra hour of sleep a night counts. A recent study showed that extra sleep can help kids perform better in school.
For two nights, a group of kids who took part in the study went to bed at their usual bedtime. Afterward, they were given tests for memory and attention span. Both of those things are important for learning in school.
On the third night, some kids went to bed one hour earlier than usual. Others went to bed one hour later. The next day, experts tested the kids again.
Here is what the experts found: The kids who slept an extra hour improved their test scores. Some kids did better by as much as two grade levels! The kids who lost an hour of sleep did not improve their scores.
Most third graders need at least nine hours of sleep each night, say experts. However, studies show that many kids are not sleeping enough. That can make it hard for kids to pay attention in school.
Going to bed early is not easy, experts agree. But its worth it! One extra hour of sleep may mean the difference between doing well and falling asleep in class.
Here are some tips to help you get a good nights sleep:
relax with quiet time before going to sleep.
go to bed at the same time each night.
eat a big meal or exercise right before bed.
drink soda pop with caffeine in the evening.

When people think of lightning, they generally picture it as a single bolt. However, scientists have recently reported that one flash of lightning often strikes in more than one place. It is common for lightning to fork, or split, and strike in two or more places, scientists say.
Lightning is a flow of electricity. A flash of lightning can heat the air around it to up to 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun!
When lightning heats the air around it, the air expands and makes a loud crashing sound-thunder. If you hear thunder, you are within striking distance of lightning. ""Anytime you hear thunder, you should immediately move to a safe area,"" said scientist E. Philip Krider. Safe places include a school, house, or car.
While it is unusual for people to be struck by lightning, it does happen. According to the National Weather Service, lightning causes nearly 300 injuries and 100 deaths in the United States each year.
Watching a lightning storm may be exciting, but it can also be dangerous. Just keep in mind the power of nature and watch from a safe place indoors.
Whether you are outdoors or indoors during a thunderstorm, it is important to stay safe.

and lower in fat. Nutrients give you energy and help your body stay healthy. Some foods that are good sources of nutrients are fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, such as brown rice and whole-wheat bread.
Nutritious foods can be fun and tasty!
A healthful diet is not the only way people can keep their bodies fit. The new guidelines say kids should exercise for at least one hour a day.
If you think eating healthful foods is boring, think again! Nutritious foods can be fun and tasty. Just ask the kids at Meadowbrook Elementary School in Fort Worth, Texas. They recently taste-tested foods, such as sweet potato pancakes and blueberry burgers.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture held the taste test. That group wants to help schools find ways to serve healthful foods and meet the new dietary guidelines.
""These new dietary guidelines represent our best ... advice to help Americans live healthier and longer lives,"" said one government official.
Experts say that kids are eating too much sugar. If you look at a food label, you might have trouble spotting the sugar. That's because sugar can have many different names. Here are some of them:
Why is it important to read food labels?

Astronauts are aiming for the moon again. This time, though, they plan to stay there. Astronauts hope to live and work on the moon by 2020, according to NASA. The U.S. space agency recently announced plans to build a base there.
At first, four-person crews will stay for a week. By 2024, they will be able to live there for as long as six months.
The base will most likely be built near the moon's north or south pole. The poles get the most sunlight. At those locations, the moon base would be able to use solar power. That is energy from the sun that can be used to create electricity.
The moon is the only place beyond Earth that humans have visited. At a distance of about 238,900 miles, the moon is Earth's closest space neighbor. So far, only 12 people have walked on the moon's dusty surface. Those astronauts traveled there on Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972.
NASA hopes the moon mission will kick off a new
or time period, of space exploration. Scientists say that living on the moon is the first step in preparing astronauts to travel to Mars. ""By demonstrating we can survive on another world for a long time, we build confidence that we can venture much farther from Earth and stay for longer periods of time,"" NASA official Michael Braukus told

Scientists hope the missions will answer questions about Mars. The spacecraft will take pictures of the planet. Some spacecraft will even collect samples of the soil on Mars to study. NASA first sent spacecraft to Mars in the 1960s. Since then, several spacecraft have landed on Mars. One of the most exciting landings happened in 1997, when
landed on Mars. Millions of people on Earth watched as it's tiny rover, Sojourner, wandered over the planet's surface.
Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is often called the Red Planet because it looks red from Earth. Mars looks red because its surface has lots of iron. The iron has rusted and turned a reddish-brown color. Sometimes, winds on Mars whip the reddish dust into the sky, turning the sky pink.
A dust storm whips across the Martian surface. Dust storms often form in the Martian spring. A dust storm forms when high winds pick up sand and blow it across the surface. Large dust storms can last for months and blanket the entire planet with the red dust.
Two dry riverbeds cut across the surface of Mars. Each riverbed is more than a half-mile deep. Scientists say the riverbeds formed when water suddenly gushed to the surface from inside Mars. The riverbeds might have formed billions of years ago, scientists say. Hundreds of dry riverbeds crisscross the Red Planet.
Valles Marineris is the largest canyon on Mars. It is nearly 2,500 miles long and about 4 miles deep. On Earth, it would almost span the distance between New York City and Los Angeles. (The Grand Canyon on Earth is only 227 miles long and 1 mile deep!) The volcanoes on Mars are larger than volcanoes on Earth. The largest Martian volcano, is about the same size as Arizona at its base.
Mars has ice caps at its north and south poles, much like Earth has. But Martian ice caps are made of water ice and frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. The polar ice caps grow in the winter and shrink in the summer. This photo shows the planet's south pole in summer.
One day on Mars is 24 hours long; one year is 687 days long.
Temperatures on Mars range from -220 degrees Fahrenheit (F) to 68 degrees F.
Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.
A person who weighs 50 pounds on Earth would weigh 19 pounds on Mars.

The last owner of the nickel was a man from North Carolina. When he died in 1962, he left the rare coin to his family. However, they thought it was a fake and kept it in a closet.

Bedbugs hide in homes across the country.
The insects can live in mattresses and couches. They come out at night to eat. While people sleep, the bugs drink their blood. The bites dont hurt, but they can cause itchy bumps.
Those bumps are popping up all over. About 95 percent of U.S. pest control companies reported battling bedbugs in the past year. That is according to the National Pest Management Association. A rise in travel might be one reason. Travelers might carry the bugs in their suitcases.

Officials arent taking the attacks lying down. New York made a law to
or stop, renters from moving into apartments that have bedbugs. That state also passed a law making schools tell parents about bedbug sightings.
Getting the word out is a good idea, Gangloff-Kaufmann told
The best way to get rid of bedbugs starts with prevention, she says.
Got bedbugs? Dogs can tell! Experts have trained pooches to use their powerful noses to sniff out the insects.
Peoples noses are too weak to find the scent. Dogs noses are much stronger. The dogs can locate the insects in just a few minutes.
Once pups find a bedbug, they sit down nearby. Then a pest control expert comes to get rid of the insects. Good dogs!
Why might the number of bedbugs grow quickly in big cities such as New York?

To prepare for the climbs, Erik spent more than 1,000 hours training each year. He walked on a treadmill every day. He also climbed stairs wearing a 100-pound pack on his back.
Erik climbs with the help of a team of climbers. He uses tracking poles to help him feel his way to the top of each mountain. ""I can't use my eyes, so I use my hands and my feet to feel what I'm doing,"" said Erik.
The mountains that Erik climbed are all different. Some are rocky. Others are covered in snow and ice. Although he cannot see, Erik can use his other senses to tell each mountain apart. ""My senses--the feel of the rock, the smell of the earth, the sound of the wind howling--are what make each mountain different and unique for me,"" he said.

Everyone knows helping others is a good thing - maybe even chimps! Scientists recently studied from Uganda. That is a country in Africa. The scientists did tests that show that chimps often help people or other chimps, even if they get nothing in return.
In one test, a person dropped a stick near a group of chimps. In most cases, a chimp handed the stick back to the person. Chimps care about other chimps too. In another test, a chimp handed over the stick when another chimp dropped it. The animals did not receive food or praise for their actions in either test.
The results surprised the scientists. They had long thought that humans are the only animals that help others. ""We've never seen this level ... of

A celebration is under way for Ben Franklin's 300th birthday. Way is he considered one of the greatest Americans of all time?
Put on your party hat! January 17 is the 300th anniversary of Ben Franklins birth. People across the United States will celebrate the ways this great American helped our country. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, events are taking place all year.
The main event is an exhibit called
Benjamin Franklin: In Search of a Better World.
It began in Philadelphia and will travel to four other states during the yearMissouri,Texas, Colorado, and Georgia.
""In his 300th year, we want people to understand why Ben Franklin is still so important,"" spokesperson Nicola Twilley told
""We want to bring him and his
to life."" A legacy is something passed on to future generations.
Why is Philadelphia making such a big fuss about Franklins birthday? In 1723,when he was 17 years old, Franklin made his home there. He worked to make life in that city better. In Philadelphia, he helped set up the countrys first hospital, public library, and volunteer fire department.
During the 1700s, Philadelphia was the center of American government. When Franklin was young, America was made up of 13 colonies ruled by England. Franklin helped America gain independence. He also helped write the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.
""Hes very inspirational,"" says Twilley. ""He came from a poor background. He had only two years of school. He made himself into one of the greatest Americans of all time.""
If you could interview Ben Franklin, what would you ask him? Why?
Ben Franklin only attended school from the ages of 8 to 10. But his love of learning lasted a lifetime.
Even at a young age, Franklin was a scientist and an inventor. At the age of 10, Franklin invented wooden swim fins to help him swim faster.
When he was 12 years old, Franklin worked in his brothers printing shop. Later, he opened his own shop.

Move over, Spider-Man! Now you don't have to be a comic-book superhero to creep up walls. Scientists have recently invented a powerful tape. Someday, people may be able to use it to climb walls.
To make the tape, scientists studied gecko lizards. The little lizards are great climbers. They can cling to smooth walls and hang from glass ceilings.
What is the secret to the gecko's power? A gecko has millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of its feet. The hairs create a natural force between the gecko's feet and the wall.
Scientists modeled the new tape after the feet of geckos. The tape is covered with billions of tiny plastic hairs. ""It's like Velcro,"" said one scientist.
It will be a long time before the sticky tape is ready for people to use. One scientist believes it may be ready in five years. Until then, the little lizards are still the climbing champions!

. However, no one knows exactly when that will occur. ""I would say it will be at least a year away,"" he predicted.
Until then, scientists will keep the public informed. ""If the volcano catches anyone by surprise, then we aren't doing our jobs,"" said Trusdell.
Mauna Loa is not the only volcano in the news. At the time
went to press, Mount St. Helens in Washington state was also awakening.
The last time Mount St. Helens erupted was in 1980. It was such a large eruption that it blew the top off the mountain. A new eruption would most likely be much smaller, say scientists.

The menu for koalas is always the sameleaves! They eat only the leaves of eucalyptus (yoo-kuh-LIP-tuhs) trees. Sound boring? Not to a koala! There are thousands of these trees in Australia. The only problem is that leaves from some trees can make koalas very sick.
How does a koala know which leaves to choose? Scientists recently discovered that koalas learn from experience. After eating leaves that make them sick, the animals use their sense of smell to remember to avoid that type of leaf.
Scientists were not surprised to learn that koalas
means ""to like better."" Large trees have more leaves and offer better shelter to koalas.
A mother koala sits in a eucalyptus tree and holds her joey.
A marsupial is an animal that has a pouch in which to carry its young.
It looks like a small pink jellybean.
After a joey is born, it crawls into its mother's pouch. The joey drinks only its mother's milk for the first six months.
However, no matter how large the tree, koalas will not eat from one that makes them sick. They would rather go hungry than eat leaves from these trees, say scientists.

Kids around the world will participate in Earth Day events. Some will clean up parks. Others will plant trees. What do you plan to do on Earth Day to help the environment?
One way to protect the Earth is to reduce pollution. Pollution occurs when people harm the air, land, and water. Most air pollution comes from the burning of fuels, such as oil, coal, and gas. The fuel is used to run cars and heat homes. Water and land pollution often come from chemicals and garbage.
Some Earth-friendly inventions help reduce pollution. These inventions conserve, or use fewer, energy and natural resources such as water. Take a look at some of these exciting inventions.
? An Earthship is actually not a ship at all. It is a house built to save energy and water. Earthships use solar power from the sun for heat and electricity.
Earthships are made from recycled material. Old tires, aluminum soda cans, and glass bottles are some common materials used to build Earthships.
Many people who live in Earthships also recycle their water. When it rains, they collect and filter the rainwater. The filter makes the water safe to use for drinking, washing, and cooking. The leftover water is saved for other uses, such as watering indoor plants.

""There was a big meadow full of willows, and it looked like there should be a moose standing there,"" Roger Shenkel told
Shenkel shared his idea with officials at the Colorado Division of Wildlife (DOW).
The DOW spent years studying Grand Mesa's habitat. A habitat is the place where an animal or a plant naturally lives. When officials decided that the area was suitable for moose, the DOW workers set out to find some of the animals to live there.
Utah needed more bighorn sheep because their numbers have dropped. In

Wildlife officials help solve the problem by moving animals to areas where they can find enough food. The map shows how moose and bighorn sheep were swapped this year to keep both groups of animals healthy.
Why was it important for officials to study Grand Mesa's habitat before moving the moose?

Experts think kites were first made in China more than 2,000 years ago. Legend has it that a Chinese farmer invented the kite. On a very windy day, he tied a string to his hat. He held the string to keep his hat from blowing away.
Traders from China spread kite flying to other parts of the world. ""Kites come in all different shapes and sizes,"" said Van Meers. ""Every culture is unique, and every culture has a different style.""
The kite gets its name from a bird of the same name. Kites are graceful, soaring birds with long, narrow wings. These birds were once common in England. In the 1600s, kids in England made toys that sailed through the sky when pulled with a string. When the toys moved, they looked like the gliding birds.

To migrate is to move from one area to another when the seasons change.
Whooping cranes are endangered. There are only about 380 of them in the United States. In the fall, whooping cranes in the North are supposed to migrate south for the winter. However, many whooping cranes dont know how. With so few birds, many baby whooping cranes dont have any adults to teach them how to migrate, explains Joe Duff. He is an Operation Migration pilot.
Thats where the trikes and costumes come in. Each October, pilots in Wisconsin dress up like whooping cranes and take to the skies. The young birds follow them because they think the trikes are whooping cranes leading the flock.
It takes about three months for the birds to reach the Southwith plenty of stops along the way. The pilots lead the whooping cranes to special

Oil can make animals sick if they swallow it. When oil covers an animal's fur or feathers, it can't swim, fly, or stay warm. If the oil is not cleaned off the animal, it could die.

Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Keep reading to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.

A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.

During the Vendee Globe voyage, MacArthur had to make repairs to her boat without losing time. She averaged ten naps a day, sleeping a total of just six hours a day. Once she awoke just in time to steer away from a giant iceberg looming 50 feet in front of her!
Those difficulties were nothing compared to the one MacArthur said she faced at the finish line. ""My life is here, home is on board
I just adore being at sea, and to suddenly stop this will not be easy at all,"" she said.

New roller coasters are getting bigger, faster, and scarier. Millions of kids and adults take these thrill rides each year. Some experts worry that the rides' sudden twists and turns are unsafe.
High-speed coasters whip riders' heads back and forth. One report blamed coasters for 13 brain injuries from 1995 to 2000. Another report says some people have nearly died from coaster-related brain injuries.
Recently, two scientists set out to learn if coasters really do cause brain injuries. They studied the effects of riding three of the fastest coasters in the United States. The scientists say the coasters' twists and turns are not fast enough to cause brain injuries.
""People take more than 1 billion rides on roller coasters each year. The reports on brain injury are few and not proven,"" said Douglas Smith. He is one of the scientists who did the new study.
Some experts do not think the new study proves coasters are safe-especially for kids. They say the scientists only studied how coasters affect adults, not kids. They want a new study.
Edward Markey is a government official. Recently, he asked a group of experts to include children in their next study about roller coaster safety. Results from that study will be reported next year. Roller coasters have to be studied to make sure that ""riders of all ages"" are safe, Markey said.
 The idea for the roller coaster began with the ice slide. It was invented in Russia more than 500 years ago.
 There are more than 1,400 roller coasters in the world today.

The NBA has brought back its old ball after trying out a new ball covered in synthetic material.
Shaquille O'Neal is happy, and it's not because he made a free throw. The basketball star is thrilled that the National Basketball Association (NBA) brought back the leather ball this month.
For the past few months, NBA players had to use a new ball. The ball was covered with a
or human-made, material. Many players had complained about the new ball. They said it didn't bounce as well as the old ball. The new ball also cut their hands.
David Stern, the head of the NBA, heard the players' complaints. Stern agreed the decision to use the new ball was rushed. ""The right thing is to listen to our players,"" he told
Scientists compared the two types of basketballs. Their study showed that the new ball was less bouncy. The biggest difference they found, however, was in the way the ball soaks up
The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture when the players sweat than the leather ball does. ""The surface becomes slick,"" Kaushik De, a scientist who helped lead the study, told
Now that the leather ball is back, many NBA players are relieved. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us.""
Basketball began in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts. Physical education teacher James Naismith (18611939) invented the game. At first, players tossed soccer balls into peach baskets. Open-ended baskets were not used until 10 years later. Until then, players had to fetch the ball from the basket every time they scored.

Scientists recently studied leatherback turtles in the Atlantic Ocean. Leatherback turtles are the largest species of turtle. They can grow up to about 7 feet long.
To migrate is to move from one area to another. Leatherback turtles spend most of their lives in the sea. They lay their eggs on land. Then they migrate back to the ocean.

Leatherbacks are named for their flexible, leatherlike shells. Other turtles shells are hard and bony.

Ian is a student at Parker Memorial School in Tolland, Connecticut. Recently, the school came up with a new way for kids to pay for lunch. The school put a special machine in the lunchroom. The machine is a scanner that reads fingerprints!
Students simply place a finger on the scanner. ""Then your name shows up on the computer for the lunch lady to see,"" Ian said. The scanner keeps track of the cost so parents can pay for the lunches. ""I like it because you don't have to take any money out of your pocket,"" said Ian.

""We'll be able to perform operations with these robots that have never been imagined,"" said Dr. Randolph Chitwood of North Carolina. Dr. Chitwood is working to see whether robots can be used safely in operations to replace people's heart valves.
During the new heart operation, a robot with three arms works at the operating table. A few feet away, a doctor controls the robot's arms with a computer. Three tiny holes are made in the patient's chest. The robot's arms fit through the small holes.
One of the robot's arms holds a tiny camera. The camera allows the doctors to see inside the patient's body. The other two arms hold small tools, such as scissors and needles.
Robots may help lower the risks of heart operations. A doctor's hand can sometimes shake slightly. Or sometimes, a doctor's hand can be too large to reach some areas of the heart.
But a robot's arms do not shake and can fit into tiny places. Because the robot can work through small holes, the patient's chest heals faster after the operation.

Brianna was one of 261 people recently sued by the music industry. Music officials said she had stolen about 1,000 songs because she copied and shared the songs without paying for them.
The music industry wants people to know that it is against the law to copy and share songs over the Internet. Music officials say that is just like stealing CDs from a store.
To avoid going to court, Brianna's mother paid the music industry $2,000. ""I am sorry for what I have done,"" said Brianna. ""I love music and don't want to hurt the artists I love.""

Allergens in the air arent the only problem. Kids food allergies have risen too. Between 1997 and 2007, the number of kids with food allergies jumped 18 percent. Eating milk products and eggs can give some children rashes. Those foods can even cause some people to have trouble breathing.
Whats behind allergies spread? Some scientists think our
dont have enough to do. Immune systems help our bodies fight germs. But kids today come in contact with fewer germs than their grandparents did. Thats in part because more medicine is available. Experts say that when our immune systems have fewer germs to fight, they can get confused. They attack other things, such as milk, instead.
Other scientists say hotter temperatures are to blame. They say the weather is warmer for longer periods now, so plants bloom longer. Plants release pollen (left), which is a common allergen.
Doctors do not know for sure whats making allergies increase. But they do know how to treat them with medicine. There is very good treatment for allergies, Nish says. No one should suffer with symptoms.
Dust and other allergens that float into your nose are in for a blasta cough or a sneeze, that is! Both are natural
, or responses, to help keep you from getting sick. Heres a look at the big bursts.
Sneezes start at the back of your throat. Each quick burst can force out up to 40,000 droplets of saliva. The tiny droplets travel at up to 300 miles per hour.
Coughs come out of your lungs. Each blast can push out 3,000 saliva droplets as fast as 50 miles per hour. Enough air comes out to almost fill a 2-liter bottle.
What might be some other reasons for the rise in allergies?

Antarctica is a big icy continent. It is around the South Pole. The South Pole is found at the bottom of Earth.
Penguins are birds. Emperor and Adelie penguins live in Antarctica. The penguins stay warm because they have feathers that are very small and close together. The feathers have oil on them. Cold water can't get through the feathers to touch the penguins' skin. Each year, penguins molt, or lose, their feathers and grow new ones.
Penguins can waddle faster than humans can walk.
Penguins like to line up and dive into the water again and again.
Penguins sometimes toboggan, or slide, on their bellies.
Penguins surf waves to get back to shore.
Weddell seals live in Antarctica. Weddell seals swim in the cold ocean water to catch fish and other ocean animals to eat. These seals don't chew their food. They swallow the food in big pieces.
Weddell seals stay warm because they have a layer of blubber, or fat. They also have a coat of thick fur. The fur keeps water from touching the seal's skin.

In July, wildlife workers rescued African penguins from Robben Island. Robben Island is in the Atlantic Ocean near South Africa. Workers took 14,500 oily penguins to a wildlife center. Each penguin was carefully washed. It took two people about an hour to clean the oil from each of the birds!
Workers took the cleaned penguins to the east coast of South Africa. The penguins were set free in the ocean and swam back to Robben Island. While the penguins were swimming home, workers had time to clean up the spilled oil.
Workers put a special device on a few penguins. The device sent information to a computer. The computer showed exactly where each penguin was on its 560-mile swim home.
Did you know that there are 17 kinds of penguins? Here are just a few:
The emperor penguin is the largest of all penguins. It stands about 4 feet tall and can weigh up to 100 pounds.
The little blue penguin is the smallest penguin. It is only a foot high and weighs less than 2 pounds.
The rockhopper penguin has yellow feathers on its head.

of San Francisco, California. (A pier is a platform built over water.) People like to look at boats tied up at the piers. They also enjoy watching sea lions that have made a home at one of San Francisco's piers.
San Francisco's Pier 39 is packed with sea lions. The sea lions sleep in the sun, bark loudly, and eat fish. (They don't always smell that great, however!)
Animal experts are not sure why sea lions first came to Pier 39. But the number of sea lions has grown each year since an earthquake hit San Francisco in 1989. Before the earthquake, only about 30 sea lions camped out at Pier 39. Now, the number of sea lions can be as high as 600!
Food to Eat and Room to Spread Out
Experts say the earthquake might have caused
, a type of fish, to swim closer to San Francisco than before. Herring is a favorite food of sea lions, so they might have followed those fish to shore.
Sea lions might also like the pier because they have plenty of room to spread out. The Marine Mammal Center, an organization that cares for sea animals, asked the city to protect the sea lions. Now the sea lions cannot be moved from the pier.
Sea lions can grow to be up to 8 feet long and weigh up to 850 pounds.
Sea lions can swim up to 20 miles per hour.
Sea lions usually live between 20 and 30 years.
Sea lions eat fish, squid, and octopus. They have about 36 teeth but like to swallow their food whole.

form in the air when it is very cold. Many ice crystals make a snowflake. A group of snowflakes creates a snowfall.
Before a snowflake reaches the ground, it goes through four steps.
1. Each snowflake begins as water droplets inside a cloud in the sky.
2. When the temperature freezes, the water droplets turn into ice crystals.
Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division.
3. As more water sticks to the ice crystal, it begins to change shape.
4. When many ice crystals stick together, snowflakes form and fall to the ground.
The shape of a snowflake depends on the temperature at which ice crystals form. These crystals bump into each other and stick together. That creates new shapes of snowflakes.
Snowflakes are usually less than half an inch across.
The largest snowflake ever measured was bigger than a childs hand!
Snow only looks white. It is actually clear.
No two snowflakes are exactly the same.

Kids in some countries must deal with problems like those. But a special worldwide organization is trying to help them.
UNICEF helps children around the world. One way it helps is by providing schools and supplies. Three of the countries where UNICEF helps with education are Colombia, in South America, Rwanda (ruh-WAHN-duh), in Africa, and Thailand (TIGH-land), in Southeast Asia.
Those countries are probably far from where you live. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to go to school in another country?
In Colombia, the government requires kids to go to school for at least five years. Some people are poor and must work hard to survive. Some children must quit school to help their parents earn money.
With UNICEF's help, Colombia's government is creating a special school for those children. The students learn at their own pace and attend when they can. They have a small library and a garden where they grow vegetables.
One or two teachers must teach all the students, from grades 1 through 5. Students of the same age work together in small groups, helping one another learn.
Children in Rwanda must go to school from ages 7 to 15. But there is not enough space in some schools in Rwanda to fit all the students. Some students cannot afford to buy the uniforms and notebooks they must have to go to school.
To help solve those problems, UNICEF has created a special program called Schools-in-a-Box. Each box contains school supplies, workbooks, and learning games. When teachers use the Schools-in-a-Box, kids can be taught wherever they are.
Children in Thailand must go to school for six years. Though school is free, some families cannot afford to buy the uniforms children must wear to school.
Some classrooms in Thailand have as many as 50 kids and only one teacher! Often, children of all ages are in the same grade. The children must share the few books and school supplies that are in the school.
But UNICEF is working to help these people. The organization has built Village Education Centers in parts of Thailand. At night, adults gather there and take classes. During the day, the buildings are schools for children.
UNICEF is an organization that works to help children all over the world. UNICEF tries to provide health care, nutritious food, clean water, and an education for all children. The organization raises money and talks to world governments about helping children.

507,"Summer is almost here! Why do experts say that summer is the most dangerous time of the year for kids? During the summer, most schools are closed. Kids have more time to play outside, ride bikes, and swim. That means kids have more chances to get hurt.
Playing outside gives you a chance to breathe fresh air, but it also exposes you to harmful sun rays. Harmful sun rays can cause sunburns. You can get a sunburn even if you are outside for a short amount of time. So when you are in the sun, always wear sunscreen. Use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher, and be sure to rub it evenly into your skin. You should also wear a hat and try to play in the shade.
Whether you ride a bike, ride a scooter, or use in-line skates, be wheel safe. The most serious way kids get hurt while on wheels is by hitting their heads. So always wear a helmet when you are playing on wheels. When you ride scooters and use in-line skates, always wear wrist guards, kneepads, and elbow pads.
What's the Right Way to Wear a Helmet?
A helmet should be straight on the head, just above the eyebrows.
The chin strap should be snug but not too tight.
The rear straps go behind the ears; the front straps should run up and down.
One way to beat the summer heat is by swimming in a cool pool. To stay safe when you swim, you need to follow water-safety rules. Be water safe by swimming only when a grown-up is nearby. You should always swim with a buddy.
How else can you be safe this summer?

A teenager recently discovered the skull of a huge prehistoric bird in Argentina, a country in South America. Scientists say the 10-foot-tall bird had a sharp, hooked beak and thin legs. They think that the bird probably ate animals as large as sheep and ran fast.
The big bird belonged to a group of birds called ""terror birds"" that once lived on Earth. ""It is an unbelievable creature.

Sometimes people drop cigarette butts on the ground. Many beaches in the United States are littered with cigarette butts. When beach cleanups are held, cigarette butts are picked up more often than any other kind of trash.
Cigarette butts can be dangerous. Cigarettes have hundreds of poisons in them. Scientists worry that the poisons could pollute the ocean water.
Cigarette butts can also harm animals. Seabirds will try to eat cigarette butts. The birds think the butts are food. The butts get stuck in the birds' stomachs and make them sick.
Every day, about 3,000 kids start smoking.
The average age a kid starts smoking is 13.
About 46 million adults in the United States smoke.
Smoking-related illnesses kill about 500,000 people each year.
Smoking one cigarette takes about seven minutes off the smoker's life.
On November 16, kids across the United States will scream their lungs out. That's when the Great American SmokeScream will happen. The kids will tell people not to smoke.

Green sea turtles can weigh more than 300 pounds and grow to about 3 feet long. They can live for a long timeup to100 years! Most green sea turtles eat plants.
Clown fish have trouble hiding because they are so bright. To stay safe, clown fish live near poisonous sea animals. Those animals look like plants.
Dugongs are plant-eating sea animals. They live near some coral reefs. Dugongs have whiskers and round faces. They are sometimes called sea cows.
Moray eels are ocean fish that have long, slim, snakelike bodies. They hide in tiny holes throughout coral reefs. Moray eels eat small fish and octopuses.
Hammerhead sharks have wide, flat heads. They grow to more than 10 feet long. Hammerheads have triangle-shaped teeth with sharp bumps for chewing food.
Regal angelfish live near safe caves of coral reefs. They are brightly striped fish. Angelfish usually swim in pairs. They eat sea sponges or tiny coral reef animals.
Coral reefs are formed by tiny ocean animals called

By the end of the fall, the bears start to hibernate in dens, which are caves or openings in the ground. They breathe slower and their hearts beat slower.

is a powerful, spinning wind. It is also known as a twister.
Most tornadoes last fewer than 15 minutes. During that time, a twister can travel across a large area of land and destroy everything in its path.
The strong winds in some tornadoes reach speeds of up to 300 miles per hour. Those winds can toss cars and other objects high into the air.
Tornadoes can happen any time of the year. However, they are most common from March through July.
A tornado can destroy homes and trees.
Most tornadoes start as thunderstorms. During those storms, heavy rain and lightning are common. Large
, or ball-shaped pieces of ice, may also fall.
Large thunderstorm clouds appear in the sky. The clouds become dark. Thunder can be heard.
Warm and cold air meet. Air rises from the ground to the clouds. If the rising air starts to spin, a funnel-shaped cloud can form.
The funnel-shaped cloud spins faster. When the bottom of the cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.
As the tornado travels across the ground, it picks up anything in its way.
