The 'S' of SEMI stands for 'Subject'. Subject is the first element of the SEMI approach.
The words you use to describe the subject matter of a piece of art, craft or design work will depend on the individual work. Below are lists of descriptive words that you could use:
- man, woman, child, groups of people, royalty, religious figures, families, people in love, people at war
- everyday life, worship, at war, working, sleeping, posing, storytelling
- the still life, everyday objects, food and drink, plants, the landscape, personal belongings, religious artefacts, symbols and signs
- colours, shapes, geometric, patterns, suggestive, mood, emotion, dark, light, powerful, subtle
- sculptural, decorative, functional, vase, bowl, cup, plate, jewellery, necklace, bracelet, earrings
- Square, circular, long, tall, short, interlocking
- flowers, stems, petals, flowing, curving, interlocking, curved
- clothes, shoes, hats, jewellery, furniture, houses and buildings, bridges, fabric, wallpaper, designs for print, logos, posters

Numerical data can be entered onto a spreadsheet for analysis
If you want to ask people's opinions and also analyse results in a spreadsheet, it's best to give rate answers. For example:
'My life is dependent on my mobile phone'.
Rate the statement from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree).
It is best to avoid questions that give a range as the answer, as these are hard to analyse. For example, it is better to ask How much pocket money do you get?, and get a single value than to give the respondent a range of values such as 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 5, more than 5.
Test your survey and spreadsheet on a couple of people first, before you try doing the whole thing. That way you can make sure that both parts work well, and that you do not waste any time. It is a good idea to get a maths teacher to check over your survey to see if they have any suggestions on how it can be improved.

When waves meet a gap in a barrier, they carry on through the gap. However, the waves spread out to some extent into the area beyond the gap. This is
You should know that the amount of diffraction depends on the
The length of a single wave, measured from one wave crest to the next.
The extent of the spreading depends on the
of the waves. The smaller the width of the gap compared with the wavelength of the wave, the stronger the diffraction. For example, when waves spread into a harbour, they spread out more if the harbour mouth is narrow.
Sound can diffract through a doorway or around buildings. Lower pitched sounds travel better than high-pitched sounds. This is because low-pitched sounds have a long wavelength compared with the width of the gap, so they spread out more.
Ultrasound is sound with a high frequency. It has a very short wavelength compared with most gaps, so there is very little spreading. This makes sharp focusing of ultrasound easier, which is good for medical scanning.
Light has a very short wavelength compared with most everyday gaps such as windows and doors. There is little obvious diffraction, so it produces sharp shadows.
Long wave radio signals are much less affected by buildings and tunnels than short wave radio signals or VHF radio signals. Because of diffraction, radio signals can sometimes be received in the shadow of hills.

She says the storm is like an old tongue and a blinding illumination. It makes the trees fall heavy as whales. In line 27 she says Tropical Oya of the Weather. The storm is a mystery to her.
lots of close quotation of relevant phrases, which is good
no hint of why these phrases are significant

The way Grace Nichols describes the storm shows what it means to her as a Caribbean woman living in England. On the one hand, she emphasises all the destruction which it causes. The wind is 'raging' angrily, it's as if it has come to take revenge for something. She seems to feel sorry for the ancient trees which have been uprooted. All this makes the wind 'fearful' to her, as to any inhabitant of the 'English coast'. But at the same time, to her it is 'reassuring' because it is from 'back home', something old from the past, an ancestral spectre which reminds her that the other part of her life, the Caribbean is still there, still important to who she is. The last part of the poem becomes excited in tone, the way she feels she is 'riding the storm', as if the power of the wind has become her power. Something in her had been frozen over in England, like a 'frozen lake', but it's now been 'unchained' by the hurricane.

""suff'rance is the badge of all our tribe.""
He is verbally abused and bullied by most characters in the play and is called cruel names including
""villain with a smiling cheek, cut-throat dog, bloody creditor, damned inexecrable dog""
He is very astute and is aware of other people's concerns - he knows all about Antonio's business ventures.
""I hate him for he is a Christian; / But more, for that in low simplicity / He lends out money gratis.""
So, why does he make such a strange agreement with Antonio, asking for a pound of Antonio's flesh instead of interest if the loan is not repaid within the arranged time? Does he genuinely want to be friends with Antonio when he says
""I would be friends with you, and have your love?""

We see him being impatient with her and ordering her around. When she runs away, he seems as upset about the loss of his money as her:
""My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter! ... My ducats and my daughter!""
It would seem that Shylock cares for money more than anything else. Yet in an often forgotten moment When Shylock finds out his daughter traded his wife's ring for monkey he cares only for its sentimental value.
""Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my turquoise; / I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor: / I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.""
Perhaps it is the loss of Jessica as well as all the harsh treatment he has suffered from Antonio - and others - over the years that makes him bitter enough to ask for Antonio's pound of flesh.
He cleverly argues in Act III, scene 1 that he is as much a man as a Christian is and so will follow the example the Christians set by seeking revenge.
""The villainy you teach me I will execute.""
He is thrilled to hear that another of Antonio's ships is lost, making Antonio more vulnerable.

Caught out by Portia, by the end of the trial he has lost all his money and has to suffer the humiliation of being forced to become a Christian. Shakespeare doesn't give Shylock any lines to tell us how he feels. How should he react? We never find out what happens to him.

Think about how the poet uses helps to convey his ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is blunt and explicit. The poem is about a storm on an island. Yet because there is no article ('The' or 'A') before the title, there is a sense that Heaney is not writing about one storm in particular, but about many similar storms. It is an experience he is used to.
The poem is written in the present

Heaney speaks in a friendly tone to draw us in. He uses common conversational tags -

Lines in a poem or play that run on from one to another without pause or punctuation.
. Look carefully at the line endings to see the effect enjambment creates. For example:

, (line 15/16) where the surprise of finding

Despite the confident start, by the end of the poem Heaney admits being afraid:
""it is a huge nothing that we fear""
(line 19). Perhaps this suggests that the ultimate power of the storm is that it is an unknown quantity. No one knows what the wind will do and what each storm will bring. Are such fears justified?

. We see three sets of lovers get together and almost see a man murdered on stage. There is much deception and disguise. The ending is full of celebration for most but despair for Shylock. So, what happens to create so many dramatic contrasts? How is the drama maintained and the audience involved?
The sequence of events in a narrative; a story
are woven together in such a way that we are often left on a mini cliff-hanger, wondering what will happen next. It's just like in a soap opera: we jump from place to place, picking up the story each time. Here are just some examples:
We hear about the Prince of Morocco in Act 1, scene 2, are introduced to him in Act 2, scene 1, but do not see him choose a casket until Act 2, scene 7!
We are primed about the vulnerability of Antonio's ships from Salarino's comment about
the harm a wind too great might do at sea
which is reinforced when Shylock talks of
pirates - and then there is the peril of waters, winds and rocks
. From then on the bad news dribbles in at intervals: Salarino tells Solanio of the loss of
a vessel of our country richly fraught
in Act 2, scene 8 - but we do not yet know that this is one of Antonio's ships; by Act 3, scene 1 rumours of more wrecks are circulating - but it is not until Act 3, scene 2 that we know for certain that every one of Antonio's fleet has been lost.
Antonio takes the bond lightly; but Bassanio is suspicious of it from the start:
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind
. This sets the audience wondering about what its consequences might be.
In Act 2, scene 9, the Prince of Arragon follows the Prince of Morocco to choose a casket, but also fails. We now know that it must be the lead casket that contains the prize, so when we hear moments later that Basanio has arrived we are on the edge of our seats to see which casket he will pick.
Tension mounts as Shylock continues to demand his pound of flesh and it seems that the laws of Venice will let him have his way. This reaches its height in the trial scene: Shylock even sharpens his knife in anticipation. Will Antonio live or die?
""'Nearest his heart'. Those are the very words.""

A type of drama in which characters undergo suffering or calamity, and which usually ends with a death. A sad or catastrophic event causing suffering or death.
. For example, Act 2 is made up of lots of short scenes that rush us through the story of Jessica and Lorenzo's elopement. In contrast, Act 4 is one long scene taken up almost wholly by the trial, in whose complexities and emotions we are quickly caught up.
""He was wont to call me usurer: let him look to his bond.""
There is a lot of hostility between the Christians and the Jews of Venice, and this of course fuels the hatred between Shylock and Antonio. There is verbal abuse between the two groups. Shylock is keen to commit murder in the cutting out of the pound of Antonio's flesh.
But the conflict is balanced to some extent by comedy. We can laugh at Lancelot's trick on his father, Gobbo, and at the bawdy jokes.

arises from the scenes involving disguise and deception. We, the audience, are aware that Lancelot is deceiving his old father, that Jessica dresses up as a boy, and that Portia and Nerissa are really Balthazar and his clerk. It's amusing because we know more than the characters on stage.
As well as the main characters who people the various plots of the play, there are some 'commentator characters' like Solanio and Salarino, who fill in as
Tellers of a story; the 'voices' in a text that describe or narrate the events of the plot; either characters in the story, or one ore more authorial voices who relate but take no part in events.

. Think about Jessica in Act 3, scene 2, when she arrives at Belmont with her new husband: how is she feeling? And how does Shylock react at the end of the trial scene (Act 4, scene 1)? A broken, grovelling Shylock would mean a very different ending from a defeated but defiant Shylock.
The act starts in moonlight and ends as morning comes. Why is this?
It sets up Portia's comparison of the light of Belmont, shining in the darkness, to a good deed shining
. Belmont represents the light of love and harmony.
The move from the darkness to dawn is a itself a powerful
An image or thing (usually something physical, like a flag) that stands for or represents something else - usually something abstract, like a nation. A crucifix is a symbol of Christianity.
Portia promises to the characters on stage that she will answer all things faithfully at a later time, but we never see this happen, leaving a few unanswered questions. We may also have questions of our own:
How and when did Portia find out about Antonio's ships?
What do we feel about the way Shylock was treated?
How likely is it that Jessica and Lorenzo will be happy together?

In many developing countries farmers cannot obtain or cannot afford to pay for synthetic fertilisers. They use other methods of agriculture to provide nutrients for their crops. This may include the use of manure, crop rotation or slash and burn agriculture. In slash and burn farming, areas of forest are burned and the ground used to grow crops for a few years until nutrients run out. Generally these methods lead to lower yields of crops.

The main improvements introduced in the 1830s, which were the main characteristics of High Farming, covered fertilisers, drainage and steam power coupled with support from government initiatives.
Illustration of a bird with guano (bird droppings)
- a scientist called Sir John Lawes started the production and use of phosphate fertilisers and super phosphates, which were initially by-products of industrial processes. The other most commonly used fertiliser from the 1830s onwards was guano (bird droppings) from the Andes Mountains in Peru. Soil in Britain became richer and produced higher yields as a result.
- new steam-operated machines were invented that could lay drainage pipes in straight lines. These drainage pipes cleared water from flooded fields and subsequently improved the quality of agricultural land in Great Britain.
- steam became the new method of powering farming machinery, which made the agricultural process more efficient. Examples of new steam-powered machinery included ploughs, seed drills, threshing machines and from 1852 onwards, steam-powered reapers. Unfortunately, most of these new steam-powered machines were invented in America and were not practical for use on the smaller enclosed British fields in the late 19th century.
- for the very first time, the government gave out 28 million in loans to help farmers use these new techniques and ideas on their fields. The government also forced remaining open land to be enclosed.

in this play. It is held up as an ideal, especially in Portia's famous courtroom speech:
The quality of mercy is not strained:
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven.
Upon the place beneath. It is twice blessed:
It blessed him that gives, and him that takes.
Shylock on the other hand is determined to get revenge on Antonio. Even when offered money his hatred and need for revenge are paramount.
My deed upon my head! I crave the law,
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
We see here two differing ideas about the relationship between mercy and justice. In Elizabethan times Portia would have been seen as representing the Christian idea of mercy. The
advocates that Christians should ""turn the other cheek"" rather than exact revenge from the the person who has wronged them. Shylock's view of justice is the complete opposite: it is ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" - which interestingly is an idea of justice which can be derived from the
Shylock also believes that Christians are hypocritical about their mercy - that in reality they are as keen on revenge as he is:
""If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge!""
(Do you agree with Shylock's argument? Shylock has clearly had experience of a Christian 'justice' which discriminates against Jews.)
The end of the play could be interpreted as underlining Shylock's point. Portia makes a very persuasive speech about mercy, yet when it come to deal out justice, she is less generous than her words. She emphasises that Shylock shall have
- and catches him out as she knows the law better than he does. Portia refuses to let Shylock back out of the deal, saying
""He shall have merely justice and his bond.""
Just as Shylock missed his chance to be merciful, so Portia comes back with the full weight of the laws against him and shows no mercy. Having begged Shylock to show mercy to Antonio, she seems less than merciful to him. So - to what extent does Portia actually demonstrate
Here are some other questions to ask yourself about Justice and Mercy in the play:
To what extent do the Duke and Antonio show
to Shylock at the end of the trial? The law states that Shylock can be put to death for plotting against a Venetian and his wealth confiscated. The Duke allows him his life, and Antonio allows him to keep his half of his wealth -
Antonio forces him to become a Christian and makes him bequeath his fortune to Jessica and Lorenzo.
Do you think that it is just that a Christian court should try a Jew?
The Duke, officially in charge of trying the case, is obviously on Antonio's side: at the start of the trial he sympathises with Antonio, saying that Shylock is
""an inhuman wretch, / Incapable of pity, void and empty / From any dram of mercy.""
Given that attitude, is it ever likely that Shylock will get a fair hearing?
in a broader sense. For example, you could ask yourself whether it was just that Portia's father prevented her from marrying someone of her choice, or whether Portia and Nerissa were fair to trick Bassanio and Gratiano with the rings.

2307,"This exercise will help you with questions which ask you to look at a source in context. You need to understand how a question is phrased to answer it well in your exam.
Typical exam questions about source material might be:
Use the source and your own knowledge to explain what Source A tells you about...?
How does Source B help you understand...? Use the source and your own knowledge in your answer.
Read the source below and the exam question that goes with it.
Last summer in the hot weather, when the smell was sickening and the flies were thick, there were a hundred people a day coming to the dump. A widow who used to do housework and laundry, but now had no work at all, fed herself and her 14 year old son on garbage.
Use the source and your own knowledge to describe the effects of the Great Depression on the people of the USA.
Now read these two answers to this question - which do you think is better?
In the Depression some people were so poor that they had to live on the rubbish dumps. People who had no work got food for their families from the dump.
The depression meant factories closed down and lots of people were put out of work (12 million by 1932). Some left their homes and lived in Hoovervilles. Farmers left their land and moved west to try to find work in California.
? It certainly has more facts about the Depression. But read it again. Does it refer to the source at all? No it doesn't; it seems to have been written without reading it. It would get more marks than answer 1 but not top marks.
Answer 1 used information from the source in another way but does not use further knowledge of the Great Depression to improve the answer.
Use the source and your own knowledge to describe the effects of the Great Depression on the people of the USA.
You are being asked to bring two things together -
Look at this answer below, which combines the two requirements.
Some people in the USA were hit so hard by the Depression that they went and lived off the rubbish dumps. With no dole or social security they had to do this or starve. There were 12 million unemployed by 1932. This was because demand for goods had fallen so much that factories had closed.
Remember to use both the source and your own knowledge.
Then add in what you can remember about the historical background which would help you understand the source better.

Tu peux aller  la gare s'il te plat? Tu peux apporter le sac le 25 aot, d'accord? Merci!
Philip has written a letter without any mistakes and he would get a grade C for this effort.
Look at all the tasks that Philip completed to get a C grade for his answer. The question asked him to:
say where he had lost the rucksack
say how he had lost the rucksack
ask his friend to check at the railway station
He has also looked carefully at the pictures and realised that:
the first train was going to Paris
since he was going to Cherbourg for the boat, he had to change trains at Folligny
the rucksack was quite big and that it had clothes in it
Philip has written short sentences and has remembered the basic rules, for example:

and he also remembered which verbs take the verb

This time Philip would have definitely got an A for this effort. Let's look at why:
Philip has answered all the questions in the task.
He has written more complex sentences and joined shorter sentences together with words such as
'J'ai chang de train  Folligny. Je suis descendu du train. Je n'ai pas pens au sac' becomes: 'J'ai d changer de train  Folligny et je suis descendu du train sans penser au sac'.

means 'to realise', and he has learned the

Female homesteader, contemplating her life on the Plains
Early settlers and homesteader on the Plains faced huge problems. The burden of many of these fell on the women, whose lives were burdensome and unpleasant:
There was little wood to build log cabins.
Settlers built 'sod houses', while they lived out of doors - people did their cooking on an open fire.
Outdoor toilets and open wells. The sod houses leaked, and fleas and bedbugs lived in them 'by the million'. It was impossible to disinfect the floor. As a result the death rate, especially from diphtheria, was high.
A 'good thick coat of whitewash' killed bedbugs. 'A layer of clay' stopped leaks. Homesteaders eventually built more modern houses.
There was no wood for fuel, and no shops to buy items such as candles and soap. A typical household had only two buckets, some crockery and one cracked cup. There was no water and little food.
A travelling shoe-maker or tinker might pass through who would provide or mend household items, but usually families just had to make do. The women collected 'buffalo chips' for fuel, stoked the stove, and made their own candles and soap. 'I have often wondered how my mother stood it', wrote an early settler.
No doctors or midwives. No social life 'because of the distances between farmhouses'. In the winter families were shut in 'and longed for spring'.
People had to make the most of any trip to their nearest town, where the women talked of the harvest and the men smoked corncob pipes and talked politics.
Local government was non-existent, and some early lawmen (such as Henry Plummer) were worse than the bandits.
Law courts and sheriffs such as Wyatt Earp slowly established law and order.

How would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment Do not kill? They would try to make sure that they were not involved in any killing, which would affect their views on issues such as war, abortion and euthanasia. They would say that these actions are wrong in all circumstances.
If you believe in relative morality you would agree that different courses of action might be needed in different situations.
How would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment Do not kill?

Stars form from massive clouds of dust and gas in space.
Gravity pulls the dust and gas together.
As the gas falls together, it gets hot. A star forms when it is hot enough for nuclear reactions to start. This releases energy, and keeps the star hot. The outward pressure from the expanding hot gases is balanced by the force of the star's gravity. Our sun is at this stable phase in its life. Gravity pulls smaller amounts of dust and gas together, which form planets in orbit around the star.

6802,"A real challenge with any religion comes when people ask, 'Why do you believe?' The answer is not often very easy to give as an undeniable 'truth', but that's because there is a difference between religious belief and other beliefs.
People talk about truth in five different ways.
This is the sort of truth that we can find in pictures, novels or films. We are not saying that what we are looking at, reading or watching is actually true. However, we might say that it is 'true to life'. By this we mean that it is believable - it could happen - although it is not actually true itself.
This is quite straightforward. We can say that we 'know' that something happened in the past even though we were not there and did not see it for ourselves. We know that it happened because we have seen
, such as archaeological or films or documents, and from this evidence we can know that certain things happened.
When we talk about moral truth we mean that we 'know' that something is right or wrong. This is almost like an
. We know that it is wrong to steal or to kill people. We may also know that we will be punished in some way if we do this but we are saying that we know
that this is wrong anyway. This sort of truth is linked with the moral argument for the existence of God.
Scientists can only say that something is true if they can prove it by
; they have to be able to show that each time they conduct the experiment the same thing happens. When the same result is obtained from an experiment that is repeated over and over again, this is known as
evidence and is the basis of scientific truth.
This is the sort of truth which we find in religion. This sort of truth deals with
. People may say that they 'know' God but they cannot prove it in a scientific way and, unlike some of the other sorts of truth, it is very difficult to persuade other people if they are sceptical or do not believe themselves.
People who follow a particular religion may say that by doing so they are
the 'real truth' about life and about God. This definition of truth is linked with the argument from experience.
One of the problems is that often people from different religions claim that they have the truth and that other people do not. This is a difficult situation because it may be almost impossible to convince other people that you are right.

6825,"Explain the reasons for the downfall of Terence O'Neill.
Teacher's notes: This question is worth 6 marks in the exam. Give yourself 7 - 8 minutes to answer it.
Mark Scheme: In History you are marked by levels. The higher the level the more marks you get and so the higher grade you will achieve.
The answer will be general providing some information related to the question but it will not adequately explain the reasons for O'Neill's resignation.
The answer will discuss some of the reasons for the downfall of O'Neill but lack sufficient depth.
The answer will show that the candidate is aware that O'Neill had lost the support of both nationalists and unionists and it will clearly outline the reasons for this.
Terence O'Neill was Prime Minister of Northern Ireland from 1963 to 1969. He led the Unionist Party during these years. He brought in many reforms which did not really satisfy nationalists who wanted major changes. There were protest marches and street violence during the years 1968 and 1969 and as a result O'Neill resigned in April 1969.
Paul would get a level 1 for this answer. The candidate's answer is too general. Some reasons for O'Neill's downfall have been included but these needed to be explained more fully.
Terence O'Neill was forced to resign in 1969. He had lost the support of nationalists and unionists over his government's handling of the Civil Rights Movement and the protest marches which they had organised. Although O'Neill had brought in a Five-Point Reform programme and had sought to improve relations with the Republic of Ireland, nationalists felt his reforms did not go far enough. Following some bomb explosions in 1969 he resigned.
Glenn would get a level 2 for this answer. The candidate has provided an answer of reasonable quality but it lacks balance. It provides some reasons to explain why nationalists were unhappy with O'Neill's leadership but fails to explain why many unionists were also dissatisfied.
Terence O'Neill resigned in April 1969 having lost the support of many nationalists and unionists. As early as 1965 Dr. Ian Paisley, following O'Neill's meetings with the Irish Taoiseach Sean Lemass, had started an ""O'Neill Must Go"" campaign. Many unionists had become increasingly unhappy with O'Neill's reforms which they saw as concessions to nationalists and they felt he was taking N. Ireland closer to a United Ireland. He had major critics, Faulkner, Craig and Chichester-Clark within his own Party, who disagreed with him over his reforms and resigned from his government.
O'Neill was also heavily criticized by nationalists for his reluctance to bring in reforms such as ""One Man, One Vote"" and for his Government's handling of the civil rights marches in October 1968 and January 1969 when marchers had been attacked.
His growing unpopularity was clearly revealed by the limited support shown for pro-O'Neill candidates in the February election of 1969. Following some UVF explosions at water pumping stations in the spring of 1969, O'Neill decided to resign.
Nuala would get a level 3 for this answer. The candidate has produced a high quality response. It clearly outlines how O'Neill had alienated many nationalists and unionists and reveals that the campaign to oust him had started as early as 1965. It also explains how the lack of support for O'Neill had become very evident in the early months of 1969.

. The different names all mean the same thing, but are used in different parts of the world. If these huge storms start in the Atlantic off the west coast of Africa, they are called hurricanes.
In an average year over a dozen hurricanes form over the Atlantic Ocean and head westwards towards the Caribbean, the east coast of Central America and the southern USA (Florida in particular). Hurricanes may last as long as a month and although they travel very slowly - usually at about 24 km/h (15 mph) - wind speeds can reach over 120 mk/h (75 mph).
Map showing route of hurricane Mitch, 1998
Hurricanes need a lot of heat to form and a sea surface temperature of at least 26 degrees, which is why they usually occur over tropical seas. They also need to be between 5 and 20 degrees north or south of the equator. It works like this:
Warm air rises quickly, causing towering clouds, heavy rainfall and intense low pressure.
The low pressure sucks in air, causing very strong winds which spiral - anti-clockwise in the northern hemisphere - around the centre of the low, at speeds of around 120 km/h (75 mph).
Seen from above, hurricanes are huge circular bodies of thick cloud around 450 km (300miles) wide. The cloud brings heavy rain, thunder and lightning.
, about 45 km across (30miles) across. Often there will be no cloud in the eye. Seen from below it will seem calmer, with a circle of blue sky above. The eye is formed because this is the only part of the hurricane where air is sinking.
In the northern hemisphere, the prevailing easterly tropical winds tend to steer hurricanes toward land - although their course is unpredictable. As hurricanes move inshore, their power gradually reduces because their energy comes from sucking up moist sea air.
Preparation and prediction techniques can be very different in MEDCs and LEDCs
A More Economically Developed Country [MEDC] has high levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the northern hemisphere are MEDCs, eg UK, USA, Canada, Europe. More of the countries in the southern hemisphere are Less Economically Developed Countries [LEDCs].
have the resources and technology to predict and monitor the occurrence of storms, eg using satellites and specially equipped aircraft. They are also equipped to train the emergency services appropriately and to educate people about necessary precautions.
Storm warnings can be issued to enable the population to evacuate or prepare themselves for the storm. People can prepare by storing food and water or boarding up their windows.
A Less Economically Developed Country [LEDC] has low levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the southern hemisphere (eg countries in southern Africa, southern Asia and South America) are LEDCs, while more of the countries in the northern hemisphere are More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs].
are often less prepared. They may rely on aid (sometimes reluctantly) from MEDCs for the rescue and recovery process, as was the case with Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh, November 2007.
The intense winds of tropical storms can destroy whole communities, buildings and communication networks. As well as their own destructive energy, the winds generate abnormally high waves and tidal surges. Sometimes the most destructive elements of a storm are the subsequent high seas and flooding.
A More Economically Developed Country [MEDC] has high levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the northern hemisphere are MEDCs, eg UK, USA, Canada, Europe. More of the countries in the southern hemisphere are Less Economically Developed Countries [LEDCs].
are better placed to reduce the effects of tropical storms because they have more financial, educational and technological resources to help deal with them. They better able to observe and predict storm behaviour and can invest in infrastructure to withstand storms - as well as spending more money on repairing the damage caused.

Droughts occur when a long period of abnormally dry weather leads to a severe water shortage. Droughts are also often caused by the activity of humans as well. Human activities that can help trigger droughts include:
Widespread cutting down of trees for fuel reduces the soils ability to hold water - drying out the ground, triggering
Desertification is the spread of desert conditions in arid regions due to human activities, drought or climate change.
Constructing a dam on a large river may help provide electricity and water to irrigate farmland near the reservoir. However, it may also cause drought downstream by severely reducing the flow of water.
Droughts endanger lives and livelihoods through thirst, hunger (due to crops dying from lack of water) and the spread of disease.
Millions of people died in the 20th century due to severe drought and famines. One of the worst hit areas was the Sahel region of Africa, which covers parts of Eritrea, Ethiopia and the Sudan.
Droughts and famines can have other geographical impacts. If drought forces people to migrate to a new home it could put pressure on resources in neighbouring countries.
Droughts can have a severe impact on MEDCs as well as LEDCs. Droughts have caused deaths in Europe in recent years - especially amongst the elderly. In the UK in summer 2006, there were hose pipe bans and campaigns to make people save water.
Food for distribution Yabelo area, Southwest Ethiopia
The Sahel region of Africa has been suffering from drought on a regular basis since the early 1980s. The area naturally experiences alternating wet and dry seasons. If the rains fail it can cause drought.
In addition to natural factors, the land is marginal. Human activities such as overgrazing, over-cultivation and the collection of firewood can lead to
Desertification is the spread of desert conditions in arid regions due to human activities, drought or climate change.
, particularly when combined with drought conditions.
The result is crop failure, soil erosion, famine and hunger, which then means that people are less able to work when their need is greatest. It becomes a vicious circle and can result in many deaths, especially among infants and the elderly. In Niger in 2004, the situation was made worse when a plague of locusts consumed any remaining crops. In these cases, people rely on food aid from the international community.
On its own, food aid is unsustainable in the long term. What is really needed is development aid, which involves educating the local community in farming practices.
Case study: the impact of drought in the UK, 2004
The years 2004  2006 were one of the driest periods on record in the UK.
The South East of England is particularly vulnerable to drought because it has a high population density. There are 13 million people living in the region and the demand for water resources is high. There are few reservoirs, which means there is a heavy reliance on groundwater supplies. Two consecutive dry winters meant that these supplies were not replenished.
Hose-pipe bans were introduced in an effort to conserve water.
Ground-water fell to its lowest level on record.
Low river flow meant that pollution had a greater impact on the environment.
Fish were more likely to die because of low flow, low oxygen levels and higher water temperatures.
Kew Gardens introduced a range of measures to conserve water, eg only watering newly planted trees and newly turfed areas.

We are told of an argument where the mother found contraceptives in her daughter's bag.
The narrator describes clearing out her own mother's belongings after she died. Her mother's vast collection of shoes seems to have given her the most pain. She bought the white trainers on the way home.
Towards the end, it is unclear whether the narrator is imagining holding her daughter as a baby or cuddling the white trainers - 'so small and pale' (line 186) could refer to either.
The narrator sucks the laces. It is possible she is having a breakdown. She could be imagining herself as a child again. To her, the shoes may represent everything she believes her daughter no longer is: sweet, pure, new, untouched and clean.
The narrator welcomes her daughter home, but it seems most likely that this is just in her mind, as she continues to cradle the white trainers under the duvet.

The chief character in a literary work.
Victor Frankenstein comes from a wealthy, supportive family, which he neglects when he becomes overly absorbed in his studies at university.
. He is a star student, but wants to use his knowledge to obtain the god-like power of creating life.
Victor often fails to listen to good advice from his friends, family and teachers. If he had, many deaths, including his own, may have been avoided.
He rejects the Monster immediately after its creation, calling it a 'wretch' and leaving it to fend for itself. This shows how irresponsible he is. It is also another example of him neglecting his family, since the Monster sees him as its father.
Victor is scared of owning up to what he has done. Even when his little brother, William, is killed by the Monster, he does not admit to knowing who the murderer is. If he had done this, Justine's life would have been saved.
He is capable of showing sympathy for the Monster. For example, when it asks him to create a wife for it, so as not to be forever lonely, Victor at first agrees. However, he later destroys the half-built creature before the Monster's eyes. This leads to his own wife's murder on their wedding night.
His desire for vengeance is very strong. He chases the Monster from Switzerland to the North Pole, enduring great hardships along the way.
Before dying, Victor says his actions are not 'blameable', and that he still believes he was right to create the Monster. This lack of guilt, and his destructive pursuit of scientific knowledge for personal glory, makes us wonder if Victor is in fact the real monster of the story.

Solar panels do not generate electricity, but rather they heat up water. They are often located on the roofs of buildings where they can receive heat energy from the sun. The diagram outlines how they work.
Cold water is pumped up to the solar panel, there it heats up and is transferred to a storage tank.
A pump pushes cold water from the storage tank through pipes in the solar panel. The water is heated by heat energy from the sun and returns to the tank. In some systems, a conventional boiler may be used to increase the temperature of the water.

You can choose pre-drawn circuits or system blocks, which speeds up the process even further.

It featured samples or cuts from tracks, loops and digital effects produced on synthesisers and computers - together with driving, repetitive drum-and-bass lines.
House music (named from the Warehouse club in Chicago) was developed by DJs out of Disco and Dub in the early 1980s. UK House hits of the late 1980s included 'Love Can't Turn Around' and 'Jack Your Body'. Records like this made stars of the DJs and engineers who produced and played the music.
A later spin-off was Acid House, which featured a wobbly baseline and trance-like sound and was very influential in the UK Rave scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
From the 1990s onwards electronic dance music spawned numerous variants including Techno Trance, Goa Trance, Dub, Hardcore and Gabba.
In the mid 1990s a different dance music form, Jungle became popular, this grew around the London club scene, and is influenced by Techno, Hip-hop and Ragga. It is now known as Drum and Bass and features a fast tumbling beat and an emphasis on the drum and bass sounds, a good example is music by

Every number can be written as a product of prime numbers.
For example 40 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 5
126 = 2 x 3 x 3 x 7
28 = 2 x 2 x 7
How do we write a number as a product of its prime factors?
Write 24 as a product of its prime factors.
There are lots of ways to solve this. Here are two:
Start with the smallest prime number that divides into 24, in this case 2. (2 divides into all even numbers.) So we can write 24 as:
Now think of the smallest prime number that divides into 12. Again we can use 2, and write the 12 as 2 x 6, to give.
24 = 2 x 2 x 6
6 also divides by 2 (6 = 2 x 3), so we have:
24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3
2, 2, 2 and 3 are all prime numbers, so we have our answer.
In short, we would write the solution as:
= 2 x 2 x 2 x 3
We can also use a factor tree:
This shows us that 24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3
Remember that we can write these factors in index form. In this case
24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3, so
Write 36 as a product of its prime factors.

It is not possible to predict when an individual atom might decay. But it is possible to measure how long it takes for half the nuclei of a piece of radioactive material to decay. This is called the half-life of the radioactive isotope.
There are two definitions of half-life, but they mean essentially the same thing:
the time it takes for the number of nuclei of the isotope in a sample to halve
the time it takes for the count rate from a sample containing the isotope to fall to half its starting level
Different radioactive isotopes have different half-lives. For example, the half-life of carbon-14 is 5,715 years, but the half-life of francium-223 is just 20 minutes.
It is possible to find out the half-life of a radioactive substance from a graph of the count rate against time. The graph shows the decay curve for a radioactive substance.
The decay curve for a radioactive substance
The count rate drops from 80 to 40 counts a minute in two days, so the half-life is two days. In the next two days, it drops from 40 to 20 - it halves. In the two days after that, it drops from 20 to 10 - it halves again - and so on.

Abortion has been legal in England, Scotland and Wales since 1967 when The Abortion Act was passed. A new upper time limit of 24 weeks was introduced in 1990 under The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.
An abortion may be carried out if one of the following conditions applies:

the mental health of the mother is at risk
there is a reasonable chance that the child will be born seriously disabled
Where the mental health of the mother is at risk, or her family will suffer if the pregnancy continues, the latest termination date is 24 weeks. There is no upper limit if the life or physical health of the mother is at risk, or if there is a reasonable chance of a seriously disabled child being born.

because it interferes with a potential life. However there are instances when it is permitted, particularly when the life of the mother is at risk. The decision must be taken by the mother. The later in the pregnancy, the more difficult it is to approve of an abortion.
It is clear that the life of the mother is more important than that of an unborn child:

To change a fraction to a decimal, you divide the top number by the bottom number. (Divide the numerator by the denominator.)
to a decimal, we calculate 3  8
Some decimals will terminate (end) like the example above, but many will not.
There are some fraction/decimal equivalents that you should be familiar with:
If the decimal terminates (ends), the denominator will be 10, or 100, or 1000 or (depending on the number of decimal places).
0.5 means 'five tenths, so 0.5 =
0.45 means '45 hundredths', so 0.45 =
0.240 means 240 thousandths, so 0.240 =
If the decimal repeats with a single digit, the denominator will be 9:
If the decimal repeats with two digits, the denominator will be 99:
If the decimal does not repeat at all it is known as an irrational number, and you cannot write it as a fraction.
How do we know whether a fraction will give a terminating decimal? The rule is to find the prime factors of the denominator.
If the prime factors are only 2 and/or 5 the decimal will terminate.
28 = 2 x 2 x 7
so the decimal will not terminate. It will be a recurring decimal.
40 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 5
The prime factors of 40 consist of 2s and 5s, so the decimal will terminate.
125 = 5 x 5 x 5
120 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 5
There is a 3 in there, so the decimal will recur.
To change a fraction to a percentage multiply it by 100.
Remember: you might find it easier to convert the fraction to a decimal before you multiply by 100.
To change a percentage to a fraction divide by 100.
To change a decimal to a percentage multiply it by 100.

De Lacey, a blind old man, shows kindness towards the Monster. His son misinterprets the Monster's intentions and throws it out of their cottage. This deeply affects the Monster, who weeps and grieves over the loss of its hovel and (unknowing) companions. This grief quickly becomes a desire for revenge on mankind when, after saving a peasant girl from drowning, the Monster is shot at and wounded.
The Monster explains that it believed it could make friends with a child, someone who would not be old enough to be prejudiced against it. It tells of how it then came across young William and approached him in a friendly way, only to be insulted and abused yet again. On hearing the boy say his father was called Frankenstein, a name it knew to be that of its creator, it strangled him to death.
Finally, it pleads with Victor to build it a wife, a companion it can run away with to the 'vast wilds of South America' and never trouble mankind again.

Catrin suggests that relationships between parents and their children are not always harmonious, but Digging shows no conflict.
Catrin explores how a mother and child are bound together through the actual birth; Digging suggests that different generations are bound by sharing the same occupation - Heaney, his father and grandfather all 'dig'.
Both of Heaney's poems show the contrast between his father as an old man and his younger self.
Both describe his expertise in farm work as a means of illustrating Heaney's admiration for is father.
In both poems, the young Heaney is present in the fields, but in Digging he was helpful, gathering in the potatoes, while he was a nuisance in Follower.
There is a determination at the end of Digging to work and explore the past, but there is a hint of frustration in Follower - today It is my father who keeps stumbling Behind me, and will not go away.
Heaney gives us a detailed description of his father and grandfather at work, but we are given no visual impression of the father in Blake's poem.
Blake's boy becomes lost as no father was there, which suggests he was irresponsible, but Heaney shows that his father worked hard to provide food for his family.
Digging suggests a close family relationship. Blake, though, shows the love of the boy's weeping mother and the ever nigh love of God.
Blake's poem implies praise of God ' the father' of us all, while Heaney's poem shows his personal love and respect of his father and grandfather.

They release enzymes to break down compounds, so that they can absorb the nutrients. We can preserve our food, for example by freezing or canning, to remove the conditions needed for decay to occur.
Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another.
Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
Intensive farming practices include growing high-yield crops, using fertilisers and pesticides and keeping animals indoors. Food production is increased but there are unwelcome side effects.
Organic farming bans chemical inputs and has a less harmful effect on the environment but often produces less, more expensive food.
Hydroponics is the production of food using nutrient-rich solution rather than soil.
Leaves enable photosynthesis to happen. Photosynthesis is the process by which leaves absorb light and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrate (food) for plants to grow. Leaves are adapted to perform their function eg they have a large surface area to absorb sunlight.
Plants use minerals from the soil to build the complex molecules they need to survive and grow. Poor plant growth may be due to a deficiency of one or more minerals. Tests can be done to establish which mineral is deficient or a general purpose NPK fertiliser added.
Plants have two different types of 'transport' tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots.
The element carbon is the present in all living organisms. It's recycled through various processes, which are described in the carbon cycle.
Nitrogen is essential for the formation of amino acids to make proteins. The nitrogen cycle describes the ways in which nitrogen is recycled.
Osmosis is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low water concentration through a partially permeable membrane. Osmosis takes place in all living cells.
Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis through their root hair cells. Plants use water for several vital processes including photosynthesis and transporting minerals.
All substances are made from atoms. Each atom is made of a nucleus - containing protons and neutrons - surrounded by electrons.
The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. The elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in ascending order of atomic number.
The mass number of an atom is the total of protons plus neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and hence different mass numbers) are called isotopes of that element.
A covalent bond is formed between non metal atoms, which combine together by sharing electrons. Covalent compounds have no free electrons and no ions so they don't conduct electricity.
The Periodic Table is an arrangement of the elements in order of atomic number. Elements in the same vertical column are in the same group or family and have similar chemical properties.
Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid using electricity. When ionic compounds are molten or dissolved in water the ions are free to move.
When sulfuric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen is produced at the cathode (negative electrode) and oxygen at the anode (positive electrode). Aluminium is extracted from the mineral bauxite using the process of electrolysis.
All matter is made of atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements, and each one has a symbol. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other.
When atoms of different elements join together they make a compound. Compounds are represented by formulae that show how many atoms of each element are in the compound. Formulae can be worked out from the charge of the ions that make up the compound.
Chemical reactions can be written down as balanced chemical equations.
The Group 1 elements in the Periodic Table are known as the alkali metals. They include lithium, sodium and potassium, which all react vigorously with air and water.
The reactivity of the alkali metals increases down the group. Flame tests are used to identify alkali metal ions in compounds.
The Group 7 elements are also known as the halogens. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, which all have seven electrons in their outer shell.
In a displacement reaction a less reactive element is
Ionic bonding occurs between positive and negative ions, which attract each other and bind together to form ionic compounds. For example, sodium chloride consists of Na
Each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions held in place by electrostatic attraction and forming an ionic crystal lattice. The ions in a crystal lattice are very strongly bonded - a high temperature is required to melt the crystal.
The physical properties of different metals make them useful for different purposes. For example, aluminium conducts heat, which makes it a useful material for making saucepans and gold is shiny, which makes it an attractive material for jewellery.
Metal particles are held together by strong metallic bonds, which is why they have high melting and boiling points. The loose electrons in metals can all move together through the metal  creating an electric current.
The elements in the middle section of the Periodic Table are the transition elements. They're all metals with typical metallic properties eg conducting heat and electricity. They often form coloured compounds.
Transition metal carbonates undergo thermal decomposition - a reaction in which a substance is broken down into at least two other substances by heat.
Transition metal hydroxides are insoluble in water. They can be precipitated out of a transitional metal compound solution using sodium hydroxide solution.

The care of health begins the moment a man wakes up. After awakening he should not arise at once but should wait until the heaviness of sleep has gone. Then, every day, he should wash his face and eyes using pure water. He should rub his teeth using some fine peppermint powder and taking away any leftover bits of food. He should rub and anoint his head every day but wash it and comb it only occasionally.
After this, people who have to or wish to work will do so, but people of leisure will first take a walk. A young man or middle-aged man should take a walk of about 10 stadia before sunrise. Long walks before meals clear out the body, prepare it for food and give it more power for digesting.

The photograph below shows a simple gear train made up of a couple of spur gears. These are the common gears (or cogs) that look like wheels with teeth around the rim. Next to the photo is a diagram showing how you would draw this gear train in an exam.
In the drawing, the centre of each gear is shown by a cross. Each gear is drawn as two circles, one slightly larger than the other to show where the teeth would be. Teeth do not have to be drawn, but the number of teeth is written next to the gear, in this case 60 teeth and 15 teeth. Arrows indicate the direction that the gears are moving. Note that with two connected gears, they will be rotating in opposite directions.
Where there are two gears of different sizes, the smaller gear will rotate faster than the larger gear. The difference between these two speeds is called the
, and can be calculated using the number of teeth. The formula is:
Gear ratio = number or teeth on driven gear  number of teeth on the driver gear
So the gear ratio for the simple gear train above, if the smaller gear is the driver gear, is:
Gear ratio = 60  15 = 4
In other words, the driver gear revolves four times to make the driven gear revolve once.
If you know the gear ratio, and the speed input at the driver gear, you can calculate the speed output at the driven gear using the formula:
Output speed = input speed  gear ratio
So if the gear ratio is 4 and the driver gear is revolving at 200

There is a 'real difference' between the nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the kitchen and the city street. Explain how the results show this.
Only one team of scientists has carried out measurements of nitrogen dioxide levels in kitchens and made the claim that they can exceed WHO limits. Explain why it is important to this claim that other scientists repeat this investigation.

Climate refers to what is expected to happen in the atmosphere rather than the actual conditions. It is possible for the weather to be different from that suggested by the climate.
Climatic conditions in an area can be affected by the landscape, relief and activities taking place (both human and natural). Climate can alter over time and space.
Within a climatic region, the climate may vary from place to place - eg the top of a hill, the sunny side of a hill, the shaded side of a hill and the bottom of a hill. These areas with their small variations are called

keeps Britain warmer and wetter than places in continental Europe.
The prevailing wind is the most frequent wind direction a location experiences. In Britain the prevailing wind is from the southwest, which brings warm, moist air from the Atlantic Ocean. This contributes to the frequent rainfall. When prevailing winds blow over land areas, it can contribute to creating desert climates.
The British Isles have variable weather that changes from day to day between different regions and within different regions. Consequently it is very difficult to predict or forecast the weather.
Britain has four distinct seasons of fairly equal length - spring, summer, autumn and winter. In winter it is colder and wetter and the days are shorter than in summer.
Different parts of the UK experience slightly different regional climates. These can be summarised as:
- cool summers, mild winters, heavy rain all year.
- cool summers, cold winters, steady rain all year.
- warm summers, mild winters, light rain all year, especially summer.
- warm summers, mild winters, heavy rain all year, especially winter.
The variability of weather and climate in different regions of the British Isles is due to the different air masses that meet over the Isles. Each air mass brings with them different characteristics, as shown in the map below.
Prevailing winds and climate zones in the UK
are greatest along the south coast of England (average of 1750 hours of sunshine per year) and are least in mountainous areas (average less then 1000 hours).
Scotland has shorter winter days and longer summer days than the rest of the UK, because it is further north. In the north of Scotland there are four more hours of daylight in mid-summer than in London.
On average it rains one in three days in the UK. However, rainfall varies greatly from region to region. It is generally wetter in the west than the east and wetter in the highlands than the lowlands. The wettest place is Snowdonia in Wales (average annual totals exceeding 3000 mm of rain a year), followed by the Highlands of Scotland, the Lake District, the Pennines and the moors of southwest England.
Parts of the east, such as East Anglia, receive less than 700 mm a year.
In most places in the UK it will rain twice as much in winter months as in summer months. Although in central and south-eastern England, and parts of southeast Scotland, July and August are often the wettest months of the year. In London and Birmingham it will thunder on average 15 days a year, compared to less than 10 elsewhere in the UK.

The coldest months are January and February and the warmest are July and August. In summer Scotland will be about three degrees cooler than England. The average daily maximum temperature at Glasgow in July is 19C compared with 22C in London.
Scotland tends to be worse affected by severe weather than the rest of the UK. Snow is more common in highland regions than in lowland areas, so while snow might fall on the south west of England less than 10 days a year, it will fall on the peaks of the Cairngorm Mountains over 100 days a year.

for storage. The stored starch can later be turned back into glucose and used in respiration. Oxygen is released as a by-product of photosynthesis.
Three factors can limit the speed of photosynthesis - light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature.
Without enough light, a plant cannot photosynthesise very quickly, even if there is plenty of water and carbon dioxide. Increasing the light intensity will boost the speed of photosynthesis.
Sometimes photosynthesis is limited by the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air. Even if there is plenty of light, a plant cannot photosynthesise if there is insufficient carbon dioxide.
If it gets too cold, the rate of photosynthesis will decrease. Plants cannot photosynthesise if it gets too hot.
If you plot the rate of photosynthesis against the levels of these three limiting factors, you get graphs like the ones above.
In practice, any one of these factors could limit the rate of photosynthesis.
Farmers can use their knowledge of these limiting factors to increase crop growth in greenhouses. They may use artificial light so that photosynthesis can continue beyond daylight hours, or in a higher-than-normal light intensity. The use of paraffin lamps inside a greenhouse increases the rate of photosynthesis because the burning paraffin produces carbon dioxide, and heat too.
Plants need to take in a number of elements to stay alive. The most important are:
Plants get hydrogen and oxygen from water in the soil, and carbon and oxygen from carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere. Water and carbon dioxide are used to synthesise food during photosynthesis. Oxygen is used to release energy from food during respiration.
In addition to these three elements, plants need a number of minerals for healthy growth. These are absorbed through the roots as mineral ions dissolved in the soil water. Two important mineral ions needed by plants are:
- for making amino acids, which are needed to make proteins
If a plant does not get enough minerals, its growth will be poor. It will suffer from deficiency symptoms:
deficient in nitrate - it will suffer from stunted growth
deficient in magnesium - it's leaves will turn yellow

The evolution of hormones and the nervous system
During evolution, humans developed certain characteristics that gave them a better chance of survival. Multicellular organisms need ways for their cells to communicate, and there are a number of different means by which the body achieves this.
Humans did not evolve from apes such as gorillas and chimps. Instead, humans and apes share a common ancestor that lived millions of years ago. This common ancestor diverged over time to form many different species of
, only one of which survived to become modern humans. All the rest of the hominids, including early humans, became

During the evolution of human beings, many features gave individuals advantages that offered them a better chance of survival, including:
the ability to stand upright, so predators and prey could be seen more easily
having a larger brain, providing the ability to plan ahead, work together, and eventually speak
Ideas about science - data and theories
It has taken scientists a long time to try to discover how humans evolved. Scientists do this by producing an explanation and then looking for data to support their theory or prediction. Sometimes the data agrees with and supports the prediction. This increases the scientists confidence that the prediction is correct.
Data does not always support the theory
Sometimes the data disagrees and does not support the theory. This can prove that either the prediction or the observation used to produce the data is wrong. An example of this is the discovery of a new gene that affects the evolution of brain size. Scientists think it first appeared about 40,000 years ago. It has been so successful that 70% of humans now carry this gene. Scientists think that the gene increases brain size and this may improve intelligence. Scientists are now examining this gene. Many predictions and theories about how the gene works will be made, but it will only be when much more data and evidence has been collected that we will know which of these theories is correct.
In your examination you may be given additional information about human evolution that you have not seen before. You will need to be able to identify valid conclusions from the data provided and say which supports a prediction and which does not.
Data does not always prove the theory - higher only
Observations and data that support a theory still do not prove that the prediction is correct. For example, a theory that states that storks deliver human babies could be supported by the fact that populations of storks are often found near areas with higher human birth rates. This data supports the theory but does not prove it.
Observations and data that do not support a theory decrease the scientists confidence that the theory is correct.

2854,"The revolution in the textiles industry where there was a move from home-based work to factories was at the heart of the Industrial Revolution. This Revision Bite will look at some of the changes in the textiles industry.
Many historians believe that the Industrial Revolution would not have happened without the revolution in the textiles industry.
Before 1750, a lot of woollen cloth was produced, but
the textiles industry was a low-tech, labour-intensive cottage industry
. British workers were unable to spin a cotton thread strong enough to make cotton cloth, so they had to use wool thread for the warp, which
produced a half-wool, half-cotton cloth called fustian
After 1750, however, there was a revolution in the textiles industry. This involved:
, probably as a result of the growth in population, but also because of the opening up of the export market.
and innovation - the use of machinery.
, away from East Anglia and the West Country. The first factories were situated in the hills of Lancashire and Yorkshire near to fast-flowing streams, which could power the water-wheels. With the invention of the steam engine, however, factories were sited on the coalfields of the north of England and Scotland.

: used rollers at different speeds to stretch the thread.
Allowed hundreds of threads to be spun at once
. It needed a factory and a water-wheel to power it and produced a coarse strong thread that allowed British firms to make cotton cloth. Limited impact until 1785, because Arkwright had a patent and sued other manufacturers who used his idea.
Before this process was introduced, workers soaked cloth in urine or soda and left it stretched out in the sun on tenter frames for up to three months. Berthollet discovered that chlorine powder
: used rollers and a moving carriage to spin a fine, strong thread. Could be worked by women and children - cheap, unskilled labour. Had a huge impact because Crompton did not have a patent, and many manufacturers used his idea -
there were 4 million mules at work in 1811
. One result was that there was a glut of spun thread, so hand-loom weavers were able to command high wages.
Before this process was introduced, workers had decorated cloth by pressing on block-prints. Bell invented a machine for roller printing that
allowed hundreds of metres of cloth an hour to be printed in colour
: powered by steam engines. Did not have an immediate impact because of technological problems, but
it was gradually improved and thousands were used after 1825
. This caused poverty and unemployment for the hand-loom weavers, and groups of
A group of English workers who formed in the early 19th Century. They opposed and destroyed new textile machines which threatened their traditional jobs.
Eight reasons Lancashire became a cotton industry centre
- Liverpool had made millions of pounds from the slave trade, which meant there were consumers with money to buy cloth, and rich merchants with money to invest in building factories.
- the port of Liverpool allowed hundreds of tons of cotton to be imported from Egypt and America.
- the Lancashire coalfield provided coal to power the steam-engines.
- millstone grit in the Pennines meant that the water was soft, which made it easy to wash the cotton.
- the climate was damp and mild, which was necessary for spinning the cotton thread, although the mills had to be kept excessively hot and humid.
- was poor, so the people of Lancashire had more time to spend on industry.
- large numbers of women and children, pauper apprentices from the poorhouses and migrants from the countryside were prepared to work in the factories.
- up until 1774, a duty was charged on cotton cloth to protect the woollen industry. In 1774, this was abolished, and vast amounts of cotton cloth could be produced and sold at a profit.
Note that all except the first point also applied to Glasgow/Clydeside, which explains why the cotton industry was also established there.
A wig-maker who developed the water frame, although he seems to have stolen the idea from a spinner called Lewis Paul. It was too big and heavy to be used in people's homes. He moved to Nottingham to get away from the Luddism in Lancashire, went into partnership with Jedediah Strutt, and
set up a horse-powered factory in Nottingham
. At first, Arkwright sold thread to the Nottingham stocking-makers.
Strutt lent him the money to build Cromford Mill which was water-powered.
Arkwright pioneered the systems of factory rules
, discipline and time-keeping, and built the village of Cromford to house his workers.
When the duty on cotton cloth was abolished,

2585,"To put Othello into perspective, you'll need to know a little about William Shakespeare and why the play is still so popular over 400 years after it was first performed.
William Shakespeare was born in Stratford upon Avon in 1564. His father sold gloves and became an important person in the town. William, one of eight children, was the eldest son and was probably educated at the local grammar school. He married when he was only 18 and his wife, Anne Hathaway, was eight years older than him. They had two girls and a boy (who died aged 11).
Nobody knows how Shakespeare began to write or when he entered the theatre, but we know that he became a leading member of the theatre troupe known as 'The Lord Chamberlain's Men'. The company proved very popular and later, when King James I granted them the right to perform at his court, the troupe became known as 'The King's Men'. Shakespeare wrote over 30 plays for 'The King's Men', making it the most important theatre company in the country, and he often wrote parts for particular actors. He was very successful and wealthy in his time, and his work has remained very popular ever since.

What to look for in your comparison
Both poems are a conversation between a mother and child, but in Catrin it is the mother, not the child, who is speaking.
Both poems describe memories of family; but Catrin focuses on the creative tension, the 'love and conflict' between child and parent
Again a conversation between parent and child; again a kind of love poem
Duffy's poem takes pleasure in the continuing relationship between child and parent, Jonson's poem is an elegy (lament) for his dead son
In part this too is a conversation between son and father; but instead of real memories of a real family, this relationship is symbolic of something else - that between man and God.

(Make a point, support it with a quotation, and then explain how the quote reinforces the point you are making. )
to look at some sample answers to this question...
Before You Were Mine: Test (sample answers)
Below are some sample answers which examiners would mark at different grades.
The ballroom with the thousand eyes sets a very romantic scene and we can understand how the poet's mother would have been excited to go there and risk staying out late.
As well as illustrating how the light played on the mirrorball, sending light across the dancefloor, the thousand eyes could refer to the eyes of five hundred potential suitors (real or imaginary) standing round watching, which would have enhanced the excitement even more.
Throughout, the poet is very possessive of her mother. References to her appear constantly (I'm ten years away... I'm not here yet... I remember...). The word Mine appears in the title and the poem actually concludes with the same words as the title, as if the poet is locking her mother in a firm embrace of words.
This answer would be of a Grade A standard.
The line I see you, clear as scent is difficult to understand, because you can't see scent. I think it means that the poet has imagined what her mum must have looked like, waiting by the tree, so clearly that she can almost smell the scene. Also, scent is quite a romantic word - maybe her mum wore scent when she met her boyfriend.
The fact that the poet names her mother's friends, Maggie McGeeney and Jean Duff (which sound like typical names from those times) help us believe in what she is writing. It is more personal - we feel we can get to know her mother's pals too.
This answer would be of a Grade C standard.
The poet's mum used to imagine herself having as a perfect life, as if she was in a film - fizzy, movie tomorrows, if she met the right boy.
The poet says that her mother looked a bit like Marilyn Monroe in her polka-dot dress, which is interesting because her mother probably dreamed of being like Marilyn.
This answer made points which would be of a Grade E standard.
If your answer was closest to Answer 1 - well done! If not, it might be a good idea to look back over the Revision Bite.

However, he often appears weak - he starts to have visions, he asks lots of questions, he cannot make a decision and never really seems sure of himself. For instance, he panics just after the murder and has to rely on his wife to find an alibi.
Later in the play he appears to be more in control and less reliant on his wife. For instance, he plans to murder Banquo without even telling his wife. He also ignores his visions and makes decisions quickly, giving orders rather than asking questions. At times he is full of confidence but he is also distant and seems to ignore the death of his wife. When he realises he will also die, he 'will not yield' and fights to the very end.
Knowing the facts about a character is only the start - we need to be able to use these effectively. One way to do this is to have details or quotes from the play to support our ideas. For instance:

In the UK businesses provide for a wide range of different cultures. For example, there are magazines and newspapers in many different languages and Halal butchers in areas with large Muslim populations.
The market can be divided into socio-economic groups
The population can be segmented according to annual salary (eg 15,000, 30,000 etc.), or type of job and social class. Establishing a group's

is important so that products can be targeted to the relevant income group. This is called a
Generalised group by job, class and income.
. The socio-economic groups A, B, C1, C2, D and E describe how much the head of the household earns.
Products can be aimed at a lifestyle group
People are grouped according to the way they lead their lives and the attitudes they share. For example, young professionals may drive a sports car because of the image they want to project. Married parents might want the same things, but have to provide for their children, which is a large extra cost. They will need a family car to suit their lifestyle.
Marketing departments use segmentation so they can target their products more accurately. It affects each of the 4Ps in their marketing mix:
If the product is effectively segmented a company will be able to promote the right product, at the right price and use the right distribution to reach the place where the consumers are.
Now look at the way the 4Ps are used in market segmentation.
Car manufacturers often produce a range of models to suit different markets
Firms have a range of products that will be targeted at different groups or segments. For example, a car manufacturer will often have a range that includes a family model, an
model and a sports model. Lifestyle segmentation will be used to develop their product line and to target their products.
Price and quality are obviously linked but not everyone can afford to buy the most expensive goods. There is a large range of televisions on the market, for example, each with slightly different features. Within this range of products, there will also be a range of prices to cater for varying disposable incomes.
Studying how a product is advertised can reveal its
the end-user or consumer group to whom the manufacturer aims to sell
. A mobile phone company recently used advertising campaigns that varied for men and women. The male phone was pictured in black and white, and all its features and business applications described. The female phone was in bright colours, and was pictured as a matching accessory to go with a woman's lipstick and handbag. You may not agree with this stereotyping, but it is a good example of gender segmentation.
A firm needs to know where its target market is. For example, a producer of Kosher food needs to identify areas where Jewish people live. The firm would have to consider how best to get its product to these areas. This is an example of cultural segmentation.
Planet Airlines has three types of seat on its planes: First Class, Business Class and Economy Class. The service you receive in each is different, as is the price you pay. Give one example, for each 'Class', of whom they hope to sell to, stating your reasons. (3 marks)

Exam questions are usually based on case studies. Look carefully at your case study to see if there is any information on market segmentation. The examiner will want to see that you understand the principles of market segmentation.
Planet Airlines would want to sell their First Class seats to rich people. Business Class would probably be sold to business people and Economy Class to poorer people.
Mandy's answer was very basic. She has shown some understanding of the subject, but should have given far more detailed reasons. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade.
Planet Airlines would want to sell their First Class seats to rich people, because they can afford to spend more money. Business Class would probably be sold to business people, because they need more space to work on the plane. Economy Class would probably be aimed at people who cannot afford expensive tickets, for example, a family.
Jamie's answer showed he understood the subject, and his explanations were good. He could have included more detail and used business terms. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade.
Planet Airlines would want to sell their First Class seats to people in the highest socio-economic groups. Many of these will be in high managerial jobs with a large disposable income, and can afford to spend more money on luxuries. Business Class would probably be targeted at business people, because they need space to work on the plane, as well as being fresh for meetings on arrival. Economy Class would probably be aimed at tourists and people who cannot afford expensive seats, for example, an average family, belonging to soci-economic groups C1 or C2, white collar (office) and blue collar (factory) workers. These are examples of income and lifestyle segmentation.
Craig's answer was very detailed, and he used the correct business terms like 'disposable income' and 'lifestyle segmentation'. He showed that he understood the subject very well indeed. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.

4976,"To put Othello into perspective, you'll need to know a little about William Shakespeare and why the play is still so popular over 400 years after it was first performed.
William Shakespeare was born in Stratford upon Avon in 1564. His father sold gloves and became an important person in the town. William, one of eight children, was the eldest son and was probably educated at the local grammar school. He married when he was only 18 and his wife, Anne Hathaway, was eight years older than him. They had two girls and a boy (who died aged 11).
Nobody knows how Shakespeare began to write or when he entered the theatre, but we know that he became a leading member of the theatre troupe known as 'The Lord Chamberlain's Men'. The company proved very popular and later, when King James I granted them the right to perform at his court, the troupe became known as 'The King's Men'. Shakespeare wrote over 30 plays for 'The King's Men', making it the most important theatre company in the country, and he often wrote parts for particular actors. He was very successful and wealthy in his time, and his work has remained very popular ever since.
is one of Shakespeare's most popular plays. There are all sorts of reasons for this but perhaps the main one is that the basic story still strikes a chord with modern audiences. We see what happens when a man, Iago, is passed over for promotion. He is determined to get revenge and starts to manipulate everyone around him. Iago's general, Othello, is tortured by jealousy and one small item, a missing handkerchief, leads to distrust, broken friendships, murder and suicide.
The play's themes also seem very up to date - they cover all sorts of things, like the role of women, love, jealousy, ambition and betrayal. However, perhaps the most challenging theme from the play is race - Othello is black and has married a white woman. There are lots of references to this and Shakespeare shows how complex the situation was even in his lifetime.
has been filmed a number of times and adapted for stage in all sorts of ways. For instance, there have been versions set in the police force in London, versions starring jazz musicians, an opera and even a version which reverses the traditional roles, with Othello played by a white actor and the other roles played by black actors.

4403,"Footloose industry in the UK  A case study
Footloose industries are not tied to a particular location. They include high-tech industries and are located near motorway junctions or on the edges of towns and cities in business parks. The products are often electronics and computer components.
Examples include Silicon Glen in Scotland and the M4 corridor. Some of the benefits of locating an industry in the M4 corridor are shown in the diagram below.
The M4 corridor stretches from Heathrow airport in the east to Bath and Bristol in the west. The corridor is home to companies such as Hewlett Packard and Sony who are involved in research and development (quaternary industry) and have links with universities who provide well-qualified graduates.
Few raw materials are used and therefore transport costs are low, making the industries 'footloose'.
Land on the edge of cities is often cheaper than in the centre. The out of town surroundings and easy access to workers in the suburbs provides an ideal location for building science and business parks.
Motorway links and railways also provide access for commuters and for transporting components and products.
Workers wanting to live near their place of work increases the demand for housing and puts pressure on green belt land.
As demand grows, house prices increase. This means that less skilled and lower paid workers are priced out of the market in desirable areas.

A false positive occurs when a genetic test has wrongly detected a certain allele or faulty chromosome. The individual or family could believe something is wrong when it is not. This may lead them to decide not to start a family, or to choose an abortion, in order to avoid having a baby with a genetic disorder.
A false negative happens when a genetic test has failed to detect a certain allele or faulty chromosome. The individual or family would be wrongly reassured. This may lead them to decide to start a family or continue with a pregnancy.
Gene therapy involves inserting copies of a normal

It is illegal to do this to sex cells, because any changes would be inherited by the individuals offspring. Instead, gene therapy is used on body cells. It means the individual could pass on their faulty allele to their children, even if they get better themselves.

You will also need to summarise the different views that different people might hold. For example, if gene therapy saves lives, it can only be a good thing. Or, we should not use gene therapy because we do not know the long-term outcomes.
Identify arguments that are based on the right decision, ie a decision that produces the best outcome for most of the people involved. So, if a certain type of gene therapy involves a risk of causing harm, but 90 per cent of the people who have the therapy are cured, is it worth taking the risk?
Identify when certain actions are never justified because they are unnatural or wrong. For example, we could wipe out cystic fibrosis in one generation if we made sure that anyone who was a carrier was not allowed to have children. However, most people would consider this action to be immoral and wrong.

For the political movement to have succeeded, it needed one leader who focused the attention of all the supporters and led them to victory. Chartism had two main leaders - Lovett and O'Connor - and they disagreed over Chartist tactics. This caused Chartism to fail.
Chartist groups were spread out in small groups all over the country. This made it difficult to successfully co-ordinate communication and meetings on a national level.
The Chartists did not always agree about what they wanted from Parliament. They all supported the Six Points, but some also wanted improved education, sobriety laws and improved working conditions.
The Chartists did not all belong to the same class and this meant that many middle-class supporters withdrew their support after Chartism became linked to violence. When the middle-class members left, there was less money to fund the movement and it started to fail.

1695,"There are many different ways of interpreting
. For instance, when it was first published, the work was a very early example of a
A literary genre within which the main plot is focused upon the development of a romantic relationship between two people. Traditionally the story will have an optimistic ending.
There are many characters in the novel who display one or both of these -
. As you'll see, the two often go together.
It's helpful to define these words in their context. In this book, they mean:
- having too high an opinion of one's own worth or importance.
- making judgements about others which aren't based on fact or experience.
From the beginning, Darcy is shown to be too proud of his own social standing. He looks down on people, especially the Bennets. This is made worse by his natural quietness, which makes him seem even more
Distant and cold in manner, and lacking in interest or concern.
Elizabeth isn't naturally proud in the same sense as Darcy. But when she's slighted by him at the first ball, her pride is hurt. As a result, she compensates by becoming more proud of herself and defensive about her family.
Lady Catherine is incredibly proud, believing it to be the natural order of things that she be praised and obeyed.
Collins' pride changes according to whom he's speaking. In the company of people he believes to be below him socially, he revels in taking the moral high ground and bragging about his standing. With those above him, his pride vanishes and he often humiliates himself.
Without knowing the Bennets - or almost anyone else, for that matter - Darcy seems to form opinions without taking the trouble to get to know them.
Again, prejudice isn't Elizabeth's natural outlook. However, when Darcy offends her, she allows everything to feed the prejudice she develops against him. She's prepared to believe anything bad about him to fuel the impression she wants to create (for instance, Wickham's story).
Mrs Bennet develops a more blatant prejudice against Darcy after his actions at the ball. She acts on this, insulting him within earshot. Her character's lack of depth is shown by her prejudice disappearing when Darcy proposes to Elizabeth.
She's prejudiced against anyone below her in social standing, unless they're prepared to play by her rules (that is, what she says goes). So she's prepared to tolerate Collins, but despises Elizabeth.
Mrs Hurst and Miss Bingley are prejudiced against Jane and Elizabeth. This is mainly out of self-interest. They dislike Jane because they feel she isn't good enough for their brother; they dislike Elizabeth because Darcy likes her and Miss Bingley wants to marry him.
Austen offers a balance to all this pride and prejudice in two ways. Firstly, she creates characters who don't really show either characteristic (for example, Jane, Bingley and Mr Bennet). Secondly, she shows that pride and prejudice can be overcome (Darcy and Elizabeth).
The book is dominated from the opening sentence by relationships and the pursuit of marriage. Sometimes it seems as if marriage - especially if you're single - is the most important thing in life. The book is about romance, but Austen provides examples of different kinds of marriage that go some way to showing that life and relationships can be complicated.
Their marriage is the most 'complete', because they have to work so hard to get there. They need to learn about themselves before they can learn about others. Darcy overcomes his pride; Elizabeth conquers her prejudice. They appreciate the other's qualities more because they weren't aware of them at first.
The reader is left in no doubt these two will live happily ever after - they're both too nice to imagine otherwise. They're very much in love', but their relationship isn't as developed as Darcy and Elizabeth's.
Mr Bennet was ""captivated by youth and beauty"", but over time comes to realise that physical attraction alone isn't a good basis for a happy marriage. When the beauty fades, the marriage suffers. He spends a lot of time in his library to avoid his wife.
This is a practical marriage not based on either love, mutual attraction or shared interests. Charlotte says: ""Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance."" And she admits she isn't romantic. Lucas marries Collins because he can provide a home and financial security. She then arranges her home so she can avoid her husband as much as possible. Collins marries her (after being rejected by Elizabeth) simply because he feels society expects him to marry.
In perhaps the most depressing marriage of all, Wickham's an immoral
who'll undoubtedly break Lydia's heart. He doesn't love her, and only marries her because he's offered money to 'do the right thing' after
Running away secretly with a lover, usually with the intent to get married.
with her. Lydia is only 16 and bowled over by Wickham's appearance and the exciting prospect of being a wife. She doesn't really love him, or even know him, although she might believe she does.
Most of the characters are deeply concerned about their 'reputation' - how others see them and their standing in society. This is linked to 'class' (see Context), but a character's reputation isn't necessarily linked to their social standing (for example, Wickham).
Darcy is concerned about his reputation, but not as much as other characters believe. He has two faces: one public, one private. In public, although he acts with manners and formality, many believe he's arrogant and aloof. In Longbourn, his reputation develops along these lines. But in private he's loving and caring. He treats his tenants and servants well, and ensures Lydia's reputation is rescued, without publicising this.
One of Elizabeth's most attractive qualities is not being as concerned as others are about someone's reputation. She won't be intimidated by either Darcy or Lady Catherine, despite their 'reputations'. She believes there are more important things. When she finds out Jane is ill, she thinks nothing of walking three miles over fields and arriving at Netherfield in a mess - something most women wouldn't have done. Some would look down on her for being so unladylike (the Bingley sisters). However, to Elizabeth, her reputation is far less important than her sister's welfare.
Although she perhaps doesn't understand completely, by becoming Wickham's lover outside of marriage her reputation as a lady would be completely destroyed. This is why Darcy makes sure Wickham marries her. Even this isn't enough for Collins, who feels she should still be disowned. Although Austen treats snobbery lightly, this issue of reputation is taken seriously. Lydia's behaviour compromises the standing of her whole family.
Wickham is keen to use his looks and charm to cultivate a good reputation for himself. For the most part, this works. Darcy is such a gentleman he only reveals the truth about Wickham's corrupt past to Elizabeth when forced to - and insists she doesn't tell others. Wickham is concerned with his own reputation on the surface, but not sincerely, or he wouldn't act as he does. He's more concerned with others' reputations and how he might affect theirs for his own gain.
Mrs Bennet is concerned with reputation, but on a very basic level. She would be hysterical if she knew what others really thought of her. She believes she's well regarded and tries hard to be so, all the while making things worse for herself through her loud, embarrassing actions. Perhaps the best example of her misguided belief in reputation comes when she discovers Wickham has married Lydia. Rather than be concerned that her youngest daughter has married a terrible man, she immediately worries about how the wedding dress will look.

There are a number of formulae to help you with these calculations, and you need to be familiar with these. You don't necessarily need to
them, as you will usually be given a formula sheet in your exam.
Power is the rate of energy output, or work done by a component or device.
Power (P) = voltage (V) x current (I)
P = power (measured in watts, W)
A resistor has a current of 0.025A flowing through it when it has a voltage of 9V placed across its ends. Determine whether a resistor with a 0.125W power rating will be able to handle the current value.
P=V x I = 9 x 0.025 = 0.225W
A resistor of 0.125 Watts would therefore be too low to handle the 0.025A current.
The opposition in an electrical component to the flow of electricity through it. Resistance is measured in ohms.
of two resistors in series is the sum of the resistance values of the two resistors in ohms. The formula is:-
R total = combined resistance value (in ohms)
R1 = value of resistance in first resistor (ohms)
R2 = value of resistance in second resistor (ohms).
Two resistors with resistance values 1.2 kilo-ohms (K) and 2.2 kilo-ohms (K) are connected in series. Determine the total resistance of the network.
To find the combined resistance of two resistors in parallel we use the formula
R total = combined resistance value (ohms)
R1 = value of resistance in first resistor (ohms)
R2 = value of resistance in second resistor (ohms).
Two resistors are combined in parallel. If they have values of 100 ohms and 1.2 kilo-ohms, determine the value of their combined resistances. Note that the value of resistances have to be changed so they are both either ohms or kilo-ohms. Ohms have to be used in this example:
in a resistance/capacitance circuit, the time constant is the time taken to charge the capacitor, through the resistor, to 63% of its full charge - or to discharge it to 37% of its initial voltage.
for a resistor and capacitor in series. The time constant can be used to calculate time delays. The formula is
C = value of capacitance (in farads)
R = value of resistance (in ohms)
A capacitor and a resistor are connected in series. Determine the time constant for capacitance charging if the capacitor has a value of 100
units of capacitance equal to 1 millionth of a farad

x (100 x 1000) = 10 seconds
The formula for the relationship between currents in a transistor is
Determine the value of the emitter current (Ie) flowing through a transistor if the base current = 0.015 amps and the collector current = 0.16 amps.
Ie = Ib + Ic = 0.015 + 0.16 = 0.175 amps
The formula for calculating a transistor's current
the amount of amplification of the input voltage - ie how much bigger the output voltage is compared to the input voltage
A transistor has a current of 0.2 amps and 0.09 amps flowing through the collector and the base respectively. Determine the value of the current gain. Note that gain has no units because it is a ratio.
You can calculate the value of the output voltage from a potential divider using the formula:
Vout is the output voltage in volts
R1 is the value of resistor R1 in ohms,
R2 is value of resistor R2 in ohms.
Vin is the input voltage in volts
A potential divider has one resistor R1, with a resistance of 5 Ohms, a resistor R2, with a resistance 10 Ohms and an input voltage of 5 Volts. What is the output voltage?
The table below gives examples of differrent potential divider calcultations.
To find the gain of an inverting op-amp we use the formula

Avoid making the conversation sound like a rehearsed set of questions and answers. One way to do this is to think of each question as a ""trigger"" to help you say as much good French as you can. For example, if your examiner asks you to talk about your family, don't just name the members of your family and wait for the next question. Instead, develop your reply by taking one member of the family and describing their personality, as well as their physical appearance. You could then give your opinion of that person and say whether you get on well together, and why.
Don't panic if the examiner asks you a question you have not prepared. Short answers, as well as complete sentences are both acceptable. Try to be spontaneous and to respond quickly and confidently.
If you don't understand a question, ask the examiner (in French) to repeat it. If you still don't understand, say so and let the examiner move on. Avoid long silences.
Don't worry if things get harder as the conversation develops. Remember, it's the examiner's job to ""push"" you as far as you can go. If everything was too easy, the examiner would be letting you under-achieve.

4108,"In your coursework you should be aware of the basic story of Othello:
The play opens with Roderigo, a rich gentleman, arguing with Iago, a soldier. Roderigo had been in love with Desdemona, the daughter of a senator, and asked her to marry him. However, he has just found out that she has secretly married Othello, a black army general. Iago is also angry - he serves Othello but has not been promoted by him. Instead, Othello promoted Cassio, a young soldier with no experience. Iago tells Roderigo to wake Desdemona's father, Brabantio, and they shout in the street, telling him about the secret marriage. Iago stays in the background, shouting insults but not saying who he is.
Iago says he is angry because of Cassio but he also suspects an affair between Othello and his wife. However, Iago hides his anger and pretends to be loyal and serve Othello, although we soon see that he is lying to him.
We learn that a Turkish fleet will attack Cyprus and Othello is sent to advise the senate. Brabantio arrives and accuses Othello of using witchcraft to seduce his daughter. However, Othello defends himself and is put in command of the army. He then leaves to sail to Cyprus and there is a terrible storm.
The storm destroys the Turkish boats and Othello arrives on Cyprus safely. He joins his wife, Desdemona, Iago, Iago's wife Emilia, Roderigo, Cassio and the rest of his soldiers. Iago starts trying to make Othello jealous of his wife and, as part of the plan, gets Cassio drunk. Othello learns of this and sacks Cassio, saying he'll 'never more' be an officer. Iago then persuades Cassio to speak to Desdemona so that she can convince her husband to reinstate Cassio. At the same time, Iago suggests to Othello that Cassio and Desdemona might be having an affair.
Desdemona loses her handkerchief, which was a present from Othello. Emilia gives it to her husband, Iago, and he plants it as evidence of an affair. Iago also asks Othello to hide and then gets Cassio to talk about love - Cassio is talking about another woman but Othello thinks he's talking about Othello's wife, Desdemona. Othello is so angry he decides to kill his wife and tells Iago to kill Cassio.
However, Iago continues to plot against Othello. He convinces Roderigo, who is still in love with Desdemona, to kill Cassio. Iago hides and watches the attack, then wounds Cassio. Iago then pretends to help Roderigo but secretly kills him and then blames someone else.
Act II - Iago plies Cassio with drink and then tells Othello that Cassio is drunk while on duty. Othello sacks Cassio.
Act III - Desdemona loses her handkerchief which is later used by Iago to frame Cassio.
Act IV - Iago's plan has worked, Othello's emotions take over. He decides to kill Desdemona, believing she's been unfaithful, and orders Iago to kill Cassio her supposed lover.
Othello talks to Desdemona and then attacks and kills her. However, Emilia, Iago's wife, realises Desdemona is innocent and that her husband is guilty. She starts to tell the guards what has happened but Iago kills her. Othello then attacks Iago but the fight is stopped. Othello is so full of grief that he commits suicide and falls on the bed next to the body of his wife. The play ends with the arrest of Iago and Cassio is left to decide Iago's punishment.
is quite complicated and so far we have only looked at the basic plot - there are lots of extra characters and details you can include. However, do not fall into the trap of retelling the story in your essay - you will get no marks for it because the examiner already knows what happens. Instead, use the plot to support your work and ideas. Let's have a look at how you can do this next
In your work you need to show how different events fit together. This means you should know the basic storyline and what other parts of the plot are relevant to your task. If your task is about a particular scene, you should know what has already happened and what happens after the scene. Imagine you are looking at Act 3, Scene 3 (which finishes with Othello deciding to kill Desdemona and ordering the death of Cassio). You would probably want to include details from the plot like:
How Iago has been planning against Othello since the beginning of the play
How Iago is ready to lie about an affair between Desdemona and Cassio
How Cassio has been sacked by Othello because Iago got him drunk
How Desdemona starts the scene saying she will help Cassio
How Othello and Desdemona start the scene without any real worries
How Iago manipulates Othello into suspecting his wife
How the scene ends with Othello deciding both Desdemona and Cassio must die
How Iago's lies are the cause of all the other deaths later in the play

in Wales, provide opportunities for different activities. These activities all have advantages and disadvantages for communities and the environment.
Farming - especially sheep-farming - has been done in highland areas for centuries.
It has shaped the landscape, helped to build local communities and is an important part of local economies.
Trees and other vegetation need to be cleared to provide grazing. This vegetation is important for protecting the landscape from erosion and for providing habitats for wildlife.
The introduction of too many animals leads to over-grazing. Over-grazing causes soil erosion which may squeeze out wildlife and pollute water sources. For many farmers this way of life is becoming less economically viable.
Conifer forests have been planted in many highland areas.
Forestry creates local jobs and provides timber.
New conifer forests can help prevent soil erosion and can help counter the impact of
Deforestation is the destroying of forests by cutting down trees (for timber) or by burning. Often the purpose is to make way for agricultural land.
Forestry may push out other vegetation and force other activities - such as farming - into decline.
For some wildlife, the forest will provide a habitat, but other animals will lose their habitat.
Some people argue that conifer forests debase the landscape - though others think they enhance it.

2096,"There are two main types of battery: non-rechargeable batteries and rechargeable batteries.
Ordinary 'dry-cell' batteries are non-rechargeable. As the reactants inside them become used up in chemical reactions, the output from these batteries gradually falls. Once all the reactants have been used up, these batteries go 'flat' and cannot supply electrical energy anymore.
Rechargeable batteries usually maintain a constant output until just before they go flat. They contain reactants that can be made again just by passing electricity through the products. Once the battery has gone flat, it can be connected to a recharger. This uses electrical energy to reverse the chemical reactions that happened in the battery while it was in use.
Car batteries are rechargeable batteries - they are constantly recharged while the car is moving, so the lights and horn will always work.
Mobile phones, many MP3 players and other portable devices use rechargeable batteries. They must be recharged at regular intervals. It is usually recommended that such batteries should almost be flat before recharging. This allows the battery to be fully charged again.
Advantages and disadvantages of rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries
expensive to use in the long run as more are needed (high cost / performance ratio)
cheap in the long run as they can be re-used (low cost / performance ratio)

It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters, dramatic effects, themes and language. Stick to what is relevant and don't be afraid to put a personal reaction in as well - it shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied ideas you have heard.
So imagine our task is 'How is the theme of jealousy dealt with in
? There are all sorts of ways of answering this - one answer might start with different aspects of jealousy, another answer with the language of jealousy and another with the dramatic effects created. However, try to plan the start of an answer using the character of Othello as the focus. Once you've done that, compare your ideas with the answer below.
'How is the theme of jealousy dealt with in
Perhaps the most obvious characteristic of Othello is his jealousy. He loves Desdemona, his wife, calling her 'his soul's joy' but is quickly manipulated by Iago into suspecting her. Iago simply asks a few leading questions, then tries to not answer Othello's questions, or answers them ambiguously. For instance, he is asked for his thoughts, but just says, 'Think, my Lord?' In not saying anything, he is sowing the seeds of doubt in Othello's mind. Someone else would probably ignore this, but I think it is important for Othello - he is a general, he expects his wife to be as obedient as his soldiers, and the idea that she isn't starts to torment him.
By this time the audience are well aware that Iago is plotting against Othello. His soliloquies have told us of his hatred of 'the Moor' yet Othello seems blind to this. Even when Iago actually tells the truth and uses personification to warn Othello of the 'green-eyed monster' of jealousy, and that it will 'mock the meat it feeds on', Othello is unaware of what is happening.
This is only the start of the task and there is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction because it keeps to the point as well as using a range of relevant details combined with personal thoughts.

The vertical axis of a velocity-time graph is the velocity of the object and the horizontal axis is the time taken from the start.
When an object is moving with a constant velocity, the line on the graph is horizontal. When an object is moving with a steadily increasing velocity, or a steadily decreasing velocity, the line on the graph is straight, but sloped. The diagram shows some typical lines on a velocity-time graph.
The steeper the line, the more rapidly the velocity of the object is changing. The blue line is steeper than the red line because it represents an object that is increasing in velocity much more quickly than the one represented by the red line.
Notice that the part of the red line between 7 and 10 seconds is a line sloping downwards (with a negative gradient). This represents an object that is steadily slowing down.

The poem is set in a vast area of temporary accommodation called Dharavi on the outskirts of Mumbai, where millions of migrants have gathered from other parts of India and there is always a shortage of water because it is not an official living area.
But when a pipe bursts, when a water tanker goes past, there's always a little child running behind the water tanker getting the bits of drips and it's like money, it's like currency. In a hot country in that kind of climate, it's like a gift.

5017,"Nearly all of the mass in our Solar System is in the Sun. The Sun is very large. Its diameter is over 100 times the Earth's. The Sun is the source of nearly all the energy we receive. For many years, it was a mystery as to where this came from, and this baffled the leading scientists. It is now understood that the nuclear fusion is the energy source. In nuclear fusion hydrogen nuclei are joined together to make helium nuclei. This releases enormous amounts of energy.
In stars larger than our Sun helium nuclei can be fused together to create larger atomic nuclei. As the Earth contains many of these larger atoms, like carbon, oxygen, iron, etc, scientists believe that our Solar System was made from the remains of an earlier star.
Stars form from massive clouds of dust and gas in space
As the gas falls together, it gets hot. A star forms when it is hot enough for a
to start. This releases energy, and keeps the star hot. The outward pressure from the expanding hot gases is balanced by the force of the star's gravity. This happened about 5000 million years ago. This is quite recent in the history of the Universe, which is currently believed to be 14,000 million years old.
The Sun is halfway through its 10 billion year stable phase

4412,"When we are talking about dramatic effect, we are basically talking about how we experience the play in a theatre.
The first thing to bear in mind is that the play is not meant to be real, or even look real. In Shakespeare's time all the actors would have been men. Even Hero and Beatrice were men dressed up as women. There were also very few props or scenery. This meant people in the audience had to use their imagination. It is almost like watching a pantomime nowadays: we know it is not real, but that is part of its charm.
Secondly, it is important to remember how people watch a play in the theatre. We cannot stop the actors to make a cup of tea, and there is no book to put down or DVD to pause. This seems obvious, but it is easy to forget.
For instance, in Act 4, Scene 1 we witness the build up to Hero and Claudio's wedding. Hero and her friends know nothing of Don John's plot and what has happened beforehand. However, the audience knows Claudio plan to reject her publicly. She will be alone and when this happens - even her father wishes she was dead. A theatre audience naturally feels sympathy for her. This is exactly what dramatic effect is all about - how feelings are created.
Shakespeare creates dramatic effect by switching a lot from one event to another. The switches tend to involve two things: a switch from one group of characters to another, and a change of mood, like switching from tragedy to humour.
For instance, the wedding scene is a terrible ordeal for Hero. It should have been the most important day in her life, and was almost as important to her father, but things go tragically wrong. Leonato wants to disown Hero, Beatrice wants to eat Claudio's ""heart in the market place"", and Benedick leaves to challenge his best friend to a duel. Things could not get any worse. However, Shakespeare suddenly switches the mood completely.
At the end of Act 4, Scene 1, we are left on a cliff-hanger. Everything seems to be in tatters. Yet we leave Hero behind, with the next scene taking place in a courtroom where Dogberry questions the prisoners. He has no idea what he is doing and causes all sorts of confusion. He even stands before the Sexton (who is conducting the trial) and says he and his partner are the prisoners.
This scene is written to be laughed at. Dogberry and his watch are ridiculous. Shakespeare is poking fun at people who think they are cleverer than they really are.
The two scenes are next to each other to make a deliberate contrast. Shakespeare is not simply telling a story. He is showing how the characters relate to each other, how seemingly minor incidents can lead to a tragedy, and how an overhead conversation can save Hero and Claudio's wedding. Dogberry and his watch might be incompetent, but they find the truth in the end.
Whatever task you have been set, you should aim to include something about the dramatic effects created in Much Ado About Nothing, because that reflects how an audience experiences the play in a theatre.
Sometimes events in the play are repeated in a similar way later on. This allows the audience to make connections and understand some of the themes the play deals with. Examples include:
- They are both tricked in exactly the same way: they 'overhear' friends talking about them and hide to find out more. They react in similar ways, too. So the audience can see both sides at once. Even the words they use when they hear their friends are similar. Benedick says: ""This can be no trick,"" while and Beatrice asks: ""Can this be true?""
- Often characters make mistakes or are conned by others. For instance:
Don John tries to fool Claudio when Don Pedro proposes
Borachio fools Margaret into pretending to be Hero
Don John convinces Don Pedro and Claudio of Hero's unfaithfulness
Hero's friends pretend she is dead, to fool Claudio

Jack is the leader of the choir. He was the chapter chorister, can sing C sharp, and was the head boy at school.
He has red hair and is tall, thin and bony.
""His face was crumpled and freckled, and ugly without silliness""
. His fiery hair and his ugly appearance give us clues to his fiery, ugly character.
He is hungry for power. When we first meet him he bosses the choir around; later he undermines Ralph's leadership and sets up his own tribe against Ralph, even though he loses a vote. He gradually becomes a dictator. When he orders the tribe to tie up Samneric her boasts to Ralph
He knows as soon as Ralph asks him that the choir should be hunters. Hunting then pre-occupies him more and more through the novel.
He can't kill the first pig he sees because of
""the enormity of the knife descending and cutting into living flesh; because of the unbearable blood""
. Yet he quickly puts aside any doubts.
""All you can talk about is pig, pig, pig!""
Jack paints on a mask to help him hunt better. The paint gives him a liberation into savagery: he is able to do savage things now he looks more like a savage.
He is so moved by having killed a pig that he isn't anxious about the ship that went by while the fire was out. All he thinks about is the knowledge that
""they had outwitted a living thing, imposed their will on it, taken away its life""
By the end, Jack has moved on even further. His prey has gone beyond pigs - he is keen to hunt Ralph.
He commits the first act of violence towards another boy on the island when he thumps Piggy.
. He gets gradually more violent towards other boys: he has no thought for Piggy when he steals his glasses and later he ties up and beats Wilfred.
He pretends not to be frightened of the beast - but is shivering and croaking when he sees the 'beast' on the mountain. Does this suggest that he's not really as brave as he'd like to think he is?
, it's soon clear he doesn't care about the rules or being civilised:
"" Bollocks to the rules! We're strong - we hunt! ""
He rejects the order that had been established on the island:
""We don't need the conch any more""
At the end, he has no remorse for Piggy's death. He declares himself Chief. He has lost the name Jack, which suggests he has lost all.

Originating in Vienna, during the 19th Century the waltz became popular all over Europe. A father and son, both called Johann Strauss, composed a huge number of waltzes. Johann Strauss (the son) was called The Waltz King.
The Waltz always has three beats in the bar and has a bass note on the first beat. Waltzes can be identified by the 'um cha cha, um cha cha' that forms the backbone of the music.
They commonly feature a low pitched accompaniment and a higher series of elegant melodies.
The speed of the waltz is usually fairly quick and lively.
Waltzes usually contain a string of seven or eight different melodies with an introduction and a coda (ending passage).
Waltzes were written for string orchestras, full orchestras including woodwind and brass, and for solo instruments such as the piano or guitar.

The following essay section covers this plan, but we have muddled up the order. Try to sort them out so that they flow more logically.
The descriptions of places and people in these sections of the poems are highly descriptive and thought-provoking. In the mud hut, the help offered by the neighbours is unwanted and the poet feels it is pointless and intrusive. The atmosphere is busy and irritating. In the charnel house description, there is an atmosphere of calm and ordinariness. Both these descriptions are surprising in the Night of the Scorpion you might think that the help would be welcomed; in the charnel house you are surprised that love is so calm and serene in such abnormal circumstances.
The mud hut is alive with activity and pressure to do something. In contrast, the charnel house of the second stanza in Vultures is surprisingly calm. Again a surprising image because even the word charnel conjures up images of death and in the context of this poem, violence. Even more surprising is the personification of love in the charnel house tidying up. This stanza begins with one word, strange set alone on a line it causes the reader to pause and evaluate. It is strange, not that love exists in a charnel house - death does not mean that we stop loving people - but that her behaviour is so ordinary: she tidies up, chooses a corner and goes to sleep, her face turned to the wall!. Why? There are implications here that after death we tidy up our memories of people, perhaps make them cleaner, but in the end, the idea of death is a hard thing to face and we try to avoid it, turn away from it. So, ultimately, perhaps this idea is not strange at all.
This repetition of more also helps the audience to feel that the neighbours are relentless and irritating as they try to help and pray for the bitten mother. The lack of sympathy from the poet can be heard in the repetition of they said. He has disassociated himself from their behaviour, which seems to him to be superstitious and unhelpful. In their prayers, they imply that the mother has sinned in a previous life. The poet seems unhappy about this implication; to use they said so many times is to register the fact that he does not agree with them. Most of the lines in this section begin with may, which makes what the neighbours say sound like a prayer or incantation and the poet finds these incantations and superstitions silly and pointless. His descriptions make the mud hut sound claustrophobic; it is full of lanterns and candles and shadows and clicking tongues and it continues to rain. The repetition of and helps to build this feeling of pressure and tension. We can see why the scorpion would want to escape the hut and we feel that the poet would like to as well.
Both poets use descriptions of places and the activities carried out in them to develop the ideas explored in the poems.
In 'Night of the Scorpion', the description of the activity of the neighbours leads us to feel irritated by them, even though they have arrived to help the mother; they are described in a way that makes them seem annoying, like flies: 'The peasants came like a swarm of flies' This simile is continued, they 'buzz' and fuss and 'click'. This irritation is surprising because the neighbours are trying to help. They bring equipment with them: 'More candles, more lanterns, more neighbours,'

731,"The final part of your oral exam will take the form of a conversation with your examiner. The conversation will cover different topics, such as holidays, home and family, school and work. The number of topics that must be covered varies from syllabus to syllabus. EDEXCEL allows you to choose one of the topics. The other exam boards do not.
What you must be able to do
At foundation tier, the most important thing is to answer all the examiner's questions clearly, so that a German-speaking person would understand. Of course, you should try to be as accurate as possible, but small mistakes will not always lose marks. The best foundation tier candidates will be able to refer to the past, present and future. They will also be able to express personal opinions.
To do well at higher tier, you will need to be accurate and fluent. You will have to produce longer sequences of speech and use a variety of structures, tenses and vocabulary. You will also be expected to express ideas and justify your point of view.
Ask your teacher to show you the standard of work required at different levels. He/she should be able to demonstrate the differences between performance at grades E, C and A.
Most of your preparation will have added value, as it is likely to be useful in your writing exam as well.
Prepare as much material in advance as you can. Take one topic at a time. Your teacher will probably give you some possible questions for each topic.
As well as preparing answers to questions, practise giving a continuous speech on each topic.
Start simple. Later on you will find opportunities to improve your work by adding a few more interesting details. Remember - it is easy to improve a simple piece of work. It is much harder to simplify something that is too complicated!
Do not prepare notes with words or phrases that are too difficult or complicated. If you do, you will not manage a confident, lively conversation and you will get a low mark.
Sometimes you may hesitate in the conversation. Try to do this in German. Don't say ""
"". Instead, prepare some useful German ""fillers"" such as
The better prepared you are, the easier it will be to seem relaxed, fluent and spontaneous in the exam.
Look at the examiner. Eye contact is very important. It will help the examiner to help you.
Avoid making the conversation sound like a rehearsed set of questions with easy answers. One way to do this is to think of each question as a ""trigger"" to help you say as much good German as you can. For example, if your examiner asks you to talk about your family, don't just name the members of your family and wait for the next question. Instead, develop your reply by taking one member of the family and describing their personality, as well as their physical appearance. You could then give your opinion of that person and say whether you get on well together, and why.
Don't panic if the examiner asks you a question you have not prepared. Short answers, as well as complete sentences are both acceptable. Try to be spontaneous and to respond quickly and confidently.
If you don't understand a question, ask the examiner (in German) to repeat it ""
"". If you still don't understand, say so ""
"" and let the examiner move on. Avoid long silences.
Don't worry if things get harder as the conversation develops. Remember, it's the examiner's job to ""push"" you as far as you can go. If everything was too easy, the examiner would be letting you under-achieve.

Before you start building a website, identify the target audience, purpose, structure and content. Consider all the points in this checklist:
- who is the website aimed at? There may be several different audiences, so you might need to tailor the website to the different types of people who will use it.
- are you trying to sell something, or to educate and inform? What are the key things people will want to locate when using the website? The key information should be easy to identify and find, so should be placed in a prominent position, either on the homepage or through clear links.
- what are the main sections within the website? Will they make sense to someone who is visiting your site for the first time? Do the links on the website lead the user to the right point? It is vital to consider the website as a whole when you are planning your design.
- try not to present too much information on each page. People dont like scrolling down to locate the information they are looking for.
to people with disabilities? Could a person with poor eyesight use your website? Or someone who has difficulty using a mouse? A well designed website will be accessible to a variety of people. Other things to consider include colour, text size and use of media (eg images or animated content). It is important not to distract too much from the purpose of the website by using features such as animated gifs, scrolling banners, flashing buttons etc...

America was in a fortunate position as the First World War ended. The war had

They would also be familiar with the racist language used to insult Othello and see nothing wrong with it. However, we shouldn't reject Shakespeare for this - he is reflecting his audience and the time he wrote the play, but he also manages to challenge these racist ideas. His audience would almost inevitably expect the villain to be black and the hero white, but it's the opposite. Secondly the love between Desdemona and Othello is clearly real - they may be from different cultures but it is Iago who forces them apart, not their different ethnic origins.
There may be other topics you can spot, such as the subject of magic - Desdemona's father accuses Othello of using it to seduce his daughter, saying that she wouldn't be in love without 'witchcraft'. Even the handkerchief Othello gave Desdemona has 'magic in the web' of it, and losing it can lead to damnation.
It's good to include something about the basic ideas within

Distillation process to separate ethanol from water
Step 1 - water and ethanol solution are heated
The mixture is heated in a flask. Ethanol has a lower boiling point than water so it evaporates first. The ethanol vapour is then cooled and condensed inside the condenser to form a pure liquid. The thermometer shows the boiling point of the pure ethanol liquid. When all the ethanol has evaporated from the solution, the temperature rises and the water evaporates.

Don't panic! You are not expected to understand every word of the text.
Take a positive approach to your reading. Concentrate on what you do understand, not on the difficult words and phrases.
Have a good look at the title of the text as well as any illustrations. They may give you some important clues.
Read the whole text before attempting to answer any questions. It is usually better to read the text twice at a brisk pace, than to struggle along once, slowly.
Be clear as to exactly what each question wants. For example, should you be picking out precise details (for example, the date of someone's birthday) or should you be reading the whole passage in order to draw some broad conclusions (for example, a comparison of two people's attitudes to television)?
Be aware of different ways of finding out the meaning of words. For example:
Can you guess the meaning of a difficult word in a sentence if you understand what all the other words mean?
Can you find similarities between Spanish and English words? (eg
Can you find links with other Spanish words? (eg
Are you aware of language patterns? (eg 're' in front of a word often means again:
Use your knowledge of grammar. For example, if you can identify a plural, a verb tense, an adjective, an adverb or a preposition, you will be in a better position to make an intelligent guess at a meaning.
Use your knowledge of Spain and Spanish-speaking countries. For example, knowing about the Spanish educational system could be very useful if you are working on a text about school.
If you have to write answers in Spanish, be as clear as possible; but remember you will
Don't spend too long on a difficult item. Come back to it later.

The poem starts with a criticism of laws relating to ownership. The 'charter'd Thames' is a bitter reference to the way in which every aspect of life in London is owned, even the river, so often in other poems a symbol of life, freedom and the power of nature.

Blake's poem also criticises religion and its failures. The speaker draws attention to the cry of the chimney sweeper and the blackening of church walls, implying that the church as an institution is inactive, unwilling to help those in need.

People often confuse mass and weight. Remember that weight is a force, and is measured in newtons. Mass is measured in kilograms (kg).
The mass of an object is the
or ""stuff"" it contains. The more matter an object contains, the greater its mass. An elephant contains more matter than a mouse, so it has a greater mass. Mass is measured in
A 100 kg object has a greater mass than a 5 kg object. Remember an object's mass stays the same wherever it is.
All objects have a force that attracts them towards each other. This is called
. Even you attract other objects to you because of gravity, but you have too little mass for the force to be very strong.
Gravity only becomes noticeable when there is a really massive object like a moon, planet or star. We are pulled down towards the ground because of gravity. The gravitational force pulls in the direction towards the centre of the Earth.
""Down"" is towards the centre of the Earth, wherever you are on the planet
Weight is a force caused by gravity. The weight of an object is the
between the object and the Earth. The more mass the object has the greater its weight will be.
Weight is a force, so it's measured in
. On the surface of the Earth an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 10 N.
The mass of an object stays the same wherever it is, but its weight can change. This happens if the object goes somewhere where gravity is stronger, or weaker, such as the Moon.
The Moon has less mass than the Earth, so its gravity is less than the Earth's gravity. This means that objects weigh less on the Moon than they do on the Earth.
The Moon's gravity is one sixth of the Earth's gravity. A 120 kg astronaut weighs 1200 N on Earth. On the Moon they would weigh only 200 N. The astronaut's

If you were to compare the scores in the two subjects, English and Maths, which measure of average would you use and why?
The range of scores in English (37) is far greater than that in the Maths (4).
The mean score in each subject is 78 which implies that the scores of the students are more-or-less identical in English and Maths. But looking at the actual scores, you can see that this is not the case.
If you compare the medians (71 and 78), you might assume that the students generally scored less in English, (which is partly true, but there are also some much higher scores there too).
If you just state the modal score for each subject (101 and 78), you have no information about the scores of the other students.
So, which is best? It seems that to give maximum information,
a combination of the median and the range would be best.

Romeo and his friends decide to gate-crash the party. Romeo has a bad feeling about the outcome of this evening, but decides to let fate take its course.
Capulet is having a great time at his party. People are dancing. Romeo and his friends arrive wearing masks. Romeo spots Juliet. He thinks to himself that he didn't really know what true beauty was until he saw her. He doesn't know that she is a Capulet. Tybalt recognises Romeo from his voice and threatens to kill him because he is a Montague, but Capulet stops him. Romeo and Juliet flirt and finally kiss. The Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet and he is dismayed. He leaves with Benvolio. Juliet is distraught when the Nurse tells her who Romeo is.
The Chorus recaps events for us: Romeo has forgotten Rosaline and is now in love with Juliet. Juliet feels the same way.
Romeo runs away from his friends. Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline.
Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom. Juliet doesn't know that he is there at first and, talking to herself, declares her love for him. She is shocked and embarrassed when he replies. They have only met that evening, but they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and what time their wedding will be! They find it difficult to part.
Romeo goes to see Friar Lawrence, the priest, who is worried that he has spent the night with Rosaline. When Romeo says that he wants to marry Juliet, Friar Lawrence tells him off for falling in love so easily, but agrees to the wedding because he thinks that it might be a solution to the rift between the Capulets and the Montagues.

Diet, drugs and health - Digestion and enzymes
Our teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. Enzymes are needed so that this break-down happens quickly enough to be useful.
Take care - enzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients:
. Carbohydrase enzymes break down starch into sugars.
The saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough, the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet.
. Protease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. Digestion of proteins in the stomach is helped by

Food chains - Getting carbon dioxide, light and water
Remember that the equation for photosynthesis is:

Let's see how plants get the carbon dioxide and water they need for this process.
Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves. The carbon dioxide
through small holes in the underside of the leaf called stomata. (One of these holes is called a stoma. The plural is stomata.)
The lower part of the leaf has loose-fitting cells, to allow carbon dioxide to reach the other cells in the leaf. This also allow the oxygen produced in photosynthesis to leave the leaf easily.
A leaf usually has a large surface area, so that it can absorb a lot of light. Its top surface is protected from water loss, disease and weather damage by a waxy layer.
The upper part of the leaf is where the light falls, and it contains a type of cell called a
. This is adapted to absorb a lot of light. It has lots of chloroplasts and is shaped like a tall box.
Turgid plant that's watered regularly and a flacid plant without enough water.
Plants get the water they need for photosynthesis through their roots.
The roots have a type of cell called a root hair cell - these project out from the root into the soil. Roots have a big surface area and thin walls, which allow water to pass into them easily.
Note that root cells do not contain chloroplasts, as they are normally in the dark and cannot photosynthesise.
The water absorbed by the root hair cells passes through the plant in
tubes, and eventually reachers the leaves. If a plant does not absorb enough water, it will wilt or go floppy. Without water it may also not photosynthesise quickly enough, and it may die.

Electric current and voltage - Electric charge
Have you ever heard a crackle when taking off your jumper? This is caused by tiny electric charges on your clothes. It's called
Your jumper and shirt get electrically charged as they rub together, and then negative electric charges jump from one to the other. This makes sparks that crackle - you can even see them in a dark room.
When electric charges move in a wire, we say that an
flows in the wire. It's like the way a current of water flows in a river.
For an electric current to flow, we need two things:
something to make the electricity flow, such as a battery or power pack
a complete path for the current to flow in. This is called an electric circuit.
An electric current will not flow if we do not have a
(a cell, battery or power pack). It also won't flow if the circuit is not
. One end of the power source must be joined to the other end by the wires and components of the circuit.
The simplest complete circuit is a piece of wire from one end of a battery to the other. An electric current can flow in the wire from one end of the battery to the other, but nothing useful happens. The wire just gets hot and the battery goes flat.
To do something useful with the electric current, we need to put an electrical
into the circuit, such as a lamp or motor, that can use the current to make something happen.
The bulb will only light if there is a battery and a complete circuit
to the circuit, so that we can break the circuit and stop the electric current when we want to.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The plan
Juliet's mother tells her to cheer up because her father has arranged for her to marry Paris. Juliet loses her temper and refuses. Her father comes in and can't believe how ungrateful she is being. He threatens to throw her out and disown her. He says he wants to hit her. She asks her mother to stand up for her, but she refuses.
The Nurse tells Juliet to forget Romeo and marry Paris
When Juliet's mother and father have left, Juliet asks the Nurse what she should do. The Nurse says to forget Romeo and just marry Paris without owning up. In those days, that would have been a sin, and to marry two people at once would mean that she would be sent to hell. Juliet says that she will do what the Nurse suggests, but when she leaves the room, Juliet says to herself that the Nurse is two-faced. She decides to see if Friar Lawrence will help her. If not, she thinks she will have to commit suicide.
Paris goes to visit Friar Lawrence to arrange his wedding to Juliet. The Friar tries to stall for more time. When Juliet arrives, she gives Paris 'the cold shoulder' until he leaves. She begs the Friar to help her, threatening to kill herself. The Friar has a plan if Juliet has the guts to carry it through. He knows of a drug that will make her seem as though she is dead for forty-two hours. This will mean that she will be put in the family tomb along with Tybalt. Then the Friar will let Romeo know the truth, so that he can come and take her away when she wakes up and they can go off together to Mantua. Juliet isn't scared. She takes the drug home with her.
Everyone is busy with wedding preparations at the Capulets' house. Capulet is in a good mood. Juliet tells her father that she has been to see the Friar to confess her sins and asks for her dad's forgiveness. Even the Nurse believes her.
Juliet says good night to her mum then starts to panic about what she is about to do. She might die. She might go mad when she wakes up in a tomb full of dead people. There might be ghosts. She imagines that she sees Tybalt's ghost. She takes the poison and falls unconscious on her bed.
The Nurse finds Juliet and thinks she is dead. She is beside herself with grief. The family comes running and her mother and father can't believe it. Friar Lawrence arrives pretending that he has come to take Juliet to church to marry Paris. Paris comes and is shocked at the news.

Humans have instincts, but it is possible for us to overcome natural urges to follow a certain behaviour. For example, a hungry person might want to start eating immediately when they sit down at the dinner table, but they have learned that good manners mean they should wait until everyone is seated and ready to eat.
Most people start smoking before they are adults
People often imitate each other. This can help them learn something new and useful, such as new skill in lessons, sport or at work. It can also lead them to show less useful behaviour. For example, young people may start smoking, drinking alcohol or taking drugs as a result of copying each other to fit in.
Conditioning can be used to change the behaviour of people. Advertisers are very skilled at this. They use pictures of their products which make the them look glamorous or exciting, often by using famous actors or sports people.
By associating the product with attractive images the advertisers are trying to set up a conditioned response to their product. People will respond positively and buy the product.

Magnets are made from magnetic materials. These are metals that can be magnetised or will be attracted to a magnet. Most materials are not magnetic, but

and the magnets push each other away.
We say that unlike poles attract, and like poles repel.
How can you test if a piece of metal is a magnet. Seeing if it sticks to a magnet is not a good test, because unmagnetised iron, steel, cobalt and nickel objects will be attracted to either pole of a magnet.
So you can't test for what it is attracted to. But you can test what it repels:

To work out pressure, we need to know two things:

Drawing pins make good use of pressure
Drawing pins have a large round end for you to push. The round end has a large area, so it applies a low pressure to your thumb. The sharp end has a very small area. The same pushing force produces a high pressure there, so it pushes into the notice board.
If you swing round on one leg of a chair, you put four times as much pressure on one point of the floor as you do if you sit properly. This is because four chair legs spread the pressure over four times more area than one chair leg can.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The proposal
Meanwhile, a nobleman called Paris visits Capulet to ask him if he can marry Juliet. Capulet asks him to wait two more summers, but suggest he romances his daughter and invites Paris to a party that evening. He gives his servant a list of names of people to invite.
The servant can't read. He bumps into Benvolio and Romeo and asks them to read the list for him. Rosaline's name, amongst others, is on the list. The servant doesn't know that Benvolio and Romeo are Montagues and invites them to the party, too.
Lady Capulet is sent to tell Juliet about Paris's proposal. They aren't very close so she asks Juliet's Nurse to stay and listen. Juliet will be fourteen on Lammas-eve, 31st July. Juliet tells her mother that she has never thought about marriage, but promises to take a look at Paris.

Atoms and elements - Metals v non-metals
Remember that most elements are metals, rather than non-metals. The table summarises some differences in their properties.
Solid (except mercury, which is a liquid)
About half are solids, about half are gases, and one (bromine) is a liquid
High (they feel heavy for their size)
Low (they feel light for their size)
Brittle (they break or shatter when hammered)
Poor (they are insulators, apart from graphite)
They make a ringing sound (they are sonorous)
Notice that metals and non-metals have opposite properties to each other. It is usually easy to tell metals and non-metals apart, but some tests are more reliable than others
For example using a magnet is not a good test to see if an element is a metal. That's because only three metals are magnetic, not all of them.

128,"> Inform, explain and describe - Explaining
When you explain, you don't just write information - you also need to give
. In very basic terms you can think of the difference between informing and explaining in terms of answering a slightly different set of questions:
Explain = What? When? Who? Where? How? Why?
This difference is reflected in the question you will be asked, so our question about the leaflet might look a little different now:
Write a leaflet for both the pupils and their parents, outlining some of the main features of school life in Year 7 and beyond. In particular, explain why pupils have several teachers each day and why the detention system is used.
This is a little harder than the earlier version, but it's still about your school. Therefore, you still need lots of information about the classes, the organisation and the timetable. So you could still use our two basic approaches, timelines and topic centres, like this:
However, you can also put these together, like this:
Now, we can see a number of topics, so perhaps the three big circles represent registration, lesson times and detentions. They occur in that order each day, but the reasons for them are very different. So the smaller circles answer how and why as well as what, when and who. For instance, what are detentions? When do they take place? Who is in charge of them? How do pupils get put in detention? Why does the school use detentions?
This approach gives your answer a very clear structure. The writing deals with a number of subjects in turn and each subject should be in its own paragraph. You can add details and explanations as you write out each paragraph. It makes it easier for you to write and easier for your audience to read or listen to.

Another top style tip is to avoid being boring. It sounds obvious, but many writers put in far too much information. In fact, some even write most of the question out again when they start their answer. So what should you do?
At the beginning, don't waffle, get straight to the point. Don't just repeat things in your conclusion. Put yourself in the reader's shoes - which of these two starts to a school magazine article do you prefer?
Do you know someone who is being bullied right now? Don't know what to do? Well we decided to send Stuart Smith (Year 8) around the school to find out just how bad bullying is, and to come up with some ideas about what we can do to stop it.
Bullying is when people are cruel to other people. It can be hurting them, like kicking them, or hurting them using horrible names. It could be other things too. My article for the school magazine is about bullying. I am going to start by saying what the problem of bullying is and then...
The first one is much better - it gets straight to the point and you want to read on. The second version repeats parts of the question, but for no reason. People who are reading the school magazine don't have to be reminded in each article that it is the school magazine. We also know the article is about bullying from the first sentence, but Stuart's definition is poor and the whole article is slow to get started.

The Tempest first key extract - Performance
When you talk about the performance of a play, you should think about how people in the audience feel as they watch it. For instance, the beginning of the first extract is magical and romantic. The tone changes in the middle to one of conflict.
Prospero has lots of asides (thoughts spoken aloud) in the first extract. His role in this scene is made more complex because his character is pretending to be something he is not. The director has to decide whether he wants us to see Prospero as a good father who wants the best for his daughter or a manipulative control freak.
Prospero also speaks to Ariel who is invisible to the other characters on the stage.
When Ariel appears, the director must decide how to present the 'illusion'. Ariel is invisible to the other characters. But it does not necessarily follow that he must be invisible to the audience, too. Try to imagine as many interesting and unusual ways to present Ariel - the 'invisible' sprite - as you can.
When you write about performance, you need to mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:
The characters and how you respond to them
The language used - the detail about freedom and slavery, for example
The issues and ideas - like love, magic and power
The performance instructions, such as stage directions

Imagine giving some advice to a friend who is being bullied. You'd probably think of a few ideas very quickly:
You could improve your work by adding other types of sentences. At the moment, it's just a list of orders. What about adding a question or two? Like this:
Why don't you talk to someone at school about it?
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now?
This pushes your friend to think about something. It also gives them the opportunity to start talking about it.
Then you could add a statement or two, like this:
Bullying is more common than many people think.
The worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone.
If we combine these ideas and sentences, we have an interesting and varied piece of writing. All we need to add are some connectives, like 'and', 'but', 'so' or 'because'. Now we have writing that makes a real impact and which can offer advice as well as persuading people, like this:
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now? Why don't you talk to someone at school about it? Because bullying is far more common than many people think. And it is far more serious than many people imagine. In fact, it is one of the main reasons for pupils missing school. But the worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone.

The different substances in mixtures are usually easily separated from one another. The method you use depends upon the type of mixture you have.
This is good for separating dissolved substances that have different colours, such as inks and plant dyes. It works because some of the coloured substances dissolve in the liquid better than others, so they travel further up the paper.
from a liquid. (An insoluble substance is one that does not dissolve).
Sand, for example, can be separated from a mixture of sand and water using filtration. That's because sand does not dissolve in water.
from a liquid (a soluble substance does dissolve, to form a solution).
For example copper sulfate crystals can be separated from copper sulfate solution using evaporation. Remember that it is the water that evaporates away, not the solution.
from a solution. For example, water can be separated from salty water by simple distillation. This method works because the water evaporates from the solution, but is then cooled and condensed into a separate container. The salt does not evaporate and so it stays behind.

Take a look at the final paragraph of the article about boxing.
In conclusion, both sides of the debate have solid foundations. As has been shown, the arguments for and against have been put forward since boxing began. And, it would seem, the argument will continue for at least the foreseeable future, as compromise seems unlikely. Both sides do agree, however, that the debate is better held whilst boxing is licensed and controlled rather than unlicensed and uncontrolled. The latter would make it, in my opinion, neither sport nor spectacle.
As you can see, the writer clearly signals that the end is approaching by using the connecting phrase ""In conclusion"". It maintains the impersonal approach it set out with by stating that the argument will continue and that ""compromise seems unlikely"".

Romeo and Juliet first key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Montagues and Capulets have just had a fight in a public place in Verona. Prince Escalus stopped it and warned that if it happens again, those involved will be punished by death.
The first set scene begins with Montague asking Benvolio how the fight began.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
Benvolio tells him that servants from both families were fighting and that when he tried to stop them, Tybalt turned on him.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.
After that, lots of other people joined in until the Prince came and stopped the fighting.
Lady Montague is worried about her son, Romeo. He wasn't involved in the fighting but she wonders where he is. Benvolio explains that he saw him skulking about before dawn. Montague says that this is not unusual behaviour for Romeo: people have seen him crying and sighing on his own before daybreak before.
The audience finds out a lot about Romeo before he even walks onto the stage. What are your first impressions of Romeo?
Montague says he has tried to talk to his son, but he won't open up to him.
Parents and children - You might be able to sympathise with Romeo not wanting to talk about his feelings with his father.
He says he is like a flower that never gets to open because it has been stopped from blossoming by a worm that has eaten into it.
This is a simile to show that no one can get near to Romeo whilst he is in such a bad mood.
When Romeo arrives, Montague and Lady Montague leave Benvolio to try and find out why he is in such a bad mood all of the time.
- Time - There are lots of references to time in this play. The events in this play take place in just less than one week. Romeo and Juliet both feel that time drags whilst they are apart from one another.
Romeo tries to explain that he is in love with a girl who doesn't love him back. He doesn't make himself very clear though and Benvolio has to work hard to get him to tell him about it. Romeo comes up with lots of confusing descriptions of love to try and explain how he feels.
The list of opposites in Romeo's speech ('loving hate', 'heavy lightness', etc) are called oxymorons. They give us an important clue to his character. His confusing speech shows us how confusing the world is to him as a young man. It also shows us that Romeo likes to play with language.
""Here's much to do with hate, but more with love""
- Love and Hate - Romeo is commenting on the street brawl that has just happened: it's about hating an opposing family and feeling love and loyalty towards their own. Taken on its own, the line sums up the play as a whole: it's about two families that hate each other, but more about the love between Romeo and Juliet.
Romeo speaks in rhyme to try to describe how he feels.
Romeo's speeches are often in rhyme. He also likes wordplay, metaphors and similes. Romeo loves to talk about love, but does he really know what love is at this point? You could say that Romeo, at this point is 'all talk and no action'.
He says that love is like smoke made from the hot breath of lovers and that the flames are the sparks in their eyes. But if it doesn't work out, love is a sea of tears. He also describes love as a kind of madness and a poison.
- Love - The language that Romeo uses to describe love gives us an idea of what Romeo believes love to be at this point. For him it's about desire, which sounds like lust rather than true love.
Benvolio brings Romeo back to earth with a straightforward question: who is the girl he is in love with?
Whilst Romeo is pouring his heart out, Benvolio's responses could be performed in a number of ways- sympathetic, impatient, humorous. All three work.
Romeo still won't give him a straight answer though.
Romeo and Benvolio are good friends. We can see this through the way they banter with one another.
He tells Benvolio that the girl is very beautiful but she doesn't want to fall in love. It seems that she is very pure and Romeo says that because she isn't interested in men, her beauty will be wasted!
- Love - We never meet Rosaline in the play and only have Romeo's description of her to go by. It's hard to tell whether she really is a very good girl or whether she simply doesn't fancy Romeo!
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste
Benvolio says that the best thing to do is to forget her. He advises Romeo to look at other attractive girls. Romeo swears that he can never forget her; he'll never find anyone as beautiful as her. Benvolio bets that he will.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.

Maps scales can be written in ratios and tell you how many units of land, sea etc are equal to one unit on the map.
If you are travelling from Manchester to Newcastle, for example, and need to know how far it is, it would be very difficult to work this out if the map does not have a scale.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. A distance is measured as 3cm on the map.
How many cm, m and km is this equivalent to in real life?
1 cm on the map represents 50 000cm. Therefore, 3cm on the map represents 150 000cm.
To convert from cm to m, divide by 100.
To convert from m to km divide by 1000.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. What distance on the map will represent 5km?
5km = 5000m = 5000  100 cm = 500 000cm
We want to know what distance on the map represents 500 000cm in real life.
The map scale is 1:50 000, so we divide by 50 000

The movement of characters is less obvious - it's just two characters having a chat. The director has to make sure that this is interesting to look at on stage.
Again, in the second extract, two characters are talking. The director has to think creatively so that the action is interesting to watch.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - Language
Think about how language is used in the two Key Extracts - for example, where it seems the same in both, and where it seems different.
When Montague talks about how Romeo is in a bad mood and avoiding sunlight, he uses lots of imagery to do with darkness.
When Romeo describes Juliet he uses lots of words and imagery to do with light. Even the night imagery involves brightness with stars and the moon.
The metaphors and similes used by the characters in the first extract (especially Romeo) are quite complicated. Benvolio and Romeo enjoy using puns to make jokes together. Language is used in clever ways.
Romeo still uses language skillfully, but Juliet wants honesty rather than clever poetry. When Romeo starts to swear by the moon, she won't let him finish his clever metaphor. Juliet uses imagery to make her thoughts clear, eg Romeo is like a rose; Juliet's love is as deep as the sea.
Much of the first extract is in rhyme. In the scene between Romeo and Benvolio, this helps to bring out the humour in their banter.
Romeo and Juliet both speak in blank verse: they are talking about love in a much more sensitive way than Romeo did when he was talking to Benvolio. Juliet's final line in the scene finishes Romeo's to make one line of blank verse. (Blank verse is unrhymed and has lines that have 10 syllables each). This shows how close they have become.
If you get a question about language in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with your answer:
How is love described in the two extracts?
Love is described in many different ways in the two extracts. By the second extract, love is described in a more positive light.
In the first extract, Romeo uses oxymorons because he is confused about his feelings for Rosaline. Romeo compares love to poison and madness.
In the second extract, Romeo uses words to do with light and heaven when describing his feelings for Juliet. Juliet talks about love in terms of truth and promises.
In the first extract, love means many different things to Romeo. Love is confusing to Romeo and seems to have a dark side that he has no control over. Love is ruining his life. By the end of the first extract, you might think that Romeo has confused his feelings of lust for love. In the second extract, love is related to light and heaven for Romeo. Perhaps when he meets Juliet, he realizes what true love is. For Juliet, love is about truth and honesty. She is almost overwhelmed by her feelings for Romeo. For both characters, love is a powerful and wonderful force.

Before this scene, Prospero and his slave, Caliban have exchanged cross words.
The First Key Extract begins with Ferdinand hearing Ariel's song.
Ariel's song calms the stormy waters. In 'The Tempest', music is linked closely to magic and illusion.
He wonders where the sounds are coming from.
Illusion - Ferdinand does not know where the sound is coming from. He assumes that it is magic and tells us that the music not only calmed the storm, but also made him feel better.
He follows the sound, and when the song begins again, it suggests to Ferdinand that his father has drowned.
When Miranda sees Ferdinand approaching, she can't believe her eyes. She doesn't think that Ferdinand is real.
Illusion - Ferdinand is a living human being, but Miranda is convinced that he is a magical creature. In 'The Tempest', things are never quite as they at first seem.
Prospero explains that he is a man, not a spirit and that he is looking for other survivors of the shipwreck. Prospero feels excited that Miranda and Ferdinand seem to like each other: it was his plan all along
Power - Prospero claims that he has used magic to make Miranda and Ferdinand fall in love. Prospero likes to control and manipulate people through his magic.
, and he promises to reward Ariel with his freedom for helping to get them together.
Ferdinand asks Miranda if she is an ordinary girl or a goddess.
Miranda can't believe that Ferdinand is an ordinary mortal. She thinks he's a 'spirit'. She calls him 'divine' and 'noble'. Ferdinand refers to her as a 'goddess'. The language they use suggests that they worship one another.
He is shocked when she speaks his language. When he hints that he is the King of Naples, Prospero challenges him.
Prospero likes to be in control. As soon as Ferdinand suggests that he has any sort of power, Prospero tries to undermine him. Prospero's questions are sarcastic and mocking in his attempt to show Ferdinand who is boss.
Ferdinand sadly explains that he believes that his father, the King of Naples, has drowned in the shipwreck along with the Duke of Milan and his son. Prospero watches Ferdinand and thinks to himself that he will be able to manipulate him easily now that Ferdinand is in love with his daughter.
Think carefully about what kind of man Prospero is. Is he a caring father who will do anything to get the best for his daughter? Is he manipulative and controlling? Love is a powerful emotion. Should people use love to control others?
Miranda can't understand why her father is being so abrupt with Ferdinand. She has fallen in love at first sight with Ferdinand.
Love - Miranda admits that she has feelings for Ferdinand. It is the first time she has ever felt this way. Do you think that she would have fallen in love with Ferdinand even without Prospero's magic?
She wishes that her father could see things from her point of view.
When Ferdinand offers to make Miranda his queen, Prospero steps in. He is worried that his plan won't work if Ferdinand wins Miranda's heart too easily.
Prospero says: 'But this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning/Make the prize light'. He means that he can't let Ferdinand think that it was too easy to get Miranda to be his girlfriend, because he might not treat her well if it's really easy to make her love him.
He says that Ferdinand is lying about being a king and accuses him of being a spy.
Power/ Illusion - Prospero wants to manipulate Ferdinand. He will make him suffer and work hard for Miranda's love. When Ferdinand claims to have some power of his own as the heir to the throne, Prospero takes this power away by accusing him of being a spy and taking him prisoner. Prospero knows that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne. 'The Tempest' is all about the confusion between what is true and real, and what is illusion.
Miranda tries to speak up for him
You might think that Miranda is brave to speak up for Ferdinand. Apart from being a powerful magician, Prospero has quite a temper! Her speech also shows us how innocent she is. She can't believe that anyone who looks so lovely on the outside can be anything other than lovely on the inside. In 'The Tempest', Shakespeare shows us that things are not always as they first seem.
but Prospero tells her off and threatens to imprison Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Ferdinand a 'traitor'. He threatens to 'manacle' his neck and give him sea water to drink and acorn shells to eat. Prospero doesn't mean any of these threats, but in making them he shows that he has power over Ferdinand and could make him a slave just as he made Caliban his slave. Throughout the extract, Prospero uses words like 'usurp', 'traitor' and 'impostor' which all seem a bit strong when referring to Ferdinand. When Antonio took Prospero's place as Duke of Milan, he did 'usurp' him, and in doing so, he was a 'traitor' and in calling himself the Duke of Milan, Antonio is an 'imposter'.
When Ferdinand draws his sword, Prospero uses magic to make it impossible for Ferdinand to move.
Miranda tries desperately to stop her father but he won't listen. Ferdinand comes to the conclusion that all his problems - his father's death, the shipwreck, Prospero's threats - mean nothing, as long as he can see Miranda once a day, even if he is in prison.
Love/ Illusion - Ferdinand suddenly doesn't mind being Prospero's prisoner, as long as he has Miranda to love. He says it's all like a 'dream'. Does love have that kind of dream-like power to overcome difficulties? Or is it another one of Prospero's spells?
Prospero is pleased that his plan to make Ferdinand fall in love with Miranda has worked. He praises Ariel
Love/ Illusion - When Prospero tells Ariel that he has done well, this suggests that Miranda and Ferdinand's attraction towards one another is not true love, but a magic trick, an illusion, that Ariel has conjured.
Prospero promises Ariel that he will be free
Freedom and Slavery - Just as Prospero has made Caliban a slave and threatened to imprison Ferdinand, he has the power to set Ariel free. When Prospero arrived on the island, Ariel was trapped in a pine tree and Prospero set him free, so he has a debt of gratitude towards him. Also, Ariel is gentle whereas Prospero has a temper. It could be that Ariel is a little afraid of his master.
if he carries out all of his commands. Ariel agrees. Prospero orders Ferdinand to follow him and tells Miranda not to try and speak up for him.
Ariel's song calms the stormy waters. In 'The Tempest', music is linked closely to magic and illusion.
Illusion - Ferdinand does not know where the sound is coming from. He assumes that it is magic and tells us that the music not only calmed the storm, but also made him feel better.
Illusion - Ferdinand is a living human being, but Miranda is convinced that he is a magical creature. In 'The Tempest', things are never quite as they at first seem.
Power - Prospero claims that he has used magic to make Miranda and Ferdinand fall in love. Prospero likes to control and manipulate people through his magic.
Miranda can't believe that Ferdinand is an ordinary mortal. She thinks he's a 'spirit'. She calls him 'divine' and 'noble'. Ferdinand refers to her as a 'goddess'. The language they use suggests that they worship one another.
Prospero likes to be in control. As soon as Ferdinand suggests that he has any sort of power, Prospero tries to undermine him. Prospero's questions are sarcastic and mocking in his attempt to show Ferdinand who is boss.
Think carefully about what kind of man Prospero is. Is he a caring father who will do anything to get the best for his daughter? Is he manipulative and controlling? Love is a powerful emotion. Should people use love to control others?
Love - Miranda admits that she has feelings for Ferdinand. It is the first time she has ever felt this way. Do you think that she would have fallen in love with Ferdinand even without Prospero's magic?
Prospero says: 'But this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning/Make the prize light'. He means that he can't let Ferdinand think that it was too easy to get Miranda to be his girlfriend, because he might not treat her well if it's really easy to make her love him.
Power/ Illusion - Prospero wants to manipulate Ferdinand. He will make him suffer and work hard for Miranda's love. When Ferdinand claims to have some power of his own as the heir to the throne, Prospero takes this power away by accusing him of being a spy and taking him prisoner. Prospero knows that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne. 'The Tempest' is all about the confusion between what is true and real, and what is illusion.
You might think that Miranda is brave to speak up for Ferdinand. Apart from being a powerful magician, Prospero has quite a temper! Her speech also shows us how innocent she is. She can't believe that anyone who looks so lovely on the outside can be anything other than lovely on the inside. In 'The Tempest', Shakespeare shows us that things are not always as they first seem.
Prospero calls Ferdinand a 'traitor'. He threatens to 'manacle' his neck and give him sea water to drink and acorn shells to eat. Prospero doesn't mean any of these threats, but in making them he shows that he has power over Ferdinand and could make him a slave just as he made Caliban his slave. Throughout the extract, Prospero uses words like 'usurp', 'traitor' and 'impostor' which all seem a bit strong when referring to Ferdinand. When Antonio took Prospero's place as Duke of Milan, he did 'usurp' him, and in doing so, he was a 'traitor' and in calling himself the Duke of Milan, Antonio is an 'imposter'.
Love/ Illusion - Ferdinand suddenly doesn't mind being Prospero's prisoner, as long as he has Miranda to love. He says it's all like a 'dream'. Does love have that kind of dream-like power to overcome difficulties? Or is it another one of Prospero's spells?
Love/ Illusion - When Prospero tells Ariel that he has done well, this suggests that Miranda and Ferdinand's attraction towards one another is not true love, but a magic trick, an illusion, that Ariel has conjured.
Freedom and Slavery - Just as Prospero has made Caliban a slave and threatened to imprison Ferdinand, he has the power to set Ariel free.

396,"> Writer's tricks - Persuading the reader
Some persuasive texts aim simply at persuading us to do something, particularly charity leaflets, holiday brochures and adverts. Others may try in more subtle ways; newspaper and magazine articles may try to persuade us to agree with a certain view.
Try to convince us to do or agree with something, such as spending money or agreeing with a certain belief.
Contain a mixture of fact and opinion.
Emphasise key points by using subheadings, repetition, memorable phrases and emotive language.
Often use a personal style so that the text seems to speak directly to the reader.
Show clear links between points, such as ""if you donate 20 you will be helping a sick animal"" or ""using our deodorant will attract women"".
Stories can also be persuasive as well. A writer may want you to like or dislike a character. The way that they describe a character can persuade you to do either of these. Look at this extract from 'Jane Eyre':
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at the table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye with flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mamma had taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate health'.
How does Charlotte Bront try to persuade, or convince, us that John Reed is an unpleasant character in this paragraph?
She makes him sound unattractive, with his ""dingy and unwholesome skin"" and ""heavy limbs"".
She suggests that he is greedy as he ""gorged himself habitually at the table"". She suggests that this is why he is so unhealthy, so that we don't feel sorry for him.
She makes him sound spoilt because his mother is keeping him home from school, even though his so-called ""delicate health"" is his own fault.

This is the general word equation for the reaction:
The salt produced depends upon the metal and the acid. Here are two examples:
It doesn't matter which metal or acid is used, if there is a reaction we always get hydrogen gas as well as the salt.
There is a simple laboratory test to see if a gas is hydrogen. A lighted wooden splint goes pop if it is put into a test tube of hydrogen. This is because the flame ignites the hydrogen, which burns explosively to make a loud sound.
All acids contain hydrogen atoms. Apart from hydrochloric acid, this is not clear from their names, but you can tell they contain hydrogen from their chemical formulae. Remember that the chemical symbol for hydrogen is H.

The Second Key Extract takes place outside Prospero's cave. Ferdinand is carrying logs. He thinks to himself that he doesn't mind the hard work because he is doing it for Miranda,

Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
Miranda comes to see him. Neither of them realise that Prospero is watching them from a distance.
On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance?
Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
but he says he has too much to do, so she offers to carry some logs for him.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
He says he would rather break his back than see her work. Miranda insists again that she should help him.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Looking on, Prospero sees how much Miranda is in love with Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Ferdinand asks Miranda her name and when she tells him, she remembers that in doing so, she has broken her promise to her father.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand admits that he has liked lots of different women in the past

, but they have always disappointed him with some fault or other in the end.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
However, Miranda, he says, is perfect. Miranda, on the other hand, hasn't met any men except for her father, or any women, except for herself. Even so, she says that she can't imagine liking anyone more than she likes Ferdinand.
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand tells her that he is a prince, possibly a king (although he hopes his father isn't dead). He wouldn't usually put up with having to carry logs like a slave
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
but he knew as soon as he saw Miranda that he'd do anything for her. When Miranda asks him if he loves her, Ferdinand says he loves, prizes and honours her more than anything else in the world. This makes Miranda so happy that she cries. As Prospero watches them together, he is moved.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Ferdinand asks Miranda why she is crying. She says she thinks she isn't good enough for him
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!
but realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else. Ferdinand happily agrees to marry her. They say goodbye and part.
Prospero is happy for them, but he claims that their engagement is no surprise to him as it was all part of his plan. He goes to get his magic book because he has lots of work to do before supper time.

Food chains - Changes to food webs
Let's look at the food web again and ask some questions about its predator-prey relationships, with some possible answers.
What would happen if the grass died?
The grass is the producer, so if it died the consumers that feed on it - rabbits, insects and slugs - would have no food. They would starve and die unless they could move to another habitat. All the other animals in the food web would die too, because their food supplies would have died out. The populations of the consumers would fall as the population of the producer fell.
What would happen if the population of slugs decreased?
Slugs, rabbits and insects all eat grass. If there were fewer slugs there would be more grass for the rabbits and insects. With more food the populations of rabbits and insects would increase. However, the thrushes would have to eat more insects to maintain their population, so it is also possible that the population of insects could decrease. This is turn may reduce the populations of voles and frogs.
What would happen if the population of insects decreased?
There would be more food for the rabbits and slugs, so their populations would increase. However, there would be less food for the frogs and voles, so their populations would decrease. This means less food for the foxes and hawks. However, there are likely to be more rabbits and thrushes for them to eat, so their populations are likely to stay the same.

395,"> Inform, explain and describe - Informing
The key thing about writing to inform is that you stick to the information. You shouldn't really show many of your own feelings, and you definitely don't want to tell your audience how they should feel. Instead, when you inform you make the facts easy to understand, with a clear structure.
Write an information leaflet for Year 6 pupils, telling them about the school day and what they need to know when they start your school in September.
It's important to structure your answer well. Think of the answer in terms of a drawing, like this:
This is a timeline - the arrow is time moving forwards and the four lines are different events in order. Now, you can think of the school day as the arrow, and plan the different events in a typical day. For instance, you could have registration, then an assembly, then two lessons followed by break. It should be easy to add information and detail. The structure also makes it easy for the Year 6 pupils to follow your information. Another way to inform is by subject, as in the diagram below:
These are points linked together. It is not in order of time, but in order of subject. So you could have PE at the centre with all the information connected to PE in the little circles around. For instance, you could have different types of PE kit, the different sports, the sort of exercises you do. Once you have written about PE, you can move on to look at other areas of the school.

The Tempest second key extract - Issues and ideas
The two extracts deal with some deep issues. You will need to discuss how these are brought out. Some of the 'big' themes are:
If the question asks you to comment on how the theme of power is explored, consider these points:
In the first extract, Ariel's songs calm the storm and make Ferdinand believe that his father is dead. This puts Ferdinand in a weak position which makes it easier for Prospero to manipulate him. Ariel's magic powers are responsible for much of what happens in the play.
Ariel only performs his magic so that he can win his freedom. Prospero has power over Ariel because Ariel owes him a debt of gratitude.
It could be argued that Prospero's assertion of power and authority over Ferdinand is unnecessarily harsh.
Prospero is obsessed with power and authority having had his title taken from him by his brother Antonio.
As a prince, Ferdinand's royal power becomes redundant on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero sees Miranda and Ferdinand's love as a power that he can use to manipulate Ferdinand.
Miranda seems powerless under her father's control on the island. She rebels against him, but even her rebellion was part of Prospero's plan.
Miranda and Ferdinand's love is a power that exists independently of magic.

Think about how language is used in the two Key Extracts - for example, patterns of language that appear in both, or how language changes from the first to the second extract.
Love is strongly linked to magic. Miranda thinks that Ferdinand is a ""spirit"". He thinks that she is a ""goddess"". It is strongly suggested that their love at first sight is simply an illusion.
Miranda and Ferdinand's speeches are very honest and loving. Ferdinand is ""humble"", whilst Miranda talks of her ""modesty"".
When Prospero describes love he uses terms linked to control, e.g ""They are both in either's powers""; his daughter will ""control"" Ferdinand.
Prospero recognises that Miranda and Ferdinand's love is real and beyond their control. He compares it to a disease. He says his daughter is ""infected"".
There are lots of references to freedom and slavery. Prospero promises to free Ariel; he threatens to ""manacle"" Ferdinand. Ferdinand doesn't mind being a slave as long as he has Miranda to love.
Ferdinand uses a metaphor linked to slavery to describe his past crushes. He admits that he only suffers the indignity of being Prospero's slave for Miranda's sake.
The exchanges between characters are short to speed up the action.
The speeches between Miranda and Ferdinand are much longer. The content is moving and romantic.

b) An essay should always be written using formal language. All of the other situations would suit a more informal style.
Tips to make your informal writing more effective
""Dear reader, I'm really glad you've found the time to open this letter.""
2. It's okay sometimes to use the kind of words that are more usual in speech than writing:
""You don't have to put up with bullying. We'll stick together and make it stop.""
3. Contractions sound more natural in certain types of writing eg a talk to fellow students:
""It's good to know that we're all going to work together on this.""
Don't baffle your reader with too much slang.
Think carefully about structure - informal writing is different to speech and needs carefully planned paragraphs to keep it clear and easy to read.
Sometimes there is opportunity to break the rules of Standard English and use English in unexpected ways. Two good examples of writers who achieve this are poet Benjamin Zephaniah and writer Andrea Levy in her book Small Island.
If you're asked to write a story, it would be a mistake for you as the author to use incorrect grammar and slang - but inside speech marks, your characters can!

Another way to add detail to your descriptions is to use your senses. Think about what you can see, what you can touch, what you can smell, what you can taste and what you can hear. If we go back to your house, you might be able to add sounds, like music from your sister's room, the sound of the neighbour's lawnmower, or a baby crying upstairs.

Ivan Pavlov (1849 to 1936) was a Russian scientist who investigated conditioning. He discovered that dogs produced extra saliva when they were offered food. This is a natural response to a stimulus - food makes a dog's mouth water. The saliva produced is needed to start digesting food and to make swallowing food easier.
Pavlov noticed that they also did this when the person who fed them came into the room, even if the person had not brought any food. Pavlov went on to ring a bell at the start of feeding time, and eventually the dogs produced extra saliva when they heard the bell, before any food was brought in.
A dog salivating when it hears a bell is not a natural response. They would not do this without being conditioned to do so. The behaviour has been learned. It's called a

Wind, rain and waves can all cause weathering. The wind can blow tiny grains of sand against a rock. These wear the rock away and weather it. Rain and waves can also wear away rock over long periods of time.
Water expands slightly when it freezes into ice. This is why water pipes sometimes burst in the winter. You might have seen a demonstration of this sort of thing at school - a jar filled to the brim with water eventually shatters after it is put into a freezer.
The formation of ice can also break rocks. If water gets into a crack in a rock and then

Prospero is in control of the action. He even slows the pace down at one point to suit his own ends. He could be compared to Shakespeare, moving the plot forward and molding events.
Prospero watches from a distance and comments occasionally but does not interfere. It is as though he is part of the audience.

A moving and romantic extract that contrasts with the scene before it which is full of Mercutio's rude jokes.
Ariel is present at the beginning. Prospero uses magic to prevent Ferdinand from using his sword. Ferdinand seems to submit very quickly at the end of this extract, as though magic may have had some part to play.
There is no sign of magic in this extract. The setting is very ordinary as Ferdinand carries logs to Prospero's cave. Any ""magic"" that exists is in the form of the power of love.
Both Ferdinand and Miranda seem bewildered by their feelings.

The extract below is from a leaflet about passive smoking.
. Passive smoking is breathing in other people's tobacco smoke. Other people's tobacco smoke is sometimes called environmental tobacco smoke.
. Only 15% of the smoke from a cigarette is inhaled by the smoker - the rest goes into the surrounding air and other people can breathe it in. Breathing air which contains tobacco smoke can be bad for your health. This is because the tiny particles and gases in tobacco smoke contain over 4000 chemicals, many of which are harmful - at least 60 are known to cause cancer. The gases also contain carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas that comes out of car exhausts.
Q. What is the effect on my health?
. Breathing other people's smoke is uncomfortable and can cause:
nose, throat and chest irritation and breathing difficulties

Q5. Give one reason why you think this.
Q6. Look at the second answer that the writer has given in the leaflet: the one beginning ""Only 15% of the smoke..."". Explain two ways in which the writer has used language to persuade the reader that passive smoking is dangerous.
Q7. Why has the writer phrased each heading as a question?
Q8. Explain two ways in which the writer has used layout to make the text more effective.
A1. Passive smoking is 'breathing in other people's tobacco smoke'.
A2. 15% is inhaled by the smoker.
A3. Coughing. (You could name any of the effects listed in the bullet points.)
A4. The target audience could be teenagers, or a broad audience. It is the reason that you give in the next answer that is more important.
A5. Reasons are: the language used is quite simple; sentences are mainly quite short and simple, many only contain one or two ideas; the information is broken up into short sections; the headings make the information easy to follow. All these would make the text accessible for many readers, including young people.
A6. There are three main ways: the simple statement that it is 'bad for your health'; the fact that tobacco smoke contains 'over 4000 chemicals', many of which are harmful; the mention of carbon monoxide which is 'poisonous'.
A7. The headings are phrased as questions to draw the reader into the text.

Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts
A salt is always made when an acid is neutralised by a base. But the exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used.
The name of a salt has two parts:
the first part comes from the metal in the base used
the second part comes from the acid that was used
Where does the name potassium nitrate come from?
These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt:
How can we make copper sulfate? The first part of the name is 'copper', so we need a base containing copper. We could use copper oxide or copper carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'sulfate', so we need to use sulfuric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
copper sulfate + water + carbon dioixde
How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
sodium chloride + water + carbon dioxide
It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced.

If you ride your bike over a bump in the road, you will be pleased that gases exert
on the walls of their container. A pumped-up tyre cushions the rider against bumps, but a flat tyre does not. The pressure of the air inside a flat tyre is just too low to do this.
The particles in a gas move quickly in all directions, but they don't get far before they bump into each other or the walls of their container. When gas particles hit the walls of their container they cause pressure. The more particles that hit the walls, the higher the pressure.
This is why the pressure in a tyre or balloon goes up when more air is pumped in.
Gas particles hit the walls of their container and cause pressure
. They hit the walls of their container harder and more often. This increases the pressure. Sometimes the pressure gets so great that the container bursts.

This was the worst nightmare yet. He was standing with his back pressed against a smooth wall cold as ice. The cold nibbled at his buttocks and legs; it ran up and down the knobbles of his spine, making him shiver; it invaded his lungs so he could hardly breathe; he felt he had been shivering a long time.
In the extract, the writer intends to create a very creepy, sinister atmosphere. The way that he describes Ralph's imprisonment makes it sound very unpleasant. He is ""pressed"" against a wall that is ""cold as ice"" and the cold is creeping into every part of his body, making him shiver. Ralph also feels as if he can ""hardly breathe"" because of the cold.
. The simile; ""a smooth wall cold as ice"", helps the reader relate to Ralph as they will know what ice feels like. The writer also uses personification; the cold ""nibbled"" at Ralph, it ""ran up and down"" his back and ""invaded"" his lungs. This makes the cold sound as if it were alive, running over and into Ralph, trying to eat away at him. This adds to the feeling that he has been overpowered and is in danger.

rubbish is important because fewer landfill sites are needed, and the materials in the rubbish are re-used.
Fertilisers are chemicals used by farmers to help their crops grow well. Rain can wash fertilizers off the fields and into rivers. This causes water plants to overgrow and block out the light. Other plants die as a result. They use up oxygen as they rot away, and fish and other animals suffocate. This process is called eutrophication.

You might notice that some teachers are more interesting to listen to than others. It is not necessarily what they say that keeps you interested, but often how they say it. What do your teachers do to keep your attention? Make a list then compare it with the tips below.
Your listeners will switch off if they can't hear you. Use a loud and clear voice, and if you're unsure if your audience can hear you at the back - just ask ""Can you hear me at the back?""
If you speak too quickly, you won't be clear. If you speak too slowly, your audience is likely to go to sleep. Vary your pace for effect and use dramatic pauses where appropriate.
If you speak like a robot, in the same boring tone, your audience will quickly drift off. Speak naturally and use the pitch of your voice to show your emotions.

Again, keep it natural, but if you stand like a statue, you won't be very interesting to watch or listen to. On the other hand, too much arm flapping and leg hopping will distract your audience from the point you're trying to make.
Use them, but use them effectively. They need to be big enough to see, interesting to look at and relevant to what you are talking about. Don't be tempted to make a big poster to hide behind!
Choose words that are interesting, descriptive and appropriate to your audience. Don't baffle your audience with jargon or slang or lots of big words that are too difficult for anyone else to understand.
If it's appropriate to your audience and task, try to use Standard English. You don't have to be too formal or put on a silly accent, just speak in a way that is easy for everyone to understand.
Most people feel nervous about speaking formally in front of other people. Here are some tips to help you conquer your nerves:
Write your speech out in full and read it several times - this will help you gain confidence in the content.
Prepare small cards with key points of your speech. By now you should be familiar with your speech so these points will help you keep to your structure. Avoid the temptation to read your speech in full - the idea is to test your speaking skills, not your reading skills!
Practice your performance before the real thing. Try practicing at home on your own, and then in front of family or friends. If you have visual aids, be sure to practice using them.

368,"A debate is an organised argument. You might think you've never taken part in a debate before but you probably have without realising it! When you discuss topics in class or at home, and put forward different points of view - this is debating. Debating allows you to discuss your ideas and find out what other people think about a particular topic.
If you're asked to take part in an organised debate at school, this is likely to be a more formal discussion and follow a set of rules.
Here are some simple rules for formal debates:
First of all, you need two teams: the proposition team and the opposition team.
Then you need something to argue about. This is called a motion.
The proposition team starts. Their first speaker has to tell everyone what the motion is all about.
The opposition team goes next. Then the teams take it in turns until everyone has had their say.
The last speaker on each team has to sum up their team's main argument.
Your team will need to do plenty of preparation - writing out the main points of your argument. During the debate, your team is allowed to pass notes to each other so that you can add or change things as you go along. The most convincing team wins the debate. Try to guess in advance what your opposing team might argue to avoid being caught out.
Use these tips to make your arguments as convincing as you can:
Use facts - it's hard to argue against a fact so use as much evidence and as many statistics as possible.
Use opinion too - debating is all about getting your opinion across and persuading others to agree with you, so use a good balance of fact and opinion.
Listen to the other team and comment on what they have said. You then have a chance to convince the audience of the other side of the argument.
Structure your argument - as if you were writing an essay, you need a clear introduction, a middle and a conclusion.
Arguing isn't about shouting the loudest - present your arguments in a clear controlled voice. Don't lose your temper or get too emotional about the arguments.
Improve your public speaking and maybe you'll be TV Presenter one day. But it's not all bad!

258,"> Decimals - Adding and subtracting decimals
When adding and subtracting decimals, remember is to keep the decimal points in line in the question and the answer.
David is doing some DIY. He buys a 2m length of wood. He needs to cut two pieces of wood - one of length 0.6m and one of length 1.02m.
What is the total length of wood that David needs to cut?
So the total length of wood that David needs to cut is 1.62m.
You can add zeros to the end of a decimal without affecting its value, so 0.6 is the same as 0.60.
David originally had 2m of wood. What is the length of the piece of wood that is left?
David cut off 1.62m, so we need to calculate 2 - 1.62
So there is 0.38m of wood left.

Rounding 12.756 or 4.543 to 1 decimal place (d.p.) seems sensible, as the rounded figures are very close to the actual value.
But what happens if you round a very small number to 1 d.p?
This is not a useful answer. Another way to find an approximate answer with very small numbers is to use
Significant figures start at the first non-zero number, so ignore the zeros at the front, but not the ones in between. Look at the following examples:

125,"Here's a brief outline of the different types of sentences (if you want more details, look at
A simple sentence generally has one main verb and communicates one idea. For example:
There can be several words in the verb, so
- has two words in the verb.
- has three words in the verb.
However, in each example there is just one main verb and idea. This is the simplest type of sentence and usually it's very easy to understand.
A compound sentence generally joins two simple sentences together. We typically use words like 'and', 'or' and 'but' to join the ideas. For example:
It was cold but we still went to town.
It was raining and we stayed indoors.
This makes the two ideas equal in the sentence - if we take away one part of it, we are left with a simple sentence again. These are very common when we are speaking and they are not difficult to understand.
A complex sentence communicates more than one idea, so it's like a compound sentence in a way. However, the ideas are not equal. This is because one part is like a simple sentence, so it can stand on its own. The other part can't - it needs something else to support it. For instance, look at this sentence:
You can't persuade me to go to town, no matter how hard you try.
We can take away the first part, but then we are left with:
Now this is not a simple sentence and it doesn't stand on its own - it needs something else to make sense.
We use complex sentences a lot when we speak, but it's important to use them in our writing too. In fact, these are the most difficult sentences to get right.

Formal and informal writing - The writer's ""voice""
We all have different ways of expressing ourselves in our speech and in our writing. In writing, this is sometimes called voice.
Good writers have a unique voice or style of writing.
Here are two very different styles of writing:
I suppose I could tell you all about where I was born, what it was like when Mum was still around, what happened when I was a little kid, all that kind of stuff, but it's not really relevant.
My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip.
Can you guess which line is from Charles Dickens's novel Great Expectations and which one is from Kevin Brooks's novel Martyn Pig?

A short-story is easy to write if you:
Have only one or two main characters. It's a short story and you don't have time for any more.
Use people's words and actions as much as possible. Don't try to give lots of background information - let the reader use their own imagination. Remember - creative writing means creative reading too!
Make your characters and plot realistic. How do people really speak and act? Remember, most writers base some of their characters on people they actually know, so who can you use to improve your story? Would your granny make a good secret agent or your uncle a confident contract killer?
Get straight to the point. Don't worry about long openings or lots of detail. Instead, launch right in, hopefully in the middle of some action, like in the example below.
Steve held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - he was too shocked to speak. One moment he had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next he was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
You will also have to decide whether to write in the first person (using ""I""), or in the third person (typically, using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they""). Using ""I"" makes it easier to write about thoughts and feelings, but using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they"" lets you move from person to person, or from place to place. You can choose whichever you feel happiest with. For instance, we can swap the opening of the story into the first person, like this:
I held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - I was too shocked to speak. One moment I had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next I was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
The only thing you shouldn't do is swap the person - dont start with ""I"" and then switch to ""he"", or you'll spoil the story.

The solution of the equations is therefore
Use the substitution method to solve the following simultaneous equations:
Substitute the value of y from equation (1) into equation (2)

To find y use this x value in equation (1): y = x + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5
Check in equation (2): (2  3) + 5 = 11 (which is correct)

You may have done an experiment at school with a substance called salol. If molten salol cools slowly, you get big crystals. If it cools quickly, you get small crystals.
If the magma cools quickly, small crystals form in the rock. This can happen if the magma erupts from a volcano. Obsidian and basalt are examples of this type of rock. They are called

If the magma cools slowly, large crystals form in the rock. This can happen if the magma cools deep underground. Granite and gabbro are examples of this type of rock. They are

Unlike sedimentary rocks, igneous rocks do not contain any fossils. This is because any fossils in the original rock will have melted when the magma formed.

(Other spirit voices in the air) Bow-wow!
Where should this music be? I'the air or the earth?
It sounds no more; and, sure, it waits upon
Some god o'the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the King my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air. Thence I have followed it 
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
(Song) Full fathom five thy father lies 
Those are pearls that were his eyes.

This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.

Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
No, wench: it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wreck  and, but hes something stained
With grief (thats beautys canker), thou mightst call him
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,
As my soul prompts it. (To ARIEL) Spirit, fine spirit! Ill free thee
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island 
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here. My prime request,
Which I do last pronounce, is  O, you wonder!

What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me 
And that he does I weep. Myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes, neer since at ebb, beheld
And his more braver daughter could control thee,
If now twere fit to dot. At the first sight
Ill set thee free for this. (To FERDINAND) A word, good sir.

Make the prize light. (To FERDINAND) One word more: I charge thee
That thou attend me. Thou dost here usurp

Analyse, review and comment - Writing to analyse
This is one version of the speech. You will find comments beneath each paragraph, explaining what the writer has done well.
I'm sure you've all heard the saying ""we are what we eat"". Have you been into the school canteen recently? The selection is similar to that in many schools: a main meal which is usually meat-based, a variety of burgers and pizzas, a dessert and, for the health-conscious, jacket potatoes with one or two cold fillings. The question we are here to consider today is whether this is a reasonable selection, or whether changes could be made in Grange High School's canteen.
The speech begins dealing with the problem straight away. It starts with a short, familiar phrase and a rhetorical question, to involve the audience and make them listen to the speech. The current selection of food is outlined to set the scene, followed by the main question to be tackled. The opening is very friendly and easy to follow. This is a great start.
A survey conducted recently by Year 9 students suggested that many students are happy with the food on offer. They stated that the burgers and pizzas were their favourite food and that they were ""tasty, filling, cheap and quick"". These choices, sometimes called ""junk food"", are the best sellers and the canteen staff say the profit from these makes it possible to offer some of the less popular options.
The writer now looks at the evidence for keeping junk food. They've imagined a survey and comments from the canteen staff - this is fine as it's relevant and makes sense.
Some students admit that the junk food in the canteen is the only reason they stay in school at lunchtimes. Although we are not allowed off site during school times, it is well known that some students do sneak out to local chip shops and other takeaways. A substantial number of students who took part in the canteen's survey said they would be more likely to do this if the canteen offered more healthy food.
The final argument for junk food is explained. The writer introduces a rather controversial point, but softens it with the phrase 'it is well known...' so that no one is blamed. Again this keeps things formal and balanced.
So far, the writing looks really good, but it seems like the conclusion will be in favour of junk food. Is there any way of balancing the argument? Go to the next page to see how this is done.

499,"> Drama - Drama from your imagination
Taking part in drama doesn't always involve learning lines from scripts - often you'll be asked to improvise. Usually you will work in groups or pairs to devise a piece of drama from your own imagination. You'll need to be able to think on your feet and become a different character.
This might sound difficult, but you've probably improvised before without realising it - in games you used to play as a child. If you've ever played pirates, nurses or superheroes when you were younger, you were improvising - although don't think running around your classroom with a tablecloth for a cape pretending to be Superman will impress your drama teacher - it probably won't!
As with any English work, you need to think about your audience when you devise drama. Your drama needs to entertain them and keep their attention. Your drama also needs to be believable - your audience is likely to become disconnected if your story or characters are too far fetched.
The story of your drama begins with your character. Ask yourself: what does my character feel, think and react?
Here are two ideas for a character:
You are a journalist who has uncovered a story that will have big consequences and you're about to tell the world. Would your character be confident or scared?
You are a global superstar - singer, actor and producer - and paparazzi follow your every move. You live a glamorous and privileged life, but what are the secrets behind the smiles?
When you have decided on your character, you need to create a scene.
Here are some ideas for a scene based on the characters above. Can you think of any more?
You're about to appear on the most popular morning TV programme and expose your discovery when you suddenly receive a startling phone call. Who is on the phone? What do they say? How do they make you feel?
You've landed a part in a popular soap but you don't get on with the other actors. Should you tell the press the truth or pretend that you all get along?
You've been working late in the library just double checking a few facts for your article when you notice a menacing looking man watching you. Does your character panic or keep calm? Do they run or confront the man? Maybe they are being paranoid?
The press have published some false rumours about you and you're really upset. Your agent has secured a slot on a popular chat show to give your side of the story. Do you accept the offer or decide to lie low? How do you feel?
Your article has been published and has been a massive hit. You're receiving job offers from high profile newspapers and magazines and your life is about to change for the better. How do your family react? What do you decide to do?
You've found out that one of the other band members is planning to leave the group and go solo. You confront them - can you persuade them to stay, or would it be better for everyone if they left?
When you have a rough idea of your character and scene, you can think about what your character might say. If you're given time to prepare you should write a short script. If working in pairs or a group, you could improvise the scene first to get more ideas.
You may be allowed to use props to make your scene more realistic and interesting. Only use a prop if it is relevant, otherwise it could end up distracting you and your audience. If you decide to use props and costumes, always practice with them first.

Romeo and Juliet first key extract - Performance
When you write about performance, mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:
haracters and how you respond to them
anguage used - the detail about love, for example
ssues and ideas - like time, love and hate
Once you understand how the audience should feel, you can decide how you might direct a particular scene. Remember, there are lots of different ways to perform the same scene. A good answer depends on how well you explain yourself.
Here is an example of an answer to a question about performance. Think about how you might answer the same question.
How should an actor playing Benvolio behave?
Benvolio's replies to Romeo could either show that he is a good listener who wants to understand his friend's problems, or that he is amused by what Romeo has to say because he knows that his friend is not serious about this girl.
When Benvolio speaks to Montague, the mood is serious. When Romeo arrives, he has to ask lots of questions because Romeo is evasive. Some of Benvolio's comments could be said in a sarcastic or sympathetic way. The jokes that the two characters share show that they are good friends. Benvolio gives advice at the end of the scene that shows that he doesn't believe Romeo's love for Rosaline is serious.
The way Benvolio behaves towards Romeo shapes the way the audience perceives Romeo. This is important because Romeo is the main character. The audience has to like him and worry about him for the tragedy to work. If the actor playing Benvolio speaks his lines in a patient and sympathetic way, it makes Romeo seem like a young man who finds the world confusing. If Benvolio's lines are spoken humorously, the comedy in Romeo's speeches will be brought to life.

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to argue
The key thing about writing an argument is that you present both sides and come to a clear conclusion. It's not like arguing with one of your friends, when you just say what you think. Instead, when you write an argument you have to show you are reasonable and can consider the different sides.
The following article has appeared in your local paper:
Ashfield Park is threatened with closure next month as a local business has applied for planning permission to turn the area into a car park. Local residents have begun a fierce campaign to save the park, which is a popular walking spot for young children and the elderly, as well as home to the War Memorial and many wildlife species.
Write to your local paper, arguing that the park should be preserved.
It would not be enough to write that you want the park to be saved - it might be how you feel, but it wouldn't be an argument..
It wouldn't even be enough if you wrote about all the good things in the park. That would be
as you haven't thought about any other views.
A good argument presents both the good and bad aspects of keeping the park. For instance, the park might protect nature, but cost a lot to keep clean. It might be a good place to walk, but few people actually go there. An argument depends on bringing these ideas together. Use connectives, like ""because"" or ""however"" or ""although"". These words give your argument a logical structure and help make the contrasts clear.
Once you have worked through these ideas, you come to your conclusion - saying whether they should keep the park or not.

Extract 1 - Act 1, Scene 1, lines 98 to 232
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew. Were you by when it began?
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
I drew to part them. In the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
O where is Romeo? Saw you him today?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun
Peered forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad 
That westward rooteth from this city side,
So early walking did I see your son.
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood.
I, measuring his affections by my own,
Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Being one too many by my weary self,
And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
I neither know it, nor can learn of him.
Have you importuned him by any means?
Both by myself and many other friends:
Is to himself  I will not say how true 
But to himself so secret and so close,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.
See where he comes. So please you, step aside.
Ill know his grievance or be much denied.
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, lets away.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeos hours?
Not having that which, having, makes them short.
Out of her favour where I am in love.
Alas, that Love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Alas, that Love, whose view is muffled still,
Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Heres much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs:
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers eyes;
Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.
What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.
This is not Romeo: hes some other where.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will 
A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.
A right good mark-man! And shes fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Well, in that hit you miss. Shell not be hit
With Cupids arrow. She hath Dians wit,
And in strong proof of chastity well-armed,
From Loves weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide th encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
O, she is rich in beauty  only poor
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
Be ruled by me: forget to think of her.
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
To call hers  exquisite  in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing fair:
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who passed that passing fair?
Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.

332,"Imitation is a type of behaviour where one animal copies another animal. Humans often imitate each other, often without realising it. When people talk to each other, they may stand or sit in a similar way, and copy each others movements. Scientists think that this happens so that the speakers feel more at ease with other.
Some chimpanzees have been taught sign language by imitating people.
Imitation helps us to learn how to do new things. Your teachers often show you how to do something new, and then guide you as you try to repeat what they did.
Some scientists think that humans are the only animals that copy each other. Other scientists have observed chimpanzees and other primates imitating each other.
For example, chimpanzees can use sticks to spear juicy grubs to eat. Other chimpanzees copy this behaviour. In this way they learn new skills.

One way of finding out whether you have been over-charged is to estimate what the total amount should be. Round the different prices into easier numbers - 9.99 is approximately 10, 1.49 is approximately 1.50 and 8.99 is approximately 9 - and you can do the calculation quickly in your head.
10 + 1.50 + 9 = 20.50

Some coin collectors say U.S. coins should have a greater variety of pictures. For instance, they want to take the image of Abraham Lincoln off the penny. They want to remove the drawing of Thomas Jefferson from the nickel.
""After almost 100 years, even Lincoln himself would probably say enough is enough,"" said coin collector Fred Weinberg.
Weinberg and others say the presidential portraits are boring. Instead of presidents, the critics want to see patriotic scenes.
""I'm not putting down dead dignitaries, but the public wants to see something new to stimulate pride and interest, not just in coins, but in history,"" Weinberg said.
Officials at the U.S. Mint, which makes coins, say they are looking into the possibility of change. The mint could have a new nickel in 2003, a new dime in 2004, a new half dollar in 2005, and a new penny in 2006.
U.S. coins have honored presidents for almost a century. In 1909, President Abraham Lincoln became the first president to be pictured on a coin.
Later, other presidents were pictured on coins. George Washington's image was added to the quarter in 1932. Thomas Jefferson's picture replaced that of a Native American on the nickel in 1938. Franklin Roosevelt's image appeared on the dime beginning in 1946. John F. Kennedy was pictured on the half dollar beginning in 1964.
Not everyone agrees that a change in change is good. Some people want to keep their loose change exactly the way it is.
""We're open to change in color and general design... but we certainly would not be open to just replacing President Lincoln's image with a flower or something else,"" said a fan of the Lincoln penny.

The long gray line is what all the students who have ever attended West Point are called. The term refers to the color of the uniforms that the
, or military students, wear. It also reminds the cadets that they are part of a long tradition, which celebrates its 200th anniversary this year.
On March 16, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson founded a school to train military officers and teach engineering. The school was established at West Point, which had been used as a fort.
The school's first class of students was smaller than the one that entered this year. In 1802, only two students were enrolled at the school. The youngest was 10 years old!
When West Point was founded, the United States was much smaller than it is today. The country extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River.
Until 1817, West Point did not have a set course of study. In that year, Sylvanus Thayer was appointed the superintendent of West Point. He developed the school's curriculum and turned West Point into one of the best schools in the United States. George Woodbridge, who graduated from the school in 1826, explained Thayer's accomplishment, saying, ""His object was to make [us] gentlemen and soldiers.""
The officers who graduated from West Point helped build and defend the United States. They explored the vast areas west of the Mississippi River. They designed the roads, bridges, dams, railroads, and canals that the United States needed as it grew. They also helped design some of our greatest buildings and monuments. For example, they worked on the Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the base of the Statue of Liberty.
Many of the school's graduates have gone on to play important roles in U.S. history. They have been famous generals and U.S. presidents. Both President Ulysses S. Grant and President Dwight D. Eisenhower were generals and graduates of West Point. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, also graduated from West Point.
Even though all West Point graduates serve America in different ways, they all share important lessons learned at the academy. For example, they learn about taking responsibility for one's actions. They also share the school's motto. ""Always there echoes and reechoes in my ears [the motto]: Duty. Honor. Country,"" said General Douglas MacArthur, a West Point graduate.
George Washington Whistler graduated from West Point in 1819. He spent most of his career building railroads. He also built steam locomotives.
While building his first locomotive, Whistler also built the first American train whistle. He placed his whistle on top of the locomotive. He called his locomotive the Whistler. The sound of Whistler's whistle can still be heard on old steam locomotives.

Although researchers are certain about the increase in temperatures, they are still unsure about the cause. Many scientists blame
the gradual rise in Earths average temperature.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth. Temperatures there rarely reach above freezing. Although it is too cold for humans to permanently live there, many animals swim in the icy waters surrounding the continent. Penguins, for example, waddle across the ice and dive into the cold ocean waters in search of food. They eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called
In warmer water, however, krill have trouble surviving. ""Warming temperatures have led to a decline in sea ice,"" says Trivelpiece. ""Sea ice holds the food that krill need to survive. Without the ice, there is less food for krill and without the krill, the penguins are not surviving.""
These changes could upset the balance of the food chain and endanger larger animals and birds. A loss of penguins could leave leopard seals and whales hungry. (See
.) ""A very small change in temperature [can] completely change the whole food chain,"" says Trivelpiece.
Its not just emperor penguins and other creatures that may be in trouble. People who live thousands of miles away may be affected by melting ice.
As glaciers and sheets of ice melt, they add to the worlds sea level. When ice on land falls into the ocean and melts, it raises the water level. It is like dropping ice cubes into a glass of water. A 4-foot increase in global sea level would drown low-lying coastal areas.
The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air. Those gases collect in a layer and trap the heat from the sun. The process is called the

Some heat from greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is necessary. Without them, Earth would be too cold to support life. But burning fossil fuels can release too much carbon dioxide into the air, which can cause temperatures to rise.
Scientists are working to persuade governments to reduce their use of greenhouse gases. Experts say that if greenhouse gases continue to gather in the air, temperatures will likely be higher by 2100 than any time in human history. ""Our research teaches us a lesson that even a small change in the environment can have a big effect,"" says Trivelpiece.

is a system of animals and plants in an area that depend on one another for food. At the top of the Antarctic food chain are large animals, such as whales. They eat seals, which eat penguins. Penguins munch on tiny shrimplike animals called krill. Krill eat tiny ocean plants called phytoplankton. A loss of smaller animals in the food chain could leave larger animals hungry.

Toddler, along with two other robots, was unveiled in February at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. All three robots have a humanlike

Some school officials say putting a stop to contact sports will prevent kids from getting injured at recess. Freedom Elementary School, located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, banned tag because some students slapped or pushed others while playing the game.
""Students haven't been taught early on how to start, stop, and touch properly,"" Donna Thompson, director of the National Program for Playground Safety, told

This cousin of the rat is believed to be the largest rodent that ever roamed Earth. Scientists unearthed its skeleton in a dry region of Venezuela. That is a country in South America.
""Imagine a weird guinea pig, but huge, with a long tail for balancing on its hind legs,"" said the lead scientist behind the find.
Nicknamed ""Goya,"" the rodent lived in an area that once was made up of grassy marshes. Along with the giant crocodiles and giant turtles of the time, Goya lived along the banks of a swamp.
There, it used its long teeth to dine on large amounts of grasses. At about 9 feet long and 4 feet tall, the rodent couldn't move very fast. Its hefty size made it very difficult to outrun an attacking animal. A changing climate and threats from other animals might have caused the animal's extinction, say scientists.

What's the secret behind their amazing grip? Geckos have millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of their feet. When a gecko comes in contact with a surface, the hairs create an electrical force that lets it cling to a wall or a ceiling.

Tornadoes can strike in any month in any part of the world. In the United States, peak activity for tornado season is from April through July.
scientists who study weathersay the series of 113 damaging storms that tore through the Midwest will beat the recent record for the number of tornadoes on a single day in March. The previous record was 69 on March 13, 1990. ""For this early in the year, its a heck of a deal,"" says weather expert Joe Schaefer. ""What happens after that is anybodys guess.""
After the thunderstorms caused the series of deadly twisters, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for Michigan and Indiana. If a
is issued for an area, the conditions are favorable for a tornado to form. If the Weather Service issues a
for an area, a tornado has been spotted. In the case of a tornado warning, people should seek safe shelter immediately.
The National Weather Service also employs storm spotters to help predict where and when a tornado will strike. The trained volunteers are positioned before a storm hits to report what they see developing in the sky. Their reports confirm what weather forecasters see on their radar screens.
For many, there is no escaping the tornadoes wrath. ""It was over before you knew it,"" Greg Kospar of Bentonville, Arkansas, told reporters after the storm. ""The house is gone.""
The strength of a tornado and its potential to cause damage are rated using the Fujita scale, with 0 being the weakest and 5 being the strongest. A new tornado rating system is scheduled to go into effect early next year.
 Warm and cold air meet and rise into the storm cloud.
 Sometimes the rising air begins to spin, which can form a funnel-shaped cloud.

Before we got in the tank, we put on special brown overalls called

In the ocean, these playful white and gray whales often swim in

, or friendly, animals that enjoy being touched. The belugas hugged us, splashed us, and even gave us high-fives with their flippers!
Boris showed us how the beluga whales respond to different hand signals and touches. He said it takes a few days to teach a beluga a skill like waving its flipper and up to a year to teach a more complicated skill, such as jumping out of the water.
When the belugas followed directions, Boris rewarded them with squid and herring. Those are part of a belugas diet in the wild. We playfully clapped the belugas tongues. Belugas dont use their teeth to chew food. They swallow their food whole.
Although they dont look like birds, belugas are often called ""sea canaries."" That is because a beluga makes various noises and ""talks"" to other belugas. It does that by producing different sounds, including squeals and whistles, from the

During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote the poem that later became the national anthem.
On September 13, 1814, Key watched British ships bomb Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. The next morning, he spotted the American flag still flying over the fort. The sight inspired him to write the poem. In 1931, Congress made it the national anthem.
Here is the first verse of the four-verse song:

Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on armor and talk to tour guides. This year, more than 2.4 million people from across the country are expected to attend Jamestown events.
Stepping into Jamestown Settlement museum in Virginia is like stepping into the past. And that's just what thousands of people are planning to do this spring. May marks the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America. Organizers are expecting nearly 90,000 visitors on the weekend of May 11 to 13, when many major events are planned.
Jamestown is a tourist destination for people who want a frontrow seat to American history. ""The whole idea is to give people an idea of Jamestown and the world in 1607,"" historian Tom Davidson told
Davidson helped put together exhibits at the Jamestown museum for the anniversary.
Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on English armor and watch experts demonstrate how to fire muskets. Tourists can also go aboard and explore
or models, of the three ships that brought the first settlers to present-day Virginia.

At first, settlers stayed close together for protection. ""There were hundreds of people living inside a wooden-walled fort,"" explains Davidson. Living in the fort helped the settlers defend themselves from attack, but it also made hunting for food or growing crops difficult.

spent five months crossing the Atlantic. The original Godspeed carried 39 passengers from England to Virginia, making two stops along the way. The new Godspeed traveled from Maine to Virginia, stopping along the way to let visitors see the ship.
By 1613, Jamestown had expanded into a successful colony. At about that time, the settlers began to grow tobacco. Tobacco was a
meaning that it could be sold in large amounts to England. In the following years, the settlers pushed the Powhatan off the land and built tobacco
or large farms. Later, the Jamestown colonists bought slaves from Africa to work on the plantations.
Over time, Jamestown grew to become the colony of Virginia. Virginia was one of the 13 colonies that joined in 1776 to rebel against England, starting the American Revolution (17751783).
Much is known about Jamestown, yet more details are being discovered. For more than a hundred years, experts thought the site of the original settlement had been destroyed by the James River. In 1994, archaeologists, or scientists who study the remains left behind by past cultures, discovered what may be Jamestown's original location.
""Visitors can see things being excavated that haven't seen the light of day in 400 years,"" Jamestown spokesperson Mike Litterst told
Scientists are currently looking for the foundation of the first church that the Jamestown settlers built. If found, it will be the oldest English church ever discovered in the United States.
The skeletons of two settlers have already been uncovered at the site. They are on display beneath a glass case, exactly as they were found. Historians believe that one of the skeletons is that of Captain Bartholomew Gosnoll, a member of Jamestown's original ruling council. Gosnoll and Jamestown Settlement will have a lot of visitors in the coming weeks for the 400th anniversary. ""It's the biggest event we've had since 1957, when the [Jamestown] museum first opened,"" says Litterst.
When the English colonists first settled in what is now Virginia, a powerful Native American group had lived on the land for hundreds of years. ""There were about 20,000 Powhatan people there when the English arrived in Jamestown,"" Virginia Indian culture expert Karenne Wood told
She hopes that the 400th anniversary of Jamestown will help shed light on the Powhatan's story.
When Jamestown began, the English and the Powhatan tried to trade with each other peacefully, but soon fighting broke out over land and resources. Beginning in 1614, the fighting stopped for eight years when Pocahontas, a daughter of the Powhatan chief, married Englishman John Rolfe. However, the fighting quickly resumed as Jamestown expanded.
Over time, the Powhatan people lost their land to the English settlers. However, Virginia is home to many Native American descendants today. ""We have changed a lot,"" says Wood, ""but we are still here.""
Organizers at Jamestown are not calling the 400th anniversary a celebration. Why might that be?

Snakehead fish arrived in the United States from China and Korea, most likely as pets. When their owners no longer wanted them, they threw the fish into nearby lakes and streams. Snakehead fish now live in several states, from Maryland to California.
Snakehead fish aren't the only accidental arrivals. In the Great Lakes region, fingernail-sized zebra mussels hitchhiked from Russia in the water tanks of ships. Now the mussels clog pipes that provide drinking water to homes and schools.
In Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, young emerald ash borers have killed more than 6 million trees. These beetles likely arrived from China in wood packing material carried in ships or airplanes.

Each year, about 6,000 U.S. kids under age 14 are killed in accidents, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Another 120,000 kids each year are permanently disabled in accidents.
The graph shows the number of kids ages 5 to 14 who were treated in emergency rooms in 1999 for injuries suffered while doing these four activities.
""Summer is the most dangerous time of the year for kids,"" said Dr. C. Everett Koop, who is head of the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Koop added, ""The good news is that families can take simple steps to ensure their kids stay out of emergency rooms.""
The 2001 campaign is paying special attention to scooter-related injuries. Because more kids are riding scooters, doctors expect a rise in scooter accidents.
In 2000, more than 30,000 people went to emergency rooms for scooter-related injuries, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said. Most of those injured were kids age 14 or younger.
Because many scooter accidents result in head injuries, some cities and states have passed helmet laws. The New York City passed a law requiring scooter riders under age 14 to wear helmets. Fourth graders from Connecticut, asked their state government to pass a similar law.
Scooter accidents may be on the rise, but bicycles account for more injuries than scooters or any other product except cars, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign.
In 1999, 340,000 kids age 5 to 14 were treated in hospital emergency rooms for bicycle-related injuries, SAFE KIDS reported. The most common bicycle-related injuries are injuries to the head.
The best way for kids to protect their heads while riding bikes is by wearing helmets. But the National SAFE KIDS Campaign says only 15 percent to 25 percent of kids who ride bikes wear helmets while riding.

It's not surprising that fantasy has turned millions of kids into book-worms. ""Fantasy allows children to think about other worlds and contrast them to their own,"" says Allison. ""It stretches their imaginations.""
What exactly makes a story a fantasy? Traditionally, a fantasy tells the story of a single character, the hero, such as Harry Potter. Like Harry, the hero is often unaware of his or her power. After crossing into a different world, the hero is faced with a series of tests.
In a fantasy story, a teacher often shows the hero the tricks of the trade. In
, wise Gandalf protects the hobbit Frodo. Harry, too, is taught by Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts.
Fantasy books typically end with a battle between the hero and the villainand the hero ultimately wins. If Rowling sticks to the fantasy formula, will Harry defeat Lord Voldemort in Book 7 of the series?
The fantasy craze has also hit the big screen, with many books being made into films. Fans of
movies turned out in record numbers. This December, a film version of the classic C. S. Lewis book
The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe

George Washington and Abraham Lincoln are taking a step out of the history books. Two new presidential museums are using the cutting edge of technology to tell the stories of past U.S. presidents.
A group of students from nearby Rockledge Elementary School recently took a trip to Washington's home in Mount Vernon, Virginia. There, they saw a lifelike statue of Washington mounted on his horse during the Revolutionary War (17751783). The statue is an exhibit in a new museum at Mount Vernon.
""It was cool!"" 10-year-old Jack Eghtessad from Woodbridge, Virginia, told
describing the statue. ""It didn't look fake.""
At the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, students from the city's Iles Elementary School gasped. Lincoln's ghost appeared before them in the museum's library. ""I felt like I was really seeing Lincoln,"" exclaimed Samantha Mackey, 11.
or changing, the way kids learn about presidents. Recently, historians have started using more special effects to tell the stories of famous leaders. The new Mount Vernon museum has been open for only four months, but already it has drawn more than 90,000 visitors. February 19 will be the first Presidents' Day it is open.
Experts used paintings, historical documents, and the latest digital technology to create three statues of Washington for Mount Vernon. One of the statues shows Washington at age 19. Another statue depicts him at age 45, leading the Continental Army in the fight for
or freedom, against the British. The third shows him at 57, when he became the first U.S. president. (See
The museum is also home to a special-effects theater that plays a
or true-to-life movie, about Washington's life. As the film plays, the theater's seats rumble with the cannon fire of major battles. Fake snow even falls from the ceiling as the film shows Washington crossing the Delaware River in a surprise attack on the British military in 1776.
""We are, in a way, definitely on the cutting edge,"" says Ann Bay, the Mount Vernon museum's educational director. ""We were inspired by the Lincoln museum.""
Springfield's Lincoln museum reopened with new special-effects exhibits in 2005. Since then the museum has averaged more than 12,000 visitors a week. Visitors can see a life-size re-creation of Lincoln and his family, use interactive computer stations, and tour the ""ghost library.""
make it look as if ghosts of Lincoln and other historical figures appear in the room. Lincoln historian Thomas Schwartz told
that the special effects draw students into Lincoln's story. In one exhibit, visitors watch as an electronic ticker counts the more than 618,000 Americans who were killed while Lincoln was president during the Civil War (18611865). They see Lincoln's sad reaction to the huge death toll.
""These are real people that had real tragedy, real joy, and real emotion in their lives. People need to understand that,"" Schwartz says. He thinks that special effects help get that point across to visitors.
This life-size model of Washington at age 19 gives visitors a glimpse of the first U.S. president in his youth. Washington was born into a wealthy Virginia family. His first job was mapping out land. He then joined the British army and fought in the French and Indian War (17541763). During the Revolutionary War (17751783), he led the Continental Army against the British to win American independence. In 1789, he was elected the first president of the United States.
Unlike Washington, Lincoln did not have enough money to pay for school. This wax statue shows Lincoln teaching himself by reading between chores. He went on to become a successful lawyer, and in 1860 he was elected the 16th U.S. president. He led the country during the Civil War (18611865) between the states in the North and the South. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation ended slavery in 1863. He was killed in office shortly after the war ended.

After being cruelly questioned by officials, more than 30 percent of immigrants were sent back to China.
Angel Islands doors closed in 1940 when China and the United States became

Dozens of vulcanologists bravely climbed Mount Etna each day. They hoped that the mountain of fire would be a good teacher. ""We will probably learn more about this volcano during this eruption than had been learned in 3,000 years"", said Borris Behnke, a German scientist.

Etna was also hurling huge rocks into the air. ""Some of them are bigger than cars and some might be as big as trucks,"" said Behnke.
Some of the scientists didn't need to climb Mount Etna. Over the past few years, scientists had placed hundreds of sensors on the volcano. The sensors gather data about the lava flow and send the data by radio to scientists located a safe distance from the volcano.
The sensors also record earthquakes. Earthquakes in a volcanic area can mean that the volcano is about to erupt. In the days before Mount Etna erupted, the sensors had picked up more than 2,600 small earthquakes.
Behnke says that lava may erupt from Mount Etna for at least six more months. During that time, he plans to climb the volcano many times, risking his life to learn firsthand what is happening.

Although he felt both pride and joy, he also remembered that the site is a graveyard. ""I couldn't help but think about the [more than 1,500] lost souls who died,"" he said.
Do you think it's important to preserve the Titanic? Why or why not?
Ballard believes the wreck should be left alone. ""The site is a memorial, and it is better to bring people there through advanced technology rather than ravage the site through salvage,"" he said.

489,"Going, Going, Gone! African Monkey Declared Extinct
In 1933, a discovery in Africa excited scientists around the world. They had found a
, or kind, of monkey that they had never seen before--the Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey. Now, only 77 years after it was found, that monkey is extinct, scientists recently announced.
No one has seen a Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey for more than 20 years. In 1988, scientists declared the monkey an endangered species. For the last seven years, scientists searched for the monkey in Ghana and Cte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), two countries in western Africa. They found no sign of the animal.
""If [the] red colobus were present near any of our survey routes, it is likely that we would have seen one,"" said scientist John Oates.
Scientists blame the animal's extinction on hunting and the destruction of the forests where it lived.
Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was the first primate --which includes monkeys and apes--to become extinct in nearly 300 years. But scientists say it will not be the last. They worry that many of the 600 other primate species may die out within the next 100 years. Twenty-five species may die out within ten to 20 years. More than 120 primate species may become extinct before the end of this century, said Ross MacPhee of New York City's American Museum of Natural History.
Endangered primates live in Africa, Asia, and South America. Many of those primates live in areas where people are poor and need to hunt for food to survive.
Scientists fear that unlimited hunting could kill off more primates. ""Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was eaten by people. The last ones probably went into someone's pot,"" said scientist John Terborgh.
MacPhee explained that the best way to help primates is to protect them and the areas where they live. ""As long as there are a few individuals, and as long as humans leave them alone, they'll come back [from near extinction].""

116,"Scientists are balancing animal populations out West.
Rocky Mountain moose are on the moveand they're flying firstclass. Wildlife workers are using helicopters to send Utah's moose to Colorado. In exchange, wildlife officials in Colorado are capturing bighorn sheep to send to Utah. The animal swap is part of a plan to keep the moose and sheep populations in both states healthy.
Rocky Mountain moose are on the move.
One of the largest moose hauls took place in January, when a single helicopter team captured 24 of the animals in a day. The moose are now roaming free in the Grand Mesa National Forest in Colorado, where the appearance of calves indicates that the moose population is growing. Colorado workers planned to hold up their end of the bargain by capturing 20 bighorn sheep to send to Utah in February.
""This year was a major group move,"" Stephanie Duckett, a biologist with the Colorado Division of Wildlife, told
Biologists are scientists who study living things. Duckett works at Grand Mesa, which didn't have any moose two years ago. ""So far we have moved 90 moose to the mesa,"" she says. Most of those animals came from Weber County, Utah, where the moose population is in trouble.
The moose in northern Utah are threatened by
That means there are too many animals for the environment to feed and support. Overpopulation can lead to animal starvation and disease. ""It's bad for the population and bad for the environment,"" says Duckett.
Wildlife officials often try to prevent overpopulation by issuing permits that allow hunters to kill more animals during hunting season. That wasn't an option with Utah's moose; many of them live on private land where hunting is
or not allowed. Instead, wildlife officials decided to make a trade.
""Here in northern Utah, we have too many moose, and we've lost a lot of our bighorn sheep population,"" Utah wildlife manager Justin Dolling told
Colorado had a healthy supply of bighorn sheep to send to Utah, and Colorado had plenty of room for Utah's extra moose.
Once they had a plan, wildlife officials had to find a way to safely catch the wild mooseone of the largest animal species in North America. They turned to animalcapture expert James Innes and his experienced team of helicopter ""moose muggers."" A moose mugger is an animal worker trained to capture a moose without harming it. ""We have zero tolerance for
Innes's helicopter chases a moose into a clearing by flying over the forest before dropping a net to catch the animal. Once the moose is down, a moose mugger jumps out of the hovering helicopter and secures the animal's legs. ""You have to use every trick in the book to tie them up,"" says Innes.
Once the moose is secured, it is placed in a canvas bag that hangs from the helicopter and then flown to a base camp. There, a veterinarian, or an animal doctor, gives the moose a checkup before it is placed on a truck and taken to its final destinationGrand Mesa.
Wildlife managers tackled the moose overpopulation problem in Utah by sending moose to areas where they would have enough food. The map shows how moose and bighorn sheep were swapped this year to keep both groups of animals healthy.

Adult moose are too large to be hunted by other animals. Human hunters are their only predator. Half of all moose scalves are killed by wolves, grizzly bears, or black bears.
How might other animals living in the same environment be hurt by moose overpopulation? How does the animal swap help solve that problem?

247,"Is silencing parents a winning idea for kids' sports?
Loud parents are a growing problem at youth sporting events. Nearly 60 percent of people think that parent behavior in youth sports is worse today than it was five years ago, according to the National Association of Youth Sports. ""Parents are trying to yell and scream to make their kids play better, and that just doesn't work,"" sports expert and former coach Gregory Dale told
Dale and other sports experts are fans of an idea called ""Silent Saturdays."" Silent Saturdays are special game days during which parents aren't allowed to yell, scream, shout, or even speak. They can only clap to celebrate good plays and whisper to each other. Sports programs from California to New Jersey have instituted Silent Saturdays. Is quieting the sidelines a good call?
Silence helps keep parents' behavior under control.
Some sports leagues think zipping parents' lips is a great idea. The Dynamo Soccer Association in Bourbonnais, Illinois, started having Silent Saturdays last year. ""We're not trying to punish parents,"" Dynamo Soccer board member Ben Smith told
""It's just a stress-free day for the kids.""
At first, some parents were skeptical, or unsure, of the idea. But Smith says the quiet games were a big success. Instead of shouting, parents held encouraging signs and applauded. Everyone could hear the kids talking to each other on the field during the games. ""There was no negative criticism throughout the day,"" adds Smith. This year, the Dynamo board is considering two Silent Saturdays, and nearby soccer leagues are giving the program a try.
Parents should be allowed to cheer on their kids.
Silence doesn't work for everyone. For example, two grandparents in Bourbonnais were disappointed because they had traveled to cheer at their grandkids' game, but they had arrived on a Silent Saturday. Some experts think keeping family members quiet isn't the solution. ""Parents hate it,"" Jim Thompson, head of Positive Coaching Alliance, told
""If you want parents to be positive, this is not the best way to do it.""
Thompson says the solution is to train parents to cheer in a way that promotes
or fair play. Thompson prefers ""Honor the Game Days"" to Silent Saturdays. What's the difference? ""Rather than telling parents to be quiet, at Honor the Game Days, [we tell parents] how to support their kids,"" he says.

The NBA has brought back its old ball after trying out a new ball covered in synthetic material.
For the past few months, players had to use a ball covered with a synthetic, or human-made, material. Many players, including O'Neal, complained the plasticcoated basketball was a bad decision. They said the new ball didn't bounce as well as the leather ball. The new ball also cut their hands. ""The new ball is terrible,"" O'Neal, the Miami Heat center, says.
Scientists at the University of Texas at Arlington ran experiments comparing the synthetic and leather balls. The biggest difference they found was in the way the new ball absorbs moisture.
The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture than the leather ball does. That means the synthetic ball doesn't become heavier when it comes in contact with players' sweat. It also means the synthetic ball can become slippery because moisture stays on its surface, scientist Kaushik De, who helped conduct the study, told
The return of the leather ball has many NBA players jumping for joy. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us.""

The Arctic is the icy, cold region located around the North Pole. In November, scientists from eight countries released a report saying that the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of Earth.
In the report, scientists predict that at least half of the summer sea ice in the Arctic will melt by the end of this century. The scientists blame
for the Arctic thaw. That is the gradual rise in Earth's temperature.
Arctic ice is melting at an alarming rate. Winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen between 4 and 7 degrees Fahrenheit. During the past 30 years, polar bears have lost more than 386,000 square miles of ice--an area larger than the states of Texas and Arizona combined.
More than 20,000 polar bears live in the Arctic regions. Disappearing sea ice threatens polar bears and other cold-weather animals. Polar bears use the ice as a bridge to hunt seals, their primary source of food.
As the sea ice disappears, the mighty
, or hunters, catch fewer seals and risk starvation. Seals also depend on the ice to rest and give birth. Scientists fear that polar bears, seals, and other animals that rely on the ice could be wiped out by the end of the century if the warm-up continues.
Some of the 4 million people who live in the Arctic have also found themselves on shaky ground. As the frozen land thaws, buildings and roads have weakened.
Inuits (IH-nyoo-wets), a group of native people in the region, fish and hunt Arctic animals, including polar bears. They depend on those animals as their main source of food. Inuit hunters are also falling through thinning ice.
Rising sea levels have forced some people in the Arctic to move their coastal villages inland. The report warns that melting ice could cause sea levels to continue to rise--up to 3 feet by the end of this century. Towns and cities along coastlines around the world could flood as a result.
The warm-up also affects other parts of the planet. Arctic ice and snow reflect heat from the sun into space. Without the ice and snow, the planet would be much warmer. ""The polar regions are essentially the Earth's air conditioner,"" said scientist Michael McCracken.
Who cranked up the thermostat on the Arctic? Scientists say human activity is to blame for global warming. People use
, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to power cars, heat homes, and create electricity.
Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Burning those fuels gives off gases that trap heat from the sun and add to the overheating of the Earth.
To protect life in the Arctic, scientists say people need to limit their use of fossil fuels. ""Climate change is not just about the future,"" said scientist Pal Prestud, who worked on the report. ""It is happening now.""
The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Those gases collect in a layer and trap heat from the sun. The layer of gases is like the windows in a greenhouse. The process is called the

Some of the Army's top scientists have been trying to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for four years. The Army's sandwiches have to taste good and last for three years without refrigeration.
Army scientists have already made pepperoni and barbecue chicken sandwiches. They used special chemicals to keep the sandwiches fresh.
The sandwiches ""will last a minimum of three years at 80 degrees and six months at 100 degrees. They will travel to the swampiest swamp, the highest mountain, the most arid desert,"" said one army scientist.
Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches pose a special problem. Mold keeps growing on them.

Last month, workers in Oklahoma loaded about a dozen pieces of historic Route 66 onto trucks. Each of the 3,000-pound pieces then made a 1,400-mile trip to Washington, D.C., where they will become part of an exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
Route 66 has been called the ""Main Street of America."" It once stretched 2,400 miles, from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California. The road connected eight states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
In the 1920s, engineer Cyrus Stevens Avery of Tulsa, Oklahoma, envisioned a road connecting the Midwest and the Pacific Ocean. During the 1930s, Route 66 was completed and was soon lined with hundreds of businesses.
The road became so popular that it inspired a 1960s TV show,
, as well as a famous song, ""Get Your Kicks on Route 66.""
In the past few decades, however, Route 66 has fallen into disrepair, and parts of the old route have been dug up. Today, drivers use faster superhighways to get where they were going.
Even though fewer people drive on Route 66 now, many people still think of the road as the Main Street of America. That's why the National Museum of American History wants to include the road in its new exhibit, ""America on the Move."" The exhibit is scheduled to open in 2003.

Few plants or animals live on the icy mountaintops in southern Argentina and Chile. The region is cold, desolate, and snowy.
The ice fields there stretch along the Andes Mountains in South America and are home to 63 glaciers.
are large sheets of snow and ice that move slowly over land.
Glaciers are found in the polar regions around the world and in mountain valleys. The glaciers in South America are some of the largest outside the polar regions.
Because of the region's rough terrain and harsh weather, scientists have trouble reaching the area by foot. To study the melting of the South American glaciers, scientists recently relied on satellite technology.
Scientists discovered that glaciers in this area are rapidly melting.In fact, they are melting twice as fast as they were just a few years ago. Erik Rignot, an expert who studied the glaciers, referred to the South American ice fields as the ""fastest area of glacial retreat on Earth.""
As the glaciers melt, their water flows into lakes or oceans. As a result, the meltdown is causing sea levels to rise. If ocean levels rise by even a foot, the water could flood the world's coastal cities.
What is causing the glaciers to pull a disappearing act? Warmer temperatures and less snowfall from
are to blame for the meltdown, say scientists. Global warming is the worldwide rise in temperature.
The warmer temperatures cause the glaciers to break off into the ocean as icebergs. That process, called
It's not just that the South American glaciers are on thin ice. Scientists warn that about 90 percent of the world's glaciers are melting from global warming.
Some scientists say that people contribute to Earth's warmer temperatures. Harmful gases are released into the air when people burn certain fuels for electricity or for driving cars.
To help solve the problem, some scientists say people must work to reduce the effects of global warming. ""Once the glaciers have melted, that's it [for them],"" said one scientist.
Glaciers are large sheets of moving ice and snow. As snow accumulates, or builds up, on a glacier, the weight causes the snow underneath to turn into ice. The ice becomes so heavy that it forces the glacier to move.
As glaciers slowly move, they carve out the land beneath them, carrying away rocks and soil. Glaciers erode, or gradually wear away, the land.
What are some ways people can help prevent global warming?
Over hundreds and thousands of years, glaciers create different landforms, such as lakes.

The size of an elephant should make it easy to spot, right? That is not the case for some elephants in India.
Several elephants in New Delhi--the capital of that Asian country--have been hit by cars and killed. So a wildlife group has begun fitting the elephants with safety reflectors.
The reflectors work like the ones you find on a bike, bouncing back light from oncoming cars. The reflectors are attached to ropes that hang near an elephant's tail and hind legs.
In New Delhi, about 30 elephants work at night to help clear fallen trees. Many elephants are also forced to walk in the dark, after working at weddings and other religious festivals late at night. The elephants' dark skin makes it difficult for drivers to see them in the evening.

People saw green, blue, and red lights. The lights formed different patterns. Some looked like rings. Others looked like curtains. And still others looked like pillars. The lights continually changed shape and color.
are also called the northern lights and southern lights.
Usually, only people living close to the North Pole and South Pole see auroras. But auroras were unusually active this fall. Even people in Arizona saw the lights.
Auroras are caused by the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The solar wind is made of tiny particles that stream away from the sun. Earth's magnetic field is similar to the field that surrounds a magnet. When the solar wind strikes Earth's magnetic field, gases in our atmosphere glow. Those glowing gases form an aurora.
The kind of glowing gas determines an aurora's color. Glowing oxygen makes red, yellow, and green auroras. Glowing hydrogen and helium make blue and purple auroras.
Don't worry if you missed the colorful auroras in October. An aurora can form at any time of year. If the solar wind continues to be as strong as it was in the fall, you may see the northern lights on any clear night.
The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth. You could line up more than 1 billion hot dogs end to end between Earth and the sun.
If you could drive to the sun in your family's car, it would take you nearly 2 million years. That's if you drove 55 miles per hour and didn't take any rest stops.
Light from the sun travels a lot faster than you can in your car. A beam of light travels at about 186,000 miles per second. It takes sunlight a little more than 8 minutes to reach Earth.

The Vikings were pirates and warriors, known for their sea faring voyages. From the late 700s to 1100, the Vikings lived in Scandinavia. That region of Europe includes the present-day countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
Viking sailors spread fear throughout Europe. They raided and conquered coastal villages in Europe and along the Mediterranean coast. During their raids, Vikings captured slaves. They also
, or stole, treasures, such as silver and gold.
For their voyages, Viking sailors crafted swift, narrow
that could navigate the stormiest seas. The Vikings were the master shipbuilders of their time. Vikings also worked as farmers and craftspeople. Others hunted and fished.
The Vikings' claim to fame may have been their fearsome raids, but they were explorers and traders too. They were among the earliest explorers to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to North America.
The Vikings traveled to other parts of Europe, the Mediterranean, Greenland, and North America.
One of the most famous Vikings was explorer Leif Eriksson. He reached North America almost 500 years before Columbus arrived in 1492.
Longships varied in size, but many were between 60 feet and 90 feet in length.
A larger ship could carry about 50 raiders at a time.
Strong winds allowed a longship, which had one large sail, to reach speeds of up to 17 miles an hour.
Vikings used multiple oars to row the ship when there was no wind.
The front end of a longship curved upward and was adorned with a wood carving of a snake's or a dragon's head.
Over time, the Viking raiders lost their power as people learned to defend against their attacks. Today, the remains of Viking villages can be found throughout Europe and North America.
Archaeologists plan to study the burial ground in England to learn more about the life of the Vikings. Based on the objects found, they believe the site was once a Viking settlement.
Vikings were known to bury valuable items with the dead. As one historian put it, the site will allow experts to ""uncover the secrets of a time capsule more than 1,000 years old.""

This year's survey shows that fourth graders are carrying an average 7.9 pounds in their school backpacks. Last year's survey revealed that fourth graders lugged an average 7.5 pounds in their packs.
This year's backpack survey uncovered some shocking backpack weights. Some kids are carrying up to 25 pounds in their packs. One kid said he carried 63 pounds in his knapsack!
Doctors say that today more kids than ever before are complaining of back problems. Some of those back problems are caused by overloaded backpacks. Doctors say kids should not carry backpacks heavier than 10 to 15 percent of their body weight. A 70-pound fourth grader, for example, should not carry a pack that weighs more than 7 to 10.5 pounds. According to the survey, most fourth graders are within that range.

Do the coins bearing President Lincolns face still make sense? People on both sides of the debate have put in their two centsworth.
Nearly 60 percent of Americans stash their pennies rather than spend them. For many, the penny is annoying. The coins are hard to spend. Vending machines and parking meters, for example, dont accept them. Cashiers often are frustrated when people pay with them.
""The penny has been a nuisance for years, and now it costs more than one cent to make the penny,"" Kolbe told
His plan calls for rounding ""all final sales, up or down, to the nearest nickel.""
Kolbe and others point out that pennies are expensive to produce. Pennies account for more than half of the U.S. Mints coin production. It will cost about $44 million dollars to produce pennies this year. That is nearly $14 million more than it cost in 2005.
Mark Weller of the group Americans for Common Cents believes that efforts to remove the penny will fail because Americans want to keep the coin. ""Two-thirds of the public think its important to have the penny in circulation,"" he told
Weller and others fear that rounding up prices to the nearest five cents will hurt consumers. ""Consumers lose without the penny,"" adds Weller.
He also says that many charities depend on these coins. Last year, children in New York City donated more than 65 million pennies, adding up to more than $650,000.
Americans may also be hesitant for the penny to vanish because of what it represents. ""The penny is part of American history and tradition,"" says coin collector Sylvester Neal. ""It would be like getting rid of the flag.""

President George W. Bush recently recognized the heroic efforts Americans have made in the wake of this tragedy. In a speech on September 18, Bush said: ""Out of our tears and sadness, we saw the best of America. We saw a great country rise up to help. Tens of millions of dollars and thousands of hours and tons of food and clothing have all been donated to help rebuild shattered lives.""
By flying flags and holding vigils, millions of Americans shared the president's sentiments. ""As Americans, there is a bond between us, no matter how far away we are from one another,"" said Karen Bogart of Pasadena, California.

582,"Tourists Put Pressure on World's Monuments and Parks
Some of the World's most important monuments and parks are being loved to death. Many sites around the world are in bad shape because of a recent sharp increase in the number of tourists worldwide. The causes of damage range from everyday wear and tear to pollution to
, or the destruction of property on purpose.
Each year, hundreds of millions of tourists visit special places around the world. In fact, according to the World Tourism Organization, by the end of this year about 668 million people will have made tourist trips. By 2020, the organization said, that number may more than double, to 1.5 billion tourists!
The problem is that a large number of visitors can damage a monument or park. The thousands of cars and buses that carry tourists to a site create air pollution. Air pollution can discolor and damage monuments made of stone and other materials. Huge numbers of tourists also cause garbage to pile up. And sometimes tourists take pieces of monuments away with them as souvenirs.
These are some of the special places that are suffering from too much attention:
. These are two of the biggest national parks in the United States. Millions of tourists each year crowd into these areas. As a result, air pollution, garbage, and other damage have marred these awesome sites.
. Located in Peru, a country in South America, Machu Picchu is the site of an ancient city in the Andes Mountains. A people called the Incas built the city almost 600 years ago for Incan royalty. Garbage tossed aside by tourists, as well as air and water pollution, are now problems at Machu Picchu.
. The Parthenon is a temple that was built almost 2,500 years ago in Athens, a city in the European country of Greece. Air pollution has pitted and discolored the marble that the beautiful building is made of.
. Located near the town of Dunhuang, in north-central China, these caves are covered with delicate paintings and carvings. However, the breath of the 300,000 visitors who pass through the 492 caves each year is damaging the artwork, which is between 700 and 1,700 years old.
To help preserve such important places, new rules are being written by organizations such as UNESCO, which is a part of the United Nations. UNESCO is working with governments worldwide to limit the number of tourists who visit some special sites.
UNESCO is also working to educate sightseers about how to avoid damaging the places they visit. As one student who works with UNESCO said, ""You have to protect the past to reach tomorrow.""
If you are visiting a monument or national park, here are a few rules the U.S. Park Service says you should always follow:
If you are camping, take your trash and leftover food out with you when you leave.
When visiting a monument, don't touch sculptures, paintings, or other artwork.
Leave any artifacts, plants, stones, or other things where they are.
If you see someone damaging a monument or throwing garbage on the ground in a park, tell a park ranger or another park official.

As you wait in line, you hear the screams of people riding Kingda Ka. Part of you can't wait to ride the roller coaster; another part of you wants to bolt in the opposite direction. Before you know it, it's your turn to board. You brace yourself.

Congratulations! You have just experienced the fastestand tallestroller coaster on Earth.
Kingda Ka, or the ""King of Coasters,"" opens this spring at the Six Flags Great Adventure theme park in Jackson, New Jersey. The jaw-dropping thrill ride shatters the world's record for roller coaster speed and height. Of the more than 1,000 roller coasters in the United States, it is the latest ""extreme"" coaster to be built.
Six Flags roller coaster designer Larry Chickola says building Kingda Ka wasn't easy. ""We considered the wind strength, the possibility of earthquakes, the weight of Kingda Ka itself, as well as the forces caused by launching a [coaster faster than one] has ever gone,"" he told
enable roller coasters like Kingda Ka to move for most of the ride. According to scientists, energy is the ability to cause change. At the beginning of the ride, Kingda Ka blasts passengers to a speed of 128 miles an hour with technology similar to the kind that launches Navy jets from aircraft carriers. Each train on Kingda Ka is hooked up to a
cable. Liquid under high pressure is pushed through the cable. Along with motors, the hydraulic power rockets the coaster skyward.
After reaching the top of the first hill, the coaster works in the same way your bike does when you roll, pedal-free, down a slope. When a roller coaster is stopped, it has
, or stored energy. At any moment, the coaster can move, so it has the potential for motion.
As the roller coaster starts cruising, gravity takes over and converts the potential energy into
, which is the energy of motion. The repeated changes of potential energy to kinetic energy and then back again drives the roller coaster.
Kingda Ka covers 3,118 feet of track and lasts less than a minute. To roller coaster buff Steve Urbanowicz from New Jersey, the new ride is a scream! ""The ride seems like it's over really quickly, but Kingda Ka packs eight high moments of drama into those 50 seconds,"" he told
Urbanowicz, 46, speaks from experience. He has ridden 876 roller coasters around the world. In fact, he has taken more than 5,000 rides on one in particularthe wooden Cyclone at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, where the first true American coaster opened in 1884. ""I loved going to amusement parks when I was a kid and never grew out of it.""
Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division (reproduction number LC-USZ62-63945)
This illustration from 1886 shows passengers getting a one-minute ride for 5 cents aboard Coney Island's coaster.
The idea for the roller coaster was born in Russia in the 1600s when huge blocks of ice, supported by wood, were made into sleds. Straw or fur covered the icy seats.
Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, is credited with beginning America's amusement park history, in 1875. The nation's first coaster opened there in 1884 and cruised all of 6 miles an hour!
Some of the best coasters of all time were built during the 1920s. That era reigns as the golden age of amusement parks. By the end of the decade, the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression caused many parks to close.
Give another example of potential energy that is being converted into kinetic energy.

Last October, the Piscataway Board of Education voted to limit the amount of homework kids get. For kids in elementary school, homework is limited to 30 minutes a weeknight. For kids in high school, the amount of homework is limited to two hours a weeknight.
In recent years, many U.S. parents have called for limits on the amount of assigned homework.
Those parents have argued that heavy loads of homework leave kids little time for other activities. In addition, some parents say that homework assignments are so tough that they have to hire tutors to help their kids with homework.
Before the school board in Piscataway acted, parents there had been concerned about the amount of homework assigned by teachers. ""[Kids] are in school for six-and-a-half hours a day,"" said parent Cheryl Weaver. ""They don't need to come home and do another two or three hours of homework. That's more than a full-time job.""
Many educators worry about cutting down on homework. They say that limiting homework could mean limiting learning.
Some educators say that even a light load of homework helps kids learn and do well in school. The Educational Resources Information Center the of U.S. Department of Education has released a report about homework and its impact on students.
Many companies across the United States have developed Web sites aimed at helping kids with their homework. Many of those Web companies hire teachers to help kids come up with the answers to questions. Here are two such sites.
According to the department's report, homework helps students in many ways. For example, homework helps students become interested in different subjects, teaches them responsibility, and improves their classroom work. In short, homework helps students do better in school and get better grades.
Some students agree with the experts. New York resident Kaitlin Ofman, 12, notes that although she sometimes has a lot of homework, she still feels that there is a benefit to doing it.

The exhibit also includes the boy king's crown and gold dagger. The dagger was found strapped to the mummy's thigh.

679,"This will be a very different school year for Rand Amir. The fifth grader is among millions of schoolchildren who went back to school in Iraq in early October.
On the first day of school, Rand said, her classmates ripped out pictures of Saddam Hussein from their textbooks. Saddam is the former president of Iraq. The students tossed the pages out the window, yelling ""Bye, bye, Saddam.""
That was not an unusual sight at some schools throughout this war-torn country. Saddam's government was toppled in April. At that time, U.S.-led forces took control of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.
During Saddam's rule, teachers were forced to mention him in every lesson, from history to music to gym class. Students even learned math by adding 4 + 28. That's because April 28 is Saddam's birthday. Now schools are erasing Saddam's image and teachings from their lessons.
Iraqi officials are rewriting the country's textbooks. That will give students the opportunity to learn new ideas about the world.
The new textbooks, which will arrive this month, don't include any references praising Saddam. Pictures of Saddam have been removed from classrooms. Students are no longer forced to chant ""Long live our leader, Saddam"" during their classes.
Despite the changes, U.S. soldiers report that many of Iraq's schools are in various states of
, or poor condition. Although many schools were failing before the war began, many more schools were destroyed or seriously damaged during the fighting.
Some schools have broken windows and doors and are still without electricity or running water. Some lack chalkboards, desks, and other much-needed furniture and supplies.
The good news is that help is on the way for teachers and students. U.S. soldiers and aid groups are helping rebuild many of the run-down schools, restoring water and electricity.
They are also providing children with school supplies that Americans have donated. One 9-year-old Iraqi student was all smiles as soldiers unloaded boxes of new crayons, markers, book bags, and other donated supplies.
Despite the challenges, the new school year offers a fresh start for many teachers and children. ""Memories of the war are still fresh, but we shall go past that,"" said one teacher in Iraq. ""[The students] will be safer now.""
A fourth-grade class in Maine is reaching out to schoolchildren in Iraq. The students are collecting notebooks, colored pencils, rulers, and other supplies to send to Iraq.
that he hopes the care packages will improve the lives of schoolchildren in Iraq. His classmate Maddie Brochu feels the same way. ""They don't have very much at their schools,"" she said.
The project is close to their teacher's heart. Barbara Winslow's two sons serve in the U.S. military in Baghdad. Winslow told
that donating the supplies helps her students make a personal connection with children in another culture.
Why is it important to be able to think and learn freely?
The class also made a picture book and wrote a message of friendship. The message was translated into Arabic and included in each box. Arabic is the official language of Iraq. ""We hope we can reach out in friendship and make a difference,"" said Winslow.

For years, Samantha Goldfeld, 11, and her family have carried their own reusable cloth bags to the grocery store. ""My family is saving almost 800 disposable bags each year,"" the sixth grader from Scottsdale, Arizona, told
""Then we got to thinking about what that number would look like if everyone carried cloth bags instead of using paper or plastic.""
More than 500 billion plastic shopping bags are used each year worldwide. Plastic bags pollute city streets, jam recycling machines, and harm animals that get caught in the bags or ingest them. Plus,
are needed to manufacture plastic bags. Nonrenewable sources cannot be replaced.
Now Samantha has the chance to teach others about the benefits of reusable cloth bags. Samantha belongs to the community service group, Roots and Shoots, which will take part in National and Global Youth Service Day. Founded in 1986, the annual project is the largest service event in the world. From April 20 to 22, millions of young people across the globe will participate in volunteer projects, ranging from recycling to tutoring young children.
To encourage more people to use reusable cloth bags, Samantha and other Roots and Shoots members will host an information session. They plan to talk about the benefits of reusable cloth bags and provide tips for reducing plastic bag use.
Samantha is looking forward to the service event. ""Doing community service makes a difference for the environment, animals, and people,"" she says. ""Together we can make a huge difference for our planet.""

734,"Some call his journey remarkable. Others call it just plain crazy. For Christopher Swain, it was the swim of a lifetime.
Swain recently made history as the first person to swim the entire length of the Columbia River. In July 2003, the Oregon man ended a yearlong journey to raise awareness about pollution in that river. His 1,243-mile trip began in Canada and ended where the river meets the ocean-the Pacific Ocean.
Why did he do it? ""Every waterway needs a champion,"" Swain told
. ""I learned as much as I could about the river so I could see what I could do to clean it up.""
In 1805, explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were journeying west to find a passage to the Pacific Ocean. At that time, they described the Columbia River as clear, free flowing, and teeming with, or full of, salmon.
The Columbia River has changed since the days of Lewis and Clark's journey. Today, it is ravaged by
, or damage, the air, water, or land. Chemicals and waste from factories and towns contribute to water pollution. The pollution has caused a drop in the river's salmon population.
that have been built along the river mean the Columbia no longer flows freely. The dams are water barriers that provide electricity, control flooding, and carry water to farms.
The pollution in the river inspired Swain to take action. Wearing out seven wetsuits along the way and battling several colds, Swain braved water temperatures as low as 38 degrees. Followed by a boat, he swam between 5 and 25 miles a day through the polluted water.
""The Columbia River is a contaminated beauty,"" Swain told
. ""It runs through some of the most majestic landscapes on Earth.""
Despite the pollution, Swain is hopeful about the future of the river. During his journey, he spoke with nearly 13,000 people, including 8,000 schoolchildren, about keeping the river clean.
""With all the affection for the river, we have a chance to turn the [pollution problem] around,"" Swain said. ""Kids know that they want clean water.""
Earlier last year, Swain received the International Earth Day Award for protecting the Columbia River. And he hasn't finished making a splash yet! Later this year, he plans to swim in Lake Champlain, which borders Vermont and New York, the Hudson River in New York, and the Charles River in Boston.
How will Swain celebrate Earth Day on April 22? ""I will be in an East Coast waterway on Earth Day,"" he promised.
Each year, people celebrate Earth Day on April 22. They participate in community activities and care for the environment.
This year, the Earth Day theme is ""Water for Life."" Here are some ways experts say that kids can help protect water:
You can conserve water by turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth.
Organize a beach or river cleanup. Beach garbage, such as plastic rings, can get tangled around sea creatures and injure or harm them.
Make sure to put trash in its proper place-not in the water or down a drain.
What does Swain mean when he refers to the river as a ""contaminated beauty""?

What do these new discoveries mean? Scientists aren't sure, but hope the discoveries will reveal clues about the age of the rings around the sixth planet from the sun. ""I don't think Saturn's rings will disappear anytime soon, but this tells us how the rings are [changing] and how long they might last,"" says Linda Spilker, a scientist with the U.S. space agency, NASA.
Although Saturn's rings appear solid, they are actually made up of pieces of rock, ice, and dust. Those pieces vary from the size of tiny dust particles to the size of large mountains.
Scientists are also studying the shimmering rings to learn more about how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. They say that Saturn's rings are a model of the gas and dust that once surrounded the sunthe center of the solar system.

Sleep experts say that kids who do not get a good night's sleep on a regular basis put their safety at risk. Delaying bedtime for other activities can lead to accidents, such as falling off a bike or getting hurt on the playground.
In addition to preventing injuries, children who get enough sleep on a regular basis tend to get better grades and be in a better mood. ""Sleep is just as important as nutrition and exercise in our overall health,"" says Dr. Carl Hunt, a sleep expert with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Estimates show about 1 out of every 4 adults does not get enough sleep. Sleep experts think that number may be just as high for kids. According to the NIH, children ages 7 to 11 need at least nine hours of sleep each night.
Most kids and families today have busy schedules that can keep them from getting enough sleep. Plus, watching television, chatting on the Internet, and playing video games all compete with valuable sleep time.
Going to bed at the same time each night will help you get a good night's sleep. If you have trouble falling asleep, Dr. Hunt advises you to unwind with quiet time. Reading or listening to soothing music can help bring on sleep.

The diagram shows some of the organs in the human body. The diagram shows the kidneys in front of other body organs so you can see them. The kidneys are actually behin these organs.

In the United States, many people suffer from kidney disease. According to Arroyo's doctor, David Hull, more than 47,000 people are waiting for kidney transplants. For many of those people, finding a kidney is a problem.
Some of Evelyn Arroyo's relatives offered a kidney, but their kidneys did not match the tissue that made up Arroyo's kidneys. Arroyo's family feared she might die before a matching kidney was found.
That's when Bocchichio volunteered one of his kidneys, which matched Arroyo's tissue. During the operations, which took place in January, doctors removed one of Bocchichio's kidneys and put it inside Arroyo.
After the operations, Arroyo told Bocchichio, ""I want to thank you again for this chance to live for my beautiful girls;... you're my angel.""

624,"This map shows where Mount Vesuvius is located.
(veh-SOO-vee-uhss) majestically stands over the Italian landscape. The scenic mountain rises 4,200 feet high southeast of the city of Naples, which is located in southern Italy. But many people living in this region fear Mount Vesuvius. That's because it is an active volcano.
Nearly 2,000 years ago, Vesuvius exploded with tremendous force. Deadly smoke, gases, and rock shot more than 9 miles high in the air. That is about one and a half times the height of Mount Everest, the world's tallest mountain.
A thick black cloud engulfed the region and blocked out the sun. An avalanche of boiling
poured from the volcano at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. Lava is melted rock from a volcano.
The explosion sealed the ancient city of Pompeii (pahm-PAY) under a blanket of rock and ash. A mudslide wiped out the nearby town of Herculaneum (her-kyuh-LAY-nee-uhm). Many people died as a result of the volcano's fury.
Although many eruptions have occurred since then, Vesuvius hasn't exploded with such force since that devastating day. The last major eruption occurred in 1944.
Scientists warn, though, that it's only a matter of time before Mount Vesuvius erupts with tremendous force again. ""It won't be tomorrow, it won't be next month, and maybe it won't be next year,"" a scientist who monitors the volcano told
. ""But [Vesuvius] is overdue [to explode].""
Today, nearly 600,000 people live in the 18 towns surrounding Vesuvius. This high-risk area is known as the ""red zone.""
Officials estimate that they would need two weeks to evacuate all the people living in the red zone. According to scientists, anything within 4 miles of Vesuvius could be destroyed during the first 15 minutes of an eruption.
The volcano's past, however, hasn't stopped people from moving into the area. In fact, Italian officials are concerned about the overcrowding of people in the red zone. To encourage people to move away from this area, they have put a plan in place.
Some families are being offered $36,000 to move to safer locations. The goal is to persuade about 150,000 families to move from the area near the volcano within the next 15 years.
In 1995, the government also created a national park near the top of Vesuvius. That limits the number of people living there.
""Vesuvius is the most dangerous volcano in the world on account of the number of people living under it,"" said the president of the Naples region. ""The smaller the population, the smaller the danger Vesuvius represents.""

Anyone who's ever had a toothache will tell you that it can be very painful. Since ancient times, humans have tried different ways to stop the rot. Here are a few:
Ancient Egyptians placed a live mouse on a person's gums to relieve a toothache. They believed mice could cure toothaches because the rodents have good teeth.
One ancient Roman author wrote that tying a frog to a person's jaw would make teeth stronger.

No person was behind the camera's lens. The camera was triggered by motion and heat from the passing cat.

Although the cats face many threats, they have a hopeful future. Researchers have been educating ranchers and helping them build electric fences to keep their livestock from wandering into the wild.
Using cameras, scientists are keeping a watchful eye on these threatened cats and learning more about their range. As Rabinowitz points out, ""In some areas, jaguars are decreasing. In other areas, they are making a comeback.""

Most children who become soldiers come from very poor countries. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers estimates that 300,000 children are fighting as soldiers. In some countries, boys and girls as young as 8 years old are being recruited, or called upon, to fight.
Protecting children in war and conflict zones has become a top job for the United Nations. And the U.N. has made significant progress. In a report issued in December 2002, the U.N. named 28 governments and armed groups that use children to fight their battles.
International law prohibits countries from using children who are younger than 15 years old in combat. However, several U.N. conventions condemn, or do not approve of, having anyone under 18 serve as a soldier. If a country recruits child soldiers, it is violating, or breaking the rule of, international agreements.
Why us it important for governments around the world to protect children?
The U.N. wants to save children like Alhaji Babah Sawane from suffering. The report sends a strong message to governments everywhere: They will be held accountable for their actions.

87,"Journey to the Center of the Earth
What's under your feet? If you look at the ground, that question is answered easily. But dig a little deeper-about 4,000 miles deeper. That's where you will find Earth's core.
No one has ever journeyed to the center of Earth. However, scientists are trying to figure out what's there.
For a long time scientists believed that Earth's core is made of solid iron and nickel metals. Now, according to a new theory, or idea, a powerful nuclear reactor is located in Earth's core.
Earth may not be the only planet in the solar system that houses a nuclear reactor. Some scientists say nuclear reactions occur at the centers of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
All four of those planets give off, or radiate, more energy than they get from the sun. The scientists say a large energy source must lie hidden deep inside those planets.
Inside Earth's core, atoms, or tiny particles, of uranium split apart. When the atoms split, they give off lots of heat.
Scientist J. Marvin Herndon says the nuclear reaction in the core triggers volcanoes, moves the giant plates of rock that make up Earth's surface, and causes a magnetic field to surround our planet.
Earth has a magnetic field similar to a magnet's. Just like a magnet, Earth has a north pole and a south pole. The north pole has a positive magnetic charge; the south pole has a negative charge.
Earth's magnetic field changes over time. Over long periods of time, the magnetic poles move around. Sometimes the magnetic field completely disappears.
Herndon says the nuclear reaction at Earth's core causes those changes. He says the nuclear reaction changes. Sometimes it gives off lots of energy. At other times, it gives off less energy. And sometimes it stops for a short time.
If there is a nuclear reactor in Earth's core, someday it will stop completely. That would cause volcanoes to stop erupting, Earth's plates to stop moving, and the magnetic field to disappear forever.
The magnetic field protects Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. If the field disappears, life on Earth would end. But don't worry about that. The nuclear reaction in the core will not stop for 2 billion years, Herndon says.

""He decided he wanted to make a ball that would make it easier for us to pitch,"" the creator's son told
Early versions of the Wiffle ball included square holes and diamond-shaped holes. Neither of them worked.
That's how the Wiffle ball was born. Several years later, the plastic bat joined the ball.
How did the ball get its name? When you swing that plastic yellow bat and strike out, you whiff, said the creator's son.

According to the study, which was paid for by the U.S. government, more than 5 million kids, ages 6 to 19, have suffered some hearing loss. That's more than one out of every ten kids. Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss.
Amanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. ""It was assumed in the past that children wouldn't have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage,"" Niskar said.
Niskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a ""problem for children,"" she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems.
Hearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems.
For example, hearing loss ""can influence [a] child's ability to learn in the classroom,"" Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions.
Niskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead.
Listen Up! This diagram shows the parts of your ear. Loud noises can damage the cochlea and cause hearing loss.

337,"Preserving the Past: Saving the Mummies of the Ibaloi
High up in a dense, lush bamboo forest in the Philippines, scientists hike up a steep and narrow trail. (The Philippines is an island country in South-east Asia.)
As the scientists climb higher, they watch out for mud slides and rock falls. Finally, they emerge from under the forest's dripping leaves to face a forbidding black rock. As their eyes adjust to the light, they can see a small, narrow cave near the base of the rock.
Inside that cave, and numerous other nearby caves, is a national treasure. The treasure is not made of gold and silver, however, but of flesh and bone.
The treasure is actually dozens of mummies, some as old as 1,000 years. The Ibaloi people placed the mummies in the caves.
The mummies are the remains of some of the Ibaloi leaders and their families. The descendants of the mummies still live in the Philippines.
The mummies are located in an area called Kabayan in the Cordillera Central mountains. As many as 200 mummies may be located in 50 caves in the mountainous area.
The mummies are important because they tell scientists about past life in the Philippines. The mummies are also
, which means they are important to the religion of the Ibaloi.
Scientists from the National Museum of Manila in the Philippines are scrambling to find and protect all the mummies. The scientists worry that logging, forest fires, farming, or vandals may damage the mummies.
To protect the mummies, the Philippine government is putting up gates in front of the caves. Guards and tour guides are being hired to show people the mummies and to keep vandals away.
According to museum scientists, it took as much as one year to prepare an Ibaloi mummy. The process started when an Ibaloi tribal leader or family member who was near death drank a very salty liquid called
. The brine helped preserve the body.
The body was then strapped to a chair and placed over a low fire, as well as left in the sun to dry, for up to one year. Over time, the body would shrink. The body was then folded and placed in a coffin carved from a pine tree.

The wildfires that recently swept through southern California have been called one of the Golden State's worst natural disasters. The raging wildfires destroyed homes, businesses, and forests. Nearly 750,000 acres burned-an area of land about the size of Rhode Island. ""The whole sky seemed as if it was on fire,"" said one California resident.
Investigators say both people and nature were to blame for the fires. The fires spread rapidly because of the Santa Ana winds, which blow hot, dry air from the desert. Cold and rainy weather eventually rolled in to help quench the flames.
About 15,000 firefighters battled flames that were out of control. Thousands of people had to quickly

spoke to Buzz Aldrin about NASA's planned return to the moon, a future on Mars, and his children's book,
, which was recently featured at the National Book Festival in Washington, D.C.
What does it feel like to walk on the moon?
Aldrin: You knew that you were there, but it was unreal at the same time. It's so different and unusual that it's almost dreamlike.
What was the most memorable part of walking on the moon?
Aldrin: There are two moments that are not recorded on film. They're recorded in my mind. One was just the second or two after we shut the engine down and we realized that the spacecraft was on the moon. That really was the major achievement. When I was outside seeing the Earth, my other thought was that there were only three human beings who were not on Earth. [The third was Michael Collins, who was orbiting the moon in a craft that would take the astronauts back to Earth.]
Your children's book is about following your dreams. Did you dream of being an astronaut?
Aldrin: Well, there wasn't any such thing as an astronaut until about 1958 or 1959.
[the Soviet space satellite] didn't go up until 1957, so thinking of human beings in space was not at all common.
Will returning to the moon have the same impact as it did when you and Mr. Armstrong first set foot on the moon?
Aldrin: No, I don't think there is any way you can replace that competitiveness [to reach the moon first] that existed, that pioneering spirit. The moon is a proving ground in our backyard. We've been there before, but it's preparing us to visit another planet.
You've been a supporter of a piloted mission to Mars. Why do you think it's so important that we send humans to Mars?
Aldrin: Now we can send robots to Mars, but that just wouldn't satisfy the human desire to want to expand our horizons. We've always done that. I can't answer by saying that there is going to be something profitable that will be returned from Mars, other than perhaps storytelling or making movies en route.
Your sister gave you the name ""Buzzer"" when you were youngand then it got shortened to Buzz. And that stuck?

More than two-thirds of the Himalayan glaciers are already melting. This could spell disaster for countries such as China, India, and Nepal, which depend on rivers fed by melting snow from the glaciers for water.
Despite the loss of a few feet, Everest is still the highest point above sea level. Its peak lies on the border between China and Nepal. The mountain was named after Sir George Everest, who mapped much of South Asia between 1830 and 1843.

Many people don't like paying high prices for music CDs. They say they like to get their music online because it's easy-and it's free.
During the past three years, music sales have suffered a huge loss. Record industry officials blame the drop on the increasing number of people who get their songs free on the Internet.

For people who still want to get their music online, they can do it without breaking the law. Some music-sharing services on the Web work in a similar way to record stores. The services charge a small fee for each song that is copied.

Mount St. Helens is located in Washington.
Scientists say Mount St. Helens is one of the most closely monitored volcanoes and the most active volcano in the lower 48 states. Mount St. Helens is also among 13 active volcanoes that are located in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. That range is home to several powerful volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier and Mount Hood.
Although scientists say a large eruption at Mount St. Helens is unlikely, they are cautious because of the volcano's history. Officials have sealed off a 5-mile area around the volcano.
Mount St. Helens erupted with tremendous force in May 1980, blowing more than 1,300 feet off its top and killing 57 people. The blast destroyed thousands of acres of forest and scattered ash for thousands of miles. Mount St. Helens continued to rumble until 1986 but has been quiet since that time.
How can scientists tell when a volcano will awaken from its slumber? ""We measure earthquake activity, changes in the mountain, and volcanic gases,"" said Driedger.

are installed around volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens to detect earthquakes. Earthquakes always strike before a volcano erupts.
Volcanoes are mountains where hot, liquid rock called magma deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure can cause magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the crater at the top of the volcano and vents, or cracks, along its side. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called lava. Once lava cools, it hardens into rock.
Scientists use special global positioning instruments to measure movements on the slopes of the mountain--a clue to the buildup of
. Magma is red-hot molten rock located inside the volcano. It is called
when it pours out of the volcano.
As magma rises, volcanoes release carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Sensors on helicopters test the air for gases that signal rising magma. ""The gases are like telegrams that tell us what's going on inside the volcano,"" said Driedger.
More than 500 million people around the world live near active volcanoes. Monitoring volcanoes is a dangerous job, but scientists take precautions to stay safe.
""By watching volcanoes, we learn how they work,"" said Driedger. ""The more we know, the better prepared we can be to save property and lives.""
Besides volcanoes, what natural disasters are hard for scientists to predict? Why?

193,"Children find open arms in new schools after Hurricane Katrina.
as she watched heavy rains and high winds rip through her hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana. The 9-year-old had been getting ready to start fourth grade. Her brother, Terren, had arranged his school supplies in his backpack to prepare for his first day of second grade. But Hurricane Katrina prevented schools in New Orleans from opening.
When New Orleans flooded, Tenisha and her family headed 350 miles west to Houston, Texas. They spent five days in a Houston hotel until a local family provided them with shelter. Now Tenisha and her brother are getting used to a new school in Houston. ""I've started making new friends already,"" Tenisha told
Tenisha and Terren are not alone. An estimated 372,000 children from Louisiana and Mississippi have found themselves in new schools, since the hurricane caused damage and flooding in those states. Schools from Maine to California have embraced students like Tenisha and Terren with hugs, smiles, and welcome signs.
Schools in Texas expect to enroll as many as 60,000 new kids. Houston schools alone enrolled almost 2,000 students in the few days following the devastating hurricane.
Two schools in Houston that had closed last spring have reopened. The two schools are now devoted entirely to
children. An evacuee is a person forced to move from a place of danger. School principals are also hiring hundreds of new teachersmany are evacuees from Louisiana and Mississippi.
Being the new kid at school is never easy. Experts say that it's even harder for children
because of the hurricane. Displaced people have been forced to flee from their homes.
Students who have left their homes have to
or get used to, new schools, teachers, and friends, say officials. Schools also play an important role in helping kids from the stricken areas cope with the disaster of Katrina.
Tenisha and Terren are adjusting well to their new schoolMacGregor Music and Science Magnet School in Houston. So far, MacGregor has accepted more than 12 displaced students. ""We want each one of the new children to feel this is home for them,"" the school's principal, Patsy Brown, told
Students at MacGregor have welcomed the new faces. ""We want to make our new classmates feel good because we know they've gone through so much,"" fourth grader James McKethen told
James's sister, third grader Tiye McKethen, agrees. ""It's cool to have new friends. And they get to have fun in a new school and stay in a safe place.""
After just two days, Tenisha and Terren were settling in at MacGregor. ""Our new school is great!"" Tenisha told
But the siblings know that life has changed. Despite the warm welcome, Terren misses playing basketball with his friends in New Orleans. Tenisha, too, misses her old teachers. What's next for the family? They will likely settle down in Texas. Tenisha says, ""I want to stay in Houston.""
I live in Desoto, a town outside Dallas, Texas. My school district has taken in roughly 188 students from New Orleans. I must hand it to the kids; they are adapting pretty fast. It is cool because our school is doing everything to make the new students feel at home. We call it ""Southern hospitality.""
I have seen many acts of kindnesswhether it's letting a kid from New Orleans go to the front of the lunch line or giving a new student a personal tour of the school.
I wonder if I could be as strong if my city went through a disaster such as Katrina. What happens to New Orleans from here, we don't know. But what we do know is that we need to appreciate our family and friends. We need to be thankful for the things that we have because we do not know what tomorrow will bring.
Christopher Ray Clark is a sixth grader from the DallasFort Worth area. He and his family have been volunteering to help Katrina evacuees.

To solve that problem, some communities are sending kids to school in old stores, car dealerships, and malls!
The number of kids in school is increasing. In 15 years, eight million more kids than today will attend U.S. schools. Educators wonder what to do with all those kids. ""We need to figure out where we will put these children and who will teach them,"" said Richard Riley, U.S. Secretary of Education.
Educators say 10 million additional teachers will be needed to teach those kids.
Mesa, Arizona, is typical of many communities that have more kids than school space. Mesa has 84 schools and 550 classroom trailers parked around those schools. And still there isn't enough room for all the school-age kids.
To solve its space problem, officials in Mesa are building new schools. The community is also recycling old stores into schools.
This year, 700 elementary students in Mesa are attending the new Pedro Guerrero School, which used to be a supermarket. Where families once shopped for vegetables, kids now learn reading, history, science, and math.
Cassandra Fernandez attends the new school. The fifth grader's mother, who used to shop at the store, was worried when she heard that the city planned to turn it into a school. ""I thought, how are they going to make that [store] into a school?"" she said. Cassandra's mother, however, now likes the school and all the new equipment in it.
Mesa isn't the only community that has recycled old buildings into schools. Schools in Georgia, New Jersey, Ohio, and other states are also recycling schools. Recycling old buildings into schools is less expensive and takes less time than building new schools. Recycling schools also helps the environment by leaving space for trees.

: You should let a cut breathe.
: Contrary to popular belief, cuts do not need to breathe. ""The open cut or scrape should be covered,"" said skin expert Dr. Amy Harned. According to Dr. Harned, it's important to wash the wound first. Then, apply an antibiotic ointment and cover the cut with a bandage. Leaving a cut uncovered can allow germs to infect it.
: Eating carrots will improve your eyesight.
: Carrots are rich in vitamin A, which helps keep your eyes healthy. According to eye expert Dr. Timothy Wingert, ""Eating carrots will not improve your eyesight. But eating carrots is part of a well-balanced diet. Carrots have nutrients that help your eyes to function properly."" Carrots also make a tasty snack.
: You can hurt your eyes by sitting too close to the TV.
: There is some truth to this advice. According to Dr. Wingert, sitting too close to the television for long periods of time makes eyes tired and can cause eyestrain. ""Generally, it is more comfortable on your eyes to view the television from at least 5 feet from the screen,"" he says. So, back up from that television or, better yet, turn it off!

179,"""May I stay up just a little longer?"" That's the cry heard from kids every night in many U.S. households. That's because most kids don't want to go to bed.
Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks.
The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8? hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said.
Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said.
In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should.
Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school.
Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep.
Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' ""
If a kid loses one hour of sleep a night, how many hours of sleep does he or she lose in a week? A month? A year?

77,"Groundbreaking begins for a monument dedicated to an important leader.
Martin Luther King, Jr. at the March on Washington, August 28, 1963.
On a summer day in 1963, more than 200,000 people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to rally for equal rights. There, they heard Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Today, construction of a memorial honoring King is under way about a half mile from the Lincoln Memorial, where King gave that famous speech. The new memorial will be the first on the National Mall to honor an African American.
The groundbreaking ceremony for the King memorial was held on November 13. President George W. Bush, former President William Jefferson Clinton, poet Maya Angelou, and talk show host Oprah Winfrey were among the speakers at the event. ""We give Martin Luther King his rightful place among the many Americans honored on the National Mall,"" Bush told the crowd of about 5,000 people.
King (19291968) dedicated his life to helping others. As a boy growing up in the U.S. South, King witnessed African Americans being treated unfairly. At that time, the South was
or separated by race. Under the law, African Americans were not allowed to attend the same schools as white people and had to sit in the backseats of buses. African Americans also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains.
When King was older, he worked to change those unjust laws. During the 1950s and 1960s, he gave speeches and organized peaceful marches and protests.
Beginning in 1955, King led the famous Montgomery bus boycott to protest segregation. For 381 days, African Americans
or refused to use, public buses in the Alabama city. A year after the boycott began, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregation on buses was illegal.
King gained national attention from the boycott. As a result of his work, civil rights laws were passed.
are personal rights to freedom and equality guaranteed to all U.S. citizens and protected by the Constitution.
The King memorial is scheduled to be completed in 2008. The design uses water, stone, and trees to represent the themes of justice, democracy, and hope. The King memorial will also include a boulder called the Stone of Hope, from which will emerge a 30-foot figure of King. The memorial will contain a circular stone wall chiseled with King's words.
King's dream was for all people to be treated fairly and equally under the law. The design of the memorial is based on a line from his historic ""I Have a Dream"" speech: ""We will be able to hew [cut] out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.""

The Mercury missions were the first attempts by NASA, the U.S. space agency, to send a human into space. The rocket missions took place from 1961 to 1963. During the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union competed to build the best space program. That period was called the space race. Tia interviewed her grandfather, Clark Presler, about his role in the 1961 Mercury 3 mission, during which astronaut Alan B. Shepard Jr. became the first American in space.
What do you remember from your experiences in the Navy?
I remember being part of the pickup crew [aboard the U.S.S.
] when the first manned space capsule returned to Earth. It was May 5, 1961. The name of the [rocket] was the Mercury-Redstone 3.
What was the purpose of this mission?
NASA wanted to send a man into orbit and back safely. His name was Alan B. Shepard Jr.
The capsule reached [an altitude of] about 187.45 kilometers, which is 114.61 miles.
The orbit flight lasted only 15 minutes.
In the Atlantic Ocean, near Cape Canaveral, Florida.
How did you pick up Mr. Shepard?
Well, we lifted the capsule up on the chain. Alan was standing up on it, hanging on to the chain. He came out without a single scratch on his body.
At first, I thought this project would be easy, but after the interview I knew I had to learn what this was all about. So later that day I asked Grandpa to explain this to me. After that, it sounded a lot clearer, and it's fun having a member of your family actually do something, well, famous.

In 2002, President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act. This education law provides states with government money so they can help improve their school systems.
The law is meant to ensure that schools are doing enough to help students who are struggling learners. Bush says that the law helps students perform better in reading and math. Under the law, schools are required to measure students' progress through testing. Schools in which many students don't perform well on the tests have two years to improve. Otherwise, students have the option to transfer to different schools.
Senator Kerry voted for the No Child Left Behind Act. If elected, he will continue to support this law. However, Kerry wants the government to give states more money to enforce the education law and make sure schools receive the money they need.
In addition, Kerry proposes to increase the number of high school graduates. To do that, he plans to reduce class sizes and break up large, failing high schools. He also wants to begin a program in which college students mentor (help) middle school students plan for their futures.

Rats have always lived in cities. The rodents live off food and waste that people throw away. Recently, however, rat populations have grown because many communities don't have the money to pay for rat-control programs, said Jerry Hershovitz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Such programs keep rat populations down.
Rats can carry diseases that can make people seriously ill, so controlling the rat population is important.

NASA recently announced plans to build a permanent base on the moon. Astronauts could be living and working there by 2020, according to the U.S space agency. The goal is to prepare astronauts for a trip to Mars in the future.
Under the plan, four-person crews will begin with weeklong missions to the moon. By 2024, when more equipment has been set up, astronauts will be able to
or live, on the moon for as long as six months. Astronauts will travel in roving vehicles to explore the area near the
Unlike Earth, the moon has no air, wind, or weather. Its dusty
or surface, is covered with deep craters. So how can humans survive on the moon?
NASA hopes to establish a lunar outpost near one of the moon's poles. ""These locations experience sunlight for longer periods of time than other locations on the moon, which will make it possible to use solar power,"" NASA official Michael Braukus told
Solar power is energy from the sun that can be used to generate electricity.
It is also likely that the polar regions are rich in natural resources, such as oxygen and hydrogen. While on the moon, astronauts plan to use natural resources for water and fuel.
The moon is the only place beyond Earth that humans have visited. About 238,900 miles away, the moon is Earth's closest space neighbor.
On July 20, 1969, Americans Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the moon. Those space pioneers traveled to the lunar surface on the

or stop using, its aging space shuttle fleet by 2010. For their trek to the moon, astronauts will travel aboard the new
crew exploration vehicle, which is being developed. The vehicle, a modernized version of the
craft, will attach to a lunar lander.
The moon mission is part of President George W. Bush's longterm space plan. The proposed base is the first step in the bold plan to prepare astronauts for their ultimate destinationMars.
Because Mars is so far from Earth, traveling there will require humans to stay for long periods of time. Astronauts will not be able to bring enough supplies for the entire mission. They will have to use the elements on Mars to survive.
""By demonstrating we can survive on another world for a long time, we build confidence that we can venture much farther from Earth and stay for longer periods of time,"" says Braukus of NASA.
While some supporters are jumping over the moon about launching a new era of space exploration, not everyone is pleased with the plan. Critics warn that it will be difficult to fund the moon program. So far, NASA has not put a price tag on the mission but welcomes participation by other countries to help carry out its plan.
In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched
the first artificial satellite in space. The U.S. space program was established as a response. The ""space race"" between the two countries had begun. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy challenged Americans to send a person to the moon by the end of the 1960s. The time line shows some U.S. space milestones and NASA's plans for the lunar base.

605,"Soaring high above California's coastline stand the magnificent redwood trees. Redwoods are the world's tallest known trees and are also some of the oldest. Some scientists are concerned about a disease that is threatening the ancient giants. It is called sudden oak death.
The disease has scientists alarmed. First identified in 1995, sudden oak death has spread along hundreds of miles of California's coastline and jumped into southern Oregon. In addition to attacking oak trees, it has spread to redwoods, Douglas firs, and other types of trees and shrubs. One of the worst outbreaks of the disease has occurred at California's Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park.
Scientists recently discovered the organism responsible for the disease. It is a fungus that causes oozing red blobs to grow on diseased oak trees. On younger redwoods, it dries up leaves and kills sprouts. According to scientists, redwoods are hosts for the disease. A host is an organism on or in which another organism lives.
The disease first showed up in rhododendron plants in the Netherlands in 1993. Scientists are concerned because the spread of the disease could pose a threat to the redwoods' ecosystem, an environment where plants and animals coexist. Scientist David Rizzo said that anytime you have a strange organism, there is cause for concern.
Coastal redwoods can grow upwards of 360 feet. Some are taller than the Statue of Liberty, which stands about 300 feet.
The diameter of redwoods can measure about 20 feet.
Named California's state tree, the redwood can live more than 2,000 years.
In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Muir Woods a national monument dedicated to protecting and preserving the mighty redwoods.
In 1904, a fungus from Asia began killing chestnut trees in New York. Over the next 50 years, the disease killed about 3.5 billion trees and almost wiped out an entire species. Scientists want to prevent this from happening in California or elsewhere in the United States.
Studies show this disease spreads rapidly during the wet months of spring. The coming months could be vital in tracking the disease. Current weather forecasts predict that this spring will be rainier than the last two springs. ""We have to get familiar with the symptoms and the treatments,"" said another scientist, ""because we don't know how much farther it will spread.""

The main goal of the mission is to build a research base on the moon where humans can live and work. The moon is very different from Earth. Unlike Earth, there is no air, wind, or weather. The moon's dusty surface is pitted with craters.
While on the moon, astronauts hope to demonstrate that they can ""live off the land."" Learning how to live off the land is important for future human missions to Mars. Because Mars is so far from Earth, traveling there will require humans to stay for long periods of time.
The United States has already begun using robots to explore Mars. Two robotic vehicles,
, are on the Red Planet now. They are searching for signs of water, a requirement for life. Another vehicle, called an orbiter, is on its way. The orbiter is set to arrive in March and will circle Mars, studying the planet for signs of water.
Should We Go Back to the Moon?
Although some space experts and lawmakers praise the plan to return to the moon, others oppose it because of the high cost. The project is set to cost $104 billion.
Some people think that money should be used for other causes, such as helping to rebuild the Gulf Coast after the hurricanes Katrina and Rita. But NASA is quick to defend the space program. ""[It] is a long-term investment in our future,"" says Griffin.
Others say that the public needs to keep being reminded of the ultimate goal. Scientist Louis Friedman says, ""If you don't keep the Mars mission out front, people are going to ask, 'Why are we returning to the moon?' It's got to be because we're extending ourselves into the solar system.""
In 1961, President John F. Kennedy promised to land a person on the moon by the end of the 1960s. It was part of the ""Space Race"" with the then Soviet Union.

Beth met her new friends through a new program at the aquarium. The program gives visitors a chance to wade into the water with the whales and touch them.
Visitors wear thick rubber overalls to stay warm in the cold water. They can stroke the whales and touch the animals' tongues. According to their trainers, the belugas love to have their tongues rubbed.
Beluga whales eat about 50 pounds of fish each day. They make noises such as clicks, squeaks, whistles, and moos. Belugas use their sounds to send messages to one another and to help them find their prey.

What Should You Do to Avoid the Flu?
There have been a lot of empty desks in schools across the United States this winter. Many kids have stayed home while sick with the flu bug that is raging across the country.
Chances are if the flu hasn't made you sick yet, it has infected someone you know. Experts say the flu season struck more than a month earlier than its normal start. It began in October and spread quickly. Flu season typically runs from December through April.
""Most of us are convinced this was a hard flu season on children,"" said one flu expert. Hospitals and doctors' offices have been jammed with sick patients, especially kids. Some schools even closed because the flu outbreak was so severe.

Unlike a cold, the flu usually strikes suddenly and without warning. Some

Someone who has the flu virus can easily infect other people. The flu is highly

The flu virus spreads through the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Other people can catch the flu by breathing in the airborne germs.
You can also get the flu by coming in contact with places where germs hang out-such as computer keyboards and door handles-and then touching your mouth or nose.
Although there is no cure for the flu, health experts say that getting a

This season, many people lined up to get the vaccine in the form of flu shots. Each year, the flu virus changes. Scientists develop a vaccine to protect people from the type of virus that is spreading.
Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that ""there's still plenty of flu out there,"" this organization has some good news. It reports that the number of flu cases appears to be on the decline.
At press time, health officials say only five states report that the flu is widespread. That number is down from 45 at the flu's
, or highest point, in December. Now, that's something to feel better about!
What Should You Do If the Flu Sneaks Up on You?
Kids often get the flu because they are in close contact with one another at school. ""If you get the flu, don't panic,"" advises Dr. Carol Baker, of Houston, Texas. ""Most kids will recover just fine."" To help you get better, follow these tips that

What Should You Do to Avoid the Flu?
To keep flu germs from spreading, practice these healthful habits:
Wash your hands often with soap and water.
Cover your nose or mouth with a tissue when you sneeze or cough. Remember to throw away the tissue!
Avoid touching your nose, eyes, or mouth. Germs can easily enter your body there.

The doctors said kids today watch more TV than kids did 30 years ago. Today, one in three kids watches four or more hours of TV a day. Watching that much TV, they said, is unhealthful.
According to the doctors, kids are not entirely to blame for watching too much TV. Part of the problem comes from a lack of safe places for kids to play.
Crespo and Anderson aren't against watching TV, as long as kids limit the time they spend in front of the tube.
""There are a certain number of hours in the day you're supposed to sleep [and] do your homework,"" said Crespo. ""You're supposed to go to school, and then there is a certain amount of hours that you are free to do whatever you want.

Manatees were once thought to be on the edge of

As a result, Florida recently removed the manatee from its list of
Endangered species are animals or plants that are at risk of dying out.
The first laws protecting this slow-moving marine mammal were passed in the late 1970s. Those laws made hunting, capturing, or killing manatees illegal.
As Floridas human population grew, however, manatees faced more threats. Last year alone, 396 manatees died in Florida, according to the states Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Many manatees have been injured or killed in collisions with boats. Others have gotten tangled in fishing gear. Manatees are also threatened because of the loss of their
As builders develop along the coastline, they destroy the manatees natural homes.
Environmental factors, such as red tide, have also taken their toll on the playful creatures. Red tide occurs when millions of tiny organisms are present in an area of the water. Those tiny organisms turn the ocean red and brown. Some of them are harmful to fish and other animals.
Red tide occurs naturally in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2005, more than 80 manatees were killed in red-tide outbreaks.
Not everyone thinks it is a good idea to remove manatees from the list. Many wildlife experts worry that the unusual mammals will not receive the same protection they had in the past. ""We cant celebrate yet,"" warned manatee expert Patrick Rose in an interview with
State officials say that the manatee is not under urgent threat. Although the huge creatures are being removed from Floridas list, state scientists say that the animal will remain protected under the nations Endangered Species Act. That law offers special protection to animals and plants facing extinction.
Wildlife officials say protection of the manatees might even be strengthened. The next step calls for the writing of a plan to continue increasing the number of manatees. ""There will be no less protection,"" says Henry Cabbage of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
A manatee recently got a taste of the Big Apple. Manatees are rarely seen far from the warm coastal waters of Florida, but one adventurous sea cow swam north to waters off New York City this summer. The large marine visitor then swam to waterways about 25 miles inland. Wildlife officials say its not unusual for manatees to

A great white shark cruised across the Indian Ocean in a record-breaking swim. The great white became the first shark known to complete a round-trip journey between two continents.
""This is the first time that an individual fish has been found to go across an entire ocean and come back to the same spot,"" says Ramn Bonfil, one of the scientists who studied the shark. Scientists named the shark Nicole, after Australian actor Nicole Kidman.
Nicole not only set a distance record but also took a bite out of the speed record. The great white clocked more than 12,400 miles on her trip from South Africa to Australia and back. She
or moved between locations, faster than any other marine animal.
The map shows Nicoles route between South Africa and Australia.
Great whites live mainly off the coasts of California, South Africa, and Australia. Nicoles 99-day journey was tracked with an electronic tag placed on her fin.
The tag recorded her movements, including how deep she dove in the water. The results stunned scientists. They discovered that there is more interaction among great white populations in Africa and Australia than had previously been thought.
The new find is helping scientists learn more about how sharks migrate and
(find their way). Why might Nicole have swum so far so fast? Scientists dont know for sure, but they think one of the reasons that she may have made the trip was a search for food. Great white sharks feed mainly on whales, seals, and fish.
And how did Nicole find her way from one continent to another? Although she frequently plunged to depths of more than one-half mile, Nicole spent most of her time swimming on the surface. That led scientists to suspect that great whites might use the sun and the moon to help navigate.
The recent discoveries have excited shark lovers. ""Its clear that we have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg,"" says Bonfil. ""There is still much to learn about great white shark migrations.""
Great whites arent the only big fish in the sea. There are about 370 species, or types, of sharks. Here are some sharks that make a splash.
The whale shark grows up to 40 feet long and weighs about 15 tons. Thats heavier than two elephants!
The dwarf lantern shark is thought to be one of the smallest sharks. It is about 6 inches long.
Although most sharks swim about 1.5 miles per hour (mph), the mako shark is thought to cruise around at 22 mph.
The dusky shark has the most powerful bite. Its jaws clamp together with 132 pounds of force.

A condor's wingspan is 9.5 feet across. That's about as wide as two kids lying down head to toe.
Wildlife experts say the condors did not die from the heat. Instead, the experts believe the huge birds died from lead poisoning. They say the condors had swallowed lead shotgun pellets.
, which means they eat the remains of dead animals. The condors probably ate the remains of an animal that had been shot by a hunter. As they ate the dead animal's flesh, the birds ate the deadly pellets.
If swallowed, lead can make an animal sick or cause death. Lead stops the body from making red blood cells. It can also damage an animal's organs, including the brain and liver.
The five poisoned birds were among 35 condors that have been released in Arizona since 1996. The release program has cost millions of dollars.

California condors are among the world's largest birds. A hundred years ago, the birds were found in many parts of the United States.

Katie's pitching feat caught the attention of the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.
In July, the Baseball Hall of Fame put Katie's jersey on display. Her shirt now hangs in the same building that houses items that once belonged to baseball legends ""Babe"" Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, and Hank Aaron.
Katie won the game in a style that would make Pedro Martinez, the ace pitcher for the New York Mets, proud. She struck out all 18 batters she faced in the game in Oakfield, New York!
Katie has been playing baseball since she was 6. She first took the mound three years ago. Since her history-making win, she has found herself in the spotlight of the national media. Katie has even met President George W. Bush and received a congratulatory note and a pink baseball cap from the Los Angeles Dodgers.
What is Katie's advice to other young athletes? ""Just believe in your dreams, and go out and have fun.""

One of New Hampshires most famous faces recently became history. In May, the Old Man of the Mountain crumbled to the ground.
The Old Man, of course, wasnt a person but a rock formation that nature carved out thousands of years ago. With its pointed nose, sharp chin, and heavy forehead, the mountainside looked like the profile of an old mans face. A
is a side view of a face.
Located on Cannon Mountain, the Old Man was a popular tourist spot and a favorite among the people of New Hampshire. In fact, the jagged rock face was considered the state symbol. It appeared on state quarters, road signs, and many souvenirs.
The famous landmark stretched 40 feet high and 25 feet wide. Long concerned that it would collapse, officials made several efforts to save the mountain face. However, the heavy snow and strong winds of this past winter finally caused the cliff to collapse.
Now a special state committee has been set up to decide if the stone profile should be replaced with a man-made face. ""He was part of our history, and he can still be a part of our history if we rebuild him,"" said a New Hampshire man who recalled learning about the famous face in the fourth grade.
Do you think the Old Man should be rebuilt? Why or why not?
However, other people dont necessarily feel the same way. ""Mother Nature put him there, and Mother Nature took him,"" said one committee member. ""To put it back up, to rebuild, wouldnt be the same.""

The Red Spider Nebula surrounds one of the hottest stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Earth is located in the Milky Way.
The star has a surface temperature of at least 900,000 degrees Fahrenheit (F). In comparison, our sun has a surface temperature of only 10,000 degrees F.
The Red Spider Nebula formed when the star began to run out of fuel and exploded, pushing gases in its atmosphere away from the star. The remaining star collapsed to form a white dwarf star. White dwarfs are very small and very hot.
The tremendous heat from the star warms the nebula, causing it to glow red. The gases in the nebula reach temperatures of 18,000 degrees F.

Instead of using soap and water, the doctors use a special gel. The gel kills germs and saves time. Doctors often take more than a minute to wash their hands with soap and water. The gel speeds things up.
What's more, constant washing and drying with soap and water dries out hands. The gel causes fewer problems, so doctors who use it are less likely to skip a cleaning.
Killing hospital germs is important. About 2 million hospital patients are infected by viruses each year. About 90,000 die from viruses they got in the hospital.
If you're not working in a hospital, using soap and water is good enough. All of us need to keep hands clean to keep germs away. Washing hands is important, especially before eating and before leaving a bathroom, where many germs live. It is important to keep your hands clean at school, too!

The explosions killed ten workers and injured others. Workers struggled for days to save the rig, only to see it slowly topple over and sink into the ocean.
Officials from the Brazilian oil company Petrobras, which owns the rig, were concerned after some of the 400,000 gallons of diesel fuel and crude oil on the rig leaked out. But the spill turned out to be smaller than expected.
The problem now facing Brazil is the loss of oil production. The P-36 rig provided a large portion of the oil Brazil uses to make fuel. Now the country will have to import more oil from other countries to meet demands.

Other humanoid robots created by Japanese companies have been getting plenty of attention even without playing the trumpet.
Japanese scientists introduced ASIMO (ah-SEE-moh), the world's first stair-climbing robot, in 2000. The 4-foot, 115-pound ASIMO's many talents include walking, holding objects, speaking Japanese, and recognizing faces. ASIMO recently finished a world tour.

The robots may also be able to help elderly people with chores such as vacuuming and taking out the garbage. Some people, however, worry that robots may take away jobs that are now performed by humans.
Although the humanoid robots have been busy making public appearances, they aren't for sale yet. If you really want a robot that will clean your room and help out with chores, you still have to wait a bit longer.

""I started thinking of them as a family almost immediately,"" filmmaker Martyn Colbeck told
He was talking about wild elephants, not his next-door neighbors. For more than 15 years, Colbeck has filmed a family of African elephants in Amboseli National Reserve in eastern Africa.
airs April 1 on the PBS television show
The new film comes after recent studies found that elephants can recognize their reflection in a mirror. That is something only humans, chimpanzees, and dolphins were thought to be able to do. ""These animals are smart,"" Colbeck says. His documentary shows just how intelligent African elephantsthe world's largest land animalsare.
Colbeck's film follows an elephant family led by a 62-year-old female elephant named Echo. In the wild, African elephants live in herds. They roam long distances to find food. The oldest female elephant, called the
leads the herd. Adult male elephants live separately from the females and the young calves.
Echo guides her family to fresh water and food while staying alert for danger. The young elephants are the most
or at risk of being harmed. Colbeck witnessed that danger when he saw another elephant family attempt to kidnap Echo's calf Ebony. Echo gathered the other adult female elephants in her family to come to the rescue. ""Together they plowed into the kidnappers to recover Ebony,"" Colbeck explained. ""It showed forethought and teamwork.""
During his years of filmmaking, Colbeck observed other signs of elephant intelligence. Elephants communicate with each other through low rumbling sounds that people often cannot hear. Family members also make distinct sounds that other members can recognize.
or customs. After an elephant dies, the other family members cover the body with sticks and leaves and linger near the site for days. The animals often return to the site years later.
Amboseli National Reserve covers about 150 square miles in southern Kenya, near the Tanzania border. The Kenyan government protects the nature reserve's elephants from
or illegal hunting. Elephants have been hunted throughout history for the ivory in their tusks. Humans have used ivory to make jewelry and other objects. Today, elephants are an endangered species.
Since strict anti-poaching laws were put into effect in 1968, the number of elephants in Amboseli has risen from 500 to more than 1,200. When Colbeck began filming Echo's family in 1990, the family had only 14 members. Today it has 30 members.
Although the elephants still face some danger from the local Masai tribespeople, the creatures have become remarkably comfortable around human visitors. That makes Amboseli an ideal place for scientists to study elephant behavior.
""The elephants are totally relaxed about having vehicles in amongst the herd,"" says Colbeck. ""Nevertheless, it is still very important to respect the animals and not disturb them.  That respect develops into a trust, and in that way we have been able to document some extraordinary moments in their lives."" That trust has not only allowed Colbeck to film Echo's family, but it has also made him feel like one of the family.
The elephant families in Amboseli National Reserve are organized alphabetically. Echo's family is the ""E"" family, so every member of the family is given a name starting with
Here's how Echo fits in with some of her relatives.
(age 62): Echo is one of the oldest elephants in Amboseli. She is the leader of her family. You can tell that she is old by the length of her tusks. They are almost touching! Wild African elephants live an average of 60 years.

(age 17): When he was born, Ely couldn't walk. The family waited to move until he stood on his own. Now he lives alone. He left the herd at age 12.
(age 25): Edwina is Echo's first known grandchild.
(age 22): Eleanor helped care for Email after Erin died.
(age 6): Email's mother, Erin, died when he was 2. Now the rest of the family takes care of him.
(age 12): Europa is Echo's first known great-grandchild.
(age 8): Elaine is Echo's second great-granddaughter.

Skateboard class is rolling into schools! For sixth grader Carlos Cervantes, learning to skateboard takes a lot of work, but its worth it. ""[On] the first day of class, I was scared, but I tried it,"" the 12-year-old told
""After two days of practice, I felt more comfortable.""
Carlos is learning to skateboard in an after-school program at West Middle School in Aurora, Colorado. Skateboards are now finding their way into the regular school day as well. Douglass Elementary in nearby Boulder is the first public school in the country to offer skateboarding in gym class.
Douglasss physical education (PE) teacher Richard Cendali starts his skateboarding class by teaching students how to put on their safety gear and how to fall without getting hurt. Then kids start rolling around the gym. ""Sometimes theyre so excited, they fall. Theyre screaming, Im doing it! Im doing it!"" says Cendali, laughing. ""Its such a thrill to see those kids succeed and see their smiles.""
PE instructors around the country have started teaching classes such as skateboarding, in-line skating, yoga, and even rock climbing. Experts call these sports ""the new PE."" These individual sports are designed to help fight childhood
by getting kids involved in fun physical activities. Obesity is the condition of being dangerously overweight. Another goal of these nontraditional activities is to promote lifelong fitness habits.
Since 1980, the percentage of young people who are overweight has more than tripled. The time students spend in PE class, however, is decreasing. Many schools have dropped gym classes to save money or to provide students with more classroom time. Only 8 percent of elementary schools offer gym class to students every day, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Because students have less PE time, teachers are searching for ways to keep kids moving. ""[Skateboarding] is a great activity that keeps kids engaged in physical movement and gives them new skills and interests,"" says West Middle Schools afterschool program coordinator, Lindsey Johnson.
Some people say skateboarding not only offers health and fitness benefits but also teaches life lessons that could help kids with their schoolwork. Students who are learning to skateboard often spend hours practicing a new trick before they get it right. ""Skateboarding teaches kids to believe that if they stick with something, they will ultimately succeed,"" says education expert Richard Sagor of Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon.
Carloss skateboarding teacher at West Middle School, Eric Klassen, agrees. ""A baby will attempt to walk 600 to 900 times before [he or she] is successful,"" Klassen says. ""We tell students that they shouldnt say I cant do it unless theyve tried 600 to 900 times.""
Klassens students take his advice to heart. ""It took me 600 times to learn one new trick,"" says Martin Carrera, 11.
Over the last decade, team sports have dropped in popularity while individual sports, such as skateboarding, have been on the rise. This trend may affect the kinds of activities PE teachers offer in gym class. Learning individual sports gives all students an opportunity to exercise, whether they make it onto a school team or not.
Imagine that your school offers a skateboarding class. Would such a class have a positive effect on you? Explain.

His worries don't stop at school, however. Cantees is also concerned about the clothes his daughters are wearing to school. ""My wife is even having problems shopping [for clothes] for our daughters in the third and fourth grades,"" said Cantees.
Parents also worry about school clothes. Some of the clothing looks like garb worn by pop stars Madonna, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera. The clothes include miniskirts, stretch T-shirts, and hipster jeans.
For years, stores have sold clothing to teens similar to the styles pop singers wear. Now the stores are selling those clothes to 8- to 12-year-olds.
Roberta Capole, the editor of Tiger magazine, says many kids just want to look like pop stars. ""I don't think it's about trying to look older,"" she said. ""I think kids are just trying to dress like stars they think are fantastic.""
Store officials and clothing designers hope to make lots of money selling the new fashions. Stores say that each U.S. kid spent about $500 on school clothes this fall.
Some store clerks don't understand what the fuss is about. They think the new fashions are OK. ""We make sure all our clothes are age appropriate,"" said one clerk. She went on to describe the hipster pants she sells. ""They are an inch below the waist.""
Clothing designers say they have to make the new fashions. ""If I don't make it, someone else will,"" one designer said.
Parents are upset about the new fashions. ""When I take [my kids] shopping, they pick out things that... aren't appropriate for school,"" said one mother.
Teacher Dana Zeman says the new fashions don't belong in school. ""In my class, I'd like to set [a dress code],"" she said.

In addition, portable video-game systems can stir up trouble. When students bring their gaming gear to school, fights sometimes start or the device gets stolen. Educators hope that keeping video games at home will help keep the peace at school. School officials at Florence Rideout added the video game ban to school rules to satisfy some parents' concerns.

The poll found that at least 65 percent of Florida's voters favor new steps that would help protect the endangered manatees. Some of those steps include lowering the speed limit for boats in manatee zones, increasing fines for people who speed in manatee zones, limiting the amount of building along waterways where manatees are found, and creating additional protected areas for manatees.
""We are struck by [how far] Florida voters are willing to go to protect manatees,"" said Kate Stewart, who conducted the poll. She said the results also showed that ""boaters and non-boaters alike not just support but strongly support increased protection measures.""
Florida manatees live in the state's warm coastal and inland waters. The Save the Manatee Club says that the Florida manatee population has been shrinking since 1974, when scientists started keeping track.
Collisions with boats cause many manatee deaths. Since manatees swim slowly, they cannot get out of the way of a fast-moving boat. According to the Save the Manatee Club, 78 manatees were killed in collisions with boats in Florida waters last year. So far this year, at least 23 manatees have been killed in collisions.

They were there to celebrate the grand opening of the National Museum of the American Indian. The new museum is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It is located on the National Mall, near the U.S. Capitol.

Ten-year-old Jessica Lovato, from the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe in New Mexico, joined the celebration. To her, visiting the museum was ""a great learning experience!""
Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, Edward S. Curtis Collection, [reproduction number, LC-USZ62-130198]
Native American artifacts, such as these baskets, will be on display at the National Museum of the American Indian.
A wealthy New Yorker named George Gustav Heye collected most of the new museum's items throughout the early 1900s. He was interested in Native American culture and traditions.
There are about 800,000 Native American objects included in the museum's collection. The museum plans to display about 8,000 artifacts at a time.
The 4 million people who are expected to visit each year won't just find ancient objects--although there are plenty of them to see. Officials say the new museum also teaches people about Native Americans in modern times. Along with ancient pieces, such as beadwork, pottery, and carvings, visitors will also find newer ones, such as modern art and beaded sneakers.
The museum has been a work in progress for 16 years. Twenty-four Native American tribes helped build and plan the museum. They even reviewed the traditional dishes served in the museum's caf.
Symbolism abounds in the five-story building, which is made of limestone from Minnesota. The building's curved exterior resembles rocks shaped by wind and water over thousands of years.
In honor of many types of Native American dwellings, the museum's entrance faces east, in the direction of the rising sun. Inside, an electronic welcome sign greets visitors in 150 Native American languages.
Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today, each with its own culture. Native Americans have lived in North, South, and Central America for more than 20,000 years. When European explorers first arrived in North America, they thought they had landed in the East Indies. Those are islands located near Asia. That is why the explorers called the people living in the Americas ""Indians.""
To many Native Americans, the new museum has been a long time coming. ""[It is] long overdue,"" said Lawrence Small, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
Now that it is officially open, Native Americans hope the new museum keeps their culture alive. ""This will be a good education tool for everyone that wants to learn about the Indian people,"" a Cherokee woman told
. ""Our languages are still here. Our culture is still here.""
Why is the new museum an important part of Native American history?

Even though the coqui and greenhouse frogs are each only about the size of a dime, they make a huge racket. Instead of making soft chirping or gentle croaking sounds, the frogs chirp as loudly as a lawnmower. ""You'd never believe so much noise could come from a creature that small,"" Stevens said.
Scientists say the frogs in Stevens's backyard recently arrived in Hawaii. They came from islands in the Caribbean Sea, south of the United States mainland. Scientists think the frogs were accidentally shipped to Hawaii in flowerpots.
Since arriving in Hawaii, the foreign frogs have spread to 150 areas. In some areas, more than 8,000 can be found on a single acre of land. Each one is adding to the noise level.
The frogs are more than a noisy nuisance; they are causing other problems, as well. They eat insects that birds and other frogs used to eat. Each night, each thunderous frog can eat at least six insects.
The number of frogs is increasing because no other animals prey on them. If the foreign frog population keeps growing, other frogs and birds in Hawaii might not have enough insects to eat and might starve.
Some officials worry that the frogs might cause some people to leave Hawaii because of the racket. ""We get a lot of complaints from residents,"" said Fred Kraus, a spokesperson for the state. ""Some [have] threatened to leave the state.""

Marc Delluc discovered the cave etchings. Delluc is a cook who spends many of his weekends exploring caves in France. One day, he was exploring a tunnel in one cave when he noticed the etchings. He was the first person in thousands of years to see the amazing carvings. Delluc said the etchings are beautiful to look at. ""I just sat there gazing at the ceiling,"" he said.

With razor-sharp teeth, piranhas are the most ferocious fish in the world. Officials were quick to assure Londoners that the Thames is safe. They believe that the 4-inch-long red-bellied piranha's owner probably released it into the river, where a sea gull picked it up.
Experts say that the temperature of the Thames is too cold for piranhas to survive. These warm-water fish are found mainly in South America.
Piranhas have a reputation that is worse than their bite, say some experts. ""Piranhas are generally nervous and are not the ferocious killers people think they are,"" said Paul Hale, the head of the London Aquarium. ""They prey on weak and injured animals, including fish, birds, and mammals.""

Thousands of people are in need of food, clean water, and medicine.
World leaders are focusing on providing long-term aid to the affected areas. That includes helping people rebuild their homes, their lives, and their businesses. Officials predict that it could take up to a decade to recover from the tsunami.
Governments have promised more than $3 billion in aid. ""The world is coming together in a manner we have never ever seen before,"" said United Nations official Jan Egeland.
It's not just governments helping out. People are making a difference in ways large and small, with companies donating millions of dollars and kids organizing bake sales to raise money.
Officials say an early warning system could have saved thousands of lives. A warning system was established in 1965 for countries that border the Pacific Ocean. The United States is part of that system.
What other problems may arise after the tsunami?
Because tsunamis are rare in the Indian Ocean, countries in that area did not have a warning system. World leaders are working to create a system that will warn and help protect people in all countries.

Venice attracts millions of tourists each year for its beautiful art and architecture. People weave their way through the city on boats because there are no streets. A maze of long

Venice is located in northern Italy on the Adriatic Sea. The city was built on a series of small islands in a

Venice is sinking at a rate of 1.57 inches per year, according to scientists. The Italian government has proposed the building of floodgates to control the flow of the sea.
Scientists hope to turn the tide in favor of Venice. They want to pump huge amounts of water into the ground through sturdy pipes. Scientists expect the water will expand the sand underneath and prop up the city. They hope to test the project on a small area over the next few months.
In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads.
Scientists behind the plan say that the pipes will work along with the floodgates to help save the city. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnt carried out in a careful way.
Everyone, however, agrees that saving the sinking city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose tremendous part of [history],"" Melissa Conn of Save Venice, an organization dedicated to helping preserve the city, told reporters.
Venice in Italian means ""city of canals.""
About 1.6 million people live in Venice.
The most famous building in Venice is the Basilica of St. Mark, a church dedicated to the patron saint of the city.

CIS is just one of hundreds of schools in the United States that are going green. A
is built with recycled and environmentally friendly materials. Green schools are designed to use less energy than traditional school buildings.
The majority of the energy supply in the United States comes from the burning of
such as oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels were formed from the remains of prehistoric animals and plants. People use fossil fuels when they drive their cars, heat their homes, and power farms, factories, and cities.
Though people depend on fossil fuels, those energy sources have their drawbacks. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air and releases gases that contribute to global warmingthe gradual rise in Earth's average temperature.
Hoover Dam generates clean energy by using water to spin turbines.
Fossil fuels are gradually being used up. To conserve them, scientists are looking to
sources. Renewable energy is power from sources that can't be used up and do not pollute the environment. Water, wind, and solar power are types of renewable energy.
President George W. Bush announced an energy plan that calls on lawmakers to ensure that ecofriendly fuels are developed and made easily available to Americans. Gas is a fossil fuel used in cars, and the price to fill up a gas tank is rising. Gas costs about $3 a gallon in some parts of the United States.
At CIS, students are excited for construction to begin on their new school building. ""I think the school is going to be a lot better,"" Drew Barsody, 10, told
""I'm looking forward to seeing the solar panels.""
These wind turbines convert wind into electricity.
Here are some common environmentally friendly energy alternatives.
Solar Power: Solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat and electricity. California and Arizona are two states that use solar power. One drawback of solar power is that energy can't be collected if the sun isn't shining.
Energy produced from windmills is used to generate electricity. The amount of electricity generated from wind has been growing in recent years, tripling since 1998 in the United States. Electricity is produced from wind in 30 states, including California, Texas, and Iowa.
is one of the oldest sources of energy. Hydropower often comes from dams or waterfalls. Of all renewable energy sources, it is most often used to generate electricity. In 2004, it accounted for 7 percent of all the electricity generated in the United States.
Ethanol is a clean-burning fuel that can power cars. It is created from several sources, such as corn crops. Typically, a small amount of ethanol is combined with gasoline to fuel vehicles. That helps decrease the fuel's cost and harmful emissions.
Turning off the lights when you leave a room is one way to conserve energy. What are some other ways to save energy?

What do the Florida Everglades, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, and Kathmandu, Nepal, have in common? More than you might think!

That isnt the only thing the landmarks share. Experts say the Everglades, the Great Barrier Reef, and Kathmandu are in trouble and should be closed off by 2020.
are endangering the landmarks, warns a new report by the Centre for Future Studies (CFS). Global warming is the gradual rise in Earths average temperature.
""The combined impact of too many tourists stomping all over these important sites plus climate change is having a severe [effect],"" Susi Moser, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told
The last nine years were the hottest since scientists began tracking Earths temperature in 1861. Some scientists say global warming will create more
or powerful, hurricanes. Researchers predict that the heat will cause glaciers in the Antarctic to melt. That will cause ocean levels to rise.
Those changes could destroy the Everglades, the CFS report says. Stronger hurricanes could threaten the areas plant and animal species, including American crocodiles and manatees. Rising seawater could flood the swampy region.
Its important to protect the 2,358-square-mile landmark, Jan Michael Jacobson, director of the Everglades Institute, told
""The Everglades primarily is valuable because it is a unique habitat,"" he said.
The historic temples of Kathmandu, Nepal, were built between 1300 and 1800. They draw millions of tourists each year.
The Great Barrier Reef and Kathmandu are facing a different threattourists. The Great Barrier Reef attracts about 1.8 million tourists a year, who pump billions of dollars into Australias economy. Visitors can also damage the delicate system of coral reefs.
Tourists are endangering Kathmandu, too, CFS officials say. The valley is in the shadow of Mount Everest, the worlds tallest mountain. The report warns that skiers and climbers hoping to tackle Mount Everest and other Himalayan peaks may harm Kathmandus ancient temples.
The effects of global warming are already being felt. More than 150 countries are working to stop the rising temperatures. They have
emissions. Those gases contribute to global warming.
As for the Great Barrier Reef and Kathmandu, the CFS report recommends limiting the number of tourists allowed to visit the sites. But some people say that visiting endangered landmarks could encourage tourists to fight for their protection.
Many cars and factories burn fossil fuels. That releases greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the air. Those gases form a layer and trap the suns heat close to Earth.
That process is called the greenhouse effect. The layer of gases acts as a window in a greenhouse doesit lets in heat but doesnt let much out. The result is global warming, a worldwide rise in average temperature.
There are 788 World Heritage Sites, but becoming one is not easy. Landmarks must meet one of 10 requirements. For instance, a site must represent a unique culture or a significant period in history. Independent groups
or examine, each landmark. Then an international committee, which is part of the United Nations, votes on the new sites. The Great Wall of China and the Statue of Liberty are included on the list.

mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think well get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told
She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria.""
Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly
disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havent been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims.
With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world.

or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been
Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door.
To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November.
After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Its uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives.""
Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization.
Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why?
Jonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.
From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Roosevelts death, Salks vaccine was declared officially safe.
In October 2005for the first time in 26 years in the United Statesfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnt at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.

603,"Bello Nock recently raced up a thin wire on a motorcycle. He drove the motorcycle high over thousands of spectators' heads. He's a clown with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus.
To the spectators below, Bello's stunt looked dangerous-and it was. But Bello knew a secret. He was using science to help keep himself safe.
Bello began performing circus stunts when he was 9 years old. He walked on a thin wire that was stretched 9 feet off the ground.
To stay on a wire without falling, Bello needs to keep his center of gravity low. An object's center of gravity is usually located in the middle of the object. That is where the object's weight is centered.
By crouching and keeping low, Bello keeps his center of gravity low. The lower his center of gravity, the harder it is for Bello to fall.
Bello often carries a heavy metal stick when he performs. The stick bends downward, lowering his center of gravity.
Bello also uses Newton's first law of motion when he performs. That law is named for Isaac Newton. He was a scientist who lived about 275 years ago.
Newton's first law of motion says that a moving object will keep moving unless an outside force acts on it. (The law also says that an object at rest will stay that way unless an outside force acts on it.) Bello uses that law when he rides his
As Bello speeds along on his tiny bike, he sometimes has to stop before slamming into a wall. To stop, Bello uses the bike's brakes. The brakes create
between the bike's tires and the ground. The friction is an outside force that slows the bike.
Friction also changes the bike's motion into heat energy. You could say that Bello's act is really hot!
How do you use science in your everyday life? Discuss in class and let us know what you think in the Write On section of
To see how friction works, rub your hands together as fast as you can. When you rub your hands together, they should start to feel warm. Friction between your hands changes into heat energy.
Bello always puts on a high-energy show. ""I always want to capture the attention of children,"" he said. He captures their attention with science.

Scientists recently announced that the music made by several kinds of birds and humpback whales shares some of the notes, rhythms, and harmonies found in music created by people. Scientists say that these animals may also pass songs along to one another, which means animals may be able to learn music.

Keep your pearly whites clean, but be sure to shut off the faucet while you brush. That can save about 8 gallons of water a day.
Put away that rubber ducky. Taking a bath can use up to 70 gallons of water, while showering uses just 10 to 25 gallons of water.
In one day, a faucet can drip more than 20 gallons of water, and a leaky toilet can waste 200 gallons! Ask an adult to stop the drips.

This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Keep reading to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's As Easy As One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart (below).
So what's the result? Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

""We'll be able to perform operations with these robots that have never been imagined,"" said Dr. Randolph Chitwood of North Carolina. Dr. Chitwood is working to see whether robots can be used safely in operations to replace people's heart valves.
During the new heart operation, a robot with three arms works at the operating table. A few feet away, a doctor controls the robot's arms with a computer. Three tiny holes are made in the patient's chest. The robot's arms fit through the small holes.
One of the robot's arms holds a tiny camera. The camera allows the doctors to see inside the patient's body. The other two arms hold small tools, such as scissors and needles.
Robots may help lower the risks of heart operations. A doctor's hand can sometimes shake slightly. Or sometimes, a doctor's hand can be too large to reach some areas of the heart.
But a robot's arms do not shake and can fit into tiny places. Because the robot can work through small holes, the patient's chest heals faster after the operation.

In 1951, Linda Brown from Topeka, Kansas, was in third grade. She was one of many African American kids who were forced to attend schools separate from those for white students. Linda's school was miles away from her home. She was not allowed to attend a whites-only school that was just a few blocks away.
Linda's parents and 12 other families sued the Kansas school system. The case was taken all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
On May 17, 1954, the Court ruled that it was unfair to have separate schools for black and white students.
Today, Linda Brown is grown up. She travels around the country to speak about the case. She recently told an audience, ""Little did my father know that when he stepped off the witness stand, he stepped into the history pages.""

Meet the soon-to-be members of rescue teams--rats! Scientists are training the rodents to help find people who are buried in buildings after earthquakes and other disasters.
Rats have a strong sense of smell, which can help them sniff out people. The rodents are also tiny enough to crawl just about anywhere. They can get into places that are too small for people and other animals, such as dogs.
Scientists trained the rats to search for the scent of people. They attached tiny electronic devices to the brain of each rat. Signals from the rat's brain are sent to a radio that is strapped to the animal's back. Rescue teams will be able to track the signals and follow the rat's path. That will help them figure out where to start digging. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next six months.

Cholera is usually caused by dirty food or water. The first cases of the disease in Haiti happened in October. Since then, it has killed several hundreds of people. Thousands of others have become sick.
In Port-au-Prince, about 1.3 million people are homeless. That city is the capital of Haiti. Most of those people lost their homes in the 2010 quake. Survivors live together in tents. With so many people living in an unhealthy place, experts are concerned that cholera could spread even faster.

Koalas are pictured everywhere in Australiafrom boxes of chocolate to sports team jerseys. Yet the animals live only in small areas along the east coast.
The koalas were once widespread on the east coast. However, farmers cut down many of the forests where koalas lived. Hunters also killed the animals for their fur.
I recently joined Bill Ellis and his team in a forest on St. Bees Island. Ellis is a scientist who studies koalas. He and other scientists hope that studying koalas on the island will teach them how to protect koalas elsewhere in Australia.

Whenever we find a koala, we collect information about the trees in the area. We measure how tall and how fat the trees are. Then we put tags on their trunks, so we know theyve been recorded.
We also capture and tag the koalas. Before releasing them back into the wild, we give them a health checkup.
Ellis wonders if the St. Bees koalas are headed for hard times. The island is filled with wild goats, which may be eating small blue gum trees. Ellis hopes more research will help him understand how to protect the blue gumsand the koalas that depend on them.

 Volunteers hold Yellow in the sack. They adjust a radio collar around the koalas neck.

Big plans are under way for a little green machine. Its a laptop computer made for kids who live in poor countries. A program called One Laptop per Child plans to sell the laptops at a very low cost to the governments of those countries.
Many poor areas dont have electric power. The ""green machine"" does not need to be plugged into an electrical outlet. The laptop runs on electricity produced by a hand crank.
One Laptop per Child plans to test the computers this fall. The program hopes to start shipping millions of green machines in 2007.

or travel to a new location, when the season changes. Each spring, tens of millions of monarchs from Mexico head north. In the fall, they will fly to Mexico for the winter months.
Elizabeth Howard created the Web site Journey North. The site studies monarchs and tracks their travel patterns. ""They travel farther than any other migratory animal or insect on the planet,"" she says. ""What's most amazing is they go to the same place every winter [and spring], even though they've never been there before.""
People who track monarchs are worried that the butterflies will become
or at risk of dying out completely. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning forests. The butterflies seek shelter in forest trees during the winter. Increasing temperatures are also threatening the butterflies' survival.
""There is a good chance that we will see big changes in the monarchs' migratory patterns in the next several decades,"" says monarch expert Karen Oberhauser. ""My hope is that monarchs will be able to adapt.""
Some monarch butterflies live for just a few weeks. Others may live up to eight months. Each butterfly races to complete its leg of the journey and produce the next generation before it dies. Parent butterflies leave Mexico in March. Their children are born in the southern United States. Those butterflies travel north. Grandchildren butterflies are produced in the north, where they spend July. Finally, it is the great-grandchild of the first butterfly that returns to Mexico. It will remain there for the winter.
Why might people want to save monarchs?

. That is a colorless, odorless gas. Methane is one of the gases that contribute to global warming. Global warming is the slow rise of Earth's temperature. Scientists say one cow releases up to 150 gallons of methane a day!
All that belching adds up. There are 100 million cows in the United States. They are responsible for 20 percent of the nation's methane production.
The methane is produced in cows' stomachs when they digest their food. The gas comes out when cows exhale.
Experts are worried about the planet. ""[Cows, and other animals'] contribution to environmental problems is on a [huge] scale,"" officials wrote in a report.
Scientists are trying to figure out ways of lowering cows' methane production. Some researchers say they have created a pill that could do that.
Other researchers want to change cows' diets. Some scientists think cows should eat more natural sugar. Other researchers want to add extra fats from coconuts or sunflower seeds to cattle feed. That could make cowsand the planethealthier!
Why might scientists worry about global warming?

When people think of lightning, they generally picture it as a single bolt. However, scientists have recently reported that one flash of lightning often strikes in more than one place. It is common for lightning to fork, or split, and strike in two or more places, scientists say.
Lightning is a flow of electricity. A flash of lightning can heat the air around it to up to 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun!
When lightning heats the air around it, the air expands and makes a loud crashing sound-thunder. If you hear thunder, you are within striking distance of lightning. ""Anytime you hear thunder, you should immediately move to a safe area,"" said scientist E. Philip Krider. Safe places include a school, house, or car.
While it is unusual for people to be struck by lightning, it does happen. According to the National Weather Service, lightning causes nearly 300 injuries and 100 deaths in the United States each year.
Watching a lightning storm may be exciting, but it can also be dangerous. Just keep in mind the power of nature and watch from a safe place indoors.
Whether you are outdoors or indoors during a thunderstorm, it is important to stay safe.
Try to find shelter in a car or building.
Avoid water, high places, and open spaces.
Do not use a corded telephone. Lightning can strike phone lines.
Avoid using the sink or shower. Lightning can travel through water pipes.

Many pharaohs were buried with treasures. To keep thieves out, builders designed the pyramids with hidden rooms. No one knows what happened to Khufu's body or if he was buried with treasures. Perhaps the answer is behind a mysterious door inside the Great Pyramid.

Each year, about 20 million kids play sports during and after school. Unfortunately, about 5 million of those kids suffer some kind of injury while playing.
To help children play sports safely, the National Youth Sports Safety Foundation (NYSSF) has named April National Youth Sports Safety Month.
During April, the foundation plans to teach kids about sports safety. The foundation's message is that most sports injuries can be prevented.
According to the NYSSF, you can do a few things to keep from getting a sports injury:
Do warm-up stretches before and after playing any sport. Stretching helps loosen tight muscles and tissues.
Do not play when you are in pain. Pain is a sure sign of an injury!
Use proper sports safety equipment, such as helmets, elbow pads, kneepads, safety glasses, wrist guards, shin guards, and mouth guards.
The NYSSF says that playing sports and exercising help kids stay healthy and make friends. But no matter which sport you play, always remember to have fun!

Woodstock is one of a growing number of U.S. schools teaching Mandarin. The schools want to prepare students for a future in which they are likely to work with people from China. Business in China is booming, and that trend is expected to grow.
The U.S. government is trying to encourage even more public schools to teach Mandarin. Officials are considering spending about $1 billion on Chinese programs in schools.
China is getting involved too. The Chinese government has donated textbooks to U.S. schools. Some schools are also taking part in teacher exchange programs with China.
""It is important for students to learn Mandarin and Chinese culture,"" Mary Patterson, the principal of Woodstock, told
""Students who do so will have wider opportunities when they become adults.""
More people speak Mandarin than any other language in the world, yet the language is one of the most difficult to learn. It doesnt look or sound anything like English.
The Chinese writing system does not use an alphabet of letters. Characters, or symbols, represent words and ideas. ""You cant sound out words,"" says Claire Diller, 9. ""In Chinese, you have to memorize the words.""
However, all the hard work hasnt stopped young learners. Today, about 50,000 U.S. students are studying Mandarin, and they are doing

Twelve of the world's 19 penguin species face major threats, according to wildlife experts. They are in danger of becoming
or dying out completely. This list includes emperor penguins.
""Many of the world's penguin species are in big trouble,"" penguin expert Kassie Siegel told
Her wildlife group is asking the U.S. government to protect the 12 threatened species of penguins.
Overfishing is partly to blame for the problem. Penguins eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called
Fishing boats are catching large amounts of krill. That leaves less food for penguins to eat.
Another reason for the decline in the number of penguins is global warming. Global warming is the slow increase in average temperature around the world. It is causing sea ice to melt. Penguins need the floating sea ice as a place to rest while they search for krill.
Scientists say people contribute to global warming when they drive cars or use electricity. That burns
such as coal, oil, and natural gas. The burning of fossil fuels gives off gases that add to the overheating of Earth. ""We can and must reduce gas emissions to keep penguins safe in the future,"" says Siegel.
What can people do to reduce their use of fossil fuels?

Today, most of the oil that is used in the United States is
Opponents say the drilling would pollute the area's land, air, and water. Pollution would harm the plants that the area's animals eat to survive.
Studies by the U.S. government show there may be only a six-month supply of oil in the ANWR. Opponents believe the risk of polluting the ANWR is not worth such a small supply of oil.

A bee does the waggle dance. It walks in a figure eight and shakes its body. The farther away the food, the longer the bee shakes. The direction in which it walks tells other bees the way to the food.
Honeybees get food from flowers. When a honeybee finds a field of flowers, it flies back to the hive. The bee tells the other bees where to find the food. How? It dances! The round dance shows that food is nearby. If the food is far away, the bee performs the waggle dance. That dance shows the location of the food.
Fireflies have a chemical inside their bodies. It makes light. Fireflies flash lights at one another. Each
or kind, of firefly has a different flash pattern. That helps the insects find members of their own species. The flash pattern also helps male and female fireflies find one another
Grasshoppers send messages by chirping. They often rub a back leg against a wing. That causes a vibration and makes sound. Mostly male grasshoppers make sounds. They chirp to attract females. Each species of grasshopper has its own call. Some grasshoppers make sounds to warn other males to go away.
A leaf-cutter ant carries a piece of a leaf back to its nest.
Ants give off scents to pass along messages. If an ant finds food, it goes back to its nest. The ant leaves a scent trail along the way. Other ants follow the trail to find the food.

Many scientists have long thought that dinosaurs and birds are related. The recent discovery is more proof. ""Previous proof was based on the way the bones looked. This proof is based on protein,"" says Cantley. ""It better supports our beliefs that chickens came from dinosaurs.""
This year, scientists plan to look for more dinosaur bones to study. ""We want to find other dinosaur bones that contain protein,"" says Cantley. ""That would give us even more proof.""

In the fall, brown bears eat a lot of food. They eat berries, plants, and fish. Bears eat to build up fat. By the end of the fall, the bears start to hibernate in dens, which are caves or openings in the ground. They breathe slower and their hearts beat slower. They don't need to eat or drink because they use their fat to stay alive.
When fall comes, a chipmunk gathers extra food. It stores the extra food in its

The next time you stick on a Band-Aid, you can thank Earle Dickson. He invented the ready-made bandage in 1920. He wanted to help his wife who often cut her fingers while cooking.
At the time, people had to cut pieces of gauze and tape to make bandages. They were hard to use. Dicksons simple idea was a big success. Today, ready-made bandages come in many shapes, sizes, and colors.
Did you know that chocolate chip cookies were a mistake? Ruth Graves Wakefield created them in the 1930s. She was mixing a batch of chocolate cookies and was out of baking chocolate. She decided to chop up a bar of semisweet chocolate instead. When the cookies were done, the pieces of chocolate had not melted! They had kept their chip form in each cookie.
Before the 1920s, people often got into traffic accidents. One day, Garrett Morgan saw a bad accident between a car and a horse-drawn carriage. He decided to solve the problem by inventing a traffic signal. It was a pole with signs saying when to stop and go. Todays red, yellow, and green traffic lights are based on Morgans idea.
What other inventions can you name? Which of those inventions do you think is the most important?

Popocatpetl means ""smoking mountain"" in a language once spoken in Mexico. It is also the name of a Mexican volcano, which people have nicknamed ""Popo."" Mexico is a country just south of the United States.
Late last year, a volcano called Popo erupted. Gases and ash filled the air. No one was hurt by the eruption. Scientists studying Popo knew it was going to erupt. About 50,000 people live in the villages and towns that surround Popo. The scientists warned those people. Many of the residents left their homes before the eruption.
Inside Popo and below Earth's surface, temperatures were about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit before Popo popped. Scientists from Mexico and the United States used special tools to keep track of what was happening inside Popo. One tool detected that

This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
. That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's as Easy as One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.
Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?
