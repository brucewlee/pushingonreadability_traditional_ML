of 24 lines. The lines are pentameters (they have 10 syllables each).
Think about how the language the poet uses helps to convey his ideas. Here are some points to consider:
Think about the title. It does not tell us anything about Batman and Robin - it's only when we begin to read the poem that the identity of the 'kid' becomes clear. However, if we go back to the title having read the poem, it may remind us of other young people who are caught up in the shadow (line 20) of someone they admire, and their need to forge their own identity.
Batman is at first presented as a real superhero: he is described at the start in the alliterative phrase Batman, big shot, as someone who gives orders to Robin. Yet as we read on, his status is diminished. We hear that he
(line 4) Robin and had an affair with a married woman (line 10). We see him at the end all alone, cooking an unappealing meal for himself (
(line 21), with next to nothing (line 22) in the house to eat. Can it be that he cannot manage by himself, without Robin around? He is shown as anxious to get going,
(line 23) with boredom, but unable to do anything.
This poem contains various examples of slang, for example naval slang -
(line 2), British slang - the ordinary word motor (line 11) for the amazing Batmobile, and American slang -
(line 24). The mixture of styles adds humour and perhaps helps to illustrate the growing-up process: Robin is trying out a mixture of things.
There is a serious message behind the comedy - we are encouraged to consider whether heroes and hero-worship can really sustain young people growing up. However marvellous the admired person may be, a young person has to learn to be independent -
(line 18) and to live their own life.

Throughout this section, we have been asking ourselves
how much Britain really changed during 1905-1918

The home front during the First World War
These areas provide the examples of change that you need to answer this question, but remember, you need to also assess the
of these changes - not just list what they were.
Read these statements from a modern textbook:
In the first 20 years of the 20th century, British society underwent profound changes.
There was growing awareness that more would have to be done to protect the weakest and poorest members of society.
A series of laws was passed which attempted to deal with the problem of poverty. The foundations of what became known as the 'welfare state' were laid.
An Act of 1918 gave many women over the age of 30 the vote. Finally, women could play a full part in national political life.
[Meanwhile,] it was the trade unions who did the most to bring a new political party for the workers into existence [and] help Labour candidates to stand in Parliamentary elections.
Nigel Kelly and Greg Lacey, Modern World History (2001)

of change in Britain during the years 1905-1918?
Does this poster effectively sum up the era?
Or you could argue that this election poster of 1911 sums up the truth about the Liberal reforms and the improvements of the period 1905-1918.

There are various ways to measure body temperature, including using a clinical thermometer, heat-sensitive strips, digital probes or thermal imaging cameras.
high temperatures can cause dehydration, heat stroke, and death if untreated
low temperatures can cause hypothermia, and death if untreated
The bodys temperature is monitored by the brain. If you are too hot or too cold, the brain sends nerve impulses to the skin, which has three ways to either increase or decrease heat loss from the bodys surface:
Hairs on the skin trap more warm air if they are standing up, and less if they are lying flat. Tiny muscles in the skin can quickly pull the hairs upright to reduce heat loss, or lay them down flat to increase heat loss.
If the body is too hot, glands under the skin secrete sweat onto the surface of the skin, to increase heat loss by evaporation. Sweat secretion stops when body temperature returns to normal.
Blood vessels supplying blood to the skin can swell or dilate - called vasodilation. This causes more heat to be carried by the blood to the skin, where it can be lost to the air. Blood vessels can shrink down again - called vasoconstriction. This reduces heat loss through the skin once the bodys temperature has returned to normal.
Muscles can also receive messages from the brain when you are cold. They respond by shivering, which warms you up.
- Hair muscles pull hais on end.
- Hair muscles relax. Hairs lie flat so heat can escape.
- Sweat secreted by sweat glands. Cools skin by evaporation.
A very common mistake in exams is to write that the blood vessels move up and down in the skin. The blood vessels do not move during vasodilation and vasoconstriction.

Use the ""washing line"" idea. Hang your work from an imaginary horizontal line. This also works with a strong vertical line.
Create a ""horizon"" in the display . Make sure that all your work goes above and below the imaginary horizontal line. This will also works with a vertical line.
display your work at angles without being sure that's right. It usually isn't. It can make your work look untidy and doesn't help the viewer when they are trying to see your work development.

Robert Walton tells of both his family history and hopes for the highly dangerous expedition he has embarked upon. He meets Victor Frankenstein shortly after seeing a creature 'of gigantic stature' on an ice raft speed away from his ship, which has become trapped in ice somewhere in the Arctic.
Victor is very ill and is looked after by Walton, who has complained in his letters of not having a companion to share his feelings. As the two become friends, Victor begins his tale; one he hopes will be a warning to Walton about the dangers of ambition and the pursuit of knowledge. Walton says he will write down everything his friend tells him.
Victor has a very happy childhood, brought up by a wealthy and caring family in Geneva, Switzerland. He adores, and is adored by, his foster sister, Elizabeth, and has another great friend in Henry Clerval.
However, tragedy strikes when his mother dies of fever just before he leaves to study at the University of Ingolstadt. His father insists he should still go, and while at university Victor's earlier interest in science becomes an obsession - in particular, he wants to discover the secret of life itself.
Victor cuts himself off from his friends and does not see his family for years. He becomes ill through work, not helped by visiting graveyards at night to dig up bodies he later experiments on. All this effort pays off, though, when he finally discovers a way to give life to dead objects.
Victor manages to construct a creature made of huge body parts stolen from a number of different graves, and brings it to life 'on a dreary night of November'. He is immediately disgusted by it and what he has done. He abandons the creature, assuming it will die of neglect. Victor then falls further into illness himself, before being rescued by the arrival of Clerval, who looks after him in the following weeks.
Victor recovers and becomes more like his old, happy self. He stops his scientific experiments, takes up new studies, and goes on holiday with Clerval.
In a letter from Elizabeth, he learns that the 'very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty' Justine Moritz has become a greatly loved servant of his family, and that his youngest brother William (four) is 'rosy with health'.
But just before he finally returns to home Geneva, six years after he left, Victor hears of William's murder. On arriving, he sees the Monster lit up by lightning during a thunderstorm and rightly guesses it was to blame. However, he knows no-one will believe him if he says so.
Moritz is put on trial for the murder and soon executed. Victor admits to Walton that both she and William are ""the first hapless (unlucky) victims of my
The Monster and Victor meet for the first time since it was created, and Victor tries to kill it out of revenge. But the Monster dodges the attack, then asks to talk and explain its actions. It wants Victor to admit some responsibility and show sympathy for what it has gone through, thanks to Victor abandoning it.
The Monster is calm and restrained, and speaks politely with great skill and persuasion. Victor curses, calls it 'Devil', and is openly violent in his words and attempted deeds. This irony shows that Shelley wants the audience to sympathise with the Monster. The chapter ends with the Monster hinting to Victor that it will leave mankind alone if he agrees to listen to its story. Grudgingly, Victor accepts.
The Monster tells of how it has suffered terribly at the hands of man, mainly because of its appearance - something it cannot be blamed for. It learnt how to speak and read while spying on the De Laceys as they taught a foreign visitor (Safie) their language.
De Lacey, a blind old man, shows kindness towards the Monster. His son misinterprets the Monster's intentions and throws it out of their cottage. This deeply affects the Monster, who weeps and grieves over the loss of its hovel and (unknowing) companions. This grief quickly becomes a desire for revenge on mankind when, after saving a peasant girl from drowning, the Monster is shot at and wounded.
The Monster explains that it believed it could make friends with a child, someone who would not be old enough to be prejudiced against it. It tells of how it then came across young William and approached him in a friendly way, only to be insulted and abused yet again. On hearing the boy say his father was called Frankenstein, a name it knew to be that of its creator, it strangled him to death.
Finally, it pleads with Victor to build it a wife, a companion it can run away with to the 'vast wilds of South America' and never trouble mankind again.
After some debate, Victor agrees to the Monster's request to build a second creature, on the condition it keeps to its ""solemn oath to quit Europe and every other place in the neighbourhood of man"". Victor is miserable at the thought of what he must go through again. His family put this depression down to his grief at William's death.
Weeks later, Victor has still not started work on the new creature, due to fear of what might happen and being discovered at his gruesome task. He is still sad, and his father thinks an immediate marriage to Elizabeth will cheer him up. He tells his family he will travel to England before marrying, and his father sends him off with Clerval as a companion. They part company in Scotland, where Victor finally sets up a laboratory to complete his task on a remote island in the Orkneys.
One moonlit night, on seeing the Monster grinning at his window as he works, Victor tears the half-built creature to pieces. The Monster howls in rage and utters the
Suggestive of a sign of danger to come.
words: ""I shall be with you on your wedding night."" It leaves, while Victor takes a boat out to sea to dump the remains of the unfinished creature. After doing so, he falls asleep and the boat drifts aimlessly.
Victor wakes up and lands on the Irish coast. He is immediately surrounded by angry strangers and accused of murder. He is taken to see a corpse and is devastated to discover it is Clerval. Two months of near-fatal fever follow, before his father arrives to look after him. After another month in prison, evidence is finally found to prove him not guilty and he is taken back to Geneva to marry Elizabeth.
Victor and Elizabeth marry at last, but Victor is reminded frequently of the Monster's threat to be with him on his wedding night (showing how self-absorbed he has become). A heavy rain storm is an

sign, as is the pistol Victor has hidden upon him.
Once night falls, Victor leaves Elizabeth to inspect the house where they are staying and to look for any sign of the Monster. While he is gone, the Monster finds Elizabeth, whose 'shrill and dreadful' scream brings Victor rushing back. He finds his wife dead on the bed with 'the murderous mark of the fiend's grasp' still on her neck. From his window, he sees the Monster grinning at him, an echo of when Victor destroyed its 'wife'.
Enraged and appalled at events, Victor finally tells a magistrate about the Monster. But it is too late. The magistrate does not believe his story, and says that, even if it were true, there is nothing ordinary men could do to such a powerful enemy.
Victor promises to take action himself and chases the Monster for months, north across Europe and Russia and towards the North Pole. When he appears to have lost track of his prey, or approaches starvation, it becomes clear the Monster has left signs or food for him. Just before catching up with it on an ice sledge, the ice cracks, the Monster escapes, and Victor is rescued by Walton.
Walton concludes the story in a continuation of the earlier letters sent to his sister. These tell how Victor still encourages Walton and his crew to go on with their expedition, despite being trapped in ice with unknown perils ahead. It seems Victor has learnt nothing from the moral of his own story.
When the ice breaks, Walton agrees with his men's wishes to return home, although he is very sad at his failure. Near death, Victor asks Walton to kill the Monster if he comes across it, but he knows that this is now unlikely because the ship is heading away from the Pole.
He seems to have learnt his lesson when he tells Walton to 'avoid ambition'. However, his last words hint that someone else could succeed in creating life without the terrible consequences he has suffered, so he dies
Soon after, a noise attracts Walton to the cabin where Victor's body rests and he discovers the grieving Monster. It tells Walton it is sorry for what it has done, but also justified because of man's mistreatment of it. The Monster sees a hopeless life ahead and tells Walton it will kill itself in 'the agonies of torturing flames'. It then leaps off the ship and Walton watches as it heads off to its death, becoming 'lost in darkness and distance'.

A good way to decide on the tone of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
In a loud, angry tone, to protest about the failure of democracy?
In a sombre, muted tone, to express sadness that a gap remains between rich and poor?
In a dramatic tone, so that we wonder what may happen between the two pairs of people?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
The ideas in this poem are to do with the extreme divisions between rich people and poor people in a supposedly egalitarian society, and the effect these divisions have on how people perceive each other.
Have a look at these quotations, and our suggestions about how they fit into this theme
...the two scavengers up since four am/grungy from their route
We are encouraged to sympathise with these garbagemen who work anti social hours and who become dirty and smelly as a result. The specific detail (four am) and the expressive word grungy make us pity them.
The elegant couple are not described in as much detail as the garbagemen, as if the poet is less interested in them. He uses a clich here, the cool couple - which is how they probably think of themselves...
'as if anything at all were possible/between them...'
It seems that the poet would like to believe that the two pairs he describes really could be friends - but the 'as if' tells us he knows that is only imaginary. He feels that democracy hasn't succeeded because communication between the rich and poor is still impossible.

, who wrote that God probably only created very simple life forms and that these developed over time.
Today we associate evolutionary science with scientists such as
who wrote On the Origin of Species in 1859. He argued that life began with very simple cells and later developed into what we see today. He said that
was one of the major mechanisms driving evolution.
Darwin upset many people with his views and even some respected scientists such as

It is possible to draw a parallel between the Sikh belief in the emergence of the universe from the void and the Big Bang theory. According to both modern science and to the
(collection of Sikh Scriptures), there are innumerable galaxies in the universe and in each there are many solar systems containing stars and planets, all of which are in constant motion.
Sikhs believe that the universe that derived from God will ultimately be re-absorbed into God:
""When the Creator became manifest, all creatures of the earth assumed various shapes. But when you draw creation within yourself, all embodied beings are absorbed in you.""
Some scientists say that the expansion of the universe which followed the Big Bang will eventually be reversed and at some distant point in the future will start to contract, eventually imploding into a 'Big Crunch'.
However, for the majority of Sikhs today, the questions that modern science might raise in connection with their religious outlook on life are not a key concern.

The sequence of events in a narrative; a story
is a book about growing up. The reader meets Pip when he is seven, and follows his life until he meets Estella again (after 11 years apart) at the age of 35.
The proper term for this kind of story is the German word
A type of novel that tells about the the early moral, psychological, and intellectual development of the main character. The Harry Potter books are a modern day example.
The fact that Pip is also the narrator of the story makes it more instructive, because he is able to interpret the meaning of what is happening, as well as see it through a child's eyes.
The reader lives Pip's life with him, and we see:
the way contact with rich people makes him dissatisfied.
how coming into money makes him shallow and selfish, and unhappy.
how trying to find love with a beautiful, yet cruel, girl makes him unhappy - the plain, good girl would have been better.
how disappointments change his character for the better.
how Pip is happier when he settles down to a decent living through hard work - this is one of the main messages of the novel.
One idea Dickens explores is: what makes a 'gentleman'?
Remember that Dickens' father lost his social position through bankruptcy, and that Dickens once worked in a boot-blacking factory.
Most of Dickens' readers would have wanted to better themselves, and the author holds up a number of models of upper class life for Pip (and therefore the reader) to consider:
Bentley Drummle: wealthy, but a lazy lout?
Miss Havisham: wealthy, but mad and manipulative?
Pip: having money and manners, but being vain and shallow?
Mrs Pocket: from a 'good' family, but an incompetent mother?
Magwitch: a terrifying criminal who devoted his life to helping a young boy?
Dickens' message is that 'character' is not about money or manners, but what is in your heart. The heroes of Great Expectations are:
Ambition and illusions versus fitting in and accepting your lot
Victorians believed it was right to try to improve your lot, and
explores the issue through its events and characters:
Pip's yearning to be a 'gentleman' only makes him unhappy.
Magwitch makes a fortune as a sheep herder, and puts it to good effect, helping Pip in his ambition to be a gentleman.
Miss Havisham is the opposite of ambitious. She has stopped the clocks and done nothing more with her life - failing even to put on her second shoe.
Estella lives a privileged life, and cares for nothing but inheriting Miss Havisham's jewels. She has a meaningless life, is obviously bored and - although
by suitors - has no real friends.
Joe Gargery has no ambition beyond his forge, but is a good and noble man.
Biddy is happy with her lot. She cheerfully does the drudge's jobs, yet she catches education ""like a cold"" and becomes the village schoolteacher.
Herbert Pocket longs to make money in commerce, but is unable to do so until Pip buys him a job at Clarriker's. Having got the job, he goes out to Cairo, works hard, and makes a decent living.
Bentley Drummle is at the top of the social heap, but wastes his position and talents, and dies without accomplishing anything.
Mr Wopsle longs to act on the stage, pursues his dream and succeeds. Although he only has small parts in second-rate
Variety show entertainment consisting of light comic acts, singing and dancing.
Wemmick strictly divides his working life from his personal life. Although his letterbox mouth betrays his unhappiness in his job, at home he is relaxed and happy.
From the above, what do you make of Dickens' attitude to ambition versus accepting your lot?
One conclusion is that Dickens felt illusions make you unhappy, and ambition does not bring success. What matters to Dickens is not what you achieve, but what kind of person you are.
. He makes it clear that they underlie happiness (when things go well) and misery (when things go wrong).
Pip's unrequited love for Estella is the main story of the book, and brings him only misery.
Miss Havisham's life is ruined when the man she loves jilts her on her wedding day.
Estella marries Bentley Drummle without loving him, and suffers for it.
Joe marries Biddy for love, and they are happy, despite the age gap between them.
Herbert Pocket marries Clara Barley for love, and they are happy, despite the social gap between them.
In addition, Dickens explores other kinds of 'love':
Magwitch loves Pip through gratitude; Pip comes to love Magwitch through admiration.
Joe has a familial love for Pip. Biddy has a caring love for Pip.
A loveless mother, however - such as Mrs Joe or Miss Havisham - can ruin a person's life.
Dickens also explores social class in Victorian England.
Pip starts off as a blacksmith's apprentice (honest working class), rises to be a gentleman, but ends up middle class - a partner in a trading company.
Magwitch is a career criminal - a member of the lowest underclass - but makes a fortune in Australia.
Miss Havisham is rich, but her father made his money as a businessman, brewing beer.
Joe is a skilled craftsman (honest upper working class).
Orlick works in the forge. He is a member of the lower working class, surly and dangerous.
Herbert Pocket longs to be a middle class 'capitalist'.
Belinda Pocket is 'out of her class'. She married beneath herself and is incompetent in her new role as mistress of a schoolteacher's house.
Pip sees that many of the people of 'high' social class have significant character flaws, and that people from other social classes are 'better' human beings. On the other hand, violent and surly lower working class people are to be feared and distrusted.
Dickens' message is that the middle class values of godliness, hard work, temperance and the gentleness of a 'gentleman' are - with sufficient income - the way to happiness. This message would appeal to his middle class/upper working class readership.
Dickens had a social conscience and was deeply critical of the existing system of law and justice. (Remember that his father was imprisoned for debt.) Issues relating to crime and the law run throughout
The story starts with Pip meeting a 'fearful' criminal in a cemetery, who makes him steal a file and food.
Because Compeyson looks a 'gentleman', he manages to blame Magwitch, and receives a lighter sentence.
Jaggers continually washes his hands with soap. Dickens makes it clear he is as guilty as the criminals he protects.
In Chapter 32, Wemmick and Pip visit Newgate prison. Pip finds it ""much neglected"".
Magwitch is transported to Australia. But although he has been ""in jail and out of jail"", he is a good and noble man.
It is Magwitch, not the law, who delivers justice to Compeyson.
Dickens' shocking conclusion is that, in Victorian England, some criminals were good men trapped by an unfair system, that punishment missed the guilty, that lawyers were rotters, and that prison was an inhuman place - in short, that England's system of justice was wholly unjust.

Nanoparticles range in size from about 100 nm down to about 1 nm. They are typically the size of small molecules, and far too small to see with a microscope.
Nanoparticles have a very large surface area compared with their volume. So they are often able to react very quickly. This makes them useful as catalysts to speed up reactions. For example, they can be used in self-cleaning ovens and windows.
Nanoparticles also have different properties to the same substance in normal-sized pieces. For example, titanium dioxide is a white solid used in house paint and certain sweet-coated chocolates. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles are so small they do not reflect visible light, so cannot be seen.

Not all exam questions will be phrased in the same way, so look carefully at the

Vivid 'word pictures' used by a writer to conjure up a mental image of something.
The use of symbols - ie, of images or things that represent something else, usually something abstract.
A style of poem, with a particular pattern of rhythm, rhyme pattern or regular line length (eg sonnet, couplets or ballad).
The way a text is built and shaped. Chapters, plot, acts and scenes, stanzas, narrative, verse-form, rhyme and rhythm - all these (and many more) are aspects of structure.
The pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of poetry.
In poetry, the use of words which have the same or a similar sound - eg 'flow' and 'bow' - to form a pattern of sound.
What? Where? When? What are the stories of the poems? Answering these questions is a good starting point to help you make sense of the poems, and it can usually be done fairly easily.

Lines of poetry that make up a unit; verses.
- are they regular? Irregular? Do the lines have a similar length, or do they look random? Are there any very short, direct, lines?
There are certain features of language that you should look out for in poetry and write about in your exam. Try to find examples of them in the text and think about what effect they have. Why do the poets use that particular feature? What are they trying to convey?
The choice of adjectives (describing words). They might be simple or complex.
Visual representations of something; mental pictures; personas that are presented to the world.
Images or things (usually physical, like a flag) that stand for or represent something else - usually abstractions, like a nation. A crucifix is a symbol of Christianity.
The use of any techniques such as
An explicit comparison of one thing to another, using the words 'like' or 'as'. 'Sleeping like a log' and 'bright as a button' are similes.
A description of one thing in terms of another - implicitly comparing the two, but without using 'as' or 'like'. 'Sea of troubles', and 'drowning in debt' are metaphors. Something that represents another thing.
Words that express the sound they stand for, eg 'crunch', 'pop'.
Some people find writing about sound difficult because you need to read the poem aloud to hear what it sounds like. Try to answer the following questions when you are considering the sounds in poetry:
Does the poet use rhyme or echoing sounds to bring certain words together and reinforce the meaning?
Does the poet use repetition to emphasise certain words?
Does the poet use a definite rhythm throughout the poem, or in part of the poem, which reinforces the meaning?
When you've got to know the poem, you can begin to see what ideas and attitudes are in it. What
is happening in the poem? What are the feelings of the poet and/or the speaker(s)? You have to make up your mind what the poet's intentions are in writing the poem and what they wanted to say.
Make the idea of tone simpler by thinking about it like this: if you were reading the poem aloud, how would you do it? What kind of voice would you use? How would you want an audience to react when they hear it? Practise thinking about tone by reading a number of different poems. How do the poets want the audience to react to each one?
To get high marks in your exam you need to be able to pick out quotations from the poems that
the points you make. The selection of a quotation is one way the examiner will know if you really understand the poem and if you are able to construct an argument and if you have thought about your ideas.
Make sure you develop your point by commenting about the quotation you've selected -
Make a point, support it with a quotation and then explain how the language used helps to add to the line's effectiveness.
What is it about? Get to know the subject matter of the poem.
What form is the poem written in - and why?
How does the poem work? Look at the language (words) the poet has used. Think about the sound the poem makes when you read it.
Develop your ideas about the poem. What ideas does the poem give you? What attitude does the poet have to the subject matter? What tone does the poem have - how would you read it aloud?

Firms need short-term finance to start up a business or to cover day-to-day running costs. This is repaid over a short period and provides a firm with
The difference between current assets less current liabilities - the difference between a firm's cash and its short-term debts - the money it has to play with.
. Long-term capital is used to grow or expand and is paid back over a number of years.
Internal sources of finance are usually a cheaper way to raise working capital. Obtaining finance externally is usually the last option as interest has to be paid increasing the cost.
Now look at both in detail and try to remember three ways of raising finance from each source.

Assets that are no longer required, like an outdated computer or an obsolete piece of machinery, can be sold.
Stock levels can be reduced and funds made available for other uses.
A sole trader or a small business may be able to borrow money from family or friends without paying interest.
Loans from a bank or a building society can be expensive. An agreed amount is borrowed and repaid over a fixed period of time with interest. A bank
A predetermined credit limit from a bank.
Grants from central or local government can cost the firm nothing.
Firms often lease equipment or machinery to avoid a large outlay of cash. This is useful if a firm needs to upgrade within the medium term as technology advances.
The Public Sector operates both at national level and locally. Responsibility, and therefore funding, lies with
Although the main function of public corporations and local authority undertakings is to provide a service for everyone, they may also make a profit. If this is the case, then the surplus cash is reinvested in the business as retained profits, to develop or improve the service. Otherwise, funding comes from the Treasury or the local authority, either in the form of grants funded by taxation, or loans.
The Public Sector Net Cash Requirement (PSNCR) is the money required by the public sector of the economy for expenditure on items that are not financed by income.
Exam questions in this subject are often based on case studies. Read the following case study and think of how you would answer the question.
Top Sounds is a dance club that wants to keep up to date by installing video monitors throughout the premises. They are not sure which monitors they should buy because technology is advancing so quickly. At the moment, they only have one projector and a large projection screen. Both are old-fashioned. Business has been quiet lately so they don't have much working capital.
Give one possible internal source of finance and one possible external source of finance that Top Sounds could use, explaining your reasons.
When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page.
Remember you will gain extra marks if you show you can use business terms correctly in your answers.
One internal source of finance that Top Sounds is to sell the projector and screen. As an external source of finance they could lease the video monitors.
Conrad's answer was very basic. He has made good decisions but has given no reasons. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade.
Top Sounds have to make sure they do not use up all their working capital. One internal source of finance that they could use is to sell some assets. The projector and screen are going to be replaced by the video monitors, so could be sold. As they don't have much cash they may also need external financing to get the video monitors.
them would be a cheaper option at the moment than buying them for cash.
Nona's answer showed she understood the subject and her explanations were good. She could have given more detail and used business terms. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade.
Top Sounds have to make sure they have liquidity by not using up all their working capital. One internal source of finance that they could use is to sell some assets. The projector and screen are old-fashioned and are going to be replaced by the video monitors so will not be needed anymore and could be sold. One external source of finance they could use is leasing the video monitors. This would be a cheaper short-term option than buying them for cash and safer as they are not sure which monitors they should get. It would be easier to change them if they were not happy with them and to update them when new models come along.Another alternative might be to use
which would mean initially smaller expenditure but in the long term will cost more than the original price.
Pete's answer was very detailed, and gave good explanations. He showed that he understood the subject very well and used the correct business terms like working capital and assets. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.

These facts about Dickens will help you to better understand
When he was 12, his father was imprisoned for debt.
While his father was in prison, Dickens was sent to work in a boot-blacking factory.
Even when his father came out of prison, Dickens' mother made him continue working in the factory - for which he never forgave her.
In 1830, he fell in love with Maria Beadnell, but she rejected him.
In 1857, Dickens, now 45, fell in love with an actress - the 18-year-old Ellen Ternan - although he never dared tell the public about her.
In 1858, Dickens set up his own weekly magazine -
. In 1860, sales were falling because the novel the magazine was running did not have enough action to keep people interested.

Magwitch - the 'father-figure' in the novel - was a convict, but he was a good man.

Dickens packed Great Expectations full of comic characters and events.

- people were enthralled by stories about jail, crime, the criminal underworld and gruesome murders.
, set in bleak locations or scary mansions.
(especially where the lovers were socially mismatched).
, written to bring social issues to the notice of the general public.
Can you match the element to the genre?
The novel opens in a misty graveyard. Satis House is a scary mansion, and Miss Havisham is mad.
This novel was written by Dickens to show that being 'a gentleman' has nothing to do with wealth and status, but dutiful and gentle behaviour. It was therefore an attack on Victorian social snobbery.
There are a number of lawyers, criminals and murders in
. And it is as much the story of Magwitch as it is of Pip.
The book tells the story of Pip's love for Estella. Dickens rewrote the ending so that Pip got Estella in the end. Also, Biddy marries Joe (although he is 20 years older than her), and Herbert marries Clara Barley (even though she is socially inferior to him).
Pip becomes a gentleman, and there are lots of descriptions of the rich and elderly Miss Havisham.
As you work on a particular section of text from

Dickens was once a newspaper reporter; his descriptions show a wonderful eye for

Dickens loved words, and liked to produce a 'pretty piece of writing' in different styles. He included lots of powerful

Descriptions of one thing in terms of another - implicitly comparing the two, but without using 'as' or 'like'. 'Sea of troubles', and 'drowning in debt' are metaphors. Things that represent other things.
Explicit comparisons of one thing to another, using the words 'like' or 'as'. 'Sleeping like a log' and 'bright as a button' are similes.
. His descriptions often present people, their surroundings, and even the weather, in ways which reinforce each other, so that a certain 'feel' is built up through the passage.
From the early 1850s, Dickens gave public readings of his novels. His writing is

In 1857, Dickens wrote and acted in a play called

The 19th-century social, historical and cultural setting
The key social and cultural influences of the time were:
In 1859, Samuel Smiles published his book
, which told people that if they worked hard they could improve their station in life. The 19th century was the age of the 'self-made man'.
In Victorian times, society was strictly layered - not only into rich and poor, or even upper, middle and lower class, but hundreds of 'grades'. People were expected to 'know their place', and the Church taught them to be content in their 'station'. Dickens did not like the effects of social class.
At the time, many people were becoming aware of the need to improve the condition in which the poor found themselves. Dickens was a great supporter of social
Change for the better, often within politics or society.
In Victorian times, Britain was overwhelmingly Christian. The Church dominated religion and the morals of the time. Dickens, however, disapproved of the power the Church had over people's lives.
Family was at the centre of Victorian society. People had large, extended families - although Dickens was aware that not all families were happy families.

Waste polymers are disposed of in landfill sites. This uses up valuable land, and suitable sites often fill up quickly.
Polymers release a lot of heat energy when they burn. This energy can be used to heat homes or generate electricity. But there are problems with incineration. Carbon dioxide is produced, which adds to global warming. Toxic gases are also produced, unless the polymers are incinerated at high temperatures.
Polymers have recycling symbols like this one for PVC to show what they are
Many polymers can be recycled. This reduces disposal problems and the amount of crude oil used. But first the different polymers must be separated from each other. This can be difficult and expensive.
Most polymers, including poly(ethene) and poly(propene), are not biodegradable. This means microorganisms cannot break them down, so they may last for many years in rubbish dumps.

3571,"You should know that energy can be 'wasted' during energy transfers, and you should be able to calculate the
The fraction of the energy supplied to a device which is transferred in a useful form.
Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transferred from one form to another, or moved.
Energy that is 'wasted', like the heat energy from an electric lamp, does not disappear. Instead, it is transferred into the surroundings, and spreads out so much that it becomes very difficult to do anything useful with it.
Ordinary electric lamps contain a thin metal filament that glows when electricity passes through it. However, most of the electrical energy is transferred as heat energy instead of light energy.
Below is the Sankey diagram for a typical filament lamp.
Modern energy-saving lamps work in a different way. They transfer a greater proportion of electrical energy as light energy.
Below is the Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp.
Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp
From the diagram, you can see that much less electrical energy is transferred, or 'wasted', as heat energy.
The efficiency of a device such as a lamp can be calculated using this equation:
efficiency = (useful output  total input )  100
The efficiency of the filament lamp is (10  100)  100 = 10%. This means that 10% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy (90% is transferred as heat energy).
The efficiency of the energy-saving lamp is (75  100)  100 = 75%. This means that 75% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy (25% is transferred as heat energy).

2718,"Through reading Victor's journal and the books found at the De Laceys, the Monster discovers it has been the victim of persistent
. Shelley makes it clear the Monster is one of many such victims. She wanted her audience to think about the injustices in her world, and perhaps do something about them.
The Monster suffers right from the start with Victor's flight from it, deserting his responsibilities as a 'father'. People in the 19th century would have seen this as a crime. Victor is punished with death by the novel's end.
But the Monster is also responsible for some terrible crimes, especially the murder of Elizabeth. It punishes itself by committing suicide. However, if people had been kinder, or at least less cruel, the Monster would have found acceptance and felt no need to exact revenge on a world it believed to be responsible for its
A difficult or unfortunate state or situation.
Shelley, like her mother, was a firm believer in social justice: that we should look after everyone from all ranks of society, regardless of wealth or status. Perhaps it should not be a surprise, then, that the fairest, most decent characters are women. But they are punished by fate, a cruel God, the Monster or (ironically) the system of justice itself.
Victor's mother shows kindness in firstly taking in Elizabeth, then taking care of her when she falls ill with scarlet fever. An injustice is done to her, though, when she dies of the same disease after coaxing Elizabeth to a full recovery. Elizabeth then acts as a mother to the remaining family, marries her livelong love, Victor, but is punished with death at the hands of the Monster.
Justine is a caring servant and loving guardian of William who unreasonably feels responsible when he is murdered. Her execution as a result of a forced conviction and unfair judge is a further example of the many injustices Shelley saw in the world around her. It is also ironic that the judicial system saves Victor when on trial for the murder of Clerval, when he is the guiltiest character in the story. Shelley could not be clearer: justice is blind, the world is unjust.

116,"Block of aluminium metal - image does not show the transparent oxide layer
Aluminium and titanium are two metals with a low density. This means that they are lightweight for their size. They also have a very thin layer of their oxides on the surface, which stops air and water getting to the metal, so aluminium and titanium resist corrosion. These properties make the two metals very useful.
Aluminium is used for aircraft, trains, overhead power cables, saucepans and cooking foil. Titanium is used for fighter aircraft, artificial hip joints and pipes in nuclear power stations.
Unlike iron, aluminium and titanium cannot be extracted from their oxides by reduction with carbon:
Aluminium is more reactive than carbon, so the reaction does not work.
Titanium forms titanium carbide with carbon, which makes the metal brittle.
the process needs a lot of electrical energy
and a lot of energy. This especially limits the uses of titanium.
less energy is needed to produce recycled aluminium
than to extract aluminium from its ore. Recycling preserves limited resources and requires less energy, so it causes less damage to the environment.

Many scientists, governments and international bodies (but not all) accept the greenhouse effect and global warming theories. Some argue that the greenhouse effect, and the extent to which greenhouse gases contribute to it, have both been exaggerated. Some argue that the predicted rises in atmospheric temperatures and sea levels are overestimated.
Environmental campaigners argue that oil companies have contributed to environmental problems. Some activists even claim that wars in the Middle East were influenced by Western governments and oil companies' plans to get access to oil reserves.
On the other hand, many representatives of oil companies and industries that use a lot of energy argue that environmentalists have exaggerated the extent to which fossil fuels pollute the atmosphere, and the impact this will have on the environment.
Most governments have promised to reduce greenhouse gasses by signing up to the

Some groups - environmentalists included - campaign against certain types of alternative energy generation. For example, dams built to produce hydroelectric power flood large areas - impacting on local people, wildlife, vegetation and hydrology. Tidal barrages could alter the look, behaviour and ecology of estuaries, such as the Severn, and might cause pollution problems. Some people oppose wind farms on the grounds that they are ugly and noisy and a hazard to wild birds.

Both poems are about a harvest - yet in both, something happens to sour the happy atmosphere.
IClarke uses the mouse as a symbol of the weak and vulnerable in the world who are the innocent victims of warfare, while Heaney's poem shows the contrast between hope and disappointment. (His disappointment with the wasted blackberries reflects other disappointments in life.)
In both poems, the narrative is reflected in the structure - stanza 1 of Heaney's poem is about hope, stanza 2 is about disappointment.
Out in the storm, Whitman reflects on the violence of the natural world; Clarke is awakened to violence committed by man. However, both have nightmarish qualities.
Both are in the present tense, to add to the tension. Whitman's poem is a sonnet. The last syllable of each line rhymes, creating a dramatic effect. Clarke's is freer in form and sounds more like natural speech.
Clare's poem is very celebratory and innocent. There is no violence in the natural world he describes
...because there are no humans to cause it, unlike in Clarke's poem.
Again, both poems are from personal experience.
Both are about high summer: Clare refers to the hay grass, but it is for him something beautiful to look at rather than something with a purpose.
Like Whitman's, Clare's poem is a sonnet. We often associate sonnets with love, so perhaps his poem is simple an expression of his love of nature.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

4218,"Many questions will ask you to write about character in some way. For instance, you might need to look at someone's feelings, examine their role in the story, or show how a particular character is presented.
Quite a few people are mentioned in
, such as Lucy's husband and Steven's father, but there are really only four people to focus on.
The old man is clearly the central character. We know he lives with his daughter and her family, and keeps pigeons. The pigeons are very important to him, and the story. Most of the action seems to involve pigeons in some way or other.
The story is told largely from his point of view. For instance, we are informed of his thoughts, such as when he thinks about how his other granddaughters changed after they got married.
We are also told exactly what he sees and hears, such as the young couple fooling around in the garden. And he is involved in all of the conversations.
In addition, the descriptions of the other characters are from the old man's point of view. For instance, Steven is described as being '
'. These are the old man's impressions, not Alice's.
So, when you write about the old man, you must make sure you explain why he is so central to the story. In fact, Steven never says a word, which tells us the old man probably wants to ignore him as much as he possible.
The next page tells us more about the old man's personality.
The grandfather is very possessive of Alice. He still sees her as a young child - even though she is 18 - and loves her.
He has probably spoilt her in the past and is still very close to her, perhaps because she is the youngest of his grandchildren. He talks about her as if she is a pigeon, asking his daughter if they 'can keep her a bit longer?'.
The old man is a rude and angry character. He speaks rudely to Alice, saying
several times. Sometimes it is not clear if he is asking a question or stating something. So, 'Think you want to leave home, hey?' might be a statement: 'You think you want to leave home', or a question: 'Do you think you want to leave home?'. This makes him seem aggressive - he does not want answers from Alice; he wants to criticise her.
The old man is lonely, too. He thinks about what life will be like without his granddaughter and feels as if he is 'caught and finished', as if his life is almost over. In some ways this makes him very sensitive. He gets upset at seeing his granddaughter 'gazing' away from the house towards the place where Steven lives, and cries when he realises Alice is to marry.
At other times the old man seems quite spiteful; he appears to want to hurt the people he loves. He even calls Alice 'rubbish' and '
Acting bold in a rude or disrespectful manner.
When he lets the pigeon escape, he smiles 'proudly' at his granddaughter. We cannot be sure why he behaves like this, but he does so deliberately.
Alice is the old man's granddaughter. She is 18 and planning to marry very soon.
She often behaves as if she is much younger - described as 'swinging on the gate' or with her 'head loose on her arms, singing'. Alice seems carefree and looking forward to the future. This makes a clear contrast with her grandfather, who is anxious about what will happen.
In some ways Alice respects her grandfather: she moves 'politely' towards him and brings Steven over to offer him a present. It is almost as if she is apologising for having a boyfriend and trying to 'charm away' her grandfather's sadness. She even offers advice on how to look after the new pigeon.
At other times Alice makes fun of him. For instance, she laughs at the idea that he will tell her mother about Steven, and sings a song 'for him to hear' in order to annoy him. She also walks off, forgetting about him, because all she can think about is her boyfriend.
When the old man lets his favourite pigeon go free, Alice seems the most affected. She stares, does 'not smile' and is 'wide-eyed, and pale' with 'tears shivering off her face'.
It appears Alice is astonished and upset at her grandfather's actions. This seems totally out of character. In some ways, Alice might be blaming herself.
Lucy is the old man's daughter, and Alice's mother. She has three other daughters who have left home and are married.
We know Lucy had a husband in the past, but we know nothing about him. We can only guess whether they are divorced.
Lucy has to put up with her father's anger. She seems used to it, as her eyebrows go up in 'tired
' when he comes into the house. This shows she is patient with him and tries not to get into an argument. When her father calls her a 'liar', or blames her for everything, she remains calm and reasonable.
However, she can be tough, too. She makes her own mind up about things and has given Alice permission to get married. When her father is surprised, she speaks to him 'coldly', then ignores him. This shows she will only tolerate so much from him, and stands up for herself when she needs to.
She is also positive about her family, saying her other daughters have 'done fine' and have 'fine husbands', and that Alice is 'happy'.
The grandfather and Steven watch the pigeons fly away
Steven does not say a word in the entire story, but we know Alice loves him and they are going to marry soon. We only see Steven through the old man's eyes: a 'violent-bodied youth'.
Lucy clearly trusts him and believes he will be a 'fine' husband for Alice.
Steven brings a present with him when he first arrives. The old man thinks it must be for Alice, but it turns out to be a pigeon for him. This indicates Steven is probably quite thoughtful. We do not know whose idea it was, but Steven brings it along.
Steven also shows some interest in the old man by gathering around him with Alice in an 'affectionate' and 'concerned' way.

The boys are on the island because the plane that was evacuating them from Britain during a fictional nuclear war was attacked. Piggy reminds Ralph:
""Didn't you hear what the pilot said? About the atom bomb? They're all dead.""

All the friendships and good relationships on the island break down, either through bullying and violence or death.
Ralph and Jack seem to be friends at the start, yet Ralph knows Jack is hurt when he is not elected chief. This rivalry for power is at the root of some of the violence.
Ralph finds it hard even at an early stage to get things done. He and Simon are left to build the third shelter by themselves, because everyone else is too busy having fun. The community spirit of the assemblies is hard to maintain.
Even the littluns' games involve violence and broken friendships. Once Roger watches them playing:
""Percival had gone off, crying, and Johnny was left in triumphant possession of the castles.""
As pressure builds, the boys find that they have to take sides. When Jack defies Ralph and goes off alone, he challenges,
""Anyone who wants to hunt when I do can come too.""
He ignores Ralph's effort to make peace.
Jack's tribe becomes ruled by fear. Most boys don't want to be involved, but have no option. He keeps control by intimidating them and bullying them, such as when he ties up and beats Wilfred.
Roger rules by terror too. When Samneric are captured,
""Roger advanced upon them as one wielding a nameless authority.""

There are some simple ways to reduce heat loss, including fitting carpets, curtains and draught excluders.
Heat loss through windows can be reduced using double glazing. The gap between the two panes of glass is filled with air. Heat loss through conduction is reduced, as air is a poor conductor of heat. Heat transfer by convection currents is also reduced by making the gap is very narrow.
You may wish to view this BBC News item from 2006 about energy efficiency in homes.
Heat loss through walls can be reduced using cavity wall insulation. This involves blowing insulating material into the gap between the brick and the inside wall, which reduces the heat loss by conduction. The material also prevents air circulating inside the cavity, therefore reducing heat loss by convection.
Heat loss through the roof can be reduced by laying loft insulation. This works in a similar way to cavity wall insulation.

Alcohol has short-term effects such as sleepiness and impaired judgment, balance and muscle control. This leads to blurred vision and slurred speech. Vasodilation occurs - blood vessels in the skin carry more blood - leading to heat loss.

In the late 20th century, traffic congestion reduced accessibility to inner cities. This led to out of town locations becoming favoured for the retail industry. They are close to the suburbs and are accessible for many people via ring roads and motorways. Land is also cheaper in this part of a settlement, making it attractive to retailers.
A Next store in Hemel Hempstead, Herts
The result of this is that more people shop out of town, rather than in a CBD. The reduction in profits in the CBD can cause smaller branches of chain stores to close down, eg Next in St. Albans has recently closed in favour of the larger out of town store at the nearby Colney Fields retail park. Colney Fields benefits from free parking and easy access to the M25, giving it a wider sphere of influence than the smaller town centre store. Can you think of an example in your local area?
If this becomes widespread, areas in the centre of town can become derelict and unattractive, further discouraging people from shopping there. Also, unless bus or rail links are adequate, people without cars have limited access to shopping facilities.

5747,"Contraception or birth control is used for a variety of reasons:
when pregnancy might harm the mental or physical condition of the mother
to limit the number of children people have to ensure they don't damage living standards or affect other children
to prevent pregnancy in people who do not want a child at this stage in their lives
Contraception, including artificial contraception, is permitted in Judaism in appropriate circumstances.
Reform and Liberal schools of Judaism allow birth control for a wide range of reasons. Orthodox Judaism is more restrictive.
The methods of contraception allowed under Jewish law are those that do not damage the sperm or stop it getting to its intended destination. These are the contraceptive pill and the IUD.
Judaism teaches that life is a sacred gift from God:
Then God said, Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
Sexual intercourse is seen as an important part of marriage. It is part of a husbands duty and a womans rights. Judaism is generally opposed to contraception because of teachings such as:
He who fashioned and made the earth he did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited
God blessed them and said to them, Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.
Contraceptives are also thought to interfere with the physical union between a man and a woman:
For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.
On the other hand any restriction on the use of contraceptives can be lifted if the mothers life is at risk in any way.

God placed the man in a garden in Eden, and made beautiful trees grow there. God said to the man:
You may eat the fruit of any tree in the garden, except the tree that gives knowledge of what is good and what is bad. You must not eat the fruit of that tree; if you do you will die that same day.
The Lord God took soil and formed the animals and birds; the man named them, but none was a suitable companion for him. The Lord God put the man into a deep sleep, and while he slept he took one of the mans ribs and formed a woman out of it.

Sample question: How does Shelley create sympathy for the Monster?
Remember, you are advised to spend 45 minutes on this part of the paper, so divide your time up like this:
Sample question: How does Shelley create sympathy for the Monster?
Most people who have not read the novel believe the Monster is evil, committing numerous crimes against humanity. However, Shelley (
Use of authors name shows awareness of the writer at work.
) carefully makes the reader aware that the Monster can in part be excused for these crimes, and is at heart a decent, kind and good creature. Sympathy is created through its speech, its actions, and the mistreatment it suffers. Shelley ultimately shows how the Monster should be pitied, rather than criticised. (
The introduction addresses key words in the question, and suggests ways that sympathy is created.
We first see the Monster through the eyes of Robert Walton, who describes it as being ""of gigantic stature"". (
Evidence of knowledge of the whole text, and useful quotation embedded within a sentence.
) This could arouse alarm rather than sympathy, and this alarm is reinforced when it is described in detail in chapter 5. Here, we find Victor call his creation a ""catastrophe"", ""wretch"" and ""miserable monster"" (
More textual evidence and indicating an alternative viewpoint  something that impresses examiners.
). The Monster is hideous to look at and Victor feels he must run away to escape its clutches. All of this seems to indicate that it is, in fact, a true monster, something to be feared and capable of great harm. But Shelley is only allowing us to see it from Victor's biased point of view. When we hear the Monster's story, a very different impression is created. (
The paragraph ends by rejecting alternative viewpoint and indicating a shift to how sympathy is created.
It first speaks in Chapter 10, after Victor has called it ""Devil"" and threatened to kill it. Instead of reacting with similar venom, the Monster states simply: ""I expected this reception."" This is because it has grown used to man showing hatred towards it. Yet its calm acceptance of the fact begins to gain the audience's sympathy. This continues when you look at its language. Shelley gives the Monster a very powerful, persuasive speaking voice. It is highly articulate and shows obvious intelligence.
This is demonstrated in the following quotation:
""You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If you comply I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.""
Here it rightly criticises its maker for threatening death, when he should actually be looking after his 'offspring'. The Monster offers a reasonable argument that if Victor does his duty it will not commit anymore crimes. The vocabulary is very sophisticated (""glut"", ""satiated"") with almost poetic, if chilling, imagery (""the maw [stomach] of death""). The use of a variety of sentence types, punctuation and rhetorical devices reveals an educated being. The fact that the Monster is self-taught also gains our sympathy. (
Detailed analysis of language use, focused on the question, and following the Point, Evidence, Explanation structure for essay writing.
Shelley was very aware of the need for good parenting, since she was brought up by her father alone - her mother died in childbirth. (
) Victor chose to desert his parental duties, a fact the Monster is very quick to point out, meaning he is at least partly responsible for the Monster's actions. Furthermore, we feel sympathy for the Monster because of Victor's continued insults towards his creation (""abhorred devil detested form"") and his later destruction of the Monster's half-built wife before its very eyes.
The Monster begins life without an evil thought in its head. Despite the hardships it suffers - being attacked by townspeople, enduring severe cold and hunger, and being burnt when first encountering fire - it never gives up hope of a better life. Of course, these very hardships create great sympathy, as does its appreciation of beauty, nature, music, and the loving relationships it sees at the De Laceys.
It commits many acts of kindness, especially for the De Laceys, whom it loves. When Felix later beats it, thinking his father's life is in danger, the Monster is moved to tears of anguish and rage. After being forced out of its hovel through no fault of its own, it then rescues a peasant girl from drowning. Its reward for this utterly selfless and kind act is being shot. (
Numerous examples given of how sympathy is created.
) Shelley tells us that only after this do the Monster's ""feelings of kindness give place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth"". Most readers would have sympathy with this, given what the Monster has suffered. (
The paragraph ends by reinforcing the idea of sympathy, using more textual evidence, and by referring to the authors name again.
Although the Monster goes on to commit some terrible crimes, Shelley often gives some justification for them - justification that leads to a feeling of sympathy. (
Acknowledgement that the Monster has an evil side, turned into a point about sympathy being produced.
) Elizabeth is only murdered in revenge for Victor destroying the Monster's hope of future happiness, in the form of the second creature. The Monster knew it could never be loved by a human, only by one of its own kind, so it takes away Victor's hopes of future happiness in return.
The murder of William at first also seemed inexcusable. Yet when we learn that he had insulted the Monster using the same abusive language as his older brother (""hideous monster""), perhaps there is some sympathy for its response.
At the end of the novel, (
A phrase that suggests final evidence is about to be used and introduces the conclusion of essay.
) despite being abandoned and mistreated by its creator, the Monster still feels compelled to grieve over Victor's dead body. This moment of dignified reflection and regretting of misdeeds lends more sympathy to the Monster.
Its final act is to commit suicide in ""the agonies of torturing flames"" rather than live without a father, companion and, worse still, hope of future happiness. This sacrifice is the final means Shelley uses to gain pity for the creature, reinforced by the fact that it is never even granted a name. (
The essay concludes with a further two ways that show how Shelley creates sympathy, focusing on the novel's end and making a final reference to Shelley by name. It's also a short, clear sentence that leaves the reader in no doubt that the question has been fully answered.

Guru Ram Das Ji (the fourth Guru) said that,
""The True Guru, the Primal Being, is kind and compassionate; all are alike to Him. He looks upon all impartially""
Because of this teaching Sikhs may not show prejudice against anyone.
Guru Nanak Devi Ji (the first Guru) taught that everyone should worship the same God and that every person is equal and should be treated equally. He said that there is no Hindu and no Muslim because everyone is the same in Wahegurus eyes.
Waheguru is formless and colourless, and the differences between humans do not make one person better than another. In the eyes of Waheguru, a kind act towards a human being shows respect to one of Wahegurus creatures, and is an act of worship towards Waheguru.
No one can follow these teachings perfectly, and there will be occasions when Sikhs, like those of other faiths, are guilty of prejudice and discrimination.
But there are many examples too of Sikhs challenging injustice when they see the laws of God being broken.

""The little boy lost in the lonely fen...""
The boy is portrayed as a little boy three times in the two poems (not including the titles). This emphasises his innocence and vulnerability. Are we as weak and lost as he is?
""The night was dark, no father was there...""
In the first poem the father seems to abandon his child; yet in the second poem God is the father-figure who saves the child. Can these two opposite attitudes be reconciled?
""Who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale / Her little boy weeping sought.""
We can imagine her anguish and white, tear-stained face. Blake is clearly sympathetic towards her - even though she seems to be looking in the wrong place...
Blake reminds us that (in his opinion) God is always near. He wants us to see God as dependable and trustworthy. However, God is ""like his father"" - the father who left his own son (Jesus) behind in the ""mire""!

4885,"The UK industrial sector has changed immensely in recent years. Many heavily industrialised areas in Britain have had to cope with the loss of traditional heavy manufacturing industries and adapt to new working methods.
When there have been large numbers of job losses in an area which has undergone de-industrialisation, such as South Wales, the government and the EU will often intervene to improve the environment and quality of life for local people. Other areas which have been affected include Merseyside, Tyneside and Belfast with the decline of shipbuilding.
Industry is actively encouraged to locate in areas of low employment with incentives such as grants, subsidies and low rents.
Improvements which have accompanied the re-industrialisation in South Wales include:
The Cardiff Bay and Swansea Waterfront Redevelopments
Any large-scale economic activity may have a negative impact on the natural environment. Manufacturing industries in particular can cause air, water and noise
The presence of a potentially harmful substance that can reduce quality of a natural resource, such as water, and have knock-on impacts on the environment.
. Industrial pollution can affect the environment in a number of ways:
It may damage the well-being of humans and other species - for example, it can pollute drinking-water supplies or poison plants and animals.
It may interfere with natural processes - for example, it could change local climatic conditions or destroy wildlife habitats.
It may impact on people's livelihoods - for example, pollution of the sea will hurt people who are involved in fishing and tourism.
Some governments have introduced legislation to try to cut down on avoidable pollution and to encourage industries that are more
Sustainable means using something or doing something in a way that minimises damage to the environment and which avoids using up natural resources, eg by using renewable rather than scarce resources.
. These laws need to be enforced by courts.
A recent example of courts taking action against a company for causing pollution was in 2004 when a US court ordered the oil company
to pay 2.5bn for an oil spill in 1989.
ran aground while off course. It spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil contaminating over 1,300 miles of the coast of Alaska. It is estimated that the spill killed as many as 250,000 seabirds, 3,000 sea otters, 300 seals and 22 killer whales.
The court wanted Exxon to pay to help compensate those people in Alaska whose livelihoods were hurt the worst. The 2.5bn pay out is the latest ruling in a long-running court case.
Traditionally, most retail outlets were located in the CBD. The centre of town was a logical place for shops because it was the most accessible part of a town and transport links radiate out from this point.
In the late 20th century, traffic congestion reduced accessibility to inner cities. This led to out of town locations becoming favoured for the retail industry. They are close to the suburbs and are accessible for many people via ring roads and motorways. Land is also cheaper in this part of a settlement, making it attractive to retailers.
A Next store in Hemel Hempstead, Herts
The result of this is that more people shop out of town, rather than in a CBD. The reduction in profits in the CBD can cause smaller branches of chain stores to close down, eg Next in St. Albans has recently closed in favour of the larger out of town store at the nearby Colney Fields retail park. Colney Fields benefits from free parking and easy access to the M25, giving it a wider sphere of influence than the smaller town centre store. Can you think of an example in your local area?
If this becomes widespread, areas in the centre of town can become derelict and unattractive, further discouraging people from shopping there. Also, unless bus or rail links are adequate, people without cars have limited access to shopping facilities.

Realising that there was a great demand for beef in the north of the USA, the Texans drove their cattle north on a
to Sedalia in Missouri, where they were loaded onto trains for Chicago.
Two Texas ranchers, Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving, pioneered a second trail, to Denver in Colorado, where they sold their cattle to gold miners.
In 1868, a rancher named John Iliff (the 'cattle-king of the northern plains') won the contract to supply beef to the Sioux, who had been forced onto a reservation in the Black Hills.
A safer drive (the Chisholm Trail) was established to Abilene. This was set up by Joseph McCoy as a 'cow-town', with railroad stockyards (and numerous saloons where the cowboys could spend their wages).
John Iliff was the first rancher to set up an 'open range' ranch - in Wyoming in 1867.
A Cowboy looks out onto the Plains
There were huge areas of 'open range' - unfenced land which was free for anyone to use.
Charles Goodnight is reputed to have invented the

In spring 1886 there was a drought, followed by a scorching hot summer (up to 43C). This was followed by a winter storm in January 1887, in which the temperature dropped to -43C. Half the cattle on the plains died in a single year.
More and more homesteaders were coming onto the plains, and fencing off their farms with barbed wire (patented in 1874).
""The railroads were the critical factor in the development of cattle ranching.""
Search out and list all the ways the railroads affected the development of cattle ranching.
Five ways the railroads affect the development of cattle ranching include:
In 1865-1870 beef was transported north on the railroad from Sedalia, causing the opening up of Chicago and the other northern markets.
The long drives were developed solely to get the cattle to the railroads.
The development of 'cow-towns' such as Abilene were to allow the safe loading of cattle onto the railroads.
In 1870-1885, refrigeration cars on trains opened a world-wide market for beef.
After 1885 many homesteaders, who eventually destroyed ranching, were brought to the West on the railroads.

Geographers have put together models of land use to show how a 'typical' city is laid out. One of the most famous of these is the

Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another.
Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
Intensive farming practices include growing high-yield crops, using fertilisers and pesticides and keeping animals indoors. Food production is increased but there are unwelcome side effects.
Organic farming bans chemical inputs and has a less harmful effect on the environment but often produces less, more expensive food.
Hydroponics is the production of food using nutrient-rich solution rather than soil.
Leaves enable photosynthesis to happen. Photosynthesis is the process by which leaves absorb light and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrate (food) for plants to grow. Leaves are adapted to perform their function eg they have a large surface area to absorb sunlight.
Plants use minerals from the soil to build the complex molecules they need to survive and grow. Poor plant growth may be due to a deficiency of one or more minerals. Tests can be done to establish which mineral is deficient or a general purpose NPK fertiliser added.
Plants have two different types of 'transport' tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots.
The element carbon is the present in all living organisms. It's recycled through various processes, which are described in the carbon cycle.
Nitrogen is essential for the formation of amino acids to make proteins. The nitrogen cycle describes the ways in which nitrogen is recycled.
Osmosis is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low water concentration through a partially permeable membrane. Osmosis takes place in all living cells.
Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis through their root hair cells. Plants use water for several vital processes including photosynthesis and transporting minerals.
All substances are made from atoms. Each atom is made of a nucleus - containing protons and neutrons - surrounded by electrons.
The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. The elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in ascending order of atomic number.
The mass number of an atom is the total of protons plus neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and hence different mass numbers) are called isotopes of that element.
A covalent bond is formed between non metal atoms, which combine together by sharing electrons. Covalent compounds have no free electrons and no ions so they don't conduct electricity.
The Periodic Table is an arrangement of the elements in order of atomic number. Elements in the same vertical column are in the same group or family and have similar chemical properties.
Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid using electricity. When ionic compounds are molten or dissolved in water the ions are free to move.
When sulfuric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen is produced at the cathode (negative electrode) and oxygen at the anode (positive electrode). Aluminium is extracted from the mineral bauxite using the process of electrolysis.
All matter is made of atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements, and each one has a symbol. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other.
When atoms of different elements join together they make a compound. Compounds are represented by formulae that show how many atoms of each element are in the compound. Formulae can be worked out from the charge of the ions that make up the compound.
Chemical reactions can be written down as balanced chemical equations.
The Group 1 elements in the Periodic Table are known as the alkali metals. They include lithium, sodium and potassium, which all react vigorously with air and water.
The reactivity of the alkali metals increases down the group. Flame tests are used to identify alkali metal ions in compounds.
The Group 7 elements are also known as the halogens. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, which all have seven electrons in their outer shell.
In a displacement reaction a less reactive element is
Ionic bonding occurs between positive and negative ions, which attract each other and bind together to form ionic compounds. For example, sodium chloride consists of Na
Each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions held in place by electrostatic attraction and forming an ionic crystal lattice. The ions in a crystal lattice are very strongly bonded - a high temperature is required to melt the crystal.
The physical properties of different metals make them useful for different purposes. For example, aluminium conducts heat, which makes it a useful material for making saucepans and gold is shiny, which makes it an attractive material for jewellery.
Metal particles are held together by strong metallic bonds, which is why they have high melting and boiling points. The loose electrons in metals can all move together through the metal  creating an electric current.
The elements in the middle section of the Periodic Table are the transition elements. They're all metals with typical metallic properties eg conducting heat and electricity. They often form coloured compounds.
Transition metal carbonates undergo thermal decomposition - a reaction in which a substance is broken down into at least two other substances by heat.
Transition metal hydroxides are insoluble in water. They can be precipitated out of a transitional metal compound solution using sodium hydroxide solution.

The advantages and disadvantages of renewable energy sources.
Energy from sunlight is captured in solar panels and converted into electricity.
Single dwellings can have own electricity supply.
Manufacture and implementation of solar panels can be costly.
Wind turbines (modern windmills) turn wind energy into electricity.
Can be found singularly, but usually many together in wind farms.
Manufacture and implementation of wind farms can be costly.
Some local people object to on-shore wind farms, arguing that it spoils the countryside.
A tidal barrage (a kind of dam) is built across estuaries, forcing water through gaps.
In future underwater turbines may be possible out at sea and without dams.
Ideal for an island such as the UK.
Potential to generate a lot of energy.
Tidal barrage can double as a bridge, and help prevent flooding.
Opposed by some environmental groups as having a negative impact on wildlife.
May reduce tidal flow and impede flow of sewage out to sea.
The movement of seawater in and out of a cavity on the shore compresses trapped air, driving a turbine.
More likely to be small local operations, rather than done on a national scale.
May be opposed by local or environmental groups.
In volcanic regions it is possible to use the natural heat of the earth.
Cold water is pumped under ground and comes out as steam.
Steam can be used for heating or to power turbines creating electricity.
Used successfully in some countries, such as New Zealand and Iceland.
Can be expensive to set up and only works in areas of volcanic activity.
Geothermal and volcanic activity might calm down, leaving power stations redundant.
Dangerous elements found underground must be disposed of carefully.
Energy harnessed from the movement of water through rivers, lakes and dams.
Creates water reserves as well as energy supplies.
Can cause the flooding of surrounding communities and landscapes.
Dams have major ecological impacts on local hydrology.
An organic material, which can be burnt to provide energy, eg heat, or electricity.
An example of biomass energy is oilseed rape (the fields of yellow flowers you see in the UK in summer), which produces oil.
After treatment with chemicals it can be used as a fuel in diesel engines.
It is a cheap and readily available source of energy.
If replaced, biomass can be a long-term, sustainable energy source.
When burnt, it gives off atmospheric pollutants, including greenhouse gases.
Biomass is only a renewable resource if crops are replanted.
Obtained from felling trees, burnt to generate heat and light.
A cheap and readily available source of energy.
If the trees are replaced, wood burning can be a long-term, sustainable energy source
When burnt it gives off atmospheric pollutants, including greenhouse gases.
Make sure you know what types of energy are
A renewable resource is one that can be replaced or replenished as it is used. Renewable energy is energy which is generated from sources which are not finite or exhaustible such as wave power, wind power, solar power or geothermal energy.
A non-renewable resource is one that cannot be replaced when it is used up, such as oil, natural gas or coal.
. It is important to remember that biomass and wood are only renewable if the trees and crops are replanted. Many people fall into the trap of thinking that bio means renewable - it doesn't!

A text recounting the writer's own life.
At the start of the story, she lives in her own, intense dream world. She is fascinated by flying, and almost believes Superman could teach her to fly. She also plays superman games with her friend David.
Her father has died and she idealises her Uncle Frank. Superman and Uncle Frank are bound together in her mind.
Gradually, she becomes affected by the war. She is physically sick when she sees graphic pictures of the horrors of the prisoner-of-war camps. Superman cannot save her from her nightmares.
She is at first powerless when accused by Paula Brown, then becomes isolated and a target. Everyone turns against her.
After this, her usual comforts of home and Uncle Frank do not help, although she pretends she is fine.
When her mother and Uncle Frank appear not to believe her story, she leaves the light room and chooses somewhere dark to hide and think.
This shows how everything has changed for her. She has lost her childhood world of innocence (light) and entered the cruel, dark 'real' world.
The narrator's mother is anxious - she believes her daughter should have lots of sleep.
She worries about the war and is glad her husband did not live to see it.
She checks the film is 'innocent' enough for her daughter to see. 'Snow White' epitomises purity and goodness.
She tries to create light for her family (candles at supper...) but
assumes her daughter's guilt. Although she says she believes her daughter's denial, we get the feeling she does not.
He dreams of Superman, too, and is the narrator's closest friend.
He is an outsider because he is a ""mummy's boy"".
He becomes the villain in the Superman games, but continues his cruelty outside the game, imprisoning and torturing insects. We can compare him to the Japanese imprisoning and torturing enemies.
He plays games of war, such as pretending to be a Nazi, but is the most closely touched by the war, because his Uncle Macy has probably become a prisoner.
He is waiting to be drafted to fight in the war.
He is clever, strong and popular. He knows the games children like.
He is worshipped by his niece - she pictures him as Superman - and he loves her, too.
Does he believe her when she denies pushing Paula?
His face is hidden in the shadows when he comes to talk to her, suggesting he cannot bring the 'light' that will help her.
When he goes away and leaves her alone, his footsteps get fainter - indicating he will have a fainter role in her life from now on. Superman is gone for good.
Jimmy Lane pointing a finger at narrator
He is beaten into second place by the narrator in the Civil Defence signs competition - so has a grudge against her.
He lives opposite Paula Brown and fancies her - he always chases her at tag.
He backs Paula up in accusing the narrator of pushing her into the oil, both to show his 'support' for Paula and to get back at the narrator for beating him in the competition.
She is very attractive but not popular, because she is too stuck-up.
She was given an expensive snowsuit as a present, and is very proud of it.
She is unfriendly: she only invited the narrator to play tag because they needed someone else, not because she wanted her to.
She fancies Jimmy Lane and always allows herself to be caught by him.
She deliberately chooses to blame the narrator when she slides in the oil, perhaps because she sees her as the weakest person there.

Chartist groups were spread out in small groups all over the country. This made it difficult to successfully co-ordinate communication and meetings on a national level.
The Chartists did not always agree about what they wanted from Parliament. They all supported the Six Points, but some also wanted improved education, sobriety laws and improved working conditions.
The Chartists did not all belong to the same class and this meant that many middle-class supporters withdrew their support after Chartism became linked to violence. When the middle-class members left, there was less money to fund the movement and it started to fail.

is quite startling, when she imagines that the 'mother tongue' might 'rot and die in your mouth' (line 13), as the second ('foreign') language takes over.
The lost tongue grows back at night when she dreams in Gujarati - like a plant that seems to have died, but then starts to bud and grow strong and beautiful ('blossoms') again.
Why do you think that the poem begins in a

Abortion has been legal in England, Scotland and Wales since 1967 when The Abortion Act was passed. A new upper time limit of 24 weeks was introduced in 1990 under The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.
An abortion may be carried out if one of the following conditions applies:
the life or physical health of the mother is at risk
the mental health of the mother is at risk
there is a reasonable chance that the child will be born seriously disabled
Where the mental health of the mother is at risk, or her family will suffer if the pregnancy continues, the latest termination date is 24 weeks. There is no upper limit if the life or physical health of the mother is at risk, or if there is a reasonable chance of a seriously disabled child being born.
In 1974 119,000 legal abortions were carried out in England and Wales, by 2006 this figure had risen to 193,700.
Abortion is not permitted within Islam unless its to save the mothers life. Even if a pregnant woman is sentenced to death, this cannot be carried out until the baby has been born.
The later the abortion takes place the worse it is thought to be. Some Muslims believe that for the first four months of pregnancy the woman has greater rights than the foetus but that after this time they are equal.
One of the reasons that Islam is very opposed to abortion is because, before the time of

'Illegal drugs' include heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, LSD and cannabis (these are divided into Class A, B or C depending on how addictive they are).
'Recreational drugs' are drugs that people use for pleasure or relaxation. Most recreational drugs are illegal. However, alcohol and tobacco are legal recreational drugs. (Some religious people would include caffeine as a 'recreational' drug and would avoid its use.)

The use of any Class A drug (like heroine) in the last year has increased, from 2.7% in 1998 to 3.4% in 2005/06, mainly due to a rise in the use of cocaine powder.

Of course, what Othello actually sees isn't what he thinks it is. So when he sees and hears Cassio talking about Desdemona, Cassio is actually talking about another woman.
Othello also believes the story about Cassio wiping his beard on the valuable handkerchief. The only 'proof' is Iago's word, which is a lie. Othello is fooled in other ways too - he hears a scream and then assumes Cassio is dead, but he is only injured. However, the most important difference between reality and appearance is that Othello continues to think that Iago is of 'exceeding honesty', but everyone in the audience knows this isn't the case.

161.5 is the smallest number which rounds up to 162. 162.5 is the smallest number which rounds up to 163. Therefore, Mary's height must be below 162.5cm. (But remember that it could be 162.4999999999999... cm)

The dimensions of a piece of carpet are given as 127cm x 68cm. Both lengths are correct to the nearest cm. Between what limits does the area of the carpet lie?
We can find the lower and upper limits of both the width and height. The lower limits of width and height will multiply to give the lower limit of the area. And the upper limits will give the upper limit of the area.
The smallest possible area is calculated by multiplying the smallest possible length and width together. The smallest possible area is

2916,"Electricity is a convenient source of energy and can be generated in a number of different ways. You will need to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of other ways of producing energy, such as the use of nuclear power stations.
Coal, oil and natural gas are primary energy sources. Electricity is a secondary energy source because we use primary energy sources to produce it. These primary sources can be non-renewable or renewable. Electricity itself is neither non-renewable nor renewable.
it is transmitted easily over distance, through electricity cables
it can be used in many ways, for example electric lamps, heaters, motors etc
Generators can be turned directly, for example, by:
When electricity is generated using wave, wind, tidal or hydroelectric power (HEP) there are two steps:
Generators can be turned indirectly using fossil or nuclear fuels. The heat from the fuel boils water to make steam, which expands and pushes against the blades of a
. The spinning turbine then turns the generator.
These are the steps by which electricity is generated from fossil fuels:
Heat is released from fuel and boils the water to make steam.
The turbine turns a generator and electricity is produced.
The electricity goes to the transformers to produce the correct voltage.
Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transferred from one form to another, or moved. Energy that is ""wasted"", like the heat energy from an electric lamp, does not disappear. Instead, it is transferred to its surroundings and spreads out so much that it becomes difficult to do anything useful with it.
Ordinary electric lamps contain a thin metal filament that glows when electricity passes through it. However, most of the electrical energy is transferred as heat rather than light energy. This is the Sankey diagram for a typical filament lamp.
Modern energy-saving lamps work in a different way. They transfer a greater proportion of electrical energy as light energy. This is the Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp.
Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp
From the diagram, you can see that much less electrical energy is transferred, or ""wasted"", as heat energy.
The efficiency of a device such as a lamp can be calculated using this equation:
efficiency = (useful energy transferred  energy supplied)  100
The efficiency of the filament lamp is 10  100  100 = 10%. This means that 10% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy. 90% is transferred as heat energy.
The efficiency of the energy-saving lamp is 75  100  100 = 75%. This means that 75% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy. 25% is transferred as heat energy.
Note that the efficiency of a device will always be less than 100%.
The energy produced by burning fuel is transferred as heat and stored in water as
. The energy in steam is transferred to movement in a turbine, then to electrical energy in the turbine. Energy is lost to the environment at each stage. Here is a Sankey diagram to show these losses.
Note that only about a third of the energy stored in the fuel was transferred as electrical energy to customers.
Our renewable energy resources will never run out. Their supply is not limited. There are no fuel costs either. And they typically generate far less pollution than fossil fuels.
water energy, such as wave machines, tidal barrages and hydroelectric power
biomass energy, for example energy released from wood
Wind farms are noisy and may spoil the view of people who live near them. The amount of electricity generated depends on the strength of the wind. If there is no wind, there is no electricity.
There is a limited supply of non-renewable energy resources, which will eventually run out. They include:
fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas
Fossil fuels release carbon dioxide when they burn, which adds to the
and increases global warming. Of the three fossil fuels, coal produces the most carbon dioxide, for a given amount of energy released, while natural gas generates the least.
The fuel for nuclear power stations is relatively cheap. But the power stations themselves are expensive to build. It is also very expensive to dismantle old nuclear power stations or store radioactive waste, which is a dangerous health hazard.
The main nuclear fuels are uranium and plutonium, both of which are radioactive metals. Nuclear fuels are not burned to release energy. Instead, heat is released from changes in the
Just as with power stations burning fossil fuels, the heat energy is used to boil water. The

Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear fuels do not produce carbon dioxide.
Like fossil fuels, nuclear fuels are non-renewable energy resources. And if there is an accident, large amounts of radioactive material could be released into the environment. In addition, nuclear waste remains radioactive and is hazardous to health for thousands of years. It must be stored safely.
They are put in drums and surrounded by concrete, and put into clay lined landfill sites.

from 2006 about the arguments for and against nuclear power.
Nuclear power stations use the heat released by nuclear reactions to boil water to make steam
The type of nuclear reaction used is called
A neutron collides with a uranium nucleus. A uranium nucleus is large and unstable.
The uranium nucleus splits into two similar-sized smaller nuclei.
These neutrons can then collide with more uranium nuclei.
These processes are repeated continuously, forming a
A nuclear chain reaction occurs when a neutron splits a nucleus, releasing more neutrons, which in turn go on to split even more nuclei.
In a nuclear reactor, the reaction is controlled so that energy is released at a steady rate.
The energy released in nuclear fission is far greater than the energy released in a chemical reaction, such as burning fuel. This means that the power output of a nuclear power station is large. The lifetime of a nuclear power station is about 20 years.
In considering the subject of nuclear power, it is important to weigh up the advantages and the disadvantages. These are some of the advantages:
no carbon dioxide is produced when the station is operating, as stated earlier
a small amount of fuel is needed, when compared with coal or gas
hazardous radioactive waste is produced, as stated earlier
building the power stations is quite expensive
decommissioning, ie taking apart, the power stations at the end of their lifetime is very costly
The nuclear fuel, usually uranium oxide, is held in metal containers called

. They are raised to speed it up, or lowered to slow it down.
Scientific applications give people things that they value, but may have undesirable impacts on the environment.
Our society uses more and more energy every year, but the carbon dioxide produced by most power stations is believed to be causing serious damage to the climate.
Natural resources should be used in a sustainable way.
The use of renewable energy sources would guarantee energy for the future. At the moment, renewable energy sources cannot provide enough energy.
There are official regulations and laws which control scientific research and applications.
The nuclear industry is regularly inspected to ensure that standards of safety are maintained.
Some applications of science have ethical implications. One point of view is that the right decision is the one which gives the best outcome for most people. Another point of view is that certain actions are never justified because they are wrong.
Disposal of nuclear waste raises ethical problems:
Some people say that we must have nuclear power, or we will not be able to combat global warming and still produce enough energy.
Others say that it is unethical to produce waste that will still be dangerous in many thousands of years time.
Weighing up the arguments - higher only
Before deciding on a course of action, it is important to ask if it is
. Can it be done? Then it is possible to consider if it
If nuclear waste could be sent down into the Earths mantle, it would take millions of years to resurface. Unfortunately, there doesnt seem to be any way to do this. It is not feasible.
Nuclear waste could be sent into space in rockets so that it falls harmlessly into the Sun. Unfortunately, this would be far too expensive, and any accident on take-off would spread dangerous waste over a large area. It ought not to be done.
In different social and economic contexts, different decisions might be taken.
Many developing countries insist that they need to burn fossil fuels in their power stations, even if it produces global warming. They need this to allow them to catch up with the standard of living that we enjoy.

Weather symbols can seem confusing until you look for the patterns. Note how increasing cloud cover is shown by covering more and more eighths (oktas) of the circle.

Similarly, once you know the symbol for rain is a black ball and the symbol for snow is a star, then you know sleet will be a ball plus a star, and two, three or four balls denotes heavier rainstorms.

Limestone and its products have many uses, including being used to make mortar, cement, concrete and glass.
Metal carbonates such as calcium carbonate break down when heated strongly. This is called thermal decomposition. Here are the equations for the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate:
Other metal carbonates decompose in the same way. Here are the equations for the thermal decomposition of copper carbonate:
Notice that in both examples the products are a metal oxide and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide gas can be detected using limewater. Limewater turns cloudy white when carbon dioxide is bubbled through it.
Metals high up in the reactivity series - such as calcium - have carbonates that need a lot of energy to decompose them. Metals low down in the reactivity series - such as copper - have carbonates that are easily decomposed. This is why copper carbonate is often used at school to show these reactions. It is easily decomposed, and its colour change, from green copper carbonate to black copper oxide, is easy to see

such as susceptibility to floods, drought and other hazards can influence development. Frequent drought in the Sahel region of Africa is a huge obstacle in the way of development.
such as wealth generated through industry, agriculture or the availability of natural resources influences development. The UK is one of the world's most developed nations because these factors allowed it to industrialise during the Industrial Revolution.
 many LEDCs are in debt to MEDCs, which means they have to prioritise paying these off with interest before investing in development.
Despite some MEDCs having food surpluses and problems such as obesity, many people in LEDCs suffer from malnutrition and starvation. This could be a result of factors such as drought, debt or conflict, eg in the Darfur region of Sudan.
This is an example of 'sustainable agriculture'. It benefits small farmers and enables them to use their land efficiently. The projects use cheap, appropriate technology to increase yields in ways that make farmers more independent and conserve their natural resources.
Farmers in 50 developing countries have adopted sustainable techniques and some have experienced increased yields. By combining science with traditional knowledge, sustainable agriculture could meet the long-term food needs of developing countries without damaging the environment.
Genetically modified (GM) foods, for example, could change food production methods. They allow more food to be produced in a smaller area using fewer resources. Some people are against GM crops and question whether it will reduce hunger in LEDCs and are concerned about the impact on the environment.
In the 1960s high-yielding varieties of crops were used to increase food production - this became known as 'The Gene Revolution'. In the Gene Revolution, genes from one plant were copied and inserted into another to give it new characteristics. This allowed foods to be developed to suit specific environments and food demands.
Jakarta in Indonesia has a rapidly growing population and water companies do not have the resources to supply reliable and safe water to everyone. This means that a large proportion of the population are drinking contaminated water and are vulnerable to disease. In addition, salt water is also contaminating groundwater, which is making the problem worse. This is a particular problem in shantytowns such as Marunda.
Like most shantytowns, Marunda lacks basic services such as water supply, sanitation and electricity. People there have a poor standard of living and a low quality of life. Conditions are crowded and disease spreads easily, contributing to low life expectancy and high infant mortality rates.
In the past, people have relied on water from tankers or street sellers who charged high prices.
The Jakarta city authorities tried to invest in basic services but there was a lack of funding. They then sought investment from abroad. In 1999, Thames Water began a 60,000 project to bring piped water to Marunda. The project involved local people from the early stages to ensure that their needs would be met appropriately and that the project was sustainable.
Statue of Great General Sudirman in Jakarta
By the year 2000, over 1600 homes in Marunda had piped water. Water can now be obtained more cheaply, allowing money to be spent on food, clothes and education which is vital for the country's long-term prospects. There have also been health benefits because the risk of disease from contaminated water has been reduced.
This scheme was a success as it was sustainable and worked with the people to meet their needs. Not all schemes have been as successful as this one. The Pergau Dam in Malaysia, for example, was constructed in partnership with the British government with the aim of providing safe and reliable water and electricity.
However, it did not meet the needs of the poorest people and the scheme was 'tied aid'. This means that conditions were attached which did not benefit Malaysias population.

4051,"We use a decimal point to separate units from parts of a whole (tenths, hundredths, thousandths etc)
In the number 34.27, the value of the figure 2 is a tenth, and the value of the figure 7 is a hundredth.
When ordering numbers, we should always compare the digits on the left first.
For example, which is greater: 2.701 or 2.71?
Both numbers have two units and seven tenths, but 2.701 has no hundredths, whereas 2.71 has one hundredth. Therefore, 2.71 is greater than 2.701.
Another way to look at it is to write a zero at the end of 2.71 to make it 2.710 (this does not change its value, because it is after the decimal point).
The two numbers are now 2.710 and 2.701. It is quite easy to see that 2.710 is bigger (just as 2710 is bigger than 2701).
When adding and subtracting decimals add or subtract as normal, but make sure that you keep the decimal points aligned.

(Note that we wrote 5 as 5.00. It is not essential to do this, but it helps.)
1) Multiplying and dividing by 10, 100, 1000
You need to learn the following rules:
Move the decimal point one place to the right
Move the decimal point two places to the right
Move the decimal point three places to the right
Move the decimal point one place to the left
Move the decimal point two places to the left
Move the decimal point three places to the left
Multiplying decimals is the same as multiplying two whole numbers. You just need to remember the following:
If there is one digit after the decimal point in the question, there will be one digit after the decimal point in the answer.
If there are two digits after the decimal point in the question, there will be two digits after the decimal point in the answer etc.
For example to calculate 3.42  2 we work out 342  2 and then work out where to put the decimal point.
There are two digits after the decimal point in the question (3.42 x 2), so there will be two digits after the decimal point in the answer. Therefore 3.42  2 = 6.84
First work out 12 x 11 = 132
Now count the digits behind decimals points in the question. There are two of them. So you need two digits behind the decimal point in your answer. So 1.2 x 1.1 = 1.32
When dividing a decimal by a whole number, divide as usual but keep the decimal points aligned
(Note that the decimal points are in the same place.)
If you are dividing a decimal by another decimal, you need to use equivalent fractions.
(we have multiplied the numerator and denominator by 10).
(We have multiplied the numerator and denominator by 1000.)
Remember to always multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number. And make sure that the denominator is a whole number.

This Revision Bite will help you understand why and how a company conducts market research.
Market research is the collection of information or data to better understand what is happening in the market place. A firm's marketing department needs to know about economic trends, as well as consumers' views. Based on this information, they can put together a marketing plan, which will meet their own needs as well as those of their consumers.
There are two general types of research:
Primary research provides new data for a specific purpose
The marketing department of a firm or a specialist research organisation can provide this. Typically, the data is gathered in face-to-face interviews, by telephone, by post or via the internet, using questionnaires. This is called a
. Sometimes potential consumers are asked to test products, and their responses are recorded.
Gathering primary or new data - questionnaires, surveys etc.
has the advantage that the firm itself has control over the whole process. The disadvantages are that it takes longer and is more expensive.
It can be anything from a company's own sales statistics to Department of Trade and Industry reports. Other secondary sources of information include journals, company reports, government statistics, and surveys published by research organisations. Traditionally, these have been paper-based, but more and more information is now available on CD-ROM or on-line through the Internet.
Gathering secondary or existing data - internet, newspapers etc.
has the advantages of being cheaper and quicker than field research. The disadvantages are not knowing if the findings are accurate, or how relevant they will be to your product.
Marketing departments need to have information so they can get their

right. For example, they will want to know what similar products already exist and how much they cost. They will also want to know whether consumers will want to buy their new product, and what they think about it. The process for doing this is as follows:
Now have a look at the process in more detail. If you were a marketing manager, you might do the following things:
Make sure you know what you are trying to find out, and how it will help you. This is something that people sometimes forget. There is an endless amount of information available, so it is important to be focused.
You have to decide which are going to be the best ways to gather this information. Choose the most appropriate reports and journals. Depending on how much time you have, choose what field research you can do. Designing questionnaires and testing products on consumers can take a long time. You also have to decide whether you have the necessary skills, or whether you need to use a specialist research organisation. This is a more expensive option.
You would usually do desk research first, because it is cheaper and quicker. Then supplement this with field research, so that you don't duplicate your findings. Designing the questionnaires and conducting the surveys takes place during this phase.
Now that you have the findings, you have to work out what they are telling you. If you identified your objectives before you started, this should not be too difficult. You must look for
and patterns. Then you should see how this affects your marketing mix. For example, if you were thinking of setting a price for your product of 10 per unit, and 70% of the

think this is too high, then you may need to consider reducing the price. If you don't, you may find that few consumers will buy it. But remember: no survey is perfect. There is always a margin of error.
In market research, what is the difference between desk research and field research? Give two examples of each.
When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page.
Desk research is finding information that already exists, and field research is finding new information. Journals are one type of desk research, and questionnaires are one type of field research.
Dionne's answer was basically correct, but lacked detail. It also looks as if she didn't read the question properly as she only gave one example of each type of research. If the question asks for two reasons then you will have to give two to get full marks.
Desk research is finding information from sources that already exist, such as journals and reports. Field research is finding out new information that you specifically need. This could be through questionnaires or consumers trying out your product.
Garth's answer showed he understood the terms, and his examples were appropriate. He could have included more detail, and would have gained more marks by using business terms in his answer (see Heather's answer).
Desk research is getting data from existing secondary sources, such as journals and reports. Field research is finding out new information about your consumer's needs. This could be through a survey using questionnaires, or getting them to try out your products and recording their opinions.
Heather's answer was very detailed, and she used the correct business terms. She showed that she understood the subject very well. She would get a very good mark.

William Blake was born in London in 1757. Instead of going to school, he was apprenticed to an engraver, learning skills he was to use throughout his career as a poet. He then became a student at the Royal Academy of Arts.
When Blake was 23, he made friends with people who were interested in religious mysticism. They influenced him greatly: he published his first poems, touched with mystic ideas, in 1783.
The following year, Blake set up a print shop in London. He engraved and published
(from which these poems are taken) in 1789.
Blake always wrote out poems by hand on an engraving plate, rather than using type, engraved illustrations and hand-coloured them: he was concerned with the presentation of his poetry as well as the words themselves.
He continued to write about and engrave his prophetic Christian visions throughout his life, although he never found the fame he had hoped for. Blake died in 1827. It was not until 50 years later that his work began to be widely recognised. Yeats (who wrote

They are found at high altitude across the globe, even on high mountains close to the equator, and at lower altitude in high latitudes close to the North and South Poles. The formation of glaciers and the process by which they shape the landscape around them is called glaciation.
Glaciers once covered large areas of the Earth and shaped the landscape around them. The legacy of ancient glaciers lives on - for example in areas such as the Lake District.
There are three processes by which glaciation affects the landscape -

When the temperature reaches freezing point, the water inside cracks freezes, expands and causes the cracks to widen. When the temperature rises, the water thaws and contracts. This eventually causes rocks to break up. For freeze-thaw to take effect, the air temperature needs to fluctuate around freezing point.
Freeze thaw weathering produces angular rock fragments.

This causes the wearing away of the landscape as the glacier behaves like sandpaper. It leaves behind smooth polished surfaces which may have scratches in them called striations. Striations are carved out by angular debris embedded in the base of the glacier.

4489,"We have already looked at one aspect of language - in the section on
we saw how you could use short quotations as evidence.
We might want to say Don John is an aggressive and angry character. We can then support this view by looking at his language. He says that if he had a mouth he ""would bite"", and that he only has his unhappiness to make use of.
Here we are using two ways to provide evidence: words that are directly from the play are put in quotation marks, for example, ""I am a plain-dealing villain."" The second way is to describe what is said in your own words, for instance, Don John plans to stop Claudio's marriage to Hero. It is often good to combine these methods, perhaps quoting just one word from the play. For instance, Don John despises Claudio and calls him a ""start-up"" (an 'upstart' in modern English).
The one thing you should avoid is using a long quotation. Many students write out whole chunks of the play. This is just like retelling the story - there is no reason for it, and you will not get any marks for it.
We can also deal with language in
by looking at the techniques Shakespeare used. Some of these techniques (and names) might seem difficult at first. If that is the case, just think about what the play would sound like if the technique was not used. For instance, when Claudio is rejecting Hero at the church, imagine he says to Leonato:
Well, yes, it is easy to understand, but it is not unusual or interesting. And it does not show how bitter Claudio is. So instead, he says:
""Give not this rotten orange to your friend""
The ""rotten orange"" is Hero. Claudio is talking about her as if she is beautiful on the outside but decayed inside - she has turned bad but no-one has seen this yet. Claudio's words are unusual, but the audience can immediately relate to them and remember his ideas. So if you are not too sure of a technique, remove it and compare the two versions - what effect does Shakespeare's technique have on you?
. Imagery is when we might talk about one thing in terms of another. So Benedick is described as if he were a ""disease"" which Claudio has caught - he will ""hang upon him"", make Claudio ""mad"" and cost a huge amount of money to ""be cured"". Imagery substitutes one thing for another in three main ways:
- when a direct comparison is made (with 'as', 'than' or 'like'). Benedick says he ""was duller than a great thaw"", while Borachio compares fashion-conscious men to soldiers and priests. These ideas allow us our own interpretations. Is fashion like being in the army and being told what to wear - or everyone looking the same?
- when one thing is called something else, such as Claudio calling Hero a ""jewel"". If he had said she is ""like a jewel"" it would be a simile. But he says she actually is ""a jewel"", so it is a metaphor. Think about the qualities of a jewel: it is valuable, beautiful and rare. Then think about how Claudio views Hero - is she something to admire and possess, rather than someone to love?
- where something is described as if it is human. Beatrice talks about how a ""star danced"", and Leonato says ""happiness takes his leave"".
. A lot of jokes are puns: a play on words using words that sound similar but have different meanings. So, when Beatrice says Claudio is ""civil as an orange"", she plays on the similarity between 'civil' and 'Seville'. He is either polite or bitter (like the oranges from Seville).
is when characters give quick, witty replies. We see this most often with Beatrice and Benedick. For instance, when they argue in Act 1, Scene 1, they are able to twist the other person's words around. And both want to have the final word.
. Repeating a word or phrase draws attention to it. For instance, in Act 5, Scene 2, Beatrice says:
""Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath""
The word 'foul' is repeated six times in just three lines. This is not by accident. Shakespeare is drawing attention to how unhappy Beatrice is. Another way of repeating ideas is to use
, such as Benedick in Act 3, Scene 2 talking of a Dutchman, Frenchman, German and Spaniard.
are also used frequently. They highlight the conflicts in the story between men and women, truth and lies, or being single and getting married. There are lots of examples. One of the clearest is Beatrice's explanation for not getting married (in Act 2, Scene 1):
""He that hath a beard is more than a youth: and he that hath no beard is less than a man: and he that is more than a youth, is not for me. and he that is less than a man, I am not for him""
Another way of looking at the language of
is to examine the lines. Shakespeare used different patterns of lines for different effects. Some are written in
, so they have ten syllables which are organised in five pairs. The first syllable is weak, the second stronger. So if we look at a typical line, we traditionally show the weak or unstressed syllable with an 'x' above it, and the stressed syllable with an '/' above it. In this example Claudio is saying goodbye to Hero:
x / x / x / x / x /
But fare thee well, most foul, most fair, farewell
Reading it like this, we can hear an obvious beat. We can also see that the key words tend to be stronger and carry more meaning. They also seem to sum up Claudio's contradictory views of his rejected bride: fare - well - foul - fair - well.
Most tasks allow you to write or talk about how language is used in the play. So imagine your title is: 'How does Beatrice change during the course of
?' There are all sorts of references you can make to language:
When we first meet Beatrice, she seems to be a clever, independent woman. She speaks openly, not waiting to be asked, and seems to like making fun of Benedick in particular. She compares him with ""a disease"", and her repartee makes even the messenger afraid of her. Throughout the play she uses puns, such as saying Claudio is ""civil as an orange"". This shows her witty nature, because she plays on the similarity between ""civil"" and ""Seville"": he is either polite or bitter (just like the oranges from Seville).
This combines much of what we have covered so far. It starts to answer the question without filling up the page with irrelevant facts, plot details and fancy technical terms. Remember, you do not have to tick off the language terms like a trainspotter. Instead, show you appreciate some of the techniques Shakespeare used, and the effects they have on his audience.

Carbon dioxide in the air can dissolve in rain water to form carbonic acid, H
Carbonic acid is a weak acid. It partially ionises to form hydrogen ions.
The hydrogen ions from carbonic acid give natural rain water a slightly acid pH value of 5.6. Over millions of years this very dilute acidic solution has been responsible for the formation of caves in areas of limestone rocks. Limestone is made of calcium carbonate, which reacts with acids.
calcium salt + water + carbon dioxide
During the last century the rain water in some parts of the world has become far more acidic. This acid rain has been caused by the emission of pollutant gases such as sulfur dioxide. When coal is burned in electricity power stations, sulfur impurities form sulfur dioxide.
The gas is also produced when fuels obtained from crude oil are burned. When sulfur dioxide is released into the air it reacts with water and oxygen to form sulfuric acid, H
Sulfuric acid is a strong acid. It ionises completely to hydrogen ions.
This gives rain water a pH below 5.0. Rain water that has this higher level of acidity can cause damage to buildings and statues, particularly those made of limestone. It can also reduce the growth of, or even kill, trees and crops. Acid rain may even lower pH of water in lakes, killing fish.

5840,"All religions teach the difference between good and evil, but have different beliefs about evil and suffering.
Religion has a great deal to say about 'good' and 'evil'. Religious leaders and sacred texts all encourage believers to live 'good' lives. The problem of evil and suffering is one of the commonest reasons people give for not believing in God.
- suffering caused by events that have nothing to do with humans, and which are to do with the way the world is, eg, natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, floods or earthquakes
- suffering caused by humans acting in a way that is considered morally wrong eg, bullying, murder, rape, theft or terrorism
Human evil and natural evil can often work together, with human evil making natural evil worse  or better! For example, the suffering caused by an earthquake or floods can be made worse by people looting, but it can be made more bearable by people showing compassion and making personal sacrifices to help those who are suffering.
It is important to remember that: 'evil' is a cause of suffering; 'suffering' is a result of evil.

A PLC has far more power to raise large amounts of capital, through selling its shares to the public. This means it can develop the business more easily than a private limited company. It can also benefit from being a large-size organisation. It will be able to buy in bulk, and specialise. All of this should reduce costs.

A PLC has far more capital available, which it has raised through selling its shares to the public on the Stock Market. This means it can develop and expand the business more easily than a private limited company, which doesn't have the financial resources. It can also benefit from economies of scale, because it is a large-size organisation. This means that it will be able to buy in bulk, borrow more cheaply, and specialise.

6816,"The ""Golden Age of Farming"" or ""High Farming"" took place in Great Britain between 1840 and 1870. The reason this period is given these two names is because farmers began to use more advanced and scientific techniques on their land for the very first time. These new techniques allowed them to produce higher crop yields, which led to lower food prices.
High Farming was able to take place in Britain for four main reasons:
- from 1801 onwards there was a dramatic rise in the size of the British population and by 1851 there were approximately twice as many people living in Britain as there had been in 1801. These people needed to be fed and many were unable to grow their own food.
- by the mid-1850s most of the population lived in new towns and worked in new factories, so did not have the time or space to grow their own food. Factory owners gave their workers higher wages to spend on food and this made farmers richer.
- the middle of the 19th century also saw an improvement in British transport. For example, there were now 5,000 miles of new railway tracks in Britain, which allowed fresh vegetables, milk and cheese to be moved more quickly around the country. Towns had access to fresh produce for the first time and this encouraged farming.
- British farming benefited from new colleges and institutions being set up to educate a new generation of farmers about new techniques that would give greater yields and more profits. The two most famous educational facilities were the Rothamsted Agricultural Research Station set up in 1842 and the Royal College for Agriculture in 1846.

Originating in Vienna, during the 19th Century the waltz became popular all over Europe. A father and son, both called Johann Strauss, composed a huge number of waltzes. Johann Strauss(the son) was called The Waltz King.
The Waltz always has three beats in the bar and has a bass note on the first beat. Waltzes can be identified by the 'um cha cha, um cha cha' that forms the backbone of the music.
They commonly feature a low pitched accompaniment and a higher series of elegant melodies.
The speed of the waltz is usually fairly quick and lively.
Waltzes usually contain a string of seven or eight different melodies with an introduction and a coda (ending passage).
Waltzes were written for string orchestras, full orchestras including woodwind and brass, and for solo instruments such as the piano or guitar.
The Polka originally came from the area around Czechoslovakia and was a craze in the 1840s. Everyone was dancing the Polka and so it spread around Europe like an epidemic.
The Polka is a very quick dance with 2 beats in the bar.
Like the waltz, polkas were written for any combination of instruments. This one is played by a brass ensemble:

1405,"Forensic scientists analyse substances from a crime scene using many methods - including checking for traces of metals that might indicate a link between significant people or objects in the case.
Individual transition metals can be identified by the colour of their precipitate with sodium hydroxide solution. Flame tests can be used to identify a particular metal.
Transition metals form coloured compounds with other elements. Many of these are soluble in water, forming coloured solutions. If sodium hydroxide solution is then added, a transition metal hydroxide is formed. These are insoluble. They do not dissolve but instead form solid precipitates. Here are the equations for copper sulphate solution reacting with sodium hydroxide solution:
copper sulphate + sodium hydroxide    copper hydroxide + sodium sulphate
 +  2NaOH      Cu(OH)
(blue solution + colourless solution  blue precipitate + colourless solution)
Copper solutions form a blue precipitate with sodium hydroxide
Different transition metals form different coloured precipitates.

green - turns orange-brown when left standing
How could you tell if an unknown substance contained iron(II) nitrate or iron(III) nitrate? You would add a few drops of sodium hydroxide solution. If you got a dark green precipitate it would show that the unknown substance was iron(II) nitrate; if you got an orange-brown precipitate it would show that the unknown substance was iron(III) nitrate.
Note that it is the metal that determines the colour. So you would get the same result whether you used zinc chloride or zinc nitrate - a white precipitate in this example.

2918,"A theme is an idea or topic that is important to a text. It might make us think about what the events really mean, or what the writer was trying to do, or even how the story could relate to our own lives. The key themes in
The story centres on Alice and reactions to her plan to leave home. Lucy, her mother, thinks of it as completely natural and is very positive, saying she 'never regretted' getting married and her other daughters have done well.
Alice is looking forward to leaving home. She is carefree, swinging on gates, singing and waiting for her boyfriend. She has everything in life to look forward to and cannot really understand the feelings of her grandfather. However, at the end of the story she perhaps starts to realise the heartbreak that leaving home can cause.
The old man is very negative about Alice leaving home. He thinks of it as the end for him - he will be left 'uncherished and alone' with his daughter, and will no longer have a house full of life. We know he did not like it when his own daughter left to get married, and each time one of the girls leaves he gets them 'crying and miserable'.
, reminds us that leaving home is a key theme in the story. Both the pigeon and Alice are trying to escape, while the old man is trying to stop them. He eventually lets the pigeon go. We are not sure how Alice will leave, or whether her grandfather will learn to accept this.
The old man admires his new pigeon
There are a lot of references to nature. The most obvious is the pigeons. They appear in the first sentence, as the old man looks after his dovecote (where they are kept). There are many other references - from their claws to how they fly. And the story comes to an end with them settling back in the garden, minus the young pigeon which is the grandfather's favourite.
There are many references to the garden, too - from the 'frangipani tree' to the colour of the soil. These can be detailed, like 'the brittle shadows of the frangipani tree' or 'a stream of rich green grass'.
includes references to the wider world as well, such as shadows, sunlight and sky. Nature is clearly important to both the writer and the characters: they live in the countryside and it is important to their daily lives.
Alice sheds a tear as the pigeons fly away
The story contains a number of contrasts, such as the views of the different generations on leaving home.
We also see a contrast between how Lucy and the old man behave: he is much more like a child. In some ways, even Alice behaves in a more mature manner: she does not 'thump' her feet or shout like him.
There are also a lot of comparisons between nature and the characters. The most obvious relates to the pigeons. They act as symbols, so the pigeon at the start is just like Alice: young, the grandfather's favourite and 'pretty', but straining to fly away.
The old man can control the bird by locking it away, but he cannot control Alice. When he releases the pigeon, it is like releasing Alice. Both must move away to make their own way in the world.
Comparisons are also made between their bodies. Alice's legs are like the stems on the tree, while the old man's fingers are 'curling like claws into his palm'. In other words, his fingers are like his pigeons' claws.
Meanwhile, Alice and Steven are 'like puppies on the grass'.
These constant references to nature and comparisons can give the impression that the characters are simply part of nature. They also make us believe it is natural for Alice to want to leave home, just as it is natural for her grandfather to wish her to stay.

They can be used to scan for birth defects in unborn babies and for defects in manufactured equipment. They can also be used to clean delicate equipment without the need to take it apart.
Seismic waves travel through the Earth. There are two types - P waves and S waves. They have different properties and they can give scientists information about the Earth's structure.
Sound waves are longitudinal waves. Their vibrations occur in the same direction as the direction of travel. Sound waves can only travel through a solid, liquid or gas.

comes from a sound with a higher frequency than the one on
. So sounds 2 and 3 are the same volume (loudness), but 3 is higher pitched.
The normal range of human hearing is between about 20Hz and 20kHz, but the range becomes less as we get older. Sounds with frequencies above about 20kHz are called ultrasound.
As we saw on the previous page, ultrasound waves have frequencies above about 20kHz (20,000Hz). This is above the normal hearing range for humans, so we cannot hear ultrasound.
When ultrasound waves reach a boundary between two substances with different densities, they are partly reflected back. The remainder of the ultrasound waves continue to pass through. A detector placed near the source of the ultrasound waves is able to detect the reflected waves. It can measure the time between an ultrasound wave leaving the source and reaching the detector. The further away the boundary, the longer the time between leaving the source and reaching the detector:
distance (metre, m) = speed (metre/second, m/s)  time (second, s)
For example, sound travels through water at about 1,400 m/s. If it takes 0.5 s for a sound to reach a boundary and reflect back to the detector, the total distance travelled is:
The distance to the boundary is half this, which is 350 m.
The distances and times are much smaller of course when scanning babies and in engineering jobs.
3-D ultrasound scan of a human foetus
Computers are able to create detailed images by combining many ultrasound reflection readings. This is used in medicine for pre-natal scanning - checking unborn babies.
Ultrasound can be used in industry for quality control procedures to check manufactured objects, such as railway tracks and oil pipelines, for damage or defects. The diagram shows how a piece of metal may be tested for cracks or other flaws using ultrasound.

S waves cannot pass through the liquid outer core, but P waves can. When P waves pass from solid to liquid, then from liquid to solid, there are sudden changes in direction.

. For instance, when it was first published, the work was a very early example of a
A literary genre within which the main plot is focused upon the development of a romantic relationship between two people. Traditionally the story will have an optimistic ending.
There are many characters in the novel who display one or both of these -
. As you'll see, the two often go together.
It's helpful to define these words in their context. In this book, they mean:
- having too high an opinion of one's own worth or importance.
- making judgements about others which aren't based on fact or experience.
From the beginning, Darcy is shown to be too proud of his own social standing. He looks down on people, especially the Bennets. This is made worse by his natural quietness, which makes him seem even more
Distant and cold in manner, and lacking in interest or concern.
Elizabeth isn't naturally proud in the same sense as Darcy. But when she's slighted by him at the first ball, her pride is hurt. As a result, she compensates by becoming more proud of herself and defensive about her family.
Lady Catherine is incredibly proud, believing it to be the natural order of things that she be praised and obeyed.
Collins' pride changes according to whom he's speaking. In the company of people he believes to be below him socially, he revels in taking the moral high ground and bragging about his standing. With those above him, his pride vanishes and he often humiliates himself.
Without knowing the Bennets - or almost anyone else, for that matter - Darcy seems to form opinions without taking the trouble to get to know them.
Again, prejudice isn't Elizabeth's natural outlook. However, when Darcy offends her, she allows everything to feed the prejudice she develops against him. She's prepared to believe anything bad about him to fuel the impression she wants to create (for instance, Wickham's story).
Mrs Bennet develops a more blatant prejudice against Darcy after his actions at the ball. She acts on this, insulting him within earshot. Her character's lack of depth is shown by her prejudice disappearing when Darcy proposes to Elizabeth.
She's prejudiced against anyone below her in social standing, unless they're prepared to play by her rules (that is, what she says goes). So she's prepared to tolerate Collins, but despises Elizabeth.
Mrs Hurst and Miss Bingley are prejudiced against Jane and Elizabeth. This is mainly out of self-interest. They dislike Jane because they feel she isn't good enough for their brother; they dislike Elizabeth because Darcy likes her and Miss Bingley wants to marry him.
Austen offers a balance to all this pride and prejudice in two ways. Firstly, she creates characters who don't really show either characteristic (for example, Jane, Bingley and Mr Bennet). Secondly, she shows that pride and prejudice can be overcome (Darcy and Elizabeth).

The shape, size and colour are important factors when packaging a product. The marketing department will want to make the packaging attractive and distinctive. Coke's packaging is dominated by red. This helps consumers to recognise a product instantly, when they are in a shop. The same applies to the shape of the packaging. Deodorants and shampoos, for example, come in all shapes and sizes. Remember that the actual product is inside the container, so the packaging and advertising are all that will attract us to try a product in the first place.
Large manufacturers understand the importance of their brand name. Kellogg's, Adidas and Microsoft are all household names which we associate with quality.

Pip is both the hero and narrator of the story, looking back reflectively on the lessons life has taught him. He is critical of the mistakes made by his younger self.
Dickens starts with Pip weeping for his dead family in the churchyard, establishing him as an orphan for whom we feel sorry and protective.
Pip is a good person. He steals a file and food for the convict, but feels guilty about it. He helps Herbert Pocket to get a job. He helps Magwitch, even though it means the end of his dreams of being a gentleman.
Pip's efforts to be a gentleman almost destroy him - he says horrible things to Biddy and is ashamed of Joe. But he maintains our sympathy because he hates himself for it.
Pip's 'training' to be a gentleman was merely learning to eat properly and wear the 'right' clothes - showing that at the time he mistakenly thought that being a 'gentleman' was about surface wealth and manners (when really it was about inner character and worth).
Two things 'save' Pip. Firstly, luck dashes his dreams. Secondly, those who love him stick by him.
In the end, Pip finds happiness in hard work, 'sufficient' income, and doing the decent thing. Pip is an autobiographical projection of Dickens himself. By 1860, Dickens' marriage had failed, and he had worries about his children, and his business. In
he tells us the conclusions of an older, wiser man with experience of setbacks - that happiness is not about being successful, but being good.
In the novel, Magwitch is a father-figure to Pip. (Remember that Dickens' own father was imprisoned.)
Although Magwitch is a convict and 'a fearful man', he is decent enough to take the blame for Pip's theft (which in those days was a hanging offence). This reflects the novel's theme that a real gentleman is not someone who has money and manners, but someone who does good.
In the churchyard where Pip begins his recollections, Magwitch - also an orphan - is first made 'aware of himself' stealing food. It is suggested to us that his poor start in life condemned him to a life as a criminal.
Because Magwitch is a criminal, Pip feels he cannot keep his money, so Magwitch's return means the end of Pip's fortune.
Although he is horrified to meet him at first, Pip comes to love Magwitch as a good and noble man. In the end, he brings the dying Magwitch happiness by telling him Estella is his daughter and that he (Pip) loves her.
Magwitch's story carries the social message of
: that poverty creates crime, and many criminals are decent people who are just unlucky.
is as much Magwitch's story as it is Pip's.
Miss Havisham is a mother-figure to Pip, but taunts and abuses him. (Remember that Dickens disliked his own mother.)
Miss Havisham is a purposefully 'unreal' character. Time has stood still for her: she wears fantastic clothing and looks like a waxwork. Many writers describe
as a 'fairy story', in which Miss Havisham plays the part of Pip's imperfect fairy god-mother.
Miss Havisham also supplies the 'silver fork' element of the novel - stories about rich people that fascinated the poor.
Miss Havisham is a connecting thread for the storyline:
She was swindled by Compeyson, which condemned his partner, Magwitch, to jail.
She adopted Magwitch's daughter, Estella, but encouraged her to break Pip's heart.
Her employment of Pip gives him his yearning to be a gentleman. But she pays for Pip to be apprenticed to a blacksmith, which is the cause of his dissatisfaction.
It is at Satis House that Pip first meets Jaggers, and it is this which leads him to guess, wrongly, that Miss Havisham is his secret
Someone that helps or supports a person or group, usually by offering financial aid.
In Chapter 38, Estella rejects not only Pip's love but also Miss Havisham's, and breaks both of their hearts.
At the end of the novel, Miss Havisham sees she has hurt Pip because she was hurt, and seeks his forgiveness.
In the end, Miss Havisham is consumed by fire (a Christian image of cleansing, as well as punishment).
Although she harms Pip, the reader forgives her because she is clearly psychologically damaged, repents of her actions and dies such a horrific death.
Her name means 'star' - which is associated with beauty and love, yet at the same time is cold, distant and unobtainable. Pip, in his desire to be a gentleman, is 'reaching for the stars', but doomed to fall short.
Perhaps Dickens associated Estella with his teenage, starlet lover Ellen Ternan (the 'ell' of Ellen is picked up in the name Estella). Did this give special vibrancy to his descriptions of Pip's yearning love?
Estella is beautiful and rich, but these are her only qualities. She is otherwise shallow and cruel.
Biddy is the opposite to Estella, who represents the shallowness of money and manners.
tells of how Pip is at first beguiled into wanting Estella, but discovers that Biddy is better.
The reader can forgive Estella because, like Miss Havisham (who trained her to hate men), she too is psychologically damaged. Also, she warns Pip from the start that she has a cold heart and will never love him. Pip's
In the final chapter, after Estella's unhappy marriage to the brutal Bentley Drummle, she tells Pip she has learned good character: ""I have been bent and broken but - I hope - into a better shape.""
On the advice of friends, and to make the book more popular, Dickens rewrote the ending to read: ""'I saw no shadow of another parting from her"" - allowing Pip and Estella to stay together.
Orlick is the irredeemably evil element in
- giving it a Gothic atmosphere of threat and foreboding.
Orlick's favourite phrases are: ""I'll be burned"" and ""I'll be jiggered (meaning 'caught on a sharp hook')"" - conjuring up violent and frightening images.
After Joe (who represents pure good) defeats Orlick in a fair fight, Orlick later creeps back and attacks Mrs Joe from behind (a cowardly and brutal act).
Orlick earns Pip's disgust when he 'dances at' (that is, makes eyes at) Biddy, which frightens her.
Throughout the story, Orlick resents and bullies Pip.
In Chapter 53, he lures Pip to the sluice-house, where he tries to kill him. This chapter is pure Victorian

is cold, ruthless and unfeeling. He washes his hands continually (like Pilate in the Bible) to try to cleanse himself of the bad things he is doing. Dickens' portrayal of Jaggers shows he saw being a lawyer as a dirty business.

teaches Pip how to be a gentleman. His wife Belinda is pretty and should have married 'well', but is an incompetent housekeeper. In Chapters 22-23, Mrs Pocket and her two nurses, Flopson and Millers, introduce some slapstick comedy (mostly at the expense of the poor baby).
At the end of the novel, Pip persuades Miss Havisham to leave her money to the decent Matthew Pocket, rather than her other 'friends', who only want her money.

In Chapter 10, Jekyll writes clearly about the dual nature of human beings. He says that, as a young, educated man from a respectable family, he maintained an appearance of good behaviour at all times. But he says this was a fraud - no one suspected his true nature, which was at times extremely immoral.
Jekyll's experiments began in an attempt to separate the two sides of human nature and destroy the evil one. He discovered that the evil part of his nature was, indeed, part of himself, and therefore, in some sense, natural and part of the whole.

may form a neutron star. However, if enough matter is left behind, it may contract under its own gravity to become extremely dense, with such a strong gravitational field that nothing can escape from it. This includes electromagnetic radiation such as light, so it is called a black hole.
Black hole - formed when a massive star collapses
Black holes cannot be seen, but their effects on the gases from neighbouring stars can be observed. For example, X-rays are emitted when these gases spiral into a black hole.
Some of the observations of the universe, such as the spinning rates of galaxies, cannot easily be explained using our current theories about gravity. Scientists have suggested that the matter we can see  stars, planets and galaxies  are only part of the mass of the universe. They have suggested that most of the mass is actually matter we cannot see, called dark matter.
The existence of dark matter would allow scientists to explain their observations. However, some scientists doubt whether it really exists. They have suggested that our laws of gravity need tweaking to work properly when very large objects and distances are involved.

Penetrative properties of different types of radiation
X-rays are manufactured by an X-ray machine. A hot cathode emits electrons that are attracted to a tungsten anode. When the fast-moving electrons hit the target, most of their kinetic energy is transferred to heat but some is transferred to X-rays.
This machine allows the energy and intensity of the X-rays to be controlled. Gamma rays, on the other hand, are given out by the nucleus of an unstable atom. This process is totally random and so cannot be
In medicine nuclear radiation is used to sterilise hospital equipment, help diagnose a range of medical conditions and treat cancer patients.
Gamma rays are high energy electromagnetic waves which are only stopped by thick lead. This means they can easily pass through medical equipment, such as syringes.
As gamma rays pass through the packaging they will kill living tissue such as viruses and bacteria. As long as the equipment remains in a sealed plastic pack it will remain free of viruses and bacteria.
A radioactive tracer is used to investigate a patients body without the need for invasive surgery. A small amount of radioactive material is put into the patients body and a radiographer puts a detector around the body to detect any gamma rays or beta particles that pass out of the patients body.
The source used is either a beta or gamma emitter and is put into a drink, ingested or injected, depending on which part of the body is being investigated. The radioactive material is given enough time to move around the body before a radiographer positions a detector outside the body which can produce a picture of the patients internal organs.
High-powered gamma rays are used to kill

What might you want to say about the poet's attitude to the
in this poem? Briefly note down some points that you would want to include in your essay, then compare your ideas with those in our sample answer on the next page.
The old woman's day is very regimented. The strong, regular rhythm throughout the poem indicates both the sameness of her days and the monotony of what she has to do.
Her work is very physical. She uses strong, plain-sounding verbs to describe her work: kneel, blow, scrub, bake, sweep, which contrasts to the light, airy verbs applied to the young: lie, dream, sigh.
She uses childish language when she personifies the stars to blink and peep. Maybe this is because the appearance of the stars is a chance for her to relax at last and escape the rigours of her day.
She seems jealous of the young. She compares her life of work to their lives of idleness: the young women with nothing more to fill their days than worry about their ribbons.
Is the old woman mocking the young who have nothing more to complain about than the wind disarranging their hair OR is she quietly regretful, wishing that she has no more to worry about than they do?
It is sad that she has to work because she is old: we wonder what happened to her when she was younger to make hard work a necessity for her now. It is poignant that she does not seem to question her lot.
The last line shows the old woman's real feelings. The fire she refers to is her own life - and it is getting feeble and cold. This suggests that she does not have long left to live: her fire will soon go out.
You will probably not have included all of these points, and will also have some of your own that are not mentioned here! Of course, all the ideas referred to in the
would be useful too. Remember that any point is valid if you can back it up with evidence from the text.

John Clare was born in Northamptonshire in 1793. What little schooling he received ended when he was 11, so he was largely self-taught.
Clare became a hedge-setter and labourer, like his father before him. So he spent most of his day in the open air - many of his poems are about the countryside and seasons.
He began to publish poetry in 1820, aged 27. Clare married Martha Turner in the same year, despite still being in love with his first girlfriend, Mary Joyce.
He was badly affected when he moved from the home of his birth to a village just four miles away, although he continued to publish poetry. Clare became depressed, and was finally admitted to an asylum for the insane in 1837.
He escaped in 1841, and was found on his way home, under the impression that he would meet up with Joyce - whom he believed to be his wife. Clare spent the rest of his life in Northampton General Asylum. He died in 1864.
This Sonnet was written in 1841, but gives no hint of the pressures he might have been under. Clare perhaps wrote it as a release from his everyday troubles.

People also lead busier lives, so they might do more shopping in supermarkets, than traditional shops, and buy more ready-made meals or eat out more, rather than cooking for themselves.
Food developers need to constantly rethink the type of foods that need to be on shop shelves, in order to take account these lifestyle changes. Customers expect to find a wider range of foods, including foreign dishes and food ingredients. There are several reasons for this:

A design procedure is a series of steps which guide you through any electronic design-and-make process. Sticking to the procedure will help deliver a first-class product.
Write down in a few words the purpose of the project
Use graphics, computer software and other techniques to generate design ideas
Select the best design for further development
Once you have defined the purpose of your project, there are two important documents you need to write. These are:
- a short statement of the problem to be solved. The brief should outline the design problem you are tackling, perhaps including one or two of the envisaged design features. Next comes
. This is a longer decument, including full details of the functional and design features of the finished electronic product - as well as information on weight and size, maintenance, cost and safety.
The specification for an electronic product should include electronic factors such as component details, maximum working voltages, maximum currents, and temperature or frequency ranges.
The factors which make a product efficient, safe and comfortable to use are called
. Considerations of style - the things which make a product look and feel good - are called
. You need to consider both ergonomic and aesthetic factors when planning your designs.
When designing circuits, for example, ensure that switches and other control components are placed so that they can be easily reached, and that output components such as LEDs can be easily seen.
A product's style is a more subjective matter, as different people may have different ideas of what looks good. Think about contemporary style, about what is currently fashionable, when designing your product. You may not want to follow the fashion - but you still need to know what it is!
Circuits can be modelled to make sure they work the way you want them to. Circuit modelling can be done either using a computer modelling application, or on a prototype board - also called a
- a board covered with small sockets into which components can be plugged and connected up.
The graphic shows a breadboard with holes connected in two long rows at the top and bottom, and columns of five linked holes elsewhere. Electronic components and wires can be simply plugged into the board in order to make any required circuit connections. The top and bottom rows act as power supply channels for the circuit.

The first step is to draw the circuit on to a
. This is a kind of filter which protects the 'positive' parts of the diagram (the connections between components) and exposes the 'negative' parts (all the rest). The mask is then placed on the board which has a thin coating of copper, and the circuit diagram transferred onto the board using an etch-resist pen. (An alternative technique uses a photosensitive board which is covered by the mask and then exposed to light.) The circuit is then etched onto the board using
in an etching tank; this removes all the unwanted copper, leaving the req uired tracks and pads in place on the board.
NB - this should only be done under a teacher's supervision.
Next, a small PCB drill is used to drill out the center of the pads. Finally the components are pushed through the board and soldered in place.

With the components installed, the board would look like this:
In electronics the main method of joining circuits is soldering. Electrical solder is made from an alloy of 65 percent tin and 35 percent lead. It also has a flux running through its core. The flux is needed to ensure that the solder makes a good joint between the components and the tracks and wires on the PCB.
Evaluation and testing is about making sure that the product stays on track with the design

. You should plan to evaluate and test your project at a number of key stages of design and manufacture. These stages are referred to as
The critical control points for evaluation and testing an electronic product are:
phase. Check that you have used the correct value components, and that the various systems work together. These checks can be done using a computer-simulation package.
a prototype circuit made from a plastic board with holes in which the components are inserted, linked by conductor traces on the underside. Also called a veroboard.
to check whether the circuit works properly. Test each part of the circuit using a
layout. Check that the components are in the correct positions and that you have used the optimum track layout. Make sure that components are located neatly and that joints are well-soldered.
phase. After manufacture, check that the product conforms to its specification. During packaging, check that the product fits securely in the package, and that any conducting parts are insulated.
phase. Look back over the design and making process. Analyse how well it went, noting down any modifications and improvements you would make if you were to do it again. These notes are an important part of your design portfolio.
Make a note of each stage in your design process. If possible, illustrate your notes with digital photographs and/or graphics. Here are some of the things you should include in your notes:
The source of your design ideas and how you adapted these ideas into the intended product.
Your design developments. These should include the circuit designs with annotated notes, circuit diagrams, any computer program simulation work, evidence of bread boarding and testing and the design of your packaging etc.
There are many advantages to using computers in electronics design. They speed up the design process, enabling changes to be made very quickly. They enable circuits and products to be modelled before manufacture. And they make it easy and cheap to store and edit design specifications, and then download them onto machines for manufacturing.

A number of gears connected together are called a
. The input (eg a motor) is connected to the driver gear. The output, (eg the wheel of a buggy) is connected to the driven gear.
The photograph below shows a simple gear train made up of a couple of spur gears. These are the common gears (or cogs) that look like wheels with teeth around the rim. Next to the photo is a diagram showing how you would draw this gear train in an exam.
In the drawing, the centre of each gear is shown by a cross. Each gear is drawn as two circles, one slightly larger than the other to show where the teeth would be. Teeth do not have to be drawn, but the number of teeth is written next to the gear, in this case 60 teeth and 15 teeth. Arrows indicate the direction that the gears are moving. Note that with two connected gears, they will be rotating in opposite directions.
Where there are two gears of different sizes, the smaller gear will rotate faster than the larger gear. The difference between these two speeds is called the
, and can be calculated using the number of teeth. The formula is:
Gear ratio = number or teeth on driven gear  number of teeth on the driver gear
So the gear ratio for the simple gear train above, if the smaller gear is the driver gear, is:
Gear ratio = 60  15 = 4
In other words, the driver gear revolves four times to make the driven gear revolve once.
If you know the gear ratio, and the speed input at the driver gear, you can calculate the speed output at the driven gear using the formula:
Output speed = input speed  gear ratio
So if the gear ratio is 4 and the driver gear is revolving at 200
= revolutions per minute, a measure of speed of rotation
output speed = 200  4 = 50 rpm

This means that you will not be told what to say on your role play card - often there will be a symbol such as '!' in place of an instruction. Here you will have to respond to something that the examiner has just said.
One way that you can prepare for the unexpected is to think through how you might deal with situations where you have asked for something that it is not available. For example, think about what you might say in reply to statements such as:

Highest common factor and lowest common multiple
We can use prime factors to find the highest common factor (HCF) and lowest common multiple (LCM).
Here are the list of prime factors of 24 and 36:
24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3
36 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3
If we write down the numbers that are the same in both lists, they will give us the highest common factor of 24 and 36:
HCF of 24 and 36 is 2 x 2 x 3 = 12
To find the lowest common multiple, we need to think about which list has the most of each factor.
24 = (2 x 2 x 2) x (3)
36 = (2 x 2) x (3 x 3)
24 has the most 2s. (it has three 2s). And 36 has the most 3s (it has two 3s).
So the LCM of 24 and 36 is (2 x 2 x 2) x (3 x 3) = 72.
Find the HCF and LCM of 90 and 175.
90 = 2 x 3 x 3 x 5
175 = 5 x 5 x 7
To find the LCM we group the prime factors using brackets.
90 = (2) x (3 x 3) x (5)
175 = (5 x 5) x (7)
LCM = 2 x (3 x 3) x (5 x 5) x 7 = 3150

2737,"Methane and carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases. They absorb heat energy and prevent it escaping into space. This keeps the Earth warmer than it would be without these gases. Remember that the Moon and the Earth are the same distance from the Sun. The Moon has no atmosphere and has an average surface temperature of 18C, while the Earth has an average surface temperature of 14C. So you can see that greenhouse gases are not a bad thing in themselves, but too much of them in the atmosphere leads to global warming.
Rice paddy fields produce methane gas, and so do cattle. As the numbers of rice fields and cattle have increased, so has the amount of methane in the atmosphere.
Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.
. You may wish to check your understanding of this by looking at the chemistry section on
When land is cleared for timber and farms, there are fewer trees to perform the important task of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by photosynthesis. In addition, if the fallen trees are burned or left to rot, additional carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. These factors are particularly important in tropical areas, where forests might be cleared to make way for cattle farms. Then, not only are there fewer trees left to absorb carbon dioxide, but the graphburning trees release carbon dioxide and the cattle release methane.
As the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has increased, so too has the average global temperature. This is what scientists mean when they talk of global warming.
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen at a higher rate since the 19th century
The temperature of the earth has risen over the years
An increase of only a few degrees will cause changes to the Earths climate, and lead to sea levels rising.

Tone can also be shown by using patterns of lines, dots, shading, reflections and highlights. It is also possible to obtain sheets of dry transfer material to represent different tones.
There are a number of ways of showing on paper the texture of materials used to make a product. These are intended to give an impression of the material, rather than represent it exactly. Some examples include drawing the grain on pieces of wood or drawing lines at angles to show reflected light on clear glass or plastics. Textures can be represented in shades of grey or colour.

Mixing primary and secondary colours together creates tertiary colours. These are dark browns, greens and greys.
The colour wheel illustrates how the colours relate to each other.
The colours next to each other harmonise (go together). Use harmonising colours to make elements of a design look related to each other.
Colours that are on opposite sides of the wheel contrast with each other (they are 'complementary' colours). Use contrasting colours to make elements of a design stand out from each other.

Nails come in different shapes and sizes. Nails are much cheaper than screws and quick to put in. You do not need to drill holes in the wood first, except sometimes when using hard wood or to prevent the wood splitting.
When using wood glue, make sure you:
Get the surfaces to be glued to fit well - no gaps!
Don't put any finish on the surfaces to be glued.
Get everything ready before you start - glue, brush, damp cloth, clamps and blocks to protect your work.

Earthquakes can destroy settlements and kill many people. Aftershocks can cause even more damage to an area. It is possible to classify the impacts of an earthquake, by taking the following factors into account:
economic impacts (the impact on the wealth of an area)
environmental impacts (the impact on the landscape)
People may be killed or injured. Homes may be destroyed. Transport and communication links may be disrupted. Water pipes may burst and water supplies may be contaminated.
Shops and business may be destroyed. Looting may take place. The damage to transport and communication links can make trade difficult.
The built landscape may be destroyed. Fires can spread due to gas pipe explosions. Fires can damage areas of woodland. Landslides may occur. Tsunamis may cause flooding in coastal areas.
Disease may spread. People may have to be re-housed, sometimes in refugee camps.
The cost of rebuilding a settlement is high. Investment in the area may be focused only on repairing the damage caused by the earthquake. Income could be lost.
Important natural and human landmarks may be lost.
Effects are often classified as primary and secondary impacts. Primary effects occur as a direct result of the ground shaking, eg buildings collapsing. Secondary effects occur as a result of the primary effects, eg tsunamis or fires due to ruptured gas mains.

She creates installation pieces in porcelain and stoneware that often blur dreams and reality.
The symbolic signs of dreams are astonishingly general. A lot of people recognise their own dreams when they see my work.
She views her role as an artist as being similar to that of a set designer in that
she engages the viewer to enter the artwork and become part of it
. The installations are often on a large scale and incorporate movement, noise and light.
My desire is to give the viewer an impression of life; the encounter between what is beautiful and horrible, the beauty and destructiveness of love, and the fact that we are immortal until we die.
When I was about to start working on my Master of Fine Art project I had an intense dream. In this dream I was looking at the exhibition of all the MFA students' art projects. The artwork that was most interesting was a long corridor covered with tentacles.
The impression of walking through it was pleasant and at the same time disgusting as the tentacles reached out almost touching your body. When I woke up I realized that the corridor should become my MFA artwork.
The feeling of it, the size, material colour and expression was so real and clear in the dream all that was left for me to do was to make it.
When creating the corridor artwork I tried to stay as close to the dream as possible. So the shape of the tiles had to be organic and skin like. The corridor bent round in my dream so I built walls to reflect this, the corridor had to be the same scale and shape as what I had seen in my dream. Since the material of the tentacles was porcelain in the dream I made several moulds of plaster and then poured porcelain clay in to them. I made around 400 tentacle tiles to create this installation.
The greatest source of inspiration for me is just to keep working. One project leads to another like a chain of happenings. One artwork inspires me to a new one.
My two children give me inspiration in the way that they help me see the building stones in life and how people develop from the very beginning. To see a little person explore life is very interesting and you learn a lot about yourself and humanity.
Other sources of inspiration are my friends around me and the long discussions about everything. Love and death are also really important.
Other artists that have influenced me in no particular order include Eva Hesse, Louise Borgouise, Gerhard Richter, Matthew Barney, Damien Hirst, Paul McCarthy, Mona Hatoum, among others.
For me it is really simple: I can't do anything else. If I could do something else I would choose that. I think that to be an artist, living off what you create, you have to be a special kind of a person. It is not enough that you are talented. You have to be really intense in the creating process. The wish to create has to be stronger than all other wishes.

Power stations produce electricity at 25,000V. Electricity is sent through the National Grid cables at 400,000V, 275,000V and 132,000V.
Step-up transformers are used at power stations to produce the very high voltages needed to transmit electricity through the National Grid power lines.

6258,"All religions teach the difference between good and evil, but have different beliefs about evil and suffering.
Religion has a great deal to say about 'good' and 'evil'. Religious leaders and sacred texts all encourage believers to live 'good' lives. The problem of evil and suffering is one of the commonest reasons people give for not believing in God.
- suffering caused by events that have nothing to do with humans, and which are to do with the way the world is, eg, natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, floods or earthquakes
- suffering caused by humans acting in a way that is considered morally wrong eg, bullying, murder, rape, theft or terrorism
Human evil and natural evil can often work together, with human evil making natural evil worse  or better! For example, the suffering caused by an earthquake or floods can be made worse by people looting, but it can be made more bearable by people showing compassion and making personal sacrifices to help those who are suffering.
It is important to remember that: 'evil' is a cause of suffering; 'suffering' is a result of evil.
What does Christianity teach about good and evil?
 the ability to choose between right and wrong for themselves. God has shown people how they should live (eg the Ten Commandments (a list of religious and moral rules that were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai); Jesus life and teaching), but it is up to them to decide whether or not to follow Gods instructions.

Hitler's actions helped him to consolidate his power - it is more about the effects of what he did. The table below describes how certain events that happened between 1933 and 1934 gave Hitler the opportunity to consolidate power.
Hitler used the fire to his advantage in two ways:
It gave him an opportunity to imprison many communist leaders, which stopped them campaigning during the election.
It allowed the Nazis to say that the country was in danger from the communists during its election campaign.
Both these actions helped the Nazis to
When the courts convicted Dutch Communist van der Lubbe, but did not convict other Communist leaders, Hitler was furious and replaced the courts with the Nazi People's Courts.
Although it did not give the Nazis the majority that Hitler had hoped for in the Reichstag, it gave them enough seats - after Hitler had arrested all the communist deputies and the other parties had been intimidated by the SA - to get the Enabling Act passed, which is all Hitler needed to do.
Arguably the critical event - it gave Hitler

within the Nazi Party. It gave power to the brutal SS. It also showed the rest of the world what a tyrant Hitler was.
Many historians believe that Nazi Germany only appeared to be a dictatorship. In fact, officials were left to make most of the decisions themselves, and the Nazi government was badly-organised, and chaotic.
It is important to note that in 1934, the army was not subject to Hitler's authority. At this point, he still needed the army's support, which is why he destroyed the SA in the Night of the Long Knives.
In 1938, army leaders hoped Hitler's plan to conquer the Sudetenland would fail and give them an opportunity to

Different products are targeted at children and the over 60s
The population can be divided by age in years (eg 0-16, 17-25) or by the stage of life reached (eg schoolchild, teenager). For example, a pensioner will have similar needs to those of other pensioners but different needs from those of a teenager.
Products can be targeted at men or women
Products may be targeted at a specific gender group. For instance, cosmetics have been traditionally targeted at women while DIY has been targeted at men.

For example, there are magazines and newspapers in many different languages and Halal butchers in areas with large Muslim populations.

Products can be aimed at a lifestyle group
People are grouped according to the way they lead their lives and the attitudes they share. For example, young professionals may drive a sports car because of the image they want to project. Married parents might want the same things, but have to provide for their children, which is a large extra cost. They will need a family car to suit their lifestyle.

Direct contact means that the disease-causing microbe is passed from one person to another when their bodies touch in some way.

A common use for diodes is rectification - that is, the changing of alternating current into direct current. (An alternating current (AC) is one which flows alternately in opposite directions around a circuit, while a direct current (DC) is one that always flows in one direction only.)
A rectifying circuit can be found in the transformers used with many types of equipment that require a mains alternating current to be converted into a smaller direct current - eg electronic keyboards or mobile phone chargers.
The circuit diagrams show the two methods of rectification.
A light-emitting diode or LED is a special kind of diode that glows when electricity passes through it. The LED is made from a semi-conducting material called gallium arsenide phosphide. LEDs can be bought in a range of colours. In common with all diodes, the LED will only allow current to pass in one direction. The current required to power an LED is usually 25 mA.
A seven-segment LED is a special type of LED display used in digital clocks, video recorders and microwave ovens.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
Romeo and his friends have left the Capulets' party. Romeo has run away from his friends. Mercutio has been shouting rude jokes because he thinks that Romeo has gone off with Rosaline. Mercutio and Benvolio finally give up looking for him and go home.
The second set extract begins with Romeo hiding from Mercutio and Benvolio in Juliet's garden. Romeo thinks to himself that Mercutio can never understand how he feels because he has never been in love.
""He jests at scars that never felt a wound""
He watches Juliet as she stands on her balcony thinking out loud. He thinks that she is like the sun
Romeo uses lots of words and images that relate to light when he describes Juliet.: 'sun', 'stars' 'brightness'.
and that the moon is jealous of her because she is so beautiful. He says that her eyes are like two stars that are so bright that they would stop night-time from being dark if they were in heaven, and the birds would sing because they would think that night was day.
Romeo uses more words and images to do with light to describe Juliet.
He idolises her and compares her to an angel.
When Romeo says that Juliet is like an angel from heaven, on the one hand, he is saying how lovely she is. On the other hand, you could say that he doesn't really see her as a flesh and blood person. He idolises her. Do you believe that he can really love her when he doesn't actually know anything about her? Or do you believe in love at first sight?
Juliet, not realising that Romeo is hiding in her garden, imagines what she would say to Romeo if he were there. She says out loud that she wishes he wasn't a Montague, but says that it doesn't really matter because she loves him anyway, and hopes that he loves her. After all, a name is just a word; it doesn't really mean that much.
If we used another word for a rose instead of the word 'rose', eg 'poo', the rose would still be a rose, it wouldn't smell like poo just because we used that word. In the same way, Romeo is still lovely even though his name is Montague.
When Juliet is thinking these things aloud on her balcony, she doesn't know that anyone else is watching. Have you ever practiced saying something to someone, even though you know that you would never be brave enough to say it?
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet
When Romeo replies, Juliet nearly jumps out of her skin.
""My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself""
When Romeo calls her 'dear saint', Juliet realizes who he is. Romeo called her 'dear saint' at the party.
Juliet is very worried for Romeo's safety; he is a Montague on Capulet property. Romeo uses very poetic and exaggerated language to describe how he managed to climb over the walls.
Romeo has been quite brave and perhaps foolish to break into Juliet's garden. He likes to takes risks and doesn't think clearly about the seriousness of his actions. He uses poetic language to exaggerate his bravery.
He declares that he'd rather die than live never having the opportunity to love Juliet.
Juliet admits that she is embarrassed that Romeo heard the things that she was saying about him. She asks him if he loves her too, but she doesn't give him the chance to answer.
Juliet is worried that she has shown herself to be too keen on Romeo. In Shakespeare's day, nice girls weren't supposed to show that they were interested in boys.
Juliet's speech is very long! Is she nervous or embarrassed? Is she a chatterbox? Is she so excited about her new love that she can't stop talking about it?
Romeo begins to use poetic language about the moon to describe how much he loves her, but Juliet won't let him finish.
Time - Juliet won't let Romeo finish his sentences! Poor Romeo! We already know how much he loves to speak! Juliet's mind is working very quickly. She is excited, but also worried about how suddenly they have fallen in love.
She says that if he swears by the moon, he might turn out to be just as changeable as the moon (the moon changes its shape throughout the month).
She worries that they have fallen in love so quickly.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.
She tries to say goodnight, but she is excited and passionate about her feelings for Romeo and can't seem to stop talking about it.
""My bounty is as boundless as the sea.
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite""
Juliet's use of imagery seems more heartfelt than Romeo's: her love is as deep as the sea, and the sea never runs out. That's passion!
Juliet's Nurse shouts to her from inside the house. Juliet asks Romeo to wait. As she goes into her bedroom, Romeo thinks to himself that their love seems like a dream.
Love - Is this true love? How could it have happened so quickly? Do you believe in 'love at first sight'? Remember, that same evening that he met and fell in love with Juliet, Romeo was moping about saying that he would never love anyone as much as he loved Rosaline! Romeo might argue though that he didn't really know what true love was until he met Juliet.
Juliet comes back out onto the balcony and tells Romeo that if he is serious about her, she will send a messenger out to him tomorrow to find out where and what time they will get married!
Time - events happen very quickly in this play. In less than a week, Romeo and Juliet fall in love, get married and die.
She says goodnight to him as her Nurse impatiently tells her to come inside.
Romeo finds it hard to say goodnight to her.
Romeo said that he was in love with Rosaline in the first extract. Less than a day later, he claims to be in love with Juliet. Has he really thought about the consequences of marrying Juliet. Perhaps, when you are in love, nothing else matters. What do you think?

128,"> Inform, explain and describe - Explaining
When you explain, you don't just write information - you also need to give
. In very basic terms you can think of the difference between informing and explaining in terms of answering a slightly different set of questions:
Explain = What? When? Who? Where? How? Why?
This difference is reflected in the question you will be asked, so our question about the leaflet might look a little different now:
Write a leaflet for both the pupils and their parents, outlining some of the main features of school life in Year 7 and beyond. In particular, explain why pupils have several teachers each day and why the detention system is used.
This is a little harder than the earlier version, but it's still about your school. Therefore, you still need lots of information about the classes, the organisation and the timetable. So you could still use our two basic approaches, timelines and topic centres, like this:
However, you can also put these together, like this:
Now, we can see a number of topics, so perhaps the three big circles represent registration, lesson times and detentions. They occur in that order each day, but the reasons for them are very different. So the smaller circles answer how and why as well as what, when and who. For instance, what are detentions? When do they take place? Who is in charge of them? How do pupils get put in detention? Why does the school use detentions?
This approach gives your answer a very clear structure. The writing deals with a number of subjects in turn and each subject should be in its own paragraph. You can add details and explanations as you write out each paragraph. It makes it easier for you to write and easier for your audience to read or listen to.

One way of finding out whether you have been over-charged is to estimate what the total amount should be. Round the different prices into easier numbers - 9.99 is approximately 10, 1.49 is approximately 1.50 and 8.99 is approximately 9 - and you can do the calculation quickly in your head.
10 + 1.50 + 9 = 20.50
This is almost 3 less than the cashier asked for, so obviously you have been over-charged.

If we put a capital letter at the beginning of the clause we've used, and a full stop at the end, we have a sentence.
. A simple sentence consists of one clause that has a subject and a verb. A simple sentence puts across one simple idea.
A complex sentence is used to put across more
ideas. A complex sentence contains one main clause that can make sense on its own, and one or more minor clauses that are linked to it.
The main clause is the 'big dog barked' because it has a subject and a verb and makes sense by itself.
The minor clause is 'When I arrived'. Although it is a clause with a subject and a verb, it doesn't make sense on its own, it needs a main clause.
We can add more minor clauses to make a more complex sentence.
We can even split the main clause with a minor clause and still have a complex sentence.

Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts
A salt is always made when an acid is neutralised by a base. But the exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used.

the first part comes from the metal in the base used
the second part comes from the acid that was used

These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt:
How can we make copper sulfate? The first part of the name is 'copper', so we need a base containing copper. We could use copper oxide or copper carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'sulfate', so we need to use sulfuric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
copper sulfate + water + carbon dioixde
How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
sodium chloride + water + carbon dioxide
It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced.

The Tempest second key extract - Characters
If you get a question about characters in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with the answer.
Question: What do we learn about Miranda in the two extracts?
In the two Key Extracts we learn that Miranda is young and inexperienced, but not necessarily weak. She has a pure heart and sees the best in Ferdinand and even defends Prospero. In the First Key Extract she must do what her father says, even though his behaviour is questionable. In the Second Key Extract, she knows her own mind and goes behind her father's back (or thinks she has) to ask Ferdinand to be her husband.
Miranda can be read as a strong female character. Even though Prospero is a controlling father, Miranda shows from the beginning of the extract that she is beginning to test his power over her.
She relies on her own judgement and questions her father's actions. She stands up for Ferdinand against her father and is on the receiving end of Prospero's ugly temper. She replies with dignity and even tries to excuse her father's bad behaviour to Ferdinand. However, throughout the first extract, she is being unwittingly manipulated by Prospero.
In the second extract she openly defies her father (although it is part of Prospero's plan that she does this). She demonstrates that she is Ferdinand's equal by offering to share his workload. She claims that she is not worthy of him, but then shows her independence by proposing marriage.
Miranda pleads with Prospero to see the best in Ferdinand, but perhaps her father, who is more experienced, is wise to test Ferdinand's love for his daughter. Miranda is open about her feelings for Ferdinand, but in doing so believes that she is betraying her father's wishes. Miranda is sometimes weak and sometimes strong. She is a complex character.
Throughout the two extracts we see Miranda's growing independence. The truth is, however, that although she thinks she is rebelling against her father by following her own heart, her actions are part of Prospero's plans.

Q2. Amelia spends 80 in the local supermarket, correct to the nearest 10. What is the greatest and least amount that Amelia could have spent?
The number of children in the school has been rounded to the nearest 100 to give 800.
The smallest number that rounds to 800 is 750.
The largest number that rounds to 800 is 849.
So, the smallest possible number of children in the school is 750, and the largest possible number of children is 849.
Note: 850 is exactly halfway between 800 and 900, but 850 rounds up to give 900, so we use 849.
The smallest number that rounds to 80 is 75.
The largest number that rounds to 80 is 84.99.
Remember that 85 is halfway between 80 and 90, but 85 rounds up to 90, so we must go for the smallest possible unit less than 85 (in this case a penny less), which is 84.99.

Decimals - Place value and ordering decimals
We use a decimal point to separate units from parts of a whole (like tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc).
0.1 is a tenth, 1/10 of a unit
0.01 is a hundredth, 1/100 of a unit
0.001 is a thousandth. 1/1000 of a unit
In 52.13, the value of the figure 1 is 1/10 , and the value of the figure 3 is 3/100.
When ordering numbers, always compare the left digits first.
Eg Which is greater, 2.301 or 2.32?
Both numbers have two units and three tenths, but 2.301 has no hundredths, whereas 2.32 has two hundredths. Therefore, 2.32 is greater than 2.301.
Another way to look at it is to add a zero to the end of 2.32 (this doesn't change its value as it's after the decimal point).
The two numbers are now 2.320 and 2.301 and it is quite easy to see that 2.320 is bigger (just as 2 320 is bigger than 2 301).
Q1. In the number 3.546, what is the value of the figure 4?
Q2. Place the following numbers in order, smallest first: 3.2, 3.197, 3.02, 3.19
A1. The value of the figure 4 is 4/100.
A2. Did you get 3.02, 3.19, 3.197, 3.2?
All the numbers have three units, so start by comparing the tenths. 3.02 has no tenths, 3.197 and 3.19 have one tenth, and 3.2 has two tenths. Therefore, 3.02 is the smallest and 3.2 is the largest.
You could also write the numbers as 3.020, 3.190, 3.197 and 3.200 and compare them.

Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.
For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.
By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.
You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:
Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:
In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:
To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:
Divide both sides by 2, to give:
a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7
b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7
When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers.
For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7.
7 + 5 does equal 12, so your answer is correct.

Diet, drugs and health - Digestion and enzymes
Our teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. Enzymes are needed so that this break-down happens quickly enough to be useful.
Take care - enzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients:
. Carbohydrase enzymes break down starch into sugars.
The saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough, the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet.

Prospero is a controlling character who seems to be obsessed with power and status. Ferdinand is a prince, but he has no status on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero pretends not to believe that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne of Naples and insists on taking him prisoner. He calls him a ""spy"", a ""traitor"", and an ""impostor"". He accuses him of lying. He threatens to ""manacle"" him and starve him. He uses his magic powers to prevent Ferdinand from defending himself. He also has control over Ariel and even talks about how his daughter will have ""control"" over Ferdinand when he falls in love with her.
Prospero is only pretending to be cruel and unwelcoming to Ferdinand as part of his plan, but it seems as though he is enjoying himself in the process. Even Miranda is alarmed at his behaviour.

Ray, the main character in this extract, has stolen a motorbike and caused an accident that killed someone. He has told nobody, but knows that he can't hide for much longer. He is about to get on a bus, but realises that the one person who can link him to the crime is the conductor of that very bus. Before he can run off, he bumps into Mrs Fitzroy, his best friend's mum.
Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. Write one paragraph for each bullet point.
He hung back, groping wildly for some excuse to prevent him getting on, but the bell rang and the engine increased its impatient rumble and his legs carried him upwards on to the platform, and he felt Mrs Fitzroy clamber on behind. The bus began to move. He turned towards the stairs, but she caught hold of his arm.
""Let's go downstairs. I don't like the smoke."" Again he felt her hand guide him, and he ducked his head and began to walk along the aisle. ""Yeah"".
""This'll do,"" she said, and he turned back and sat beside her - the less fuss he made, the less obvious he was, the better. As he settled, he kept his face bent low, aware of the conductor walking towards them. He brushed past, and, noticing things with a total clarity, Ray saw the dark blue uniform that he was wearing and noted the heaviness and thickness of the material. He heard him clumping up the stairs, and he wondered, absurdly, if he was wearing heavy boots, too.
Mrs Fitzroy was opening the bag which she had on her lap, and Ray felt in his pocket for his fare. If he had the right change, he could just hand it to the conductor without looking up. Yes, he had a ten and two pence piece. He glanced at Mrs Fitzroy and saw to his dismay that she was taking out a pound-note from her purse. That would mean a delay while she got her change - plenty of chance for him to be recognised. Could he offer to pay her fare? It would seem strange, but anything was better than being seen.
What kind of atmosphere does the writer create in this extract and how do they do it?
Ray's thoughts and actions as he gets on the bus
how the writer uses language to create the atmosphere.
In this text, the writer creates an atmosphere of fear and tension. Ray's thoughts and actions at the start of the passage show that he is under a lot of pressure. He tries to think of an excuse to 'prevent him getting on' the bus, but knows that this will just make Mrs Fitzroy suspicious. When he tries to go upstairs, she insists they stay downstairs. Nothing seems to be going his way, and this leads us to believe he may well be spotted by the conductor.
As the conductor approaches, Ray's fears increase which creates more tension. He keeps his face 'bent low' to avoid being recognised, and also notices things 'with a total clarity'. This shows that he is very scared and alert, ready for something to go wrong. When he realises Mrs Fitzroy has no change, he feels 'dismay'. The reader is kept on the edge of their seat waiting for the conductor to come along.
The writer uses language, as well as events, to create tension. The phrase 'groping wildly for some excuse' shows Ray's panic and gives the impression that he feels he has no control over events. The way he notices the 'heaviness' of the conductor's uniform, and wonders if he was 'wearing heavy boots as well' might mean that he is afraid of the man. Ray asks himself 'Could he offer to pay her fare?'. This shows he is tense; he is running through possibilities in his mind. The writer uses Ray's fears to create an atmosphere of tension for the reader.

Human height is an example of continuous variation. Height ranges from that of the shortest person in the world to that of the tallest person. Any height is possible between these values. So it is continuous variation.
For any species a characteristic that changes gradually over a range of values shows continuous variation. Examples of such characteristics are:
If you record the heights of a group of people and draw a graph of your results, it usually looks something like this:
The more people you measure, and the smaller the categories you use, the closer the results will be to the curved line. This shape of graph is typical of a feature with continuous variation. Weight and foot length would give graphs similar in shape to this.
Human blood group is an example of discontinuous variation. There are only 4 types of blood group. There are no other possibilities and there are no values in between. So this is discontinuous variation.

396,"> Writer's tricks - Persuading the reader
Some persuasive texts aim simply at persuading us to do something, particularly charity leaflets, holiday brochures and adverts. Others may try in more subtle ways; newspaper and magazine articles may try to persuade us to agree with a certain view.
Try to convince us to do or agree with something, such as spending money or agreeing with a certain belief.
Contain a mixture of fact and opinion.
Emphasise key points by using subheadings, repetition, memorable phrases and emotive language.
Often use a personal style so that the text seems to speak directly to the reader.
Show clear links between points, such as ""if you donate 20 you will be helping a sick animal"" or ""using our deodorant will attract women"".
Stories can also be persuasive as well. A writer may want you to like or dislike a character. The way that they describe a character can persuade you to do either of these. Look at this extract from 'Jane Eyre':
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at the table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye with flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mamma had taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate health'.
How does Charlotte Bront try to persuade, or convince, us that John Reed is an unpleasant character in this paragraph?
She makes him sound unattractive, with his ""dingy and unwholesome skin"" and ""heavy limbs"".
She suggests that he is greedy as he ""gorged himself habitually at the table"". She suggests that this is why he is so unhealthy, so that we don't feel sorry for him.
She makes him sound spoilt because his mother is keeping him home from school, even though his so-called ""delicate health"" is his own fault.

Use the TAP technique for the question below. It will help if you read the question through several times and slowly to digest the content.
The following article has appeared in your local paper:
Ashfield Park is threatened with closure next month as a local business has applied for planning permission to turn the area into a car park. Local residents have begun a fierce campaign to save the park, which is a popular walking spot for young children and the elderly, as well as home to the War Memorial and many wildlife species.
Write to your local paper, arguing that the park should be preserved.
Have a think - what is the TAP? When you have your answer, check it with ours by pressing the 'Check ideas' button.
- it's to argue and persuade. This means you want to influence other people and tell them what you think is right
There are lots of ways of planning - some of them are fancy, some of them are simple, but the most important thing is to write your ideas down. If you don't, you could easily forget them.
Let's have a go at using the question about the park. The simplest plan is just to write down a list of all the points. Look again at the question, think of a list, then compare yours to ours.
If you are writing an argument, and we are in this question, we can make two lists - one is the positive side - which supports your view, the other is the negative side - which goes against your view. Have a go, then compare your lists with ours.

Stanley didn't have many friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.
What does this extract show us about the main character?
Stanley is another big male, but it is clear that the writer wants us to react differently to him than we did to Jim Wellings in the earlier extract.
Stanley is a lonely boy, because he ""didn't have many friends at home"". He is bullied and teased, even by adults. The fact that the teacher causes him ""embarrassment"" by showing him up in front of the class proves that he feels uncomfortable about his weight.

Another top style tip is to avoid being boring. It sounds obvious, but many writers put in far too much information. In fact, some even write most of the question out again when they start their answer. So what should you do?
At the beginning, don't waffle, get straight to the point. Don't just repeat things in your conclusion. Put yourself in the reader's shoes - which of these two starts to a school magazine article do you prefer?
Do you know someone who is being bullied right now? Don't know what to do? Well we decided to send Stuart Smith (Year 8) around the school to find out just how bad bullying is, and to come up with some ideas about what we can do to stop it.
Bullying is when people are cruel to other people. It can be hurting them, like kicking them, or hurting them using horrible names. It could be other things too. My article for the school magazine is about bullying. I am going to start by saying what the problem of bullying is and then...
The first one is much better - it gets straight to the point and you want to read on. The second version repeats parts of the question, but for no reason. People who are reading the school magazine don't have to be reminded in each article that it is the school magazine. We also know the article is about bullying from the first sentence, but Stuart's definition is poor and the whole article is slow to get started.
You've got tone and style. Work it!

Complete the following table. The data shows the scores in two tests, English and Maths, across a set of ten students.
In order to see this content you need to have both
If you were to compare the scores in the two subjects, English and Maths, which measure of average would you use and why?
The range of scores in English (37) is far greater than that in the Maths (4).
The mean score in each subject is 78 which implies that the scores of the students are more-or-less identical in English and Maths. But looking at the actual scores, you can see that this is not the case.
If you compare the medians (71 and 78), you might assume that the students generally scored less in English, (which is partly true, but there are also some much higher scores there too).
If you just state the modal score for each subject (101 and 78), you have no information about the scores of the other students.
So, which is best? It seems that to give maximum information,
a combination of the median and the range would be best.
So, in summary, English has a median score of 71 and a range of 37, and Maths has a median score of 78 and a range of 4.

Drawing pins make good use of pressure
Drawing pins have a large round end for you to push. The round end has a large area, so it applies a low pressure to your thumb. The sharp end has a very small area. The same pushing force produces a high pressure there, so it pushes into the notice board.
If you swing round on one leg of a chair, you put four times as much pressure on one point of the floor as you do if you sit properly. This is because four chair legs spread the pressure over four times more area than one chair leg can.

There's much more to acting than just reading a script out loud. If you're nervous, it's tempting to read the lines really quickly, using the same tone of voice all the way through, but this isn't very interesting for your audience.
Try to think of the punctuation as musical notes telling you when to pause for a breath (or for dramatic effect!). Don't be tempted to take a little break at the end of each line - the piece might not make sense.
To understand this, first read the script below, pausing at the end of each line. Then try again using the punctuation as your guide for when to pause.
Juliet is waiting for the nurse to come home and tell her whether the wedding with Romeo is still on. Time is ticking and she's pretty fed up.
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.

She would be as swift in motion as a ball:
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
But old folks, many feign as they were dead -

When talking about language, the things to concentrate on are:
Whether there might be another meaning behind the first most obvious one
The example below is about the language of love. Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on Romeo's descriptions of love.
Love is an excellent subject for poets. Romeo enjoys using lots of different poetic devices to explore the idea of love.
The idea of love seems to be making Romeo's brain ache. He comes up with a list of oxymorons (pairs of opposite words eg 'loving hate') to try and find the right definition of love. He makes up some vivid metaphors for love, but comes closer with his descriptions to lust. He thinks love is a kind of madness or even a poison. He thinks that he loves Rosaline. He compares her to a Roman goddess and complains that Cupid keeps missing her heart with his arrows. He focuses on her beauty and talks about his problems getting her to love him back as though it is a kind of battle.
At this point in the play, Romeo doesn't seem to understand what true love is. It is possible that he has got some of his romantic ideas from stories. He likes talking about love, but some of his opinions don't sound very loving. We never meet Rosaline in the play, but you may think to yourself that she is wise not to encourage Romeo's advances. They don't sound respectful or honourable. In fact, it could be argued that Romeo's ideas about love are funny or silly, and show him up to be immature and shallow.

The second half of the writing focuses on the points in favour of the healthier options. Again, if you want any further information, click the check ideas button to see our comments.
However, this evidence does not show the whole picture. Many students say they would prefer to see more choice in the canteen. They point out that eating jacket potatoes every day is boring, and that the cold fillings are inadequate in winter. It has been suggested that more sandwiches, salads and a bigger range of hot main meals would be much more appealing. Many of these students currently bring their own food to school simply because they feel there is so little choice. These numbers include Grange High's many vegetarians.
Now the writer moves on to the views in favour of healthy food. The impersonal tone is maintained in the first sentence. The formal connective 'However' is used to signal a change in the argument. The writer returns to the facts - jacket potatoes are the only healthy option - and suggests some alternatives. She builds on the evidence mentioned earlier. She is building up towards her conclusion now.
Nevertheless, it remains true that junk food is popular and easy to produce. If students start going off site they may get injured or into trouble, and the school could be held responsible. Therefore, it seems impractical to ban junk food altogether. But is there another answer? I believe there is: the canteen could offer a wider selection, including healthier options, for one term, and see whether it is successful. If it is, and we see more students using the canteen and eating the healthy options, the canteen could make this change permanent.
This detailed paragraph begins to suggest the solution. Formal connectives are used ('nevertheless' and 'therefore') to signal that the argument is coming to an end. She returns to a personal expression, 'I believe there is...' because she is summing up her findings.
In conclusion, the solution seems clear: if a good selection of food is provided then everyone will be happy - and the canteen will almost certainly gain more customers. Thank you for your time.
The final paragraph is short and direct. It sums up the main conclusion of the speech in a positive way: 'everyone will be happy' and 'the canteen will almost certainly gain...' which leaves the audience with a clear picture of her final point of view. Rather than trying to persuade people one way or the other, the speech has tried to suggest a solution where everyone gains. This isn't always possible, but it can be a helpful way of concluding without sitting on the fence and telling the audience to make up their own minds. As you can probably guess, this is an excellent answer.

Taking part in drama doesn't always involve learning lines from scripts - often you'll be asked to improvise. Usually you will work in groups or pairs to devise a piece of drama from your own imagination. You'll need to be able to think on your feet and become a different character.
This might sound difficult, but you've probably improvised before without realising it - in games you used to play as a child. If you've ever played pirates, nurses or superheroes when you were younger, you were improvising - although don't think running around your classroom with a tablecloth for a cape pretending to be Superman will impress your drama teacher - it probably won't!
As with any English work, you need to think about your audience when you devise drama. Your drama needs to entertain them and keep their attention. Your drama also needs to be believable - your audience is likely to become disconnected if your story or characters are too far fetched.
The story of your drama begins with your character. Ask yourself: what does my character feel, think and react?
Here are two ideas for a character:
You are a journalist who has uncovered a story that will have big consequences and you're about to tell the world. Would your character be confident or scared?
You are a global superstar - singer, actor and producer - and paparazzi follow your every move. You live a glamorous and privileged life, but what are the secrets behind the smiles?
When you have decided on your character, you need to create a scene.
Here are some ideas for a scene based on the characters above. Can you think of any more?
You're about to appear on the most popular morning TV programme and expose your discovery when you suddenly receive a startling phone call. Who is on the phone? What do they say? How do they make you feel?
You've landed a part in a popular soap but you don't get on with the other actors. Should you tell the press the truth or pretend that you all get along?
You've been working late in the library just double checking a few facts for your article when you notice a menacing looking man watching you. Does your character panic or keep calm? Do they run or confront the man? Maybe they are being paranoid?
The press have published some false rumours about you and you're really upset. Your agent has secured a slot on a popular chat show to give your side of the story. Do you accept the offer or decide to lie low? How do you feel?
Your article has been published and has been a massive hit. You're receiving job offers from high profile newspapers and magazines and your life is about to change for the better. How do your family react? What do you decide to do?
You've found out that one of the other band members is planning to leave the group and go solo. You confront them - can you persuade them to stay, or would it be better for everyone if they left?
When you have a rough idea of your character and scene, you can think about what your character might say. If you're given time to prepare you should write a short script. If working in pairs or a group, you could improvise the scene first to get more ideas.
You may be allowed to use props to make your scene more realistic and interesting. Only use a prop if it is relevant, otherwise it could end up distracting you and your audience. If you decide to use props and costumes, always practice with them first.

as they orbit the Sun. It takes the Earth 24 hours to make one complete turn on its axis, so an Earth day is 24 hours long.
Different planets take different amounts of time to make one complete turn, so they have different lengths of day.
The Sun lights up one half of the Earth, and the other half is in shadow. As the Earth spins we move from shadow to light and back to shadow and so on. It is daytime in the UK when our part of the planet is in the lit by the Sun. And it is night-time in the UK when our part of the planet is facing away from the Sun.
During the day, the Sun appears to move through the sky. Remember that this happens because the Earth is spinning on its axis. In the UK if we look south and follow the path of Sun in the sky during the day, it looks like this:
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west
. That's because the Earth is spinning towards to the east, so we see the Sun first appear there at the start of the day. The Sun 'rises' in the east and 'sets' in the west.
One way to remember which way the Earth turns is to remember ""
"", which means the Earth spins from west to east.
Star trails made by leaving the camera shutter open during the night
During the night, we cannot see the Sun. But the Earth is still spinning on its axis. This means that the stars appear to move from east to west in the sky, just as the Sun does in the day.

The different substances in mixtures are usually easily separated from one another. The method you use depends upon the type of mixture you have.
This is good for separating dissolved substances that have different colours, such as inks and plant dyes. It works because some of the coloured substances dissolve in the liquid better than others, so they travel further up the paper.

Sand, for example, can be separated from a mixture of sand and water using filtration. That's because sand does not dissolve in water.

For example copper sulfate crystals can be separated from copper sulfate solution using evaporation. Remember that it is the water that evaporates away, not the solution.

For example, pedigree dogs come in lots of different varieties, called breeds of dog. They may be different colours and sizes, but they are all still dogs. They are all still the same species. Different varieties of dog have been produced by selective breeding.
Suppose you wanted a variety of cow that produced a lot of milk. This is what you could do:
choose or select the cows in your herd that produce the most milk
select the offspring that produce the most milk
keep repeating the process of selection and breeding until you achieve your goal.
The key here is to identify the feature you want, and only breed from the individuals that have that feature. Here are some examples of what selective breeding can produce:

Before this scene, Prospero and his slave, Caliban have exchanged cross words.
The First Key Extract begins with Ferdinand hearing Ariel's song.
Ariel's song calms the stormy waters. In 'The Tempest', music is linked closely to magic and illusion.
He wonders where the sounds are coming from.
Illusion - Ferdinand does not know where the sound is coming from. He assumes that it is magic and tells us that the music not only calmed the storm, but also made him feel better.
He follows the sound, and when the song begins again, it suggests to Ferdinand that his father has drowned.
When Miranda sees Ferdinand approaching, she can't believe her eyes. She doesn't think that Ferdinand is real.
Illusion - Ferdinand is a living human being, but Miranda is convinced that he is a magical creature. In 'The Tempest', things are never quite as they at first seem.
Prospero explains that he is a man, not a spirit and that he is looking for other survivors of the shipwreck. Prospero feels excited that Miranda and Ferdinand seem to like each other: it was his plan all along
Power - Prospero claims that he has used magic to make Miranda and Ferdinand fall in love. Prospero likes to control and manipulate people through his magic.
, and he promises to reward Ariel with his freedom for helping to get them together.
Ferdinand asks Miranda if she is an ordinary girl or a goddess.
Miranda can't believe that Ferdinand is an ordinary mortal. She thinks he's a 'spirit'. She calls him 'divine' and 'noble'. Ferdinand refers to her as a 'goddess'. The language they use suggests that they worship one another.
He is shocked when she speaks his language. When he hints that he is the King of Naples, Prospero challenges him.
Prospero likes to be in control. As soon as Ferdinand suggests that he has any sort of power, Prospero tries to undermine him. Prospero's questions are sarcastic and mocking in his attempt to show Ferdinand who is boss.
Ferdinand sadly explains that he believes that his father, the King of Naples, has drowned in the shipwreck along with the Duke of Milan and his son. Prospero watches Ferdinand and thinks to himself that he will be able to manipulate him easily now that Ferdinand is in love with his daughter.
Think carefully about what kind of man Prospero is. Is he a caring father who will do anything to get the best for his daughter? Is he manipulative and controlling? Love is a powerful emotion. Should people use love to control others?
Miranda can't understand why her father is being so abrupt with Ferdinand. She has fallen in love at first sight with Ferdinand.
Love - Miranda admits that she has feelings for Ferdinand. It is the first time she has ever felt this way. Do you think that she would have fallen in love with Ferdinand even without Prospero's magic?
She wishes that her father could see things from her point of view.
When Ferdinand offers to make Miranda his queen, Prospero steps in. He is worried that his plan won't work if Ferdinand wins Miranda's heart too easily.
Prospero says: 'But this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning/Make the prize light'. He means that he can't let Ferdinand think that it was too easy to get Miranda to be his girlfriend, because he might not treat her well if it's really easy to make her love him.
He says that Ferdinand is lying about being a king and accuses him of being a spy.
Power/ Illusion - Prospero wants to manipulate Ferdinand. He will make him suffer and work hard for Miranda's love. When Ferdinand claims to have some power of his own as the heir to the throne, Prospero takes this power away by accusing him of being a spy and taking him prisoner. Prospero knows that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne. 'The Tempest' is all about the confusion between what is true and real, and what is illusion.
Miranda tries to speak up for him
You might think that Miranda is brave to speak up for Ferdinand. Apart from being a powerful magician, Prospero has quite a temper! Her speech also shows us how innocent she is. She can't believe that anyone who looks so lovely on the outside can be anything other than lovely on the inside. In 'The Tempest', Shakespeare shows us that things are not always as they first seem.
but Prospero tells her off and threatens to imprison Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Ferdinand a 'traitor'. He threatens to 'manacle' his neck and give him sea water to drink and acorn shells to eat. Prospero doesn't mean any of these threats, but in making them he shows that he has power over Ferdinand and could make him a slave just as he made Caliban his slave. Throughout the extract, Prospero uses words like 'usurp', 'traitor' and 'impostor' which all seem a bit strong when referring to Ferdinand. When Antonio took Prospero's place as Duke of Milan, he did 'usurp' him, and in doing so, he was a 'traitor' and in calling himself the Duke of Milan, Antonio is an 'imposter'.
When Ferdinand draws his sword, Prospero uses magic to make it impossible for Ferdinand to move.
Miranda tries desperately to stop her father but he won't listen. Ferdinand comes to the conclusion that all his problems - his father's death, the shipwreck, Prospero's threats - mean nothing, as long as he can see Miranda once a day, even if he is in prison.
Love/ Illusion - Ferdinand suddenly doesn't mind being Prospero's prisoner, as long as he has Miranda to love. He says it's all like a 'dream'. Does love have that kind of dream-like power to overcome difficulties? Or is it another one of Prospero's spells?
Prospero is pleased that his plan to make Ferdinand fall in love with Miranda has worked. He praises Ariel
Love/ Illusion - When Prospero tells Ariel that he has done well, this suggests that Miranda and Ferdinand's attraction towards one another is not true love, but a magic trick, an illusion, that Ariel has conjured.
Prospero promises Ariel that he will be free
Freedom and Slavery - Just as Prospero has made Caliban a slave and threatened to imprison Ferdinand, he has the power to set Ariel free. When Prospero arrived on the island, Ariel was trapped in a pine tree and Prospero set him free, so he has a debt of gratitude towards him. Also, Ariel is gentle whereas Prospero has a temper. It could be that Ariel is a little afraid of his master.

Living things produce waste materials, such as urine and faeces. Humans produce these, too, but they also produce other waste materials. These materials can pollute the environment. They include:
Rubbish is taken to a landfill site
Rubbish does not vanish when it is thrown away. A lot of it is buried in
sites. These may be disused quarries or rough ground that cannot be used for farming or housing. When landfill sites are full of rubbish, they are covered in soil and planted with trees and bushes.
rubbish is important because fewer landfill sites are needed, and the materials in the rubbish are re-used.
Fertilisers are chemicals used by farmers to help their crops grow well. Rain can wash fertilizers off the fields and into rivers. This causes water plants to overgrow and block out the light. Other plants die as a result. They use up oxygen as they rot away, and fish and other animals suffocate. This process is called eutrophication.

It sounds weird, but you can show that you are a good listener by talking! The trick is to know what to say and when to say it.
Good listeners show that they are listening by:
Making eye contact with the person that is talking to them
Using facial expressions to show that they understand or are reacting to what is said
Allowing the person who is speaking finish before they respond
Repeating, in their own words, what the person has said to show that they understand
Referring back to comments that have already been made

In a fight, right, who do you think would win -
(Interrupts) Shut up, Abdul! I'm trying to concentrate.
There's four of them. They'd take him down. Knock him cold.
So you're saying that Tinky Winky and Laa-Laa have a violent streak?
No, but if they had to, if they were forced - them against him - the Teletubbies would have it, any day of the week.
Because it would be four against one?
Yeah, the Teletubbies are a team. Bob's a Larry.
We'd better be quiet. We're annoying her.
Choose the statement that is most true:
Emily is the best listener, because she says the least and she's just trying to get on with her work
Matt shows that he is listening because he asks questions to make sure that he understands what Abdul really means, and he is sensitive towards Emily's feelings.
None of them are good listeners and anyway, they shouldn't be chatting in class.

Universal indicator has many different colour changes, from red for strong acids to dark purple for strong bases. In the middle, neutral pH 7 is indicated by green.

The key to presenting the perfect speech is preparation and practice. World leaders don't just stand up and make up a speech on the spot - they carefully prepare beforehand. They even employ people to write their speeches, although remember, this is not an option at school!

a) The house was built in 1975. It was a typical semi-detached, but it did have quite an impressive front door. Most of the windows were double glazed and the garden was quite neat.
b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.
There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.
So you need to think about TAP (text, audience and purpose) and make a good start to your writing. You should try to 'set a context', which is like setting the scene. So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on.
a) The subject I am going to write about today is why the local park should not be closed.
b) Have you ever stopped to wonder how many hundreds of people make regular use of our Memorial Park?
a) It is unlikely that newspaper readers who enjoy all the things that our park has to offer will want it to disappear forever under tons of concrete.
b) 'Ashfield Park will be ruined,' claim protestors who held a meeting last night to organise opposition to the council's plans for a car park.
It should be clear that the ""b"" versions are better - they fit the style and show that the writer has used TAP to make their writing work. Remember - you need to make it interesting right from the start.

Gravity only becomes noticeable when there is a really massive object like a moon, planet or star. We are pulled down towards the ground because of gravity. The gravitational force pulls in the direction towards the centre of the Earth.
""Down"" is towards the centre of the Earth, wherever you are on the planet
Weight is a force caused by gravity. The weight of an object is the

Weight is a force, so it's measured in

The mass of an object stays the same wherever it is, but its weight can change. This happens if the object goes somewhere where gravity is stronger, or weaker, such as the Moon.
The Moon has less mass than the Earth, so its gravity is less than the Earth's gravity. This means that objects weigh less on the Moon than they do on the Earth.
The Moon's gravity is one sixth of the Earth's gravity. A 120 kg astronaut weighs 1200 N on Earth. On the Moon they would weigh only 200 N. The astronaut's

Writer's tricks - The effect on the reader
You will now be very familiar with the idea that every text is intended to affect its readers in some way.
Every reader is, of course, different too, and sometimes a text will affect you in ways a writer didn't imagine, or you might notice depth in it that others won't. This is particularly true if the text matches your personal experience. A story about your home town might interest you more than one about somewhere else, or a text about smoking might affect you more if you know somebody who is trying to give it up.
Remember, you get marks for noticing the intended effect on the reader. Even if something doesn't interest, horrify, amuse or persuade you, you need to spot what the writer meant to do. It's usually better not to mention your personal opinion unless you are asked to.

""The eyes were the worst. It was not my imagination. They were in truth like the eyes of a dead man, not blind, but staring, unfocused, unseeing. The whole face, for that matter, was bad enough. It was vacant, as if there was nothing behind it. It seemed not only expressionless, but incapable of expression. I had seen so much previously in Haiti that was outside the ordinary normal experience that for the flash of a second I had a sickening, almost panicky lapse in which I thought, or rather felt, ""Great God, maybe this stuff really is true..."".
This is how William Seabrook described his encounter with one of the most horrifying creatures ever to step from the realms of the supernatural. For Seabrook was face-to-face with a zombie - a walking corpse. And in that moment he was prepared to believe all that he had heard about zombies since he first arrived on the island of Haiti.
The zombie's fate is even worse than that of a vampire or werewolf. The vampire returns to his loved ones. He may be recognised and laid to rest. The werewolf may be wounded and regain human form. But the zombie is a mindless automaton (robot), doomed to live out a twilight existence of brutish toil (animal-like labour). A zombie can eat, move, hear, even speak, but he has no memory of his past or knowledge of his present condition. He may pass by his own home or gaze into the eyes of his loved ones without a glimmer of recognition.
Neither ghost nor person, the zombie is said to be trapped, possibly forever, in that ""misty zone that divides life from death"". For while the vampire is the living dead, the zombie is merely the walking dead - a body without soul or mind raised from the grave and given a semblance (appearance) of life through sorcery. He is the creature of the sorcerer, who uses him as a slave or hires him out - usually to walk on the land.
From 'The Book of Great Mysteries' edited by Colin Wilson and Christopher Evans.

Q2. What is the effect of the two short sentences which open the extract?
Q3. In the third sentence, why does the speaker use a list of three adjectives to describe the zombie's eyes?

A1. They did this to make the whole text sound more believable, and to add lively detail to the factual section which follows it.
A3. They help the reader to build up a picture of the zombie, making the writing more dramatic.
A4. He had seen 'so much previously in Haiti that was outside normal experience' that he thought it might be a real zombie.
A5. The words which tell us he didn't really believe this are: 'for a flash of a second', 'panicky lapse' and 'maybe'.
A6. The writer uses the phrase 'one of the most horrifying creatures ever to step from the realms of the supernatural'. You might also have picked out the phrase 'walking corpse'.
A7. Zombies are compared to vampires and werewolves.
A8. The zombie's fate is worse because it can't think, it can't return to human form, it is doomed to slave labour and it has no memory of its home or loved ones.

Each number in a number pattern is called a term. So in the number pattern 2, 6, 10 ... the first term is 2, the second term is 6 and the third term is 10.
Write down the rule and the next two terms in the number pattern: 2, 4, 8,... Then check your answer.
The rule is 'multiply by 2' and the next 2 terms are 16 and 32.
Look at how patterns change from one term to another. See what rule gets you from the 1st term to the 2nd term, then check the same rule gets you from the 2nd term to the 3rd term.

Food chains - Getting carbon dioxide, light and water
Remember that the equation for photosynthesis is:
carbon dioxide + water (+ light energy)
Let's see how plants get the carbon dioxide and water they need for this process.
Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves. The carbon dioxide
through small holes in the underside of the leaf called stomata. (One of these holes is called a stoma. The plural is stomata.)
The lower part of the leaf has loose-fitting cells, to allow carbon dioxide to reach the other cells in the leaf. This also allow the oxygen produced in photosynthesis to leave the leaf easily.
A leaf usually has a large surface area, so that it can absorb a lot of light. Its top surface is protected from water loss, disease and weather damage by a waxy layer.
The upper part of the leaf is where the light falls, and it contains a type of cell called a
. This is adapted to absorb a lot of light. It has lots of chloroplasts and is shaped like a tall box.
Turgid plant that's watered regularly and a flacid plant without enough water.
Plants get the water they need for photosynthesis through their roots.
The roots have a type of cell called a root hair cell - these project out from the root into the soil. Roots have a big surface area and thin walls, which allow water to pass into them easily.
Note that root cells do not contain chloroplasts, as they are normally in the dark and cannot photosynthesise.
The water absorbed by the root hair cells passes through the plant in
tubes, and eventually reachers the leaves. If a plant does not absorb enough water, it will wilt or go floppy. Without water it may also not photosynthesise quickly enough, and it may die.

On their way to see Prospero, to kill him, Caliban and Stephano discuss horrible ways of murdering him. Ariel overhears them and makes them go in the wrong direction, with soothing, magical music.
In another part of the island, King Alonso and his companions sit down to rest. Prospero and Ariel cause the spirits of the island to prepare them a wonderful banquet. But at their first taste, Ariel appears to them. He accuses the ""three men of sin"" (Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian - plotters all) of their crimes. They are warned that they will suffer a nasty death unless they are truly sorry and live a ""clear life"" in the future. Only Alonso will admit what he has done.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The party
Romeo and his friends decide to gate-crash the party. Romeo has a bad feeling about the outcome of this evening, but decides to let fate take its course.
Capulet is having a great time at his party. People are dancing. Romeo and his friends arrive wearing masks. Romeo spots Juliet. He thinks to himself that he didn't really know what true beauty was until he saw her. He doesn't know that she is a Capulet. Tybalt recognises Romeo from his voice and threatens to kill him because he is a Montague, but Capulet stops him. Romeo and Juliet flirt and finally kiss. The Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet and he is dismayed. He leaves with Benvolio. Juliet is distraught when the Nurse tells her who Romeo is.
The Chorus recaps events for us: Romeo has forgotten Rosaline and is now in love with Juliet. Juliet feels the same way.
Romeo runs away from his friends. Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline.
Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom. Juliet doesn't know that he is there at first and, talking to herself, declares her love for him. She is shocked and embarrassed when he replies. They have only met that evening, but they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and what time their wedding will be! They find it difficult to part.
Romeo goes to see Friar Lawrence, the priest, who is worried that he has spent the night with Rosaline. When Romeo says that he wants to marry Juliet, Friar Lawrence tells him off for falling in love so easily, but agrees to the wedding because he thinks that it might be a solution to the rift between the Capulets and the Montagues.

Where should this music be? I'the air or the earth?
It sounds no more; and, sure, it waits upon
Some god o'the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the King my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air. Thence I have followed it 
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
(Song) Full fathom five thy father lies 
Those are pearls that were his eyes.
(Chorus of spirit voices) Ding dong 
(ARIEL and spirit voices) Ding dong bell.
The ditty does remember my drowned father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.

Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
No, wench: it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wreck  and, but hes something stained
With grief (thats beautys canker), thou mightst call him
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,
As my soul prompts it. (To ARIEL) Spirit, fine spirit! Ill free thee
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island 
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here. My prime request,
Which I do last pronounce, is  O, you wonder! 
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me 
And that he does I weep. Myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes, neer since at ebb, beheld
And his more braver daughter could control thee,
If now twere fit to dot. At the first sight
Ill set thee free for this. (To FERDINAND) A word, good sir.
I fear you have done yourself some wrong. A word.
Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Is the third man that eer I saw  the first
That eer I sighed for. Pity move my father
(Aside) They are both in eithers powers. But this swift business
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light. (To FERDINAND) One word more: I charge thee
That thou attend me. Thou dost here usurp
The name thou owst not  and hast put thyself
Upon this island as a spy, to win it
Theres nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
Good things will strive to dwell witht.
(To MIRANDA) Speak not you for him; hes a traitor. (To FERDINAND) Come!
Ill manacle thy neck and feet together.
Sea-water shalt thou drink: thy food shall be
The fresh-brook mussels, withered roots, and husks
He draws his sword but is prevented from moving by
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
My foot my tutor? (To FERDINAND) Put thy sword up, traitor 
Who makst a show, but darst not strike, thy conscience
Is so possessed with guilt. Come from thy ward 
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
Thou thinkst there is no more such shapes as he,
Having seen but him and Caliban. Foolish wench!
To the most of men this is a Caliban,
Are then most humble. I have no ambition
Thy nerves are in their infancy again,
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.

The wreck of all my friends, nor this mans threats,
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
Might I but through my prison once a day
Behold this maid. All corners else othe earth
Let liberty make use of: space enough
(Aside) It works. (To FERDINAND) Come on.

Decimals - Multiplying a decimal by a whole number
Multiplying a decimal by a whole number is the same as multiplying two whole numbers. Remember:
If there is one digit after the decimal point in the question, there will be one digit after the decimal point in the answer.
If there are two digits after the decimal point in the question, there will be two digits after the decimal point in the answer.
a) There were two digits after the decimal point in the question (4 and 3), so you must have two digits after the decimal point in the answer.
b) There was one digit after the decimal point in the question, so you must have one digit after the decimal point in the answer. The answer is therefore 12.0, but this can then be given as 12.
Check that you have a sensible answer by finding an approximate solution.
In the above example you were asked to calculate 2.4  5.
2  5 = 10, so you are looking for an answer which is slightly bigger than 10. So an answer of 12 seems sensible.

Ariel tells Prospero what has happened to the ship and its passengers and crew. He tells how he appeared on the ship as a flame (he is after all a magic spirit), and frightened the passengers so much that they had jumped in to the sea. Only the crew remained on the ship.
Prospero wants to be sure that the crew and the passengers are safe. Ariel tells him how he saw to it that the passengers were washed up on the island in separate groups. He made sure the ship was safe, and that the crew were sleeping peacefully. He had sent the rest of the fleet back to Naples, with everyone believing that their king's ship had been sunk, and its passengers drowned.
Ariel now changes the subject, and says he's getting impatient. He reminds Prospero there is a time limit on how long he had to be Prospero's servant, after his release from Sycorax's spell. Ariel wants his freedom, and reminds Prospero that he's been a good servant.

Prospero, in reply, reminds Ariel of the horror he was released from. He tells him that he needs him to work for two more days and then he will be free. Prospero sends him off to keep watch over the washed-up passengers.
As Ariel leaves, Prospero wakes Miranda and tells her that they are going to see Caliban. This doesn't please Miranda, who refers to Caliban as a ""villain"" that she does not ""love to look on"". It is clear, too, from the names he calls him, that Prospero has not forgiven Caliban for an attack he once made on his daughter.

 But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
Be not her maid, since she is envious:
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
 It is my lady!  O, it is my love!
She speaks  yet she says nothing. What of that?
Her eye discourses. I will answer it.
 I am too bold. Tis not to me she speaks.
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night!
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
O speak again, bright angel!  For thou art
As glorious to this night, being oer my head,
As is a wingd messenger of heaven
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name 
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love
And Ill no longer be a Capulet.
(Aside)Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
Whats Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
Whats in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet.
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name 
And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Call me but love, and Ill be new-baptized.
What man art thou, that thus bescreened in night
I know not how to tell thee who I am.
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of thy tongues uttering, yet I know the sound.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
How camst thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb 
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls,
For stony limits cannot hold love out 
And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet
And I am proof against their enmity.
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
I have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes.
And but thou love me, let them find me here.
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogud, wanting of thy love.
By whose direction foundst thou out this place?
By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot, yet wert thou as far
As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Fain would I dwell on form  fain, fain deny
What I have spoke.  But farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay 
And I will take thy word. Yet if thou swearst
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers perjuries
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
Or if thou think I am too quickly won,
Ill frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo  but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light.
But trust me, gentleman, Ill prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheardst, ere I was ware,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discoverd.
Lady, by yonder blessd moon I vow,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops 
O swear not by the moon, th inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract tonight.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden 
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.
This bud of love, by summers ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Th exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it 
And yet I would it were to give again.
Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
But to be frank and give it thee again:
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
is heard calling from inside the house.
I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
 Anon, good Nurse!  Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little: I will come again.
O blessd, blessd night! I am afeard,
Being in night, all this but a dream,
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow
By one that Ill procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite 
And all my fortunes at thy foot Ill lay,
And follow thee, my lord, throughout the world.
I come! Anon!  But if thou meanst not well,
 To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!

But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

. Think of a playground see-saw. The pivot is the thing in the middle of it. When no-one is on the see-saw it is level, but it tips up if someone gets onto one end. Turning forces around a pivot are called
It is possible to balance the see-saw again if someone else gets onto the other end and sits in the correct place. This is because the turning forces are balanced. We say the moments are equal and opposite.
, we need to know two things:
the distance from the pivot that the force is applied.
This is the equation for working out a moment:
Imagine that a force of 10 N acted on a see-saw 2 m from the pivot. This is how we would work out the moment:
Notice that the unit of moment is
(newton metre). Don't get confused with a 'newton meter', which is another name for a forcemeter.
Here is an example of balanced moments. 10N at 2m from the pivot is balancing 20N at 1m from the pivot. The objects create moments of 20Nm that are equal and opposite, so the see-saw is balanced.
A see-saw will balance if the moments on each side of the pivot are equal. This is why you might have to adjust your position on a see-saw if you are a different weight from the person on the other end.
If a nut is difficult to undo with a short spanner, a longer spanner will help. This is because there will be a bigger moment on the nut, when the same force is applied further from the pivot.
Using the same principle you can increase the moment applied by a lever or a crowbar, and this can help you move heavy objects more easily.

None of them had ever touched a live snake.
They were waiting for the drama to begin.
The attendant took a green snake out of a basket.
He draped the snake around the teacher's neck.
She did not have a chance to protest.
He stepped back to admire the sight.

Her eyes faced the lighted exit. I saw her fear.

So the key points to remember about sentences are:
You should have a variety of sentences in each piece you write.
Complex sentences cause the most problems, but they can be the best for linking ideas and arguing your point.

154,"> Inform, explain and describe - Describing
When you describe, you need to give lots of detail and make the words interesting for others to read. For example, if you wanted to describe your home, you wouldn't just write lots of facts, like this:
My house was built in 1972 of red brick with a pitched concrete tiled roof. The house was extended in 2003 with a small UPVC conservatory and an adjoining patio area of approximately 8 square metres...
This gives lots of facts, but these are the types of facts that someone buying a house might need. Most people would find a description like this boring. So what should you do?
The first thing is to think about what you want to show other people. Do you want to concentrate on the roof tiles or the types of bricks used? Or do you want to tell them about the fence panel your brother broke when he was chasing you last summer?
You could also write about the time Stephanie threw a tennis ball and it got stuck in the guttering - it's still there - and when it rains really hard the gutter overflows. You might even have a gnome in the front garden, which your grandad bought - it looks stupid, but you won't move it in case you offend him.
Each of these details is far more interesting than roof tiles or measurements. So, when you are describing something, think of drawing a picture or taking a photograph. You focus on a certain point, write a paragraph about it, then move to the next point and the next.

Take a look at the final paragraph of the article about boxing.
In conclusion, both sides of the debate have solid foundations. As has been shown, the arguments for and against have been put forward since boxing began. And, it would seem, the argument will continue for at least the foreseeable future, as compromise seems unlikely. Both sides do agree, however, that the debate is better held whilst boxing is licensed and controlled rather than unlicensed and uncontrolled. The latter would make it, in my opinion, neither sport nor spectacle.
As you can see, the writer clearly signals that the end is approaching by using the connecting phrase ""In conclusion"". It maintains the impersonal approach it set out with by stating that the argument will continue and that ""compromise seems unlikely"". The last sentence is a statement of the writer's own opinion, but this doesn't alter the fact that it is, or has been, a discursive text.
So, when answering how effective the beginning or ending of a text is, here's a quick checklist you might find helpful:

Formal and informal writing - Informal writing
Writing is informal when it reads as though someone is chatting to the reader. In the right situation, it makes your writing seem more friendly and natural.
Which of the following would you NOT write using informal language?
b) An essay about a Shakespeare play
c) A talk aimed at students your own age or younger
e) A story written from the point of view of a character (in the first person)
b) An essay should always be written using formal language. All of the other situations would suit a more informal style.
Tips to make your informal writing more effective
""Dear reader, I'm really glad you've found the time to open this letter.""
2. It's okay sometimes to use the kind of words that are more usual in speech than writing:
""You don't have to put up with bullying. We'll stick together and make it stop.""
3. Contractions sound more natural in certain types of writing eg a talk to fellow students:
""It's good to know that we're all going to work together on this.""
Don't baffle your reader with too much slang.
Think carefully about structure - informal writing is different to speech and needs carefully planned paragraphs to keep it clear and easy to read.
Sometimes there is opportunity to break the rules of Standard English and use English in unexpected ways. Two good examples of writers who achieve this are poet Benjamin Zephaniah and writer Andrea Levy in her book Small Island.
If you're asked to write a story, it would be a mistake for you as the author to use incorrect grammar and slang - but inside speech marks, your characters can!

The Tempest first key extract - Performance
When you talk about the performance of a play, you should think about how people in the audience feel as they watch it. For instance, the beginning of the first extract is magical and romantic. The tone changes in the middle to one of conflict.
Prospero has lots of asides (thoughts spoken aloud) in the first extract. His role in this scene is made more complex because his character is pretending to be something he is not. The director has to decide whether he wants us to see Prospero as a good father who wants the best for his daughter or a manipulative control freak.
Prospero also speaks to Ariel who is invisible to the other characters on the stage.
When Ariel appears, the director must decide how to present the 'illusion'. Ariel is invisible to the other characters. But it does not necessarily follow that he must be invisible to the audience, too. Try to imagine as many interesting and unusual ways to present Ariel - the 'invisible' sprite - as you can.
When you write about performance, you need to mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:
The characters and how you respond to them
The language used - the detail about freedom and slavery, for example
The issues and ideas - like love, magic and power

Most habitats do not stay the same all the time.

change from hot weather in the summer to cold weather in the winter
change from long hours of daylight in the summer to shorter days in the winter

Let's look at two examples of how organisms are adapted to such changes.
If you have ever been to the seaside and looked for creatures in rock pools, you are likely to have seen lots of limpets on the rocks.
When the tide is in, limpets move over sea-covered rocks, scraping off tiny bits of seaweed. When the tide goes out, limpets clamp themselves very tightly against the newly exposed rock.

The snowshoe hare lives in Canada and other parts of North America.

No particles are involved in radiation, unlike conduction and convection. This means that thermal energy transfer by radiation can even work in space, but conduction and convection cannot.
Radiation is how we can feel the heat of the Sun, even though it is millions of kilometres away in space.
Infrared cameras give images even in the dark, because they are detecting heat, not visible light.

271,"> Preparing, planning and checking - Punctuation
The most important thing with punctuation is to make sure your sentences are correctly marked at the start and end:
The starts are easy; they should all have capital letters.
The endings have full stops (or the equivalent, such as question marks). However, endings cannot have commas. Commas are only used inside sentences, never right at the end of one.
One quick way to check is to read your work to yourself (it doesn't have to be aloud). If you 'run out of breath' or need to pause in your reading to add emphasis, ask yourself whether a comma or a full stop is needed. If so, put one in.
Other areas which often cause problems are:
If you have included the actual words that somebody speaks, make sure you put them inside speech marks. Remember to close the speech marks as well as open them!
Always use question marks when writing a question whether it is direct or rhetorical. Look out for rhetorical questions in persuasive texts eg ""How long will it be until all our countryside is destroyed?"". Writers use rhetorical questions to emphasise a point and they do not expect the reader to genuinely answer the question.
Be careful when using exclamation marks as overusing them can spoil a text. They should be used only to show excitement, surprise, shock or humour eg ""Stop the car!"" she yelled.
To show when a letter has been missed out:
Remember: ask your teacher for some advice if you feel unsure about any aspect of punctuation.

Scientists can tag sharks to study their behaviour.
Animals can signal to each other. For example, they may call to each other to warn of danger. Some scientists are interested in such signals. They record and study them to try to work out what the signals mean.
Some animals migrate over large distances to find food or nesting sites.
Animals can be tagged by attaching tracking devices to them. Tagging lets scientists follow the journeys the animals make.

Ariel brings Ferdinand (the King's son) to Prospero's cave. Ferdinand thinks he's the only survivor from the shipwreck. Miranda, who has seen no other man but her father during her time on the island, sees Ferdinand and thinks he must be a spirit - while Ferdinand thinks Miranda is a goddess. The two young people fall in love, but Prospero is not pleased, and makes Ferdinand his prisoner.
On another part of the island we discover one of the groups of shipwreck survivors. They begin to wake up. They're surprised that their clothes seem fresh and new.
Ariel's magical song puts them to sleep again - all except Sebastian (the King's brother) and Antonio (Prospero's brother). Antonio convinces Sebastian that they should kill the King (Alonso) so that Sebastian can take his place. Fortunately everyone else wakes up again, before they can carry out their plan.
Elsewhere on the island, Trinculo, a jester who was on board the ship, comes across Caliban. Trinculo's drunken friend Stephano turns up, and gives Caliban strong alcohol. This makes Caliban believe that Stephano is more powerful than Prospero (who Caliban hates).
Meanwhile, Ariel, who has made himself invisible, watches the three drunken clowns. He causes havoc by whispering the accusation ""thou liest"" in Caliban's ear, then Stephano's. They become confused and fight.
Caliban reveals his plans to destroy Prospero and take over the island. Stephano drunkenly agrees. Caliban is delighted that Stephano has agreed to his plan and they sing to celebrate. Ariel plays a tune to accompany their singing which frightens both Trinculo and Stephano.
Caliban tells them not to be afraid in a moving speech that describes the beauty and magic of the island. Stephano, Trinculo and Caliban follow the sound of the music.

The extract below is from a leaflet about passive smoking.
. Passive smoking is breathing in other people's tobacco smoke. Other people's tobacco smoke is sometimes called environmental tobacco smoke.
. Only 15% of the smoke from a cigarette is inhaled by the smoker - the rest goes into the surrounding air and other people can breathe it in. Breathing air which contains tobacco smoke can be bad for your health. This is because the tiny particles and gases in tobacco smoke contain over 4000 chemicals, many of which are harmful - at least 60 are known to cause cancer. The gases also contain carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas that comes out of car exhausts.
Q. What is the effect on my health?

Q5. Give one reason why you think this.
Q6. Look at the second answer that the writer has given in the leaflet: the one beginning ""Only 15% of the smoke..."". Explain two ways in which the writer has used language to persuade the reader that passive smoking is dangerous.
Q7. Why has the writer phrased each heading as a question?
Q8. Explain two ways in which the writer has used layout to make the text more effective.
A1. Passive smoking is 'breathing in other people's tobacco smoke'.
A2. 15% is inhaled by the smoker.
A3. Coughing. (You could name any of the effects listed in the bullet points.)
A4. The target audience could be teenagers, or a broad audience. It is the reason that you give in the next answer that is more important.
A5. Reasons are: the language used is quite simple; sentences are mainly quite short and simple, many only contain one or two ideas; the information is broken up into short sections; the headings make the information easy to follow. All these would make the text accessible for many readers, including young people.
A6. There are three main ways: the simple statement that it is 'bad for your health'; the fact that tobacco smoke contains 'over 4000 chemicals', many of which are harmful; the mention of carbon monoxide which is 'poisonous'.
A7. The headings are phrased as questions to draw the reader into the text.
A8. Layout has been used in several different ways: the 'Q' and 'A' format is eyecatching; the short paragraphs are easy to follow; the bullet points at the end of the extract make the facts easy to read.

Unfortunately, when it gets into the food chain mercury damages the

Tiny plankton in the sea absorb the mercury compounds. When the plankton are eaten by small fish, the mercury they contain stays in the fish. As the fish need to eat a lot of plankton, the concentration of mercury in them becomes higher than its concentration in the plankton.
The small fish are eaten by larger fish, and these are eaten by still larger ones, such as tuna fish. This creates a high concentration of mercury in the tuna. People eating contaminated tuna may get mercury poisoning. Mercury is now banned from many chemical products and mercury use in industry is carefully regulated.
DDT is an insecticide that can pass up the food chain from insects to small birds, and then from the small birds to birds of prey, like hawks. It can accumulate in the birds of prey, giving them a large amount of DDT. Concentrations of DDT in birds causes weakness in their eggs, and reduces their population.

Romeo and Juliet first key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Montagues and Capulets have just had a fight in a public place in Verona. Prince Escalus stopped it and warned that if it happens again, those involved will be punished by death.
The first set scene begins with Montague asking Benvolio how the fight began.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
Benvolio tells him that servants from both families were fighting and that when he tried to stop them, Tybalt turned on him.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.
After that, lots of other people joined in until the Prince came and stopped the fighting.
Lady Montague is worried about her son, Romeo. He wasn't involved in the fighting but she wonders where he is. Benvolio explains that he saw him skulking about before dawn. Montague says that this is not unusual behaviour for Romeo: people have seen him crying and sighing on his own before daybreak before.
The audience finds out a lot about Romeo before he even walks onto the stage. What are your first impressions of Romeo?
Montague says he has tried to talk to his son, but he won't open up to him.
Parents and children - You might be able to sympathise with Romeo not wanting to talk about his feelings with his father.
He says he is like a flower that never gets to open because it has been stopped from blossoming by a worm that has eaten into it.
This is a simile to show that no one can get near to Romeo whilst he is in such a bad mood.
When Romeo arrives, Montague and Lady Montague leave Benvolio to try and find out why he is in such a bad mood all of the time.
- Time - There are lots of references to time in this play. The events in this play take place in just less than one week. Romeo and Juliet both feel that time drags whilst they are apart from one another.
Romeo tries to explain that he is in love with a girl who doesn't love him back. He doesn't make himself very clear though and Benvolio has to work hard to get him to tell him about it. Romeo comes up with lots of confusing descriptions of love to try and explain how he feels.
The list of opposites in Romeo's speech ('loving hate', 'heavy lightness', etc) are called oxymorons. They give us an important clue to his character. His confusing speech shows us how confusing the world is to him as a young man. It also shows us that Romeo likes to play with language.
""Here's much to do with hate, but more with love""
- Love and Hate - Romeo is commenting on the street brawl that has just happened: it's about hating an opposing family and feeling love and loyalty towards their own. Taken on its own, the line sums up the play as a whole: it's about two families that hate each other, but more about the love between Romeo and Juliet.
Romeo speaks in rhyme to try to describe how he feels.
Romeo's speeches are often in rhyme. He also likes wordplay, metaphors and similes. Romeo loves to talk about love, but does he really know what love is at this point? You could say that Romeo, at this point is 'all talk and no action'.
He says that love is like smoke made from the hot breath of lovers and that the flames are the sparks in their eyes. But if it doesn't work out, love is a sea of tears. He also describes love as a kind of madness and a poison.
- Love - The language that Romeo uses to describe love gives us an idea of what Romeo believes love to be at this point. For him it's about desire, which sounds like lust rather than true love.
Benvolio brings Romeo back to earth with a straightforward question: who is the girl he is in love with?
Whilst Romeo is pouring his heart out, Benvolio's responses could be performed in a number of ways- sympathetic, impatient, humorous. All three work.
Romeo still won't give him a straight answer though.
Romeo and Benvolio are good friends. We can see this through the way they banter with one another.
He tells Benvolio that the girl is very beautiful but she doesn't want to fall in love. It seems that she is very pure and Romeo says that because she isn't interested in men, her beauty will be wasted!
- Love - We never meet Rosaline in the play and only have Romeo's description of her to go by. It's hard to tell whether she really is a very good girl or whether she simply doesn't fancy Romeo!
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste
Benvolio says that the best thing to do is to forget her. He advises Romeo to look at other attractive girls. Romeo swears that he can never forget her; he'll never find anyone as beautiful as her. Benvolio bets that he will.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.

Love is strongly linked to magic. Miranda thinks that Ferdinand is a ""spirit"". He thinks that she is a ""goddess"". It is strongly suggested that their love at first sight is simply an illusion.
Miranda and Ferdinand's speeches are very honest and loving. Ferdinand is ""humble"", whilst Miranda talks of her ""modesty"".
When Prospero describes love he uses terms linked to control, e.g ""They are both in either's powers""; his daughter will ""control"" Ferdinand.
Prospero recognises that Miranda and Ferdinand's love is real and beyond their control. He compares it to a disease. He says his daughter is ""infected"".
There are lots of references to freedom and slavery. Prospero promises to free Ariel; he threatens to ""manacle"" Ferdinand. Ferdinand doesn't mind being a slave as long as he has Miranda to love.
Ferdinand uses a metaphor linked to slavery to describe his past crushes. He admits that he only suffers the indignity of being Prospero's slave for Miranda's sake.

A simple sentence generally has one main verb and communicates one idea. For example:
There can be several words in the verb, so
- has two words in the verb.
- has three words in the verb.
However, in each example there is just one main verb and idea. This is the simplest type of sentence and usually it's very easy to understand.
A compound sentence generally joins two simple sentences together. We typically use words like 'and', 'or' and 'but' to join the ideas. For example:
It was cold but we still went to town.
It was raining and we stayed indoors.
This makes the two ideas equal in the sentence - if we take away one part of it, we are left with a simple sentence again. These are very common when we are speaking and they are not difficult to understand.
A complex sentence communicates more than one idea, so it's like a compound sentence in a way. However, the ideas are not equal. This is because one part is like a simple sentence, so it can stand on its own. The other part can't - it needs something else to support it. For instance, look at this sentence:
You can't persuade me to go to town, no matter how hard you try.
We can take away the first part, but then we are left with:
Now this is not a simple sentence and it doesn't stand on its own - it needs something else to make sense.
We use complex sentences a lot when we speak, but it's important to use them in our writing too. In fact, these are the most difficult sentences to get right.

into the darkness overhead. I came along the landing and stopped there for a moment, listening to a rustling sound that I fancied I heard; then, satisfied of the absolute silence, I pushed open the baize-covered door and stood in the corridor.
What sort of atmosphere is Wells trying to create and how does he use figurative language to do this?
The writer is trying to create an atmosphere of fear and tension in the extract. He describes the passage as being ""draughty"" and mentions that it is underground. This makes it seem creepy and ghostly. The fact that the character only has a candle to light his way makes the story seem old-fashioned, and also creates drama because we know that the draught could blow it out! The way the echoes ""rang up and down"" and the fact that the man stops because he thinks he hears a sound, adds to the ghostly effects.
The shadows also help to create a sinister atmosphere as they flicker around and make it even harder for the man to see what's ahead. The writer uses figurative language such as personification to describe them. He says that they ""cower and quiver"", come ""sweeping up"" and that they ""fled"". All of this makes them sound alive, or perhaps like ghosts. The words used are all linked with fear, so that even the shadows seem to be afraid of what's in the corridor. This is very eerie and helps to create a very tense atmosphere.

Explore, imagine and entertain - Ending short-stories
The other problem some writers have is ending the story. It doesn't matter if it's a happy ending or not, but it has to make sense. There are lots of ways of ending, such as:
, where we have to wait until the final moment until we know. For instance, the spy who manages to stop the bomb two seconds before it explodes.
, where we are fairly sure about something, but in the final part everything changes. For example, we then learn that this is a fake bomb, and the real one is hidden somewhere else and will explode in five minutes.
, where the story stops, but we aren't sure what has actually happened at the end. For instance, the bomb is defused and everyone is safe. But then an army commander reports the theft of another bomb... only this time twice as powerful.
However, there are two endings to avoid:
, where a bomb will inevitably explode and as it does, the narrator wakes up - it was all a dream. Some English teachers don't mind this sort of thing, but others hate it. You have been warned.
, where the secret agent suddenly stops worrying about the bomb, retires, and goes off to play golf. This is even worse, and no-one likes it because the ending has nothing to do with the story.
Whatever kind of story you write, decide on your ending and include it in your plan.
Writing that explores, imagines or entertains depends on being creative. You need to experiment a little and not be frightened to try something new.

Being able to recognise changes in mood and emotion in a script is important as you need to convey this to your audience.
Using these methods, decide how you would express the emotion of anger.
What happens to your face, body and voice when you feel angry? How do you walk when you're in a bad mood? Which gestures do you use to show someone you're angry with them?
Frown, tightly clenched jaw, a tight mouth or even bared teeth.
Tense shoulders, a swift and purposeful walk almost like a march.
Strong and forceful gestures. Perhaps even clenched fists.
Either very loud and out of control or very quiet and menacing.
Maybe if you're very angry you won't pause often, you'll talk very quickly without giving the other person a chance to talk. Or the pauses might be long - a deafening silence!
Now try this with other emotions, eg surprise, excitement, happiness, sadness. See how your body, face and voice change with each emotion.
Another way to practise emotions is to do mood walks - put all the elements together to develop a walk that represents each emotion, then greet (or growl at) people with the appropriate tone of voice.

It's important that you check the accuracy of your spelling in your written work. Here are some common errors to watch out for:
Not dropping the final ""e"" before adding ""-ing"".
Errors in forming plurals in words that end in ""-y"".
Homophones (words that sound the same but are spelt differently and have different meanings), like ""to"", ""two"" and ""too"".
Problems with two vowels in the middle of words, such as ea, ou and ie
Problems with words that we sometimes shorten when we say them, like ""probly"" for ""probably"".
Certain words could also cause trouble, so look for any ways of remembering them. Sometimes the oddest ideas are the easiest to remember, like Big Elephants Can Always Understand Small Elephants, which gives us 'because'. Here are a few more to help you:

A short-story is easy to write if you:

Use people's words and actions as much as possible. Don't try to give lots of background information - let the reader use their own imagination. Remember - creative writing means creative reading too!
Make your characters and plot realistic. How do people really speak and act? Remember, most writers base some of their characters on people they actually know, so who can you use to improve your story? Would your granny make a good secret agent or your uncle a confident contract killer?
Get straight to the point. Don't worry about long openings or lots of detail. Instead, launch right in, hopefully in the middle of some action, like in the example below.
Steve held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - he was too shocked to speak. One moment he had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next he was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
You will also have to decide whether to write in the first person (using ""I""), or in the third person (typically, using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they""). Using ""I"" makes it easier to write about thoughts and feelings, but using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they"" lets you move from person to person, or from place to place. You can choose whichever you feel happiest with. For instance, we can swap the opening of the story into the first person, like this:
I held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - I was too shocked to speak. One moment I had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next I was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
The only thing you shouldn't do is swap the person - dont start with ""I"" and then switch to ""he"", or you'll spoil the story.

Experts estimate that nearly one-third of the food that humans eatfrom apples to zucchiniis pollinated by bees. ""Crops that are pollinated are the tasty things that people like to eat, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts,"" says Hackett.
Farmers are feeling the effects as mites destroy the

The bee shortage has driven up prices, making it expensive for farmers to rent honeybees. Each year, bees typically pollinate crops worth about $15 billion. Crop loss due to the bee shortage is costing farmers billions.
Farmers in California are particularly hurting because about 80 percent of the worlds almonds are grown there. Almond tree blossoms need honeybees to pollinate them.

People who support a change to the amendment say the Constitution denies foreign-born American citizens equal rights. They argue that 60,000 immigrants currently serve in the U.S. military.
Supporters also say that the Constitution has been amended in the past. Amendments to outlaw slavery, give women the right to vote, and limit a president to two terms in office were added.
Others say that the requirement is unfair, especially because the United States is supposed to be the land of opportunity. ""You cannot choose the land of your birth,"" said an advocate in a television ad. ""You can choose the land you love.""
Others argue that people born in foreign countries should not be allowed to run for president because it can cause conflict. They think that those people may have
, or loyalty, to a country other than the United States.
Should the Constitution be amended so that a foreign-born person can become president?
Many historians say that the nation's founders included the requirement for a reason. The founders feared that foreign countries could influence a leader's loyalty.
""I don't think it's unfair to say the president of the United States should be a native-born citizen,"" said Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. ""Your [loyalty to your country] is driven by your birth.""

Each fall, the skies between eastern Canada and the mountains of central Mexico fill with orange-and-black monarch butterflies. Along their journey, millions of butterflies fight fierce winds and flee predators. Once they reach their destination, monarchs cover trees with their bright, shimmering wings.
This year, the monarchs will not be flying alone. Butterfly lovers are accompanying them on their 3,415-mile journey. They are riding in a light aircraft called an

or move from one place to another. Beginning in early August, the butterflies head south for the winter months.
Most monarchs travel from Canada to Mexico. Others travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north. They are the only insects to make such a long round-trip migration.
Mexican pilot Francisco Gutierrez and a crew of other pilots from Canada and the United States departed from Quebec, Canada, on August 15. The group plans to arrive in Mexico on November 2.
The crew hopes to raise awareness about the monarchs' fragile habitats. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning the forests that protect the butterflies from rain and cold.
No one has ever followed the butterflies in the air for their entire journey. Doing so can teach scientists how the winged insects deal with wind patterns and difficult weather. Gutierrez says, ""It's going to be an adventure.""

235,"In June, a small car pulled up outside the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad. Three men unloaded a wrapped object from the trunk, handed it to museum officials, and sped off in the mid afternoon heat. No questions asked.
Museum officials were stunned. The men had left a very important vase. Although the vase was in pieces, the good news was that it could be fixed.
""This is one of the most important pieces from the Baghdad museum, and I am delighted it has been returned,"" said a museum official. ""It is reason for people all around the world to celebrate.""
Why, exactly, would the return of a vase be cause for celebration? It was the famous Vase of Warka. The 5,000-year-old
, or man-made object, is one of the world's first sculptures. The images on the vase are important because they link the past to modern times.
Along with many valuable objects, the vase was stolen from the museum after the fall of Saddam Hussein's government in April.
At that time, mobs of thieves and rioters, or
, tore through the museum. They smashed ancient objects. Thieves ran off with prized treasures. Among the lost objects were carvings, jewelry, paintings, and statues.
One museum official referred to the looting as the ""crime of the century."" He said that it wasn't just a loss for Iraq, but that it was ""a loss for all mankind.""
. That means they could never be replaced. Some of the lost objects dated back 10,000 years, to the beginning of civilization.
Many people blamed U.S. troops for failing to protect the museum as Saddam's government fell. They pointed out that U.S. forces had managed to guard the oil reserves. U.S. government officials defended themselves, saying that American troops were focused on taking control of Baghdad.
Officials estimate that about 3,000 pieces from the museum's entire collection of 170,000 items are still missing. The losses were not as large as experts originally thought. Some valuable pieces were hidden in underground vaults. Other pieces were taken by people for safekeeping and then were returned.
Some of the stolen objects are slowly making their way back to the museum. Museum workers are trying to ensure the safe return of other objects. They began a ""don't ask; don't tell"" policy.
The policy allows thieves-like the ones who brought back the vase-to return stolen goods without punishment. Countries around the world are involved in recovery efforts. They are helping to compile a list of the stolen items. However, as one expert pointed out, ""It's going to be a long time before we know for sure what's missing.""
Modern-day Iraq is the site of ancient Mesopotamia. In Greek,
means ""the land between rivers."" There, about 5,000 years ago, the first cities sprang up between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
The area between the two rivers is often referred to as a cradle of civilization. That's because mathematics, science, and one of the first written languages developed there.
Here are some of the Iraqi National Museum's valuable artifacts and their status at the time
This 5,000-year-old stone statue of a woman praying was still missing.
This life-size marble head of a woman is one of the earliest pieces of sculpture. About 5,000 years old, it was stolen during the looting.
How did looters steal from world history when they ransacked the museum?
Originally thought to be missing, this tablet is a record of the world's earliest writing. It was found on the museum's second floor, away from the riots.

In recent years, that tradition has exploded into a giant festival. Many of the ice buildings and sculptures are lit with colorful lights in the evening.
In December, 3,000 sculptors and workers began constructing Harbin's winter wonderland. Harbin lies on the Songhua River, which provides the festival with some of its ice. The festival covers 44 square city blocks. Workers used enough snow and ice to fill 90 Olympicsize swimming pools!
""Nothing can prepare you for the amazing sight of dozens and dozens of brightly glowing buildings,"" American photographer R. Todd King told
. ""Every year, the festival has more ice structures, and they are bigger and more complicated than before.""
China's rich cultural history, historic landmarks, and events such as the ice festival have made the country a top tourist destination. Nearly 42 million people visited China in 2004. The World Tourism Organization predicts that China will be the world's most-visited country by 2020. The Chinese government hopes the recent tourism boom will help improve the country's world image.
China's leaders have often been accused of violating human rights. Some watchdog groups, such as Amnesty International, claim that the Chinese government limits Chinese citizens' freedom of speech and imprisons people for speaking out against the government. Those accusations almost

About 1.3 billion people (about four times the population of the United States)
More than 50 dialects, or versions, of the Chinese language are spoken. The most widely spoken dialects are Mandarin and Cantonese.
The ice festival changes each year. Here are some buildings and sculptures that have been part of the festival in the past.
The ice festival often has an ice slide that visitors use to get from one part of the city to another.
Visitors to the winter festival can even eat at restaurants made of ice, like this KFC.
This structure was built to look like an ancient European castle. It was lit up at night to attract visitors.
People try to climb a sheet of ice. The ice wall is often located in a part of the city called Adventure Playground.

What were the most important accomplishments of your presidency?
I think that one of the most important things I've accomplished was helping to strengthen our economy so that more Americans have jobs and more families can afford to buy homes and send their kids to college.
I'm particularly proud of a new program created in 1993 called AmeriCorps, which gives young people a chance to serve their communities while earning money for college.
What advice would you give the new president?
A president has tremendous responsibilities-- from keeping our economy growing to working with foreign leaders and commanding our armed forces. The president is the leader, but he or she can't do the job alone. So my advice is build a strong team, stay focused on your priorities, and make every day count.
Why should kids be proud to be Americans?
We should all be proud to be Americans because this truly is a land of opportunity. Regardless of your background, you can work hard and achieve your dreams. You may face challenges or obstacles along the way, but if you set your sights high, work hard, and stick to your priorities, you can achieve your goals.
What has been the best part of being president?
The best part of being president has been having the opportunity to make America a better place. Every day, I have the chance to make a difference in people's lives.
After being president for eight years, what will you do now?
The first lady and I recently bought a new home in Chappaqua, N.Y., and I look forward to spending more time there. I also plan to spend time in Arkansas putting together my presidential library and launching a new public policy center. I'm sure I'll be very busy, but I also hope to spend more time with my family and friends and to simply relax after what has been eight of the most incredible years of my life.
William Jefferson Blythe IV was born on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas.
In 1962, when Clinton was a senior in high school, he was chosen to go to Washington, D.C., to participate in Boys Nation, a special youth conference. There he met President Kennedy. After that, he said, he knew he wanted to make a difference in the lives of Americans by becoming a U.S. president.
Clinton went to Georgetown University, after which he studied at Oxford University in England. He then went to law school at Yale University.
In 1976, Clinton was elected attorney general of Arkansas. He later was elected governor of Arkansas.
In 1991, Clinton decided to run for president of the United States.

Manatees were once thought to be on the edge of

As a result, Florida recently removed the manatee from its list of
Endangered species are animals or plants that are at risk of dying out.
The first laws protecting this slow-moving marine mammal were passed in the late 1970s. Those laws made hunting, capturing, or killing manatees illegal.
As Floridas human population grew, however, manatees faced more threats. Last year alone, 396 manatees died in Florida, according to the states Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Many manatees have been injured or killed in collisions with boats. Others have gotten tangled in fishing gear. Manatees are also threatened because of the loss of their
As builders develop along the coastline, they destroy the manatees natural homes.
Environmental factors, such as red tide, have also taken their toll on the playful creatures. Red tide occurs when millions of tiny organisms are present in an area of the water. Those tiny organisms turn the ocean red and brown. Some of them are harmful to fish and other animals.
Red tide occurs naturally in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2005, more than 80 manatees were killed in red-tide outbreaks.
Not everyone thinks it is a good idea to remove manatees from the list. Many wildlife experts worry that the unusual mammals will not receive the same protection they had in the past. ""We cant celebrate yet,"" warned manatee expert Patrick Rose in an interview with
State officials say that the manatee is not under urgent threat. Although the huge creatures are being removed from Floridas list, state scientists say that the animal will remain protected under the nations Endangered Species Act. That law offers special protection to animals and plants facing extinction.
Wildlife officials say protection of the manatees might even be strengthened. The next step calls for the writing of a plan to continue increasing the number of manatees. ""There will be no less protection,"" says Henry Cabbage of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
A manatee recently got a taste of the Big Apple. Manatees are rarely seen far from the warm coastal waters of Florida, but one adventurous sea cow swam north to waters off New York City this summer. The large marine visitor then swam to waterways about 25 miles inland. Wildlife officials say its not unusual for manatees to
or move from one place to another. However, the mammals typically dont go much farther north than Virginia.
Should manatees have been removed from Floridas endangered species list? Why or why not?

Some of superheated rivers of lava flowed toward towns. In an attempt to stop the advancing lava, airplanes dropped thousands of gallons on water on it. Fearing for their lives, many people fled from their homes.

On the first day of school, Rand said, her classmates ripped out pictures of Saddam Hussein from their textbooks. Saddam is the former president of Iraq. The students tossed the pages out the window, yelling ""Bye, bye, Saddam.""
That was not an unusual sight at some schools throughout this war-torn country. Saddam's government was toppled in April. At that time, U.S.-led forces took control of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.
During Saddam's rule, teachers were forced to mention him in every lesson, from history to music to gym class. Students even learned math by adding 4 + 28. That's because April 28 is Saddam's birthday. Now schools are erasing Saddam's image and teachings from their lessons.
Iraqi officials are rewriting the country's textbooks. That will give students the opportunity to learn new ideas about the world.
The new textbooks, which will arrive this month, don't include any references praising Saddam. Pictures of Saddam have been removed from classrooms. Students are no longer forced to chant ""Long live our leader, Saddam"" during their classes.
Despite the changes, U.S. soldiers report that many of Iraq's schools are in various states of
, or poor condition. Although many schools were failing before the war began, many more schools were destroyed or seriously damaged during the fighting.
Some schools have broken windows and doors and are still without electricity or running water. Some lack chalkboards, desks, and other much-needed furniture and supplies.
The good news is that help is on the way for teachers and students. U.S. soldiers and aid groups are helping rebuild many of the run-down schools, restoring water and electricity.
They are also providing children with school supplies that Americans have donated. One 9-year-old Iraqi student was all smiles as soldiers unloaded boxes of new crayons, markers, book bags, and other donated supplies.

Chances are if the flu hasn't made you sick yet, it has infected someone you know. Experts say the flu season struck more than a month earlier than its normal start. It began in October and spread quickly. Flu season typically runs from December through April.
""Most of us are convinced this was a hard flu season on children,"" said one flu expert. Hospitals and doctors' offices have been jammed with sick patients, especially kids. Some schools even closed because the flu outbreak was so severe.

The flu virus spreads through the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Other people can catch the flu by breathing in the airborne germs.
You can also get the flu by coming in contact with places where germs hang out-such as computer keyboards and door handles-and then touching your mouth or nose.
Although there is no cure for the flu, health experts say that getting a

This season, many people lined up to get the vaccine in the form of flu shots. Each year, the flu virus changes. Scientists develop a vaccine to protect people from the type of virus that is spreading.
Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that ""there's still plenty of flu out there,"" this organization has some good news. It reports that the number of flu cases appears to be on the decline.
At press time, health officials say only five states report that the flu is widespread. That number is down from 45 at the flu's

602,"Something to Go Nuts About: New Treatment May Help Kids With Peanut Allergies
Peanuts may seem harmless, but to some kids they mean trouble. About one and a half million Americans are allergic to peanuts. Between 50 and 100 people, mostly kids, die each year from peanut allergies.
For kids with peanut allergies, help may be on the way in the form of a new drug called TNX-901. Monthly shots of TNX-901 are not a cure, but they may save lives. Results suggest that the drug reduces the chance of a serious allergic reaction if peanuts are eaten accidentally.
Eating just the tiniest amount of peanuts can make kids with peanut allergies very sick. For some of those kids, an allergic reaction can occur from just touching or smelling peanuts. Symptoms include stomach pain, hives, and tightness in the throat.
""I get an itchy rash all over my body when I eat peanuts, so I hope the new injection will help,"" said an 11-year-old girl.
It may be years before the treatment is available to the public. More testing needs to be done before the drug is approved. Researcher Donald Leung said the new drug could ""help lift a cloud of fear that people with peanut allergies live under every time they eat."" That is something that kids with peanut allergies won't find nutty.
These eight foods are the cause of most food allergies:
tree nuts (such as walnuts and cashews)
About 7 million Americans have food allergies. People can be allergic to almost any food.
If you are allergic to any food, it is important to read labels carefully. Always ask an adult if you are not sure about what is in your food.

is a person who takes the law into his or her own hands. So if a bullied student feels a school isn't helping, that student may act out against others, he said.
Bullying may be one of the causes behind some of the recent shootings in U.S. schools, according to Stephens. Kids at Santana High School, in Santee, California, said bullying may have a part in a recent shooting there.
Santee student Charles ""Andy"" Williams, age 15, is accused of killing two boys and wounding 13 other people at Santana High School on March 5. According to schoolmates, in addition to having other personal problems, Williams had been bullied and teased.
School safety experts say everyone in a school, as well as parents, must work together to make sure no kids are disrespected or treated cruelly.
To stop bullying, some schools have organized
. A peer mediation group allows students who have problems getting along to work the problems out with the help of peers and teachers.
Other schools have sent students and teachers forms asking questions about such problems as bullying and teasing. The answers from the forms help school leaders and parents become more aware of kids' problems and figure out ways to solve them.
Finally, Stephens suggests that there are steps a student who is bullied can take. ""Make it clear that you don't like being bullied and then walk away and tell an adult,"" Stephens said.
Ronald Stephens, of the National Center for School Safety, gives these three tips to remember if you are ever bullied:
If a person is bullying you, tell the person in a firm, loud voice that you don't like what they are doing. Then...
Find an adult (teacher, parent, coach) and tell that adult what happened.

A forecaster is someone who predicts the weather. Why does the artist depict Bush and Kerry as weather forecasters?
What point is the cartoonist making about the candidates and the economy?
How do the symbols help convey the message? What do the suns represent? What do the hail and thunderstorm clouds represent?

As soon as historians learned what the writing on the box meant, they wanted to know more. For example, they wanted to know if the Jesus mentioned in the carving was Jesus of Nazareth.
The writing on the box poses a problem. James, Joseph, and Jesus were very common names at the time the box was made. Historians had to use math to
how many people named James had a father named Joseph and a brother named Jesus. They learned that only 20 people could have been the James mentioned in the carving.
Of the hundreds of bone boxes that have been found, only two others mention a brother's name. Historians say the Jesus mentioned on the box must have been a very important person.
Did the bone box belong to a brother of Jesus? Some historians say Jesus had brothers or half-brothers. Others say Jesus only had cousins.
Regardless of whose bones were placed in the box, the discovery is important to historians. ""This is something that provides a bridge over time,"" said one historian. ""My reaction is not so much excitement as it is awe.""

Earth's atmosphere is made of several layers. Ozone is a gas that makes up one of those layers. That layer stretches from 6 miles to 30 miles above Earth's surface.
Ozone is an important gas. It protects life on Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. Without ozone, life couldn't exist. The dangerous solar rays are called ultraviolet rays, or UV rays. UV rays can cause sunburn and skin cancer.
The pie chart shows the two most abundant gases in Earth""s atmosphere.
Scientists first noticed the ozone hole in the 1970s. Since then, each year, the hole has opened above Antarctica for a few months in the fall. The largest hole formed in 2000. It was three times larger than the United States. This year, unusually severe storms caused the hole to split, say scientists.
Cold temperatures in the atmosphere over Antarctica and chemical pollution cause the ozone hole. Chemicals that used to be in aerosol cans, air conditioners, and refrigerators made the pollution. To protect the atmosphere, people stopped using those dangerous chemicals in the mid-1990s.
Although the chemicals are no longer used, they stay in the atmosphere for a long time. Scientists say the ozone hole will continue to form for a long time. But it should start getting smaller.

Scientists in Indonesia think they have found hidden treasure52 new types of marine animals! The researchers believe that the 24 types of fish, 20 types of corals, and 8 types of shrimp are new to science.
The researchers spotted the new species off the coast of Papua, a province on one of the more than 13,500 islands that make up Indonesia. The area, Birds Head Seascape, is one of the worlds most diverse marine regions.
""These Papuan reefs are literally species factories,"" says Mark Erdmann of Conservation International, who led the expedition. Many of the species are believed to be

When you come home from school, does your pet dog run to you barking and wagging its tail? Does your cat purr when you pet it? Many pet owners believe that tail wagging and purring are signs that pets are happy.
Most scientists are not sure that animals feel emotions. They say animals never feel happy or sad. In fact, they say, animals probably don't feel love, anger, hate or other emotions either.
Scientist Joseph LeDoux studied rats to find out whether the rodents have emotions. He found that rats do feel at least one emotion--fear. He also found the part of the brain that seems to control fear in rats. In humans, that part of the brain controls fear and some other emotions.
Even though LeDoux says rats feel fear, he doubts that other animals have emotions in the way humans and other primates do. ""A whale may behave as if it's in love,"" he said, ""but you can't prove what it's feeling, if anything.""
A number of scientists say animals do have a range of emotions. Some scientists who have studied such animals as dogs, cats, elephants, lions, and whales say those animals feel emotions. Scientist Joyce Poole studies elephants. She has written that pachyderms often show grief when a relative dies. She says elephants have ""deep emotions.""
Jane Goodall, studies chimpanzees. She says she has seen chimps playing and chasing one another for fun. Goodall also says chimps feel grief. After Flo, a 50-year-old chimp, died, one of her sons, Flint, refused to eat food. Flint's brothers and sisters tried to get him to eat, but they couldn't. Three weeks later, Flint died. Goodall says Flint ""died of grief.""
More recently, scientist Marc Bekoff watched an elk run back and forth through a patch of snow, jumping into the air as it completed each back-and-forth pass. Bekoff said the animal was feeling the ""joy of life.""
Bekoff said he can't prove that animals have feelings, because animals can't talk. But, he said, animals can communicate feelings in other ways. ""I can't prove that another human being is feeling happy or sad,"" he said, ""but I can [guess] how [he or she is] feeling through body language and facial expressions."" Both people and animals use

676,"Hours before giant waves pounded coastlines in South Asia, many animals started behaving strangely. In Sri Lanka, elephants trumpeted frantically and fled to higher ground. Bats and flamingos deserted low-lying areas. Many other animals escaped unharmed.
Wildlife experts are amazed that many animals survived the tsunami. The series of huge waves killed thousands of people in South Asia and East Africa about two months ago. Experts say animals might have sensed the approaching waves and moved to higher ground.
""I think animals can sense disaster. They know when things are happening in nature,"" said an official at the national wildlife department in Sri Lanka.
Elephants' sharp senses may have warned them about the tsunami.
Other stories of odd animal behavior before the tsunami have also surfaced. Giant waves flooded low-lying parts of Yala National Park in Sri Lanka, uprooting trees and killing hundreds of people. Wildlife officials reported, however, that few animals died. The park is home to hundreds of animals, including elephants, monkeys, leopards, tigers, deer, and water buffalo.
In Thailand, elephants carrying tourists from Japan bolted for the hills, and other elephants broke free of their chains. In one fishing village, nearly 1,000 locals escaped safely after birds squawked madly.
Although some animals in South Asia successfully fled to higher ground before the tsunami, other animals were not as lucky. Many dogs and other pets lost their owners in the tsunami and are homeless, sick, and without food or water. Cows, goats, and other farm animals are also roaming aimlessly. Many of those animals are drinking polluted water. Rescue groups have been sending animal food and
to the area. Veterinarians are doctors who care for animals.
Why might animals have known trouble was on the way? Forget special powers. Instead, experts say that animals have better senses of hearing, smell, and sight than humans do. Those sharp senses help warn animals when natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes, are about to happen.
""It doesn't surprise me that animals had an early warning of the tsunami,"" animal expert Michael Dee of the Los Angeles Zoo told
. ""The senses of certain species are far stronger than what any human has."" Dee points out that dogs, for example, have a stronger sense of smell than humans and that cats can see better in the dark than people.
Scientists say that animals might have felt the vibrations from the earthquake that set off the tsunami. In addition, many animals, including elephants, pigeons, and dogs, can also pick up
. That is a sound that is too low in pitch for humans to hear.
""Elephants can hear or feel other elephants grumble up to 2 miles away, so they probably felt the earthquake,"" said Dee. ""Their first
would be to move away from the direction of the sound."" An instinct is a natural, untaught behavior or reaction.
Before the tsunami struck, animals may have started to flee because they saw other creatures running. ""Animals take their cues from other animals,"" said Dee.
How animals sense danger has fascinated people for centuries. Most scientists are quick to point out, however, that nothing has ever been proven.
Will animal instincts be used to create a warning system about natural disasters anytime soon? ""I wouldn't count on [it],"" said Dee.
In the meantime, animals are helping out in other ways. For example, elephants are assisting in the cleanup of areas hit by the tsunami.
Scientists say that elephants can pick up vibrations from earthquakes through their broad feet.
Elephants' toenails are in the skin and not attached to the toes.
Elephants' soles have sensitive foot pads that detect vibrations, such as those from an earthquake. That signals elephants to move to more stable ground.
In what other ways might animals' sharp senses be helpful?

More class time can improve test scores, according to a recent report by the research group Education Sector. As a result, schools are experimenting with tacking on an hour or more to the school day.
Elementary and middle school students at Fletcher-Maynard Academy in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have gone to an eight-hour school day. Fletcher-Maynard Academy is just one of 10 schools in Massachusetts trying out the new schedule. Lawmakers in Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, and Washington, D.C., are also debating extended school hours.
People in favor of longer school days say kids need to learn more to stay competitive in today's world. The additional hours enable teachers to spend more time on each subject. Fletcher-Maynard principal Robin Harris likes having the extra hours. ""Teachers can be a little more creative,"" she told
Students aren't just spending the extra time with their heads in a book, though. Harris explains that her students get longer recesses and more snack time. Parent Dawn Oliver says her 11-year-old daughter, Brittany, is an advice columnist for a magazine at her school in Fall River, Massachusetts. ""The kids get so involved in these things because it's not all book work,"" says Oliver.
Critics argue that extended school days could be too long for today's busy kids. And extra school time might prevent students from exploring other interests. Some students have complained about having to stay later. They are concerned that they wouldn't be able to concentrate during the last classes of the day.
Other people point out that longer school days
with, or get in the way of, after-school sports and clubs. ""The day is long enough already,"" student Cameron Villers from Ansonia, Connecticut, told

So how does interest work? Say you deposit $100 in a savings account. If the banks interest rate is 2 percent per year, the bank will pay you an additional $2 after one year. (2 percent can also be expressed as a decimal: .02)
To calculate 2 percent of $100, multiply $100 by .02. Therefore, 2% of $100 = $2.

695,"Nose to the Grindstone: Did their special noses protect search-and-rescue dogs after 9/11?
On September 11, 2001, help was needed immediately. Terrorists had crashed airplanes into the World Trade Center in New York City, New York, and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. Police officers and firefighters weren't the only ones to respond. More than 200 search-and-rescue dogs used their noses to help find victims.
Deja Vu, a German shepherd from Pennsylvania, hunted through piles of

Today, more than five years later, Otto has surprising results: Many of the dogs are fine. In fact, the dogs in her study are just as healthy as other search-andrescue dogs not involved in the 9/11 recovery efforts.
Deja Vu is no exception. ""We were concerned [about] what the dogs were inhaling and walking through,"" Deja Vu's handler, Pat Thompson, told
""But Deja Vu has remained in good health.""

The search-and-rescue dogs' noses might have protected them from the bad air, Otto

sometimes reacts differently than a human's immune system does. That system protects the body against diseases and infections. For example, respiratory problems such as asthma are unusual in dogs. Otto and other researchers say that may be why the search-and-rescue dogs haven't developed any breathing disorders.
The scientists also think the dogs in the study may be healthier than the people who worked at the sites because most of the canines spent less time at the disaster sites than their two-legged counterparts. Many rescue workers who developed breathing problems spent months volunteering after the attacks. The dogs in Otto's study spent an average of 10 days helping.
Scientists may never pinpoint the exact reason that most of the dogs in Otto's study are in good health. But Otto hopes to continue the study for as long as the dogs live. She wants to stay on the lookout for any health problems that may develop over the next few years.
She plans to use the information she gathers to protect search-andrescue dogs on future disaster missions. ""No piece of equipment can ever do the job that these dogs do,"" Otto told
Each human has a unique scent, like a fingerprint. That scent comes from a mixture of sweat and tiny flakes of skin, called

610,"History in the Making: Japan Invades Hong Kong
War broke out between China and Japan in 1937. An undeclared war was fought until 1941, when China, as well as the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, declared war on Japan, Germany, and Italy. In 1941, Japan invaded the British colony of Hong Kong, which is part of present-day China. Connie interviewed her grandfather, Locksley Siu, who was in Hong Kong during the Japanese invasion.
How old were you when World War II began?
World War II in Hong Kong was from 1941 to 1945. The Japanese army occupied the former British colony when I was 11 years old.
Where did you live, and did you have a car?
Altogether, eight people lived in [an] apartment of 500 square feet. Our apartment was in Wan Chai, on Hong Kong Island. Most people did not have cars. My dad had an old bicycle.
Did you still go to school during the Japanese occupation?
Yes, I continued to go to school for the first year. Later the school was closed because the school ran out of money. During the occupation, students were required to learn Japanese. Japanese teachers taught us Japanese.
Did you have enough food to eat every day?
No, we did not have enough food. We only ate vegetables, beans, and potatoes, but no rice at all. Meat was very costly and in short supply. When we were really hungry, we drank water. Sometimes we had to pick up grass and leaves from trees to eat.
How did the Japanese soldiers treat the Chinese people?
They were rude, and they hated Chinese people. We had to salute the Japanese soldiers when they passed by. Otherwise they would kick [us] in the back.
How was life affected by the occupation?
There was little freedom. The Japanese forbade people to go out after 11 at night. There was no traffic during the curfew. There was a lack of electricity for lighting; instead, we used candles. The only entertainment at night was the radio. The Japanese government took all Hong Kong dollars away. The Japanese government forced us to use Japanese yen. Roads such as Queen's Road and King's Road were changed to Japanese names.
Do you have any comments about the occupation?
More than 60 years after [the end of] World War II, there are still many people  who live in fear, hunger, and poverty because of wars. I hope that you will think more of those less fortunate.
I learned that there was little freedom under the occupation. I should be grateful that I live in a country where I am not forced to do things that I don't want to do. I'm going to do something for the less fortunate, just as my grandpa told me.

But some Americans acted differently. Instead of helping others, they attacked innocent Arab and Muslim Americans.
Some individuals vandalized mosques (the buildings where Muslims practice Islam, their religion). Others attacked anyone they thought looked to be from the Middle East.
Dr. Abdullah Khoui, of the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C., condemned the attacks while defending his religion.
""What took place, no sound mind would approve of it, and no religion at all in the world would accept it,"" Khoui said. ""Islam does not approve of what took place.""

""We're concerned that the actions of a small number of extremists is likely to paint with a very broad brush the large population of God-fearing, peace-loving Muslims in America,"" Majid said after the attacks.
President George W. Bush agreed with the Islamic leaders. While visiting a mosque, President Bush commented on the attacks on Muslim and Arab Americans. ""That's not the America I know,"" he said. ""That should not and that will not stand in America.""
Muslims practice the religion of Islam. Islam was first preached by the prophet Muhammad about 1,400 years ago.
In the 600s, Muhammad had a dream in which Allah, the Arabic name for God, called him to be a prophet. Islam means ""submission, commitment, and peace"".
Islam teaches that human diversity, or difference, is a sign of the richness of Allah's mercy. In other words, according to religious experts, Islam promotes peace.
Those experts add that the September 11 attacks do not represent Muslim beliefs. The majority of the 1.2 billion Muslims worldwide practice peace and tolerance toward others.

Last year, 750 schools and 90,000 kids took part in Save for America. Combined, those kids saved $1 million. Since the program began 12 years ago, kids have saved nearly $50 million!
One of the schools that takes part in the Save for America program is Setauket Elementary School, Setauket, New York. Every two weeks that school has Banking Day. Nearly 200 kids from the school deposit money on Banking Day, including Gabriel and Dylan.
Each boy deposits about $5 in his bank account on Banking Day. So far, Gabriel has saved $350, and Dylan has saved $340.
The kids who participate in Save for America save money and learn valuable lessons that they will use for the rest of their lives. Dylan explained that he has learned that saving money for the future can help him obtain the things he wants and lead a better life as an adult.
Save for America also helps kids sharpen their math skills. Gabriel said the program has improved his skills, especially in addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
The kids who take part in Save for America can use their money for a variety of things. Gabriel recently withdrew some of his savings to buy a new scooter. However, he's saving most of his money for college.

According to the National Safe Kids Campaign, children younger than 15 were hurt in nine out of ten of those accidents. In one-third of those scooter accidents, the rider fell and broke or dislocated an arm or a hand.
Most scooter accidents happen when a rider goes too fast and does not wear safety equipment.
Safety gear helps protect riders, who usually ride at about 4 miles per hour. But some people cruise at speeds of 25 miles per hour or more. In England, police gave a man a ticket for racing a scooter at 39 miles per hour!
The number of scooter-related accidents has prompted some U.S. communities to pass laws requiring kids who ride scooters to wear helmets and other safety gear. Many states already have helmet laws for kids who ride bicycles, and some have helmet laws for kids who use skateboards and in-line skates.
Ann Brown, an official with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, recommends that kids use safety gear when riding scooters. ""We're trying to head off some of the kinds of injuries that happen with in-line skates,"" Brown said about scooter safety. ""We want people to know about the safety gear early on.""
This isn't the first time scooters have been popular. Scooters have been around since 1816. According to Annette Thompson of the Bicycle Museum of America, the first scooter was made from a board and two large wheels.
Even if scooter riders are careful, accidents can happen. Here are a few safety tips that scooter riders can use:
Always wear a helmet, wrist guards, and elbow and knee pads;
Make sure your scooter works properly and is not broken;
Ride only on smooth surfaces free of traffic;
Never hitch a ride from a bicycle or a motor vehicle;
In the 1930s, kids nailed roller skates to milk crates to make homemade scooters. Scooters remained popular until the 1980s, when skateboards and in-line skates became popular.

was conducted by a team of 14 researchers in four countries.
If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
The study warns that ocean life is being wiped out because of overfishing and pollution.
Global warming (a rise in Earth's temperatures) and habitat loss are also to blame for the decline in seafood.
Although the world's sea life is in serious danger, it's not too late to reverse the problem, says the study's lead author, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. The researchers have called for measures to protect current fish populations, such as reducing large-scale fishing and pollution. ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we don't change things,"" Worm told reporters.
The loss of ocean life will cause more than just a shortage of seafood. It could spell disaster for ecosystems too. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that work together as a unit to live. A declining fish population would cause a disaster up and down the food chain. Larger animals, such as seals and dolphins, depend on fish for food. Without enough fish to eat, those animals would be in trouble.

Saturn is light because it is a ball of gas. If you built a HUGE swimming pool, Saturn would float in it. In fact, it is the only planet in the solar system that is less dense than water.
Saturn is windy. The fastest winds on Saturn can reach about 1,100 miles per hour! In comparison, the fastest winds on Earth can reach about 250 miles per hour.

Saturn, the sixth planet from the sun, lies between Jupiter and Uranus. Of the nine planets in the solar system, Saturn is the second largest, after Jupiter. In fact, more than nine Earths would fit across Saturn.
The planets rings are not solid. They are made up of particles of rock, ice, and dust. Some of the particles are as tiny as grains of sand. Others are as large as skyscrapers. Although the rings are wide, they are also very thin. The planets rings are only about half a mile thick.
In addition to learning about the rings, scientists are studying Saturns moons. The scientists primary focus is Saturns largest moon, Titan. Titan is larger than the planets Mercury and Pluto.

What do scientists expect to find? ""In many ways, the most exciting part of the journey is about to begin because we dont know what lies ahead,"" said NASA scientist Julie Webster.
Earth and the other planets in our solar system travel around the sun. Saturn is so far from the sun that it receives less sunlight than we get on Earth. The sun also looks much smaller from Saturn.

There may be another 1,000 near-Earth asteroids scientists haven't discovered. Scientists worry that one of the unknown asteroids might threaten Earth. Scientists will use the information they gathered from Eros to protect Earth from asteroids that come too close to the third rock from the sun.
Eros is about twice the length of Manhattan, New York.
Eros orbits the sun once every 21 months.
Eros has so little gravity that a baseball hit on its surface would fly into space.
A person weighing 200 pounds on Earth would weigh 2 ounces on Eros.
The daytime temperature on Eros is about 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
The nighttime temperature on Eros is about -238 degrees Fahrenheit.

""I started thinking of them as a family almost immediately,"" filmmaker Martyn Colbeck told
He was talking about wild elephants, not his next-door neighbors. For more than 15 years, Colbeck has filmed a family of African elephants in Amboseli National Reserve in eastern Africa.
airs April 1 on the PBS television show
The new film comes after recent studies found that elephants can recognize their reflection in a mirror. That is something only humans, chimpanzees, and dolphins were thought to be able to do. ""These animals are smart,"" Colbeck says. His documentary shows just how intelligent African elephantsthe world's largest land animalsare.
Colbeck's film follows an elephant family led by a 62-year-old female elephant named Echo. In the wild, African elephants live in herds. They roam long distances to find food. The oldest female elephant, called the
leads the herd. Adult male elephants live separately from the females and the young calves.
Echo guides her family to fresh water and food while staying alert for danger. The young elephants are the most
or at risk of being harmed. Colbeck witnessed that danger when he saw another elephant family attempt to kidnap Echo's calf Ebony. Echo gathered the other adult female elephants in her family to come to the rescue. ""Together they plowed into the kidnappers to recover Ebony,"" Colbeck explained. ""It showed forethought and teamwork.""
During his years of filmmaking, Colbeck observed other signs of elephant intelligence. Elephants communicate with each other through low rumbling sounds that people often cannot hear. Family members also make distinct sounds that other members can recognize.
or customs. After an elephant dies, the other family members cover the body with sticks and leaves and linger near the site for days. The animals often return to the site years later.
Amboseli National Reserve covers about 150 square miles in southern Kenya, near the Tanzania border. The Kenyan government protects the nature reserve's elephants from
or illegal hunting. Elephants have been hunted throughout history for the ivory in their tusks. Humans have used ivory to make jewelry and other objects. Today, elephants are an endangered species.
Since strict anti-poaching laws were put into effect in 1968, the number of elephants in Amboseli has risen from 500 to more than 1,200. When Colbeck began filming Echo's family in 1990, the family had only 14 members. Today it has 30 members.
Although the elephants still face some danger from the local Masai tribespeople, the creatures have become remarkably comfortable around human visitors. That makes Amboseli an ideal place for scientists to study elephant behavior.
""The elephants are totally relaxed about having vehicles in amongst the herd,"" says Colbeck. ""Nevertheless, it is still very important to respect the animals and not disturb them.  That respect develops into a trust, and in that way we have been able to document some extraordinary moments in their lives."" That trust has not only allowed Colbeck to film Echo's family, but it has also made him feel like one of the family.
The elephant families in Amboseli National Reserve are organized alphabetically. Echo's family is the ""E"" family, so every member of the family is given a name starting with
Here's how Echo fits in with some of her relatives.
(age 62): Echo is one of the oldest elephants in Amboseli. She is the leader of her family. You can tell that she is old by the length of her tusks. They are almost touching! Wild African elephants live an average of 60 years.
(died at age 34): She was Echo's eldest daughter. Erin died from a spear injury after she wandered too close to a watering hole protected by the local Masai people.

(age 17): When he was born, Ely couldn't walk. The family waited to move until he stood on his own. Now he lives alone. He left the herd at age 12.
(age 25): Edwina is Echo's first known grandchild.
(age 22): Eleanor helped care for Email after Erin died.
(age 6): Email's mother, Erin, died when he was 2. Now the rest of the family takes care of him.
(age 12): Europa is Echo's first known great-grandchild.
(age 8): Elaine is Echo's second great-granddaughter.

The poll found that at least 65 percent of Florida's voters favor new steps that would help protect the endangered manatees. Some of those steps include lowering the speed limit for boats in manatee zones, increasing fines for people who speed in manatee zones, limiting the amount of building along waterways where manatees are found, and creating additional protected areas for manatees.
""We are struck by [how far] Florida voters are willing to go to protect manatees,"" said Kate Stewart, who conducted the poll. She said the results also showed that ""boaters and non-boaters alike not just support but strongly support increased protection measures.""
Florida manatees live in the state's warm coastal and inland waters. The Save the Manatee Club says that the Florida manatee population has been shrinking since 1974, when scientists started keeping track.
Collisions with boats cause many manatee deaths. Since manatees swim slowly, they cannot get out of the way of a fast-moving boat. According to the Save the Manatee Club, 78 manatees were killed in collisions with boats in Florida waters last year. So far this year, at least 23 manatees have been killed in collisions.

The young artist from Idaho often writes poems to accompany her paintings. She has a book of poems coming out later this year. For National Poetry Month, which is celebrated in April, Weekly Reader (WR) spoke with Akiane about her talents. Here is what she had to say:
How old were you when you became interested in art and poetry?
I was almost 4 when I became interested in art. I started writing poetry when I was 6.
What are your favorite subjects to paint?
Where do you get the ideas for your paintings?
They come to me in my dreams. I get up at 5 o'clock every morning to work on my paintings and write poetry.
What do you enjoy most about painting? about poetry?
The colors! They're so beautiful. My poems explain the paintings.
What advice do you have for kids who might find writing poetry difficult?
It's really easy--just look at what's going on around you and concentrate on your feelings. Write how you feel.
I home-school. With home schooling, I have more time for painting and poetry.

About 600 Native Americans live in Supai. The town is located at the bottom of a canyon near the Grand Canyon.
Letter carrier Charlie Chamberlain loads packages on mules. The mules deliver mail to Supai, Arizona.
Before being delivered in Supai, mail arrives in the post office in Peach Springs, Arizona, about 70 miles from Supai. From Peach Springs, delivery trucks take the mail to the rim of the canyon. Letter carriers then use mules to carry the mail to Supai.
Letter carriers who deliver to Supai don't just carry letters and small packages; they deliver almost everything that goes to Supai.
""It's amazing what people can do when they put their minds to it,"" said Charlie Chamberlain, a letter carrier. ""They can pack things that you never would have thought of."" A washing machine is the most unusual item Charlie has delivered.

Adkins and Heller have built a new robot that is so small, it can sit on a dime. The tiny robot weighs less than 1 ounce, has tracks like those on a tank, and carries a camera. For power, it uses three button cells (the batteries in watches).
So far, the robot cannot do many tasks. Recently, the robot steered itself through a small maze, but it moved at only 20 inches per minute. ""It can't zip along as fast as a spider or ant yet,"" said Heller.
In the near future, however, Heller plans to make faster and smaller robots. He foresees swarms of miniature robots doing all kinds of tasks. Police officers could send the small robots after crooks, and the bad guys would never know they were being tailed. Repair workers could send worker robots into tight spaces.
Perhaps in the future, swarms of minirobots will do many of the tasks, such as housecleaning, that people do today.

This year's Summer Olympics will take place from August 13 through August 29 in Athens, the capital of Greece. The Summer Games are held every four years.
""This Olympic homecoming will be an opportunity to reawaken the true spirit and meaning of the Olympic Games,"" said an Athens organizing committee member.
The Olympic Games date back more than 2,700 years. They were first held in Olympia, an area west of Athens.
The first known Olympic competition included just one event-a 200-yard footrace. Winning athletes were crowned with a wreath of olive leaves.
Over the years, more events were added, such as wrestling, discus throwing, and chariot racing.
As times changed, the Olympics evolved. In 1896, the first modern Olympic Games began in Athens. At that time, 312 athletes from 13 countries competed in nine sports.
Now, more than a century later, 10,500 athletes from more than 200 countries will go for the gold. The athletes will compete in 28 events, including baseball, gymnastics, swimming, and tennis.

Around the rest of the city, workers are completing a railway system and tearing up narrow roads to widen them for traffic. Hotels and restaurants are getting ready for an influx of tourists. Topping the Olympic planners' list is making sure the city is secure for athletes and visitors.
Some people are concerned that Athens might not be ready for the Olympics. But the Greek government was quick to reassure: ""We will have everything ready when it matters. We will offer what the world expects of us.""

""What should I wear today?"" That's a question you might ask yourself in the morning. For some kids, the answer is the same every daya school uniform. Officials in Elmira, New York, are currently debating whether students should wear uniforms in the next school year. Uniforms would contribute to ""building pride within our school and community,"" Elmira Superintendent Raymond Bryant told

Uniforms make schools better places in which to learn, supporters say. They argue that dress codes often improve discipline and lessen bullying and teasing. ""I think [uniforms help] students focus on their academics and not the latest fashion,"" principal Megan Mannion told
Her school, Rankin Elementary School in Akron, Ohio, has had a uniform policy since 1995.
""The best thing I like about our uniform is the style, especially the shirts and sweaters,"" says Rankin fourth grader Clifton Harris. It's not just the look that makes the grade. Others argue that the new uniforms cut costs. ""You save money to buy casual clothes for home,"" adds Rankin student Asmar Epps.

""I think students should choose their own clothing styles, rather than be told to wear a specific uniform,"" fifth grader Kaylie Vilayvong from Aurora, Missouri, told
Her classmate Wade Fleetwood agrees. ""Kids should be allowed to wear different styles of clothes.""
Some parents are worried about the expense. Elmira would offer uniforms at a price between $16 and $26. ""What's the school district going to do for people who can't afford them?"" asked one Elmira father at a recent public meeting.

Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two major candidates for president stand on important issues. This week's issue is
In 2002, President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act. This education law provides states with government money so they can help improve their school systems.
The law is meant to ensure that schools are doing enough to help students who are struggling learners. Bush says that the law helps students perform better in reading and math. Under the law, schools are required to measure students' progress through testing. Schools in which many students don't perform well on the tests have two years to improve. Otherwise, students have the option to transfer to different schools.
Senator Kerry voted for the No Child Left Behind Act. If elected, he will continue to support this law. However, Kerry wants the government to give states more money to enforce the education law and make sure schools receive the money they need.
In addition, Kerry proposes to increase the number of high school graduates. To do that, he plans to reduce class sizes and break up large, failing high schools. He also wants to begin a program in which college students mentor (help) middle school students plan for their futures.

It's not surprising that fantasy has turned millions of kids into book-worms. ""Fantasy allows children to think about other worlds and contrast them to their own,"" says Allison. ""It stretches their imaginations.""
What exactly makes a story a fantasy? Traditionally, a fantasy tells the story of a single character, the hero, such as Harry Potter. Like Harry, the hero is often unaware of his or her power. After crossing into a different world, the hero is faced with a series of tests.
In a fantasy story, a teacher often shows the hero the tricks of the trade. In
, wise Gandalf protects the hobbit Frodo. Harry, too, is taught by Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts.
Fantasy books typically end with a battle between the hero and the villainand the hero ultimately wins. If Rowling sticks to the fantasy formula, will Harry defeat Lord Voldemort in Book 7 of the series?
The fantasy craze has also hit the big screen, with many books being made into films. Fans of
movies turned out in record numbers. This December, a film version of the classic C. S. Lewis book

Historians believe that colonists from England dug the well nearly 400 years ago. Shortly after the well was completed, it dried up. The colonists then used the well as a dump.
The historians have found a piece of old armor in the well. Studying the armor and other ""garbage"" from the well will help us learn about life in early Jamestown.
The history of Jamestown begins in England. On December 20, 1606, three ships sailed from England. The ships were bound for Virginia. After the colonists on the ships landed in Virginia, they built a fort. The colonists arrived in North America 14 years before the Pilgrims.
Most of the colonists came to Virginia to search for treasure. Most did not know how to grow crops to feed themselves. They became so hungry that they ate dogs, rats, and snakes.
Eventually, more people settled in Jamestown. They turned the fort into a town. The colonists began to grow and sell crops. The small fort became the first permanent English settlement in North America.
The ""garbage"" from the well is helping historians better understand how the colonists lived.
""When one stands at Jamestown today, it is hard to imagine how much hope, regret, fear, hatred, hunger, pain, and death were experienced at this place,"" historian Ivor Noel Hume wrote of the fort's earliest colonists.

shows that about 17,000 school busrelated accidents occur each year. Thats more than double previous estimates. Those injuries range from cuts to broken bones.
Researchers reported that crashes arent causing all those bumps and bruises. Slips and falls, getting jostled during stops and turns, and roughhousing are other ways kids get hurt. Nearly one-quarter of those injuries occur when kids are getting on and off buses.
Though the numbers are higher than thought, they represent a small fraction of kids. There are about 24 million kids who travel on school buses each year. School buses are still the safest way for kids to ride to school, according to the National School Transportation Association.
The results may prompt stronger arguments for requiring safety belts on buses. But not all safety experts agree. Seat belts wouldnt reduce injuries and wouldnt be worth the added expense for school districts, says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Some of the Army's top scientists have been trying to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for four years. The Army's sandwiches have to taste good and last for three years without refrigeration.
Army scientists have already made pepperoni and barbecue chicken sandwiches. They used special chemicals to keep the sandwiches fresh.
The sandwiches ""will last a minimum of three years at 80 degrees and six months at 100 degrees. They will travel to the swampiest swamp, the highest mountain, the most arid desert,"" said one army scientist.
Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches pose a special problem. Mold keeps growing on them.
Mold or no mold, some soldiers say the long-lasting sandwiches leave a bad taste in their mouths. ""I don't think I've ever wanted a sandwich that's that old,"" said Master Sergeant Kelly Tyler.

Such legends are important to native Hawaiians. Today, however, ancient gods are a part of a fiery debate in this land of spirits.
Mauna Kea is an extinct, or dead, volcano on the island of Hawaii. According to an ancient Hawaiian saying, Mauna Kea ""is the astonishing mountain that stands in the calm."" These days the 13,700-foot-high peak is anything but calm.
, scientists who study space, say the mountain peak is a perfect spot to place telescopes.
Currently, scientists use 13 telescopes in a special 11,000-acre area called the Science Reserve on Mauna Kea. Using those telescopes, scientists have made several important astronomical discoveries. The scientists who use the telescopes pay a fee to the University of Hawaii, which built the observatories.
The use of the mountain for scientific research, however, is the source of a debate between scientists and some native Hawaiians. Some Hawaiians believe that the top of Mauna Kea is sacred, or an important place to their religion. They believe that the peak is the home of the snow goddess Poli'ahu.
According to officials at the Center for Hawaiian Studies, the university is making money from the site without sharing much of the money with native Hawaiians.
""We don't get a penny from Mauna Kea, and it's our land,"" said Jon Osorio, of the Center for Hawaiian Studies.
University officials say that a master plan, completed in June, addresses native Hawaiian concerns. The goals of the plan include educating people about Mauna Kea. It also states how many telescopes the university can build in the future.
According to observers, the debate will not end soon. A 1968 agreement gives the university control of the area until 2033. Until then, native Hawaiians will fight for what is theirs while scientists keep studying the skies.

The map shows Earth's southernmost continent, Antartica. A hole in the ozone layer opens above Antartica each year.
Scientists say a hole has formed in the ozone layer above the South Pole every July for at least 15 years. Each year, the hole grows, reaching its largest size in September and October. The hole then shrinks and finally disappears in November and December.
This year, the hole was larger than ever. It covered an area of more than 11 million square miles. That's much larger than the combined areas of Antarctica and Australia!
The hole was so large that, for the first time ever, the health of thousands of people who live in southern South America was threatened.

: How is Chamber of Secrets different from the first movie?
: Harry changes a lot in the second film. In the first film, Harry learns about hate. In the second film, he learns how to deal with hate and has to explore his own emotions. He learns that he has something in common with Lord Voldemort, and he has to cope with that.
: Did you learn any new skills?
: I learned how to sword fight. But Rupert [another child actor in the movie] learned how to drive a car for the flying-car scene. Unfortunately, I didn't get to learn to drive because I was in the passenger seat. We try to make it look realistic.
: How did you film the movie and go to school at the same time?
: I go to school three hours a day, every day. I have a fantastic teacher.
: How have your friends and family reacted to your fame?
: They don't treat me any differently. They see me as Dan. I wouldn't want my friends to see me as Harry.
: In what ways has your life changed since the first movie came out?
: It really hasn't changed that much. I am often recognized as Harry Potter. But I don't mind that.
: When you grow up, do you want to continue acting?
: I think I will take it one film at a time. After this film, I will do the third [Harry Potter] film. After that, we will see how it goes.
If you could play a role in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which role would you play? Why?
: What have you learned about making movies that you didn't know before you played Harry Potter?
: It's hard work. It is a lot of fun, but at the same time it's really a challenge.
: If you could play another character in the movie, who would you like to play?

Florida Everglades National Park covers more than 100,000 acres of swampland in southern Florida.
What do the Florida Everglades, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, and Kathmandu, Nepal, have in common? More than you might think!

That isnt the only thing the landmarks share. Experts say the Everglades, the Great Barrier Reef, and Kathmandu are in trouble and should be closed off by 2020.
are endangering the landmarks, warns a new report by the Centre for Future Studies (CFS). Global warming is the gradual rise in Earths average temperature.
""The combined impact of too many tourists stomping all over these important sites plus climate change is having a severe [effect],"" Susi Moser, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told
The last nine years were the hottest since scientists began tracking Earths temperature in 1861. Some scientists say global warming will create more
or powerful, hurricanes. Researchers predict that the heat will cause glaciers in the Antarctic to melt. That will cause ocean levels to rise.
Those changes could destroy the Everglades, the CFS report says. Stronger hurricanes could threaten the areas plant and animal species, including American crocodiles and manatees. Rising seawater could flood the swampy region.
Its important to protect the 2,358-square-mile landmark, Jan Michael Jacobson, director of the Everglades Institute, told
""The Everglades primarily is valuable because it is a unique habitat,"" he said.
The historic temples of Kathmandu, Nepal, were built between 1300 and 1800. They draw millions of tourists each year.
The Great Barrier Reef and Kathmandu are facing a different threattourists. The Great Barrier Reef attracts about 1.8 million tourists a year, who pump billions of dollars into Australias economy. Visitors can also damage the delicate system of coral reefs.
Tourists are endangering Kathmandu, too, CFS officials say. The valley is in the shadow of Mount Everest, the worlds tallest mountain. The report warns that skiers and climbers hoping to tackle Mount Everest and other Himalayan peaks may harm Kathmandus ancient temples.
The effects of global warming are already being felt. More than 150 countries are working to stop the rising temperatures. They have
emissions. Those gases contribute to global warming.
As for the Great Barrier Reef and Kathmandu, the CFS report recommends limiting the number of tourists allowed to visit the sites. But some people say that visiting endangered landmarks could encourage tourists to fight for their protection.
Many cars and factories burn fossil fuels. That releases greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the air. Those gases form a layer and trap the suns heat close to Earth.
That process is called the greenhouse effect. The layer of gases acts as a window in a greenhouse doesit lets in heat but doesnt let much out. The result is global warming, a worldwide rise in average temperature.
There are 788 World Heritage Sites, but becoming one is not easy. Landmarks must meet one of 10 requirements. For instance, a site must represent a unique culture or a significant period in history. Independent groups
or examine, each landmark. Then an international committee, which is part of the United Nations, votes on the new sites. The Great Wall of China and the Statue of Liberty are included on the list.

555,"Dodging Danger: Should Dodgeball Be Tossed Out of School?
For many kids, dodgeball is a harmless game. But gym teacher Neil Williams does not see anything ""harmless"" about the game.
Recently, Williams recalled an accident that happened during his first year teaching. His students were playing dodgeball. Suddenly, the ball slammed into one girl's face, smashing her nose. The girl had to be taken to the hospital.
Soon after that, Williams started a campaign to ban dodgeball from schools. Some schools in several states have already banned the game.
The object of dodgeball is to get other players out by hitting them with a ball. Critics of the game say that it teaches violence. ""The game allows the stronger kids to pick on and target the weaker kids,"" Williams told
Judith Young is the executive director of the National Association for Sport and Physical Education. She told
the game doesn't belong in school. ""I don't have a problem with the game at backyard picnics and parties,"" she said. ""I just don't think it should be used in phys-ed classes.""
Rick Hanetho strongly disagrees. He likes dodgeball so much that he started the National Amateur Dodgeball Association.
Hanetho says dodgeball teaches kids important skills. ""It teaches eye-hand coordination, decision making, concentration, and agility,"" he said.
Hanetho also says that dodgeball does not encourage bullying. ""I don't buy the idea that dodgeball allows some kids to pick on the smaller and weaker kids,"" he said. ""In fact, it's the littler kids who are usually the best players. They are faster and can avoid being hit.""
Here's what some kids have to say about dodgeball:
Isabela, age 11: A dodgeball isn't hard and it can't hurt anyone.
Paloma, age 9: I like dodgeball. You get to run around a lot and that's a lot of fun.
Liliam, age 9: Dodgeball is great because you get to throw the ball at other kids.
Mara: age 10: Some kids don't like dodgeball because they get hit at the beginning of the game. But I like it.

This has some kids and parents upset. They argue that the companies selling the mini motorcycles dont inform buyers that they cant be ridden on public streets.
Fisher says the majority of pocket bike riders on the street are 9 and 10 years old. Officials in some states are working to pass laws to limit who can ride the bikes. The officials say that kids should have to wait until they have a drivers license.
Pocket bike racing has been a popular sport in Europe. It has caught on in some communities in the United States during the past few years.

To the spectators below, Bello's stunt looked dangerous-and it was. But Bello knew a secret. He was using science to help keep himself safe.
Bello began performing circus stunts when he was 9 years old. He walked on a thin wire that was stretched 9 feet off the ground.
To stay on a wire without falling, Bello needs to keep his center of gravity low. An object's center of gravity is usually located in the middle of the object. That is where the object's weight is centered.
By crouching and keeping low, Bello keeps his center of gravity low. The lower his center of gravity, the harder it is for Bello to fall.
Bello often carries a heavy metal stick when he performs. The stick bends downward, lowering his center of gravity.
Bello also uses Newton's first law of motion when he performs. That law is named for Isaac Newton. He was a scientist who lived about 275 years ago.
Newton's first law of motion says that a moving object will keep moving unless an outside force acts on it. (The law also says that an object at rest will stay that way unless an outside force acts on it.) Bello uses that law when he rides his
As Bello speeds along on his tiny bike, he sometimes has to stop before slamming into a wall. To stop, Bello uses the bike's brakes. The brakes create

The bears are back after being on the brink of extinction in and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is located in the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana.
Now the U.S. government may remove the grizzly from its list of endangered species in this area. ""The future of the Yellowstone grizzly bears is bright,"" says Chris Servheen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
That wasnt always the case. The numbers of grizzlies began to shrink in the early 1900s largely because ranchers hunted the animals and farmers destroyed their
By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears still lived in the Yellowstone area. That year, the grizzly was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which offers special protection to animals facing extinction. Today, wildlife experts estimate that more than 600 bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone.
Grizzly bears live in other parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as well as Washington state and will remain on the list in those areas. Grizzlies in Alaska, which number about 30,000, have never been on the list because that population is healthy.
Its Not Time Yet Not everyone thinks its a good decision to remove grizzlies from the list. Some wildlife officials fear that if the bear is removed from the list, its habitat around Yellowstone could be used for logging, oil drilling, and development. Others worry that the bears will be hunted again. ""We would love to see the grizzly bear delisted, but its not ready,"" says wildlife supporter Louisa Wilcox. ""If you want to protect bears for future generations, you have to protect the habitat they need. This plan doesnt do it.""
Should grizzlies no longer be listed as an endangered species? Why or why not?
The grizzlys return isnt the only species success story. Take a look at some other animals that are being saved, thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists.

696,"History in the Making: Three Days of Peace and Music
Woodstock was a large music festival held in the rural town of Bethel, New York, in 1969. At that time, the United States was divided over the war in Vietnam and the struggle for civil rights. Adam interviewed Michael Lang, one of the organizers of the concert.
When did you come up with the idea for the Woodstock Music and Art Fair?
In the winter of 1968. I was 23 or 24.
How did you get big stars to come to the concert?
Woodstock sounded like an event nobody wanted to miss, and the name Woodstock in those days was known. It was the home of Bob Dylan, Janice Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and other cultural icons. Initially, it was all about making everyone believe that these people were going to come and that I could get everyone to come. Soon, through word of mouth, bands were calling us.
Did you have any idea that so many people would show up?
In the beginning, we planned on 200,000, but officially we were trying to get a permit for only 50,000. In the end, we had somewhere between 500,000 and 600,000, but more than 1 million who tried to come were turned away. They had to close the [New York State] Thruway and the Canadian border.
Why did you choose Woodstock as the site, and why did you decide to keep the name Woodstock even after you ended up holding the festival 60 miles away, in Bethel?
We had to move to Bethel because we could not find a largeenough place in Woodstock. A lot of people tried to convince me to change the name [of the festival] to Bethel, but I felt the name reflected the spirit of what we were trying to do, which was to create an atmosphere of artistic community. Woodstock always stood for that.
Why are people still talking about Woodstock today?
What made Woodstock unique was how many people came and how well they treated each other. The world was shocked to discover that a crowd of more than 500,000 could live together for three days in a field and treat each other with love and respect. This was set against a backdrop of the war in Vietnam, ... a battle for civil rights and women's rights, and a yearning for peace in the world. The people who came to Woodstock accomplished all of these things, at least for that period of time, so it gave people hope for their future.
The interview taught me that a lot of musicians were activists. I also learned that no matter how prepared you are, you also have to

According to Hirsch, tissues of the nose expand when a person tells a fib, causing the nose to itch. That may be why many people scratch their noses when they lie. That urge to scratch has been called ""the Pinocchio effect.""

689,"Great whites are endangered. They are often hunted for their teeth and fins.
A great white shark cruised across the Indian Ocean in a record-breaking swim. The great white became the first shark known to complete a round-trip journey between two continents.
""This is the first time that an individual fish has been found to go across an entire ocean and come back to the same spot,"" says Ramn Bonfil, one of the scientists who studied the shark. Scientists named the shark Nicole, after Australian actor Nicole Kidman.
Nicole not only set a distance record but also took a bite out of the speed record. The great white clocked more than 12,400 miles on her trip from South Africa to Australia and back. She
or moved between locations, faster than any other marine animal.
The map shows Nicoles route between South Africa and Australia.
Great whites live mainly off the coasts of California, South Africa, and Australia. Nicoles 99-day journey was tracked with an electronic tag placed on her fin.
The tag recorded her movements, including how deep she dove in the water. The results stunned scientists. They discovered that there is more interaction among great white populations in Africa and Australia than had previously been thought.
The new find is helping scientists learn more about how sharks migrate and
(find their way). Why might Nicole have swum so far so fast? Scientists dont know for sure, but they think one of the reasons that she may have made the trip was a search for food. Great white sharks feed mainly on whales, seals, and fish.
And how did Nicole find her way from one continent to another? Although she frequently plunged to depths of more than one-half mile, Nicole spent most of her time swimming on the surface. That led scientists to suspect that great whites might use the sun and the moon to help navigate.
The recent discoveries have excited shark lovers. ""Its clear that we have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg,"" says Bonfil. ""There is still much to learn about great white shark migrations.""
Great whites arent the only big fish in the sea. There are about 370 species, or types, of sharks. Here are some sharks that make a splash.
The whale shark grows up to 40 feet long and weighs about 15 tons. Thats heavier than two elephants!
The dwarf lantern shark is thought to be one of the smallest sharks. It is about 6 inches long.
Although most sharks swim about 1.5 miles per hour (mph), the mako shark is thought to cruise around at 22 mph.
The dusky shark has the most powerful bite. Its jaws clamp together with 132 pounds of force.

Scientist Ken Longenecker is on a missionto figure out what is killing the Hawaiian monk seal. ""These guys are on the brink, honestly,"" he recently told reporters while sorting through a pile of stinky fish bones. The bones were all that remained from the meal of a monk seal.
The 600-pound animals are fast disappearing from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, their main
or natural home. Longenecker and other researchers think the seals are not getting enough food, and they are desperately trying to figure out why. ""The clock is ticking,"" says scientist Jen Palmer.
Between the 1950s and 1970s, the monk seal population plummeted. The major threats were habitat loss and deadly runins with fishing gear. Today, there are about 1,200 monk seals, but experts fear that the population will dip below 1,000 in the next five years. Although the seals habitat is now protected by law, their numbers have failed to rebound.
However, scientists are now looking at the seals diet in the hopes it will give them clues about how to save the animals. Part of Longeneckers job is to figure out what the animals are eating. Other scientists are also tracking monk seals and monitoring their habitat for pollution.

(veh-SOO-vee-uhss) majestically stands over the Italian landscape. The scenic mountain rises 4,200 feet high southeast of the city of Naples, which is located in southern Italy. But many people living in this region fear Mount Vesuvius. That's because it is an active volcano.
Nearly 2,000 years ago, Vesuvius exploded with tremendous force. Deadly smoke, gases, and rock shot more than 9 miles high in the air. That is about one and a half times the height of Mount Everest, the world's tallest mountain.
A thick black cloud engulfed the region and blocked out the sun. An avalanche of boiling
poured from the volcano at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. Lava is melted rock from a volcano.
The explosion sealed the ancient city of Pompeii (pahm-PAY) under a blanket of rock and ash. A mudslide wiped out the nearby town of Herculaneum (her-kyuh-LAY-nee-uhm). Many people died as a result of the volcano's fury.
Although many eruptions have occurred since then, Vesuvius hasn't exploded with such force since that devastating day. The last major eruption occurred in 1944.
Scientists warn, though, that it's only a matter of time before Mount Vesuvius erupts with tremendous force again. ""It won't be tomorrow, it won't be next month, and maybe it won't be next year,"" a scientist who monitors the volcano told
. ""But [Vesuvius] is overdue [to explode].""
Today, nearly 600,000 people live in the 18 towns surrounding Vesuvius. This high-risk area is known as the ""red zone.""
Officials estimate that they would need two weeks to evacuate all the people living in the red zone. According to scientists, anything within 4 miles of Vesuvius could be destroyed during the first 15 minutes of an eruption.
The volcano's past, however, hasn't stopped people from moving into the area. In fact, Italian officials are concerned about the overcrowding of people in the red zone. To encourage people to move away from this area, they have put a plan in place.
Some families are being offered $36,000 to move to safer locations. The goal is to persuade about 150,000 families to move from the area near the volcano within the next 15 years.
In 1995, the government also created a national park near the top of Vesuvius. That limits the number of people living there.
""Vesuvius is the most dangerous volcano in the world on account of the number of people living under it,"" said the president of the Naples region. ""The smaller the population, the smaller the danger Vesuvius represents.""

That prompted the group of Florida students to write letters to local lawmakers. They also collected signatures and even wrote a song about the fruit.
The students saw the ""fruits"" of their labor. In May, Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, signed the orange bill into law at their school. He sat in a room full of crates of oranges surrounded by a dozen students in bright orange shirts. ""We made history,"" Kia Gentile, 11, told

720,"People often take trips on our nation's roads and highways. But recently, several sections of an old road went on a trip of their own.
Last month, workers in Oklahoma loaded about a dozen pieces of historic Route 66 onto trucks. Each of the 3,000-pound pieces then made a 1,400-mile trip to Washington, D.C., where they will become part of an exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
Route 66 has been called the ""Main Street of America."" It once stretched 2,400 miles, from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California. The road connected eight states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
In the 1920s, engineer Cyrus Stevens Avery of Tulsa, Oklahoma, envisioned a road connecting the Midwest and the Pacific Ocean. During the 1930s, Route 66 was completed and was soon lined with hundreds of businesses.
The road became so popular that it inspired a 1960s TV show,
, as well as a famous song, ""Get Your Kicks on Route 66.""
In the past few decades, however, Route 66 has fallen into disrepair, and parts of the old route have been dug up. Today, drivers use faster superhighways to get where they were going.
Even though fewer people drive on Route 66 now, many people still think of the road as the Main Street of America. That's why the National Museum of American History wants to include the road in its new exhibit, ""America on the Move."" The exhibit is scheduled to open in 2003.

: Tell us about someone who is a hero to you and why that person is a hero.
: My parents [are my heroes] because they gave me unconditional love when I was growing up. They were great role models for raising my own daughters.
: What was your favorite subject in school and why?
: American and European history [were my favorites]. I believe that understanding the past helps us better understand and deal with situations happening in today's world.
: What do you think is the biggest change between being a kid when you were growing up and being a kid now?
: I think life was simpler when I was a kid growing up in a small west Texas town called Midland. We were outdoors a lot--riding our bicycles everywhere, playing sports, swapping baseball cards, going to barbecues in each other's backyards. Everyone in the neighborhood looked out for each other, and if you did something wrong, then your friend's mom or dad--even the school football coach--would call you on it.
: Your father, George Bush, was president. What is it like to have a former president as a dad?
: My father is a wonderful role model and a loving dad, and his example has inspired me in many ways. My father taught me to appreciate and learn from history. By studying the careers of talented Americans who entered government, I learned that dedicated public servants can help people.
: Why do you want to be president?
: I want to be president because I want America to be a place where every child is loved and educated and where every one of our citizens is able to achieve his or her greatest potential.

Japanese scientists introduced ASIMO (ah-SEE-moh), the world's first stair-climbing robot, in 2000. The 4-foot, 115-pound ASIMO's many talents include walking, holding objects, speaking Japanese, and recognizing faces. ASIMO recently finished a world tour. The tour included several stops in U.S. cities so kids and adults could learn more about it.
Like ASIMO, QRIO (KYOOR-ee-oh), can talk and recognize faces. QRIO, which was unveiled in Japan in December 2003, can also run, jump, throw a ball, dance, and even belt out a tune.
In March, QRIO conducted Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in Japan. Before the rehearsal in front of a live audience, the robot grumbled, ""I'm feeling nervous.""
Today, robots come in all shapes and sizes. Many robots are used in factories. They help build cars, inspect computer parts, and package food. Robots speed up production on assembly lines and help save companies both time and money.
Robots also perform tasks that are difficult or dangerous for humans. Robots have explored the far reaches of space and traveled into active volcanoes.
that when robots were first introduced in the 1960s, they performed only jobs that were ""dirty, difficult, and dangerous."" That, however, is starting to change. Today's engineers hope that the new breed of humanoid robots will improve people's lives.
Many people are excited that humanoid robots may one day be able to lift people confined to beds or wheelchairs. The robots may also be able to help elderly people with chores such as vacuuming and taking out the garbage. Some people, however, worry that robots may take away jobs that are now performed by humans.
Although the humanoid robots have been busy making public appearances, they aren't for sale yet. If you really want a robot that will clean your room and help out with chores, you still have to wait a bit longer.

Our classroom play celebrates Philadelphia's hometown hero. Discover how his hard work helped to improve the lives of all Americans.
Honor the 300th birthday of one of our countrys greatest thinkers, inventors, and statesmen with our classroom play.
Each morning, Benjamin Franklin asked himself, ""What good shall I do today?"" And that is how he lived his life.
His can-do attitude launched him into the history books as one of Americas most famous citizens. Ben was a printer, a writer, an inventor, a community leader, and a founder of our nation.
Ben was born in a cottage in Boston on January 17, 1706. He attended school only between the ages of 8 and 10. Bens education was cut short because his family was poor and needed him to work.
His love of learning, however, stayed with him throughout his life. Ben read all the time. He often went without food to buy books! At 12, he began his lifelong love of printing.
In honor of the 300th anniversary of Bens birth, our three-act play looks at some key events in the life of this great American. Find out how his good deeds helped shape the history of our country.
ACT 1: Ben the Young Man, Boston, 1718-1723
Bens older brother, James, owns a printing press that publishes a very popular newspaper,
In 1718, Bens father decides that 12-year-old Ben should work for James.
At that time, Ben signs a document promising he will work for his brother until he is 21, without pay. In return, his brother is to provide Ben with food and clothes.
Ben likes to read and is a good editor and proofreader. Over the next few years, he learns all about printingand even begins writing letters to the newspaper under a different name. Thanks to Bens sense of humor and clever writing in those letters,
becomes one of the most-read newspapers in Boston.
James finds out that the letters are from his brother and he becomes jealous of Ben. James is furious and vows never to publish any of Bens writing again. He also finds fault with Bens work, even though Ben rarely makes errors.
I know I am a better printer than he is.
You cant leave! You have to work for me until you are 21!
Youll never find a job in this city! Youll come crawling back to me.
But Ben never comes back to his brother. Instead, he leaves in the early morning and runs away to New York City, in hopes of finding work as a printer. After not finding a job there, he heads to New Jersey where he boards a boat to Philadelphia.
The journey is three days long, and Ben is dirty, hungry, and penniless. But Philadelphia is a lively city, and Ben loves it.
ACT 2: Ben the Community Leader, Philadelphia, 1723-1740s
After arriving in Philadelphia, Ben works to establish himself as a printer. In 1728, he opens a printing shop and begins publishing his own newspaper,
A few years later, he also publishes
The book includes weather forecasts, recipes, and jokes. It also contains some of Bens sayings, such as ""Well done is better than well said."" The almanac becomes a best seller and makes Ben wealthy.
Although Ben works to better himself,it is also important to him to help the community. He considers Philadelphia his hometown and works to make life in the city better.
Ben starts projects to pave and sweep Philadelphias streets. He redesigns the citys streetlights so that roads are safe at night.
Ben also helps set up the first public library, hospital, and volunteer fire department. At this time, most houses in Philadelphia are made of wood and stand side by side. When a fire breaks out, it can destroy an entire neighborhood.
Extra! Extra! Fire destroys row houses on Market Street!
We need to train men to fight fires so that this doesnt keep happening.
Ben persuades more than 30 men to form the Union Fire Company.
We nominate Ben as our fire chief.
Ben is appointed fire chief. He makes sure that firefighters are trained to put out fires and rescue people.
(dragging a leather bucket full of water)

The Union Fire Company meets once a month to discuss fire prevention. Ben also publishes fire prevention tips in his newspaper.
Bens ideas for Philadelphia help shape how fire departments, hospitals, libraries, and post offices work in other cities.
ACT 3: Ben the Statesman, Philadelphia, 1776
Along with his work in Philadelphia, Ben helps change the course of American history.
At the time, America is made up of 13 Colonies ruled by Britain. England has passed many laws that the Colonists think are unfair.
Ben works to mend the relationship between the Colonies and Britains ruler, King George III.
Despite his efforts, the Colonies decide to break away from Britain. They fight Britain in the Revolutionary War (1775-1783).
Ben is appointed to the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence. This document frees the Colonies from Britains rule.
We have to decide who should write the Declaration of Independence.
I wont. Many people disagree with my opinions.
I cant. I am not a writer.
I am unsure about independence from Britain.
You must write this very important document. Your writing style is perfect.
When Thomas Jefferson finishes his draft, he shows it to Ben.
Ive made small changes. For example, you wrote, sacred and undeniable, and I changed that phrase to make it stronger.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.
On July 4, a group of representatives from the 13 Colonies approve the Declaration of Independence and some people sign the document.
This for King George, so he can read it without his glasses.
On August 2, Ben and others also sign the document. They know they are risking everything for freedom from Britain.
Seven years later, in 1783, Ben negotiates the treaty that ends the Revolutionary War. In 1787, at age 81, he signs the U.S. Constitution.
Ben Franklin dies on April 17, 1790, at the age of 84. He is buried in Philadelphia. In honor of the 300th anniversary of his birth, people across the country will celebrate the life of this remarkable man.
If you could award a medal to Ben Franklin for one of his achievements, which accomplishment would it be? Why?

Today, ancient Assur is in ruins. Desert sand has covered over much of the 3,500-year-old city. Now Assur faces a new threat: water.
Assur is located in what is now Iraq, a country in the Middle East. Many parts of Iraq are covered by desert. Water is hard to find in the desert areas. To increase the amount of water, Iraqi officials are building a dam on the river Tigris.
The dam will trap the river's water. As the water rises, it might flood Assur and many other nearby ancient ruins.
Scientists worry that floodwaters will destroy artifacts hidden beneath the desert sand. Assur has already been the site of some amazing discoveries.
Scientists recently discovered four hidden tombs at Assur. They found ancient coffins, gold, jewelry, and gems. They also dug up the remains of two ancient Assurian queens.
Scientists used modern medical equipment to study the queens' bodies. They learned about some of the medical problems the ancient queens suffered from. The bodies showed evidence of dental cavities, sinus infections, and poor nutrition.
Michael Mller-Karpe, a scientist who studies ancient Assyria, said, ""The Assyrian queens have just begun to speak to us, and we are looking forward to more answers.""
Mller-Karpe and other scientists worry that the new dam may keep them from getting more answers. Even if the new dam doesn't flood Assur, the rising water could damage the ancient city. Moisture could cause the artifacts to crumble.
""You can't save Assur if it's [near] a dam,"" said scientist Peter Miglus. The soil beneath the ancient city would soak up water like a sponge. The water in the soil would destroy what's left of ancient Assur.
For now, scientists are scrambling to uncover the secrets hidden for centuries in Assur and other nearby communities. Meanwhile, some people are looking for ways to save the ancient cities. ""We don't want the slightest damage to Assur,"" one Iraqi official said.

Rats have always lived in cities. The rodents live off food and waste that people throw away. Recently, however, rat populations have grown because many communities don't have the money to pay for rat-control programs, said Jerry Hershovitz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Such programs keep rat populations down.
Rats can carry diseases that can make people seriously ill, so controlling the rat population is important.
The solution to the rat problem is to limit their food supply, say experts. For example, people in cities should use garbage cans that rats cannot get into.

, which happen when power companies turn off electricity in an area for a short time.
Several factors contributed to the shortage, said Lawrence J. Makovich, a scientist who studies energy use. One problem is that California doesn't have enough power plants to supply all the electricity the Sunshine State needs. In addition, prices have risen for the fuels used in power plants to produce electricity, Makovich said.
The energy crisis may become worse this summer as Californians turn on air conditioners. According to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the state will probably be 10 percent short of the amount of electricity it needs.
This summer, the electricity crunch may spread to other parts of the country. In some areas, prices for electricity have been on the rise.
Many states are taking steps to solve the shortage. In California, Gov. Gray Davis is urging people to save energy.
""Yes, we have a power shortage, but we are far from powerless,"" Davis said. ""By reducing our electricity demand by even a small amount, we can reduce the price, avoid shortages, and lower energy bills.""

Mennig saw a bright object streak through the sky. ""It looked like a plane that was totally engulfed in flames,"" he said.
The flaming object Mennig saw was not a burning plane. It was a meteor burning up in Earth's atmosphere.
A meteor is a piece of rock or metal from space that burns up as it streaks through Earth's atmosphere. Because meteors look like stars falling or streaking across the sky, many people call them shooting stars.
According to officials at the U.S. Department of Defense, the bright meteor, which is called a fireball, entered Earth's atmosphere above Scranton, Pa. People from Canada to Virginia saw the bright fireball.
Scientists said the meteor exploded somewhere near Williamsport, Pa. No one was hurt by the fireball and no homes were damaged. But eyewitnesses later described a layer of gray ash and damaged plants in a cornfield.
According to scientists, meteors streak through Earth's atmosphere every day, but most burn up before hitting the ground. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is now studying ways to prevent large meteors from hitting Earth.
Observers not only saw the fireball, they heard it as well. As the fireball raced through the atmosphere, it produced a loud noise.
""There were two monstrous booms followed by a long rumbling and this great shaking. It knocked pictures off walls,"" said Anna Jean Edkin, a safety official in Anthony Township, Pa.

200,"Scientists recently discovered three previously unknown species of mouse lemurs. The find is important, because the numbers of lemurs left in the wild is dwindling.
Scientists found the lemurs on Madagascar, an island nation off the southeast coast of Africa. Madagascar is home to more than 30 species of lemurs. Most lemurs are the size of small rodents, but some can grow to be as large as a medium-sized dog. Lemurs are usually
animals, which means they mostly sleep during the day and come out at night.
The discovery surprised scientists. ""It's incredibly rare to discover a new species of primate, let alone three new species,"" said Steven Goodman of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.
Lemurs live only in the island nations of Madagascar and Comoros.
The smallest lemur weighs about 1 ounce.
The newly discovered species live only in the rain forests along Madagascar's west coast. They weigh a few ounces and eat beetles, fruits, and plants.
All lemurs on Madagascar are in trouble, however. Scientists fear that lemurs are in danger of becoming extinct.
One threat is from people cutting down the trees in which lemurs live. The trees are being cleared to create farmland. Another threat to lemurs comes from hunters who are trapping the primates for food.
To protect lemurs and the rain forests in which they live, wildlife officials in Madagascar have set up special parks and nature reserves. Loggers and hunters cannot cut down the trees or hunt the animals in the nature reserves.
Scientists hope that the special areas are large enough to protect all the species of lemurs that are living today. Scientists are especially concerned because there may be undiscovered species that need protection. ""So many areas of Madagascar haven't been [explored],"" said Dean Gibson of the Duke University Primate Center. ""I think there are more [species] to find.""

The contest asked kids to write an essay that answered this question: Which of seven American values-loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, or courage-is the most important in your daily life? Those seven American values are the core values of the U.S. Army.
David chose selfless service as the most important value in his life. David wrote that the other six values are part of selfless service. ""It is most important in my everyday life because it incorporates all the other values.""
David; his younger brother, Andrew; and his parents traveled from their home in Spanish Fork, Utah, to Washington, D.C., to get his prize. On November 11, they attended the Veterans Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery.
The next day, David was made honorary mayor of the Pentagon. He toured the Pentagon, where he met Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard Myers.

While she was standing at the kitchen sink, Yano heard the music she had been struggling with being played. When she went back, she saw Sho playing the piano. When Yano asked Sho what he was playing, he said, ""Mommy's music. I saw it. I know it.""
As Sho grew up, he showed that he was also an excellent student, finishing high school by the age of 9.
Last fall, Sho enrolled at Loyola University in Chicago, Illinois, near his home. He's believed to be the youngest full-time college student in the United States. He hopes to graduate from college by age 12.
What does Sho want to be when he grows up? ""I want to study
and find a cure for diseases such as AIDS,"" Sho said. Genetics is a science that studies living things, where they come from, and how they are different.
Sho isn't the only kid in college. Twelve-year-old Jessica Meeker goes to Pennsylvania State University. Greg Smith was 10 when he started his first year at Randolph-Macon College in Virginia.
Many people, however, wonder whether young kids should go to college. Some doctors say children in college miss out on having fun as kids.
Dr. Stan Katz, a scientist in California, says it's important for kids to ""go through...child[hood]."" Katz said there are plenty of doctors and scientists who didn't go to college as kids but were successful anyway.
Dr. Sharon Hirsh, a doctor at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, says that college is good for superbright kids. She said. ""One of the things about smart kids is that they aren't challenged in regular schools.""
Sho doesn't think he's missing any of his childhood by being in college. Besides, he says, at college he can study music, his other favorite subject. ""Someday,"" he said, ""I want to be a composer.""

552,"For more than 12 years, violent conflict has plagued Azerbaijan (a-zuhr-bigh-JAHN), a country in southwest Asia between Iran and Russia. For much of that time, Azerbaijan has been fighting with neighboring Armenia.
Now Farid Dadashev, age 11, is doing something to stop the fighting.
A few years ago, Farid said, ""I don't want to be a soldier when I grow up. I want to be a teacher."" Because of that desire for a peaceful life, Farid started the Child Peace Network. He sent out a petition to kids calling for peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia. So far, 10,000 kids from three countries have signed that petition.
In January, Farid traveled to the United Nations (U.N.) in New York City to talk about how the kids in his country are suffering from the war.
Azerbaijan and Armenia have been fighting over a region called Nagorno-Karabakh. Both countries claim the region belongs to them. Most of the people who live in that region are Armenian, and in 1988, the people of Nagorno-Karabakh began asking for independence or to join Armenia.
In 1991, that request turned into a bloody conflict between the two countries. The fighting lasted until 1994, when a cease-fire was declared. Although the cease-fire continues, the two sides have not settled their differences, and fighting still breaks out.
""The war affects everyone in Azerbaijan,"" Elmira Suleymanova, Farid's grandmother, told
from her home in Baku, Azerbaijan. ""No one can feel safe. One night, an entire community was burned to the ground.""
According to the U.N., the years of fighting have left 1 million people homeless. About 30 percent of those refugees are kids under age 15, said Farid.
No one knows if Farid's petition has had an impact on the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But last month, the leaders of the two countries met to discuss peace.

Can a windup laptop make learning easier for children in poor areas of the world? The team behind the One Laptop per Child program hopes so. The groups goal is to provide up to 7 million students in Thailand, Nigeria, Brazil, and Argentina with laptop computers.
The governments of those countries would buy the low-cost laptops. Called ""the green machine,"" each computer will cost about $100. The lime-green machines are powered with a windup crank that produces electricity. They are designed that way because many poor areas dont have electric power.
Beginning this month and into November, 500 children in Thailand will receive computers. Thailands prime minister said his government plans to provide each elementary student in Thailand with a free computer ""because books will be found and can be read on computers.""

545,"Should We Go Back to the Moon?
The new spacecraft is like Apollo, ""But bigger.""
NASA hopes to make a giant leapback to the moon.
The U.S. space agency announced its plan to send four astronauts to the moon within the next 13 to 15 years. ""We will return to the moon no later than 2020 and extend the human presence across the solar system and beyond,"" says Michael Griffin, the head of NASA.
The moon is a ball of rock that continually
, or circles, Earth. At 226,000 miles away, it is Earth's closest space neighbor. So far, the moon is the only place beyond Earth that humans have actually visited.
On July 20, 1969, Americans Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin became the first astronauts to land on the moon.
The main mission of the Apollo program was to put Americans on the moon.
The astronauts traveled to the moon aboard the
spacecraft. The main mission of the Apollo program was to put Americans on the moon. When Armstrong became the first person to set foot on the moon, he spoke these famous words: ""That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.""
To date, 12 humans have been to the moon. The last crew visited there on the
NASA plans to develop a new spaceship, by building on technology from the Apollo spacecraft and the space shuttles. ""It's very Apollo-like,"" says Griffin, ""but bigger.""
The new spaceship will take the place of the space shuttle. NASA plans to end the space shuttle program within the next five years.
The first phase of the plan to return to the moon calls for a launch in 2012. The vehicle would bring crews and supplies to the
, a research laboratory in space. Later, the vehicle will carry four astronauts to the moon for a weeklong mission.
'We will ... extend the human presence across the solar system and beyond.'
The moon mission is part of President George W. Bush's long-term space plan. Last year, the president promised to return astronauts to the moonthe first step in an eventual mission to Mars.
The main goal of the mission is to build a research base on the moon where humans can live and work. The moon is very different from Earth. Unlike Earth, there is no air, wind, or weather. The moon's dusty surface is pitted with craters.
While on the moon, astronauts hope to demonstrate that they can ""live off the land."" Learning how to live off the land is important for future human missions to Mars. Because Mars is so far from Earth, traveling there will require humans to stay for long periods of time.
The United States has already begun using robots to explore Mars. Two robotic vehicles,
, are on the Red Planet now. They are searching for signs of water, a requirement for life. Another vehicle, called an orbiter, is on its way. The orbiter is set to arrive in March and will circle Mars, studying the planet for signs of water.
Should We Go Back to the Moon?
Although some space experts and lawmakers praise the plan to return to the moon, others oppose it because of the high cost. The project is set to cost $104 billion.
Some people think that money should be used for other causes, such as helping to rebuild the Gulf Coast after the hurricanes Katrina and Rita. But NASA is quick to defend the space program. ""[It] is a long-term investment in our future,"" says Griffin.
Others say that the public needs to keep being reminded of the ultimate goal. Scientist Louis Friedman says, ""If you don't keep the Mars mission out front, people are going to ask, 'Why are we returning to the moon?' It's got to be because we're extending ourselves into the solar system.""
In 1961, President John F. Kennedy promised to land a person on the moon by the end of the 1960s. It was part of the ""Space Race"" with the then Soviet Union. Each country wanted to be the first to send a human to the moon. The time line shows some famous moon milestones and a vision for the future.

208,"""If I had one wish, it would be to bring peace to Earth and comfort to all the families who lost friends and loved ones [in the terrorist attacks],"" fourth grader Brandon wrote in an e-mail to
Brandon and millions of other kids have come together to help the victims of the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. Those kids have been offering comfort to one another; collecting clothes, food, water, and other supplies to send to rescue workers; and raising money to help the victims' families.
As kids have reached out to help others, they've learned about what their country stands for. English teacher Nan Bartow of New Haven, Connecticut, has been teaching for more than 30 years. She said, ""Kids are more patriotic than ever before.""
Many other teachers agree with Bartow. ""The students are saying, 'We are proud to be Americans' and that they appreciate everything they have,"" said Cynthia Elwood, a principal in Arlington, Texas.
Kids have shown their appreciation by sharing what they have. Here are some of the things they have done:
In Georgia, Parker Pratt, age 10, and Mac Conway, age 9, opened a lemonade stand and collected about $60 for charity.
Teachers and students at the Academy Hill School in Wilton, Maine, declared Friday, September 21, Red, White, and Blue Day. Everyone at the school wore the colors of the American flag to school that day.
In Stow, Ohio, 7-year-old Alexa came up with an idea that enabled her class to raise $113. ""I saw people who were crying because they didn't have houses or anything and they lost their sisters and brothers,"" she said.
In Oklahoma, kids and their parents collected more than 40,000 teddy bears to give kids in 350 schools in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.
""It is especially hard for children to understand what has happened, but they know how to show love,"" said Sue Hale, who helped coordinate the donations. Many kids wrote and attached special notes to the bears they donated. They said the bears and notes would help give thousands of kids hope for a bright future.
If you are looking to help the victims and families of the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. you might contact the following organizations. Each of these organizations has a long history of helping disaster victims.
* The American Red Cross can be contacted at 1-800-HELP-NOW.
* The Salvation Army can be contacted at 1-800-SAL-ARMY.
* The United Way has set up the September 11 Fund to help victims and their families. You can learn more about the fund at
You may also have local chapters of these charities in your community. If so, you can call them and invite representatives to talk to your class about what they are doing to help.

. Every family should have a home escape route planned. As part of the plan, identify two ways out of every room, such as a door or window exit. Be sure your plan includes a meeting place outside that is a safe distance from your home. Practice the plan at least twice a year.
. Smoke alarms are often the first signal of a fire. Your home should have a smoke alarm on every level and in or close to each bedroom. Be sure an adult tests alarms monthly and replaces batteries once a year.
. Whenever the stove is on, make sure there is an adult in the room. Keep a ""kid-free zone"" about 3 feet around the stove.

286,"The United States and India strike an energy deal.
The biggest cities in the Asian nation of India are not much different from New York City or San Francisco. Towering buildings scrape the sky. Cars, trucks, and buses clog the busy roads. McDonalds restaurants and Barista coffee bars dot the avenues. Over the past 15 years, India has become one of the fastestgrowing countries in the world, second only to China.
In March, President George W. Bush made a three-day trip to the worlds largest
(A democracy is a form of government in which people vote to elect their leaders.) There, Bush and Indias Prime Minister Manmohan Singh talked about science and technology, trade and investment, and a clean environment. They also agreed on an energy proposal that both countries hope will help India meet its rapidly growing demand for electricity.
Experts predict that India will continue to grow, and by 2040 the country will boast the worlds third-largest economy, after the United States and China. The United States wants to develop a better business relationship with India.
Bush believes that trade is important to help India overcome its poverty. Even though the economy there is improving, a large portion of the population is still poor. More than 300 million people in India live on less than $1 a day. That number of people is larger than the population of the United States.
As India develops, it will require more electricity to power homes and businesses. Today, many cities in India suffer frequent blackouts because the country doesnt generate enough electricity.
During Bushs visit, he and Singh made an important agreement. The United States will share nuclear technology and fuel with India. In return, India will allow international inspectors into 14 of its 22 nuclear plants (see
The plan will allow India to reduce its dependence on
such as oil and coal. Fossil fuels are formed in Earth from plant and animal remains over millions of years. In addition, the United States and India will work together to develop new technologies for producing clean and safe energy.
The new agreement, however, is not a done deal. The changes still have to be approved by the U.S. Congress. Many U.S. leaders think India should not be allowed to have nuclear technology. India has refused to sign a treaty that outlines rules for using nuclear technology.
However, Bush continues to emphasize the importance of trade with one of the worlds fastest-growing economies. In 2005, trade between India and the United States was $25 billion and is expected to reach $40 billion by 2009.
""The United States and India, separated by half the globe, are closer than ever before,"" Bush says. ""The partnership between our nations has the power to transform the world.""
How might Indias growing economic power affect other countries?
Currently, India gets 56 percent of its electricity from coal plants and just 3 percent from nuclear power. Coal, when burned, causes air pollution. Nuclear power plants, however, release almost no pollution.
Nuclear energy is created by the splitting of the nucleus of an atom. That process is called nuclear fission. Many countries today use nuclear energy. Some experts predict that by 2050, nuclear power will provide 25 percent of Indias electricity.

Native American artifacts, such as these baskets, will be on display at the National Museum of the American Indian.
A wealthy New Yorker named George Gustav Heye collected most of the new museum's items throughout the early 1900s. He was interested in Native American culture and traditions.
There are about 800,000 Native American objects included in the museum's collection. The museum plans to display about 8,000 artifacts at a time.
The 4 million people who are expected to visit each year won't just find ancient objects--although there are plenty of them to see. Officials say the new museum also teaches people about Native Americans in modern times. Along with ancient pieces, such as beadwork, pottery, and carvings, visitors will also find newer ones, such as modern art and beaded sneakers.
The museum has been a work in progress for 16 years. Twenty-four Native American tribes helped build and plan the museum. They even reviewed the traditional dishes served in the museum's caf.
Symbolism abounds in the five-story building, which is made of limestone from Minnesota. The building's curved exterior resembles rocks shaped by wind and water over thousands of years.
In honor of many types of Native American dwellings, the museum's entrance faces east, in the direction of the rising sun. Inside, an electronic welcome sign greets visitors in 150 Native American languages.
Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today, each with its own culture. Native Americans have lived in North, South, and Central America for more than 20,000 years. When European explorers first arrived in North America, they thought they had landed in the East Indies. Those are islands located near Asia. That is why the explorers called the people living in the Americas ""Indians.""
To many Native Americans, the new museum has been a long time coming. ""[It is] long overdue,"" said Lawrence Small, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
Now that it is officially open, Native Americans hope the new museum keeps their culture alive. ""This will be a good education tool for everyone that wants to learn about the Indian people,"" a Cherokee woman told

The other species is a giant mouse lemur with a bushy tail. It was named in honor of Madagascar's children. Its name in Malagasy means ""child."" The scientists chose that name to remind Madagascar's children to care for the many plants and animals in their country.
Finding a new lemur species is rare because many of the tiny creatures have become extinct. The recent find means that there are now 49 known species of lemurs in the wild.

On Inauguration Day, Bush is scheduled to stand outside the U.S. Capitol before thousands of citizens, the men and women of Congress, and members of the U.S. Supreme Court.
Bush will put his hand on an open Bible held by the chief justice of the United States. Bush will then recite the same Oath of Office that was spoken by the first U.S. president, George Washington, in 1789. The
is the president's promise to lead the country.
After Bush recites the Oath of Office, he will give a speech that may set the tone of his presidency. Many people will be listening carefully to his speech, because the 2000 presidential election was the source of bitter debate.
The first inauguration ceremony was performed in New York City, which was then the nation's capital. On April 30, 1789, George Washington took office. Since then, the ceremony has changed.
Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, walked to the White House after his ceremony in 1801. Bush will arrive at the White House in a long parade of limousines and Secret Service vehicles.
James Monroe, the fifth U.S. president, gave the first outdoor inaugural speech in 1817.
After Andrew Jackson, the seventh U.S. president, was inaugurated in 1829, he held an open house at the White House. The open house got out of control after the crowd, in a rush to see President Jackson, started breaking furniture and china. Jackson was forced to escape through an open window. Although an open house is expected to be held again this year, it will probably be a more controlled event.

During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote the poem that later became the national anthem.
On September 13, 1814, Key watched British ships bomb Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. The next morning, he spotted the American flag still flying over the fort. The sight inspired him to write the poem. In 1931, Congress made it the national anthem.
Here is the first verse of the four-verse song:

The statues, one 120 feet tall and the other 175 feet tall, were of the religious leader Buddha (BOO-duh), the founder of Buddhism.
Many art and history experts say the statues were historic treasures. ""They were among the most stunning [statues] I've ever seen,"" said. Professor James Fisher of Carleton College in Minnesota.
The Taliban, the religious group that rules most areas of Afghanistan, ordered the destruction of the two statues. (
In 1996, the Taliban seized the Afghan capital, Kabul, and took control of most of the country. The Taliban and a large majority of people who live in the country are Muslims. They practice a religion called Islam.
The Taliban said their holy book, the Koran, forbids the creation or worship of statues. Before the statues were destroyed, a Taliban leader said, ""Because... these statues are there to be worshipped, and that is wrong, they should be destroyed.""
Throughout the world, leaders were outraged after learning that the Taliban planned the destruction of the huge statues. World leaders and officials from the United Nations (U.N.) tried to stop the destruction. Iran, a country where most people are Muslims, asked the Taliban not to blow up the statues. Japan, a country where Buddhism is widely practiced, threatened to withhold money that the country had planned to send to Afghanistan.
Now many people are mourning the loss of the statues. ""It is [horrible] to witness the... destruction of [historic monuments], which were the [history] of the whole of humanity,"" said a U.N. representative.

George Washington and Abraham Lincoln are taking a step out of the history books. Two new presidential museums are using the cutting edge of technology to tell the stories of past U.S. presidents.
A group of students from nearby Rockledge Elementary School recently took a trip to Washington's home in Mount Vernon, Virginia. There, they saw a lifelike statue of Washington mounted on his horse during the Revolutionary War (17751783). The statue is an exhibit in a new museum at Mount Vernon.
""It was cool!"" 10-year-old Jack Eghtessad from Woodbridge, Virginia, told
describing the statue. ""It didn't look fake.""
At the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, students from the city's Iles Elementary School gasped. Lincoln's ghost appeared before them in the museum's library. ""I felt like I was really seeing Lincoln,"" exclaimed Samantha Mackey, 11.
or changing, the way kids learn about presidents. Recently, historians have started using more special effects to tell the stories of famous leaders. The new Mount Vernon museum has been open for only four months, but already it has drawn more than 90,000 visitors. February 19 will be the first Presidents' Day it is open.
Experts used paintings, historical documents, and the latest digital technology to create three statues of Washington for Mount Vernon. One of the statues shows Washington at age 19. Another statue depicts him at age 45, leading the Continental Army in the fight for
or freedom, against the British. The third shows him at 57, when he became the first U.S. president. (See
The museum is also home to a special-effects theater that plays a
or true-to-life movie, about Washington's life. As the film plays, the theater's seats rumble with the cannon fire of major battles. Fake snow even falls from the ceiling as the film shows Washington crossing the Delaware River in a surprise attack on the British military in 1776.
""We are, in a way, definitely on the cutting edge,"" says Ann Bay, the Mount Vernon museum's educational director. ""We were inspired by the Lincoln museum.""
Springfield's Lincoln museum reopened with new special-effects exhibits in 2005. Since then the museum has averaged more than 12,000 visitors a week. Visitors can see a life-size re-creation of Lincoln and his family, use interactive computer stations, and tour the ""ghost library.""
make it look as if ghosts of Lincoln and other historical figures appear in the room. Lincoln historian Thomas Schwartz told
that the special effects draw students into Lincoln's story. In one exhibit, visitors watch as an electronic ticker counts the more than 618,000 Americans who were killed while Lincoln was president during the Civil War (18611865). They see Lincoln's sad reaction to the huge death toll.
""These are real people that had real tragedy, real joy, and real emotion in their lives. People need to understand that,"" Schwartz says. He thinks that special effects help get that point across to visitors.
This life-size model of Washington at age 19 gives visitors a glimpse of the first U.S. president in his youth. Washington was born into a wealthy Virginia family. His first job was mapping out land. He then joined the British army and fought in the French and Indian War (17541763). During the Revolutionary War (17751783), he led the Continental Army against the British to win American independence. In 1789, he was elected the first president of the United States.
Unlike Washington, Lincoln did not have enough money to pay for school. This wax statue shows Lincoln teaching himself by reading between chores. He went on to become a successful lawyer, and in 1860 he was elected the 16th U.S. president. He led the country during the Civil War (18611865) between the states in the North and the South. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation ended slavery in 1863. He was killed in office shortly after the war ended.

follows a clownfish that is scooped up from the Great Barrier Reef.
In real life, clownfish are among the thousands of colorful sea creatures that call the Great Barrier Reef home.
Stretching 1,250 miles along Australia's northeastern coast, the Great Barrier Reef is the longest coral reef in the world. A
But these days, the Great Barrier Reef has found itself in trouble. Over fishing, pollution, and high temperatures are harming its health. That's why the government in Australia is trying to help rescue the reef.
While coral may look like a plant, it is actually made up of tiny sea animals. Those sea animals are called
As polyps die, they leave hard shells behind. Other polyps grow on top of the shells. Over thousands of years, they form a coral reef in warm water that is not very deep.
In many ways, the Great Barrier Reef resembles an underwater garden. Coral can be hard or soft. It forms in different colors and in strange shapes. Some coral looks like hardened brains. Other coral looks like fans and lettuces. The reef bursts with schools of tropical fish, darting among gaps in the coral.
The reef supplies food and shelter to creatures living in and around the coral. Turtles, sharks, sea horses, and crabs are among its many inhabitants. The reef also acts as a barrier to keep waves from slamming against the shore.
While the reef is important to ocean life, it helps humans, too. People rely on the reef for both food and jobs. It also provides medicine used to treat disease. Each year, the Great Barrier Reef contributes about $975 million to the economy through tourism and fishing.
Is it surprising, then, that the Great Barrier Reef is under too much stress? Fishing nets and ships break off sections and damage the reef. Air and water pollution are also doing harm. At the same time, warmer sea temperatures have caused
on half of the reef. The high temperatures cause the coral to turn white, often killing it.
In an effort to help save the reef, the government has limited fishing to two-thirds of it. That plan increases the number of ""green zones."" Those are areas that are off-limits to fishermen and boats. However, tourists and researchers can still visit them. Many fishermen are upset about the plan because they rely on the reef for jobs.
The Australian government says that its plan will help keep the reef safe from some threats. ""It is very important that we give the reef proper protection for the future,"" said one government official. ""The reef is Australia's greatest natural [treasure].""
Ships and fishing nets are destroying the Great Barrier Reef. They sometimes break off large sections of the reef.
The crown of thorns eats living coral. It has destroyed large areas of the Great Barrier Reef.
These soft, yellow coral polyps are shaped like tubes. They use their tentacles to catch food. Coral polyps are related to jellyfish.
This coral has been damaged. Do you see the white areas where the coral has been bleached?
Why do you think scientists sometimes refer to coral reefs as ""rain forests of the sea""?

The zoo reopened its doors over the summer. It welcomed its first visitors since the war with Iraq began in March. Today, the Baghdad zoo is home to about 80 animals. In addition to the lions, the zoo's animals include brown bears, monkeys, cheetahs, and rare birds.
Before the war began, this zoo in Baghdad was one of the largest in the Middle East. More than 600 animals were housed there.
When fighting began, the zoo was turned into a battleground. At one point, the zoo's population dropped to as few as six animals.
Many animals died and others were stolen, especially many of the birds. The cages of other animals were left open. Animals, such as lions and camels, roamed the streets. Other animals, locked in their cages, were left without food and water.
U.S. soldiers were the first people to come to the animals' rescue. They secured the zoo, found some of the wild creatures, and helped feed them. Since then, wildlife groups have helped nurse many of the sick animals back to health.
To people in Iraq, the reopened zoo is a sign of hope for their country. ""The Iraqi people see it as a small but important step in returning the country to [normal],"" said one wildlife rescue worker.

""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

As the school year begins, how has the Gulf Coast changed since Katrina?
""I cried when I saw my house,"" Chakia Boutte told
The 12-year-old's New Orleans neighborhood looks different from the way it looked a year ago. Chakia points to a block of homes that were damaged when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast. ""All these houses used to be fixed up,"" she says. Chakia's own home flooded in the storm last year.
More than 1,300 people died in the storm, and many more lost their homes. Hurricane Katrina is the costliest natural disaster in American history. Relief and recovery costs from the storm are nearing $100 billion.
Some areas are coming back to life. Along the Mississippi coast, homes and businesses are being rebuilt. Volunteer camps are full of people eager to help.
Other places look as though Katrina passed through one month, rather than one year, ago. In New Orleans's Lower Ninth Ward, abandoned homes sit waiting to be
or torn down. Overturned cars and uprooted trees line the streets. The air smells of mold and garbage.
This fall, Chakia will attend school in Texas. She has lived there since her family fled the hurricane. Other families are returning to New Orleans. About 55 of the city's 128 public schools are scheduled to reopen in time for the new school year. Though the public school system will be able to accommodate 34,000 students, only 20,000 are expected to attend.
""Parents have been very reluctant to bring young children back to the city,"" New Orleans City Councilmember Cynthia Hedge-Morrell told
In New Orleanss Lower Ninth Ward, flooded homes floated off their foundations during the hurricane. Here, a home sits on top of an overturned truck.
In New Orleans, about half of the city's former population of 450,000 has returned. Electricity and phone service are still out in the hardest-hit areas. The city's roads are full of potholes. Mail delivery is slow. Grocery stores, banks, and hospitals remain boarded up.
The federal government has invested billions in a program known as the Road Home. The program will provide money for Louisiana residents to rebuild or sell their storm-damaged houses.
The most urgent task is protecting New Orleans against another hurricane. The
structures that prevent floodingcollapsed during Hurricane Katrina.
Although the damaged levee system has been repaired and improved, it is still not designed to handle a storm like Katrina. The Army Corps of Engineers is preparing plans for Congress that will propose ways to protect New Orleans against the strongest hurricanes.
On the Gulf Coast, people speak of life in terms of ""before Katrina"" and ""after Katrina."" ""My life before the hurricane was so beautiful,"" says Myeisha McDaniels, 13. ""I had just made the dance team. My mom was just letting me go to the movies by myself. I was mad the hurricane came and messed everything up.""
Myeisha and other kids who have returned to New Orleans want to help rebuild the city. As part of a summer program called Gulf Coast WalkAbout, kids built bus stop benches and planted flowers in a park that had flooded during Katrina. They also reflected on their hurricane experiences.
In a journal entry, 12-year-old Duriel Harris wrote: ""I am now used to a whole new lifestyle. ... Every day now is different from my pre-Katrina days.""
Over the summer, kids in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas participated in the Gulf Coast WalkAbout program. They helped rebuild their communities. Here are some of the projects kids in New Orleans completed.
Kids painted trash cans, picked up litter, and planted flowers at a park that had flooded during Hurricane Katrina.
Kids recorded their hurricane experiences. Duriel Harris, 12, explains his family tree. His familys home was flooded in the storm.
After noticing that people were sitting on stoops or overturned buckets as they waited for buses, kids built two bus stop benches.
Why might some families have chosen not to return to New Orleans?

Nearly 40 percent of elementary schools have either eliminated or are considering eliminating recess, according to the American Association for the Childs Right to Play.
Why? Some school officials say they want students to have more classroom time to learn. They hope that more time in class will help students perform better on standardized tests.
In addition, many schools are cutting recess because they can no longer afford to offer it. Those schools dont have the money to hire lunch aides or to buy sports equipment for the playground.
Most teachers and parents say that recess has a place in school. Nine of 10 teachers say free time spent with friends is an important part of the school day, according to a recent survey conducted by the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA).
Education experts also stress that the benefits of recess outweigh the lost class time. Recess gives students the opportunity to take a break, exercise, and socialize with their friends.
At recess, many students learn how to
or work together, with other students. Many studies also show that recess helps improve test scores.

People saw green, blue, and red lights. The lights formed different patterns. Some looked like rings. Others looked like curtains. And still others looked like pillars. The lights continually changed shape and color.
are also called the northern lights and southern lights.
Usually, only people living close to the North Pole and South Pole see auroras. But auroras were unusually active this fall. Even people in Arizona saw the lights.
Auroras are caused by the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The solar wind is made of tiny particles that stream away from the sun. Earth's magnetic field is similar to the field that surrounds a magnet. When the solar wind strikes Earth's magnetic field, gases in our atmosphere glow. Those glowing gases form an aurora.
The kind of glowing gas determines an aurora's color. Glowing oxygen makes red, yellow, and green auroras. Glowing hydrogen and helium make blue and purple auroras.
Don't worry if you missed the colorful auroras in October. An aurora can form at any time of year. If the solar wind continues to be as strong as it was in the fall, you may see the northern lights on any clear night.
The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth. You could line up more than 1 billion hot dogs end to end between Earth and the sun.
If you could drive to the sun in your family's car, it would take you nearly 2 million years. That's if you drove 55 miles per hour and didn't take any rest stops.
Light from the sun travels a lot faster than you can in your car. A beam of light travels at about 186,000 miles per second. It takes sunlight a little more than 8 minutes to reach Earth.

or scientists who study space, met in Europe. The astronomers voted that there would be eight planets instead of nine. Those eight ""classical"" planets include Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
Why did astronomers give Pluto the boot? For starters, they came up with a new definition for a planet. A planet must be nearly round and must
or circle, the sun. Its orbit should not cross the orbit of another planet. Plutos orbit
Since its discovery in 1930, astronomers suspected that Pluto was an oddball when compared with the other planets. New technology has shown that its orbit is oval-shaped. Pluto is also smaller than the other planets. Even Earths moon is larger.
Orbit and size werent the only problems. Pluto is made up of material that is different from that of the other planets. While the others are made up of rocks or gases, Pluto consists mostly of ice.
Pluto appears to be similar to other objects in the Kuiper belt. Its status as a planet began to look bleak when 2003 UB313 was discovered three years ago. That Kuiper belt object, nicknamed ""Xena,"" is larger than Pluto. The discovery prompted astronomers to begin thinking about reclassifying the objects in our solar system.
Dont pity Pluto, though. It still has a place in space. Pluto is now one of a group of smaller space objects called
One member is the largest asteroid, called Ceres (SIHR-eez). The other space object is 2003 UB313.

races toward Pluto, scientists hope the craft will offer clues to how our solar system was formed 4.6 billion years ago. Many scientists believe that objects in the Kuiper belt are leftovers from the formation of the solar system.
Plutos downgraded title isnt stopping scientists from learning more about the dwarf planet. ""We will continue pursuing exploration of the most scientifically interesting objects in the solar system, regardless of how they are categorized,"" says NASA official Paul Hertz.
Pluto meets only two of the three new requirements:
 It has to be nearly round.
 Its orbit should not cross another planets orbit.
Pluto was discovered in 1930, long after the other planets, by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh (19061997). He wasnt the person to name it, though. Venetia Burney, an 11-year-old British girl, gave Pluto its name. She thought the new planet should be named for the Roman god of the underworld.
Not all astronomers agree with the decision to change Plutos status. Why might some oppose it?

658,"On August 13, after finishing basic training, more than 1,100 men and women marched into West Point, New York. They are now students at the United States Military Academy - part of the ""long gray line"" of students that stretches back 200 years.
The long gray line is what all the students who have ever attended West Point are called. The term refers to the color of the uniforms that the
, or military students, wear. It also reminds the cadets that they are part of a long tradition, which celebrates its 200th anniversary this year.
On March 16, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson founded a school to train military officers and teach engineering. The school was established at West Point, which had been used as a fort.
The school's first class of students was smaller than the one that entered this year. In 1802, only two students were enrolled at the school. The youngest was 10 years old!
When West Point was founded, the United States was much smaller than it is today. The country extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River.
Until 1817, West Point did not have a set course of study. In that year, Sylvanus Thayer was appointed the superintendent of West Point. He developed the school's curriculum and turned West Point into one of the best schools in the United States. George Woodbridge, who graduated from the school in 1826, explained Thayer's accomplishment, saying, ""His object was to make [us] gentlemen and soldiers.""
The officers who graduated from West Point helped build and defend the United States. They explored the vast areas west of the Mississippi River. They designed the roads, bridges, dams, railroads, and canals that the United States needed as it grew. They also helped design some of our greatest buildings and monuments. For example, they worked on the Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the base of the Statue of Liberty.
Many of the school's graduates have gone on to play important roles in U.S. history. They have been famous generals and U.S. presidents. Both President Ulysses S. Grant and President Dwight D. Eisenhower were generals and graduates of West Point. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, also graduated from West Point.
Even though all West Point graduates serve America in different ways, they all share important lessons learned at the academy. For example, they learn about taking responsibility for one's actions. They also share the school's motto. ""Always there echoes and reechoes in my ears [the motto]: Duty. Honor. Country,"" said General Douglas MacArthur, a West Point graduate.
George Washington Whistler graduated from West Point in 1819. He spent most of his career building railroads. He also built steam locomotives.
While building his first locomotive, Whistler also built the first American train whistle. He placed his whistle on top of the locomotive. He called his locomotive the Whistler. The sound of Whistler's whistle can still be heard on old steam locomotives.

Parents, teachers, and health experts are concerned. According to a new report issued by the American Heart Association, 8.8 million kids and teens weigh too much. The report shows that 15 percent of 6- to 11-year-olds are overweight. This is more than double from 20 years ago.
""Although children may not realize it now, they are setting themselves up for a lifetime of health problems,"" said one doctor. Experts say that overweight kids are at risk for developing heart problems and diabetes as adults.
To help kids develop good health habits, some schools are adding gym classes back into the curriculum. Others are

The goal of physical education is to keep kids active for life-inside school and out. Many schools are stressing the importance of fitness at a young age. One gym teacher said that physical education classes combine fitness with fun to encourage children to lead healthful, active lifestyles.
Daily exercise offers enormous benefits to children. Research shows that kids who exercise do better in school. They also have improved self-esteem and feel better about themselves in general. Now, that's something to get worked up about!

784,"North and South Korea are countries in eastern Asia.
Two brothers crept carefully through the mountains in China. The boys, along with their mother, sister, and aunt, had fled their home in North Korea. They hoped to find a better life in South Korea.
Like China, North and South Korea are countries in Asia. If the Chinese police had found the family, they would have sent them back to their country to be punished or even killed.
The brothers, Young Hoon* and Young Jun, and their family members walked, rode in cars, and flew on an airplane to reach South Korea. Their journey took about a year.
They were lucky. There are about 200,000 to 300,000 North Koreans now hiding in China. But only about 2,000 of them are expected to make it to South Korea this year.
Young Hoon, Young Jun, and their family members risked their lives to reach South Korea. Why? If they had stayed in North Korea, they faced starvation. Many North Korean children are hungry because their families cannot find food. In fact, over the past ten years, about 2 million people in North Korea have starved to death.
About a year after their arrival, the brothers tell me they are happy in Seoul, the busy capital city of South Korea. I visited Young Hoon and Young Jun at the Hannuri School, an after-school program for teens who have left North Korea and come to South Korea to start new lives.
Teachers at Hannuri help the North Koreans with their schoolwork. Many of the teens did not go to school regularly in North Korea, so they are behind in their lessons.
Even though North and South Korea are neighbors, the two countries are very different. North Korea is very poor. Its leader spends most of the country's money on the army, not on food for the people.
South Korea is more like the United States. The country has enough food for everyone, and most people drive cars, go to work, and eat at restaurants.
Young Hoon, 18, and Young Jun, 15, say that in North Korea they lived in a hut and ate mostly corn and potatoes. In South Korea, their lives are much different. The brothers live in an apartment and eat well. They love movies and video games.
North and South Korea are countries in eastern Asia. Korea used to be one country. It was divided in half after World War II (1939--1945). In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, starting the Korean War (1950--1953). After the Korean War, the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, was set up to divide the two countries. I visited the South Korean side of the DMZ. Everywhere I looked there were soldiers. I wasn't allowed to talk to them because they were on duty.
The brothers tell me about their plans for the future. Young Hoon wants to be a pilot. Young Jun wants to help people. They also hope to do something they never could have even dreamed of while living in North Korea--they want to visit the United States.
Young Jun is already prepared to visit. An American he met on his way to South Korea gave him a U.S. dollar. Despite plenty of opportunities to spend the money in South Korea, Young Jun has kept it. After all, he tells me, he's going to need it when he gets to the United States.

Lava from the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii hits the sea.
Tourists watched in awe as a huge chunk of Hawaiis coastline broke off and fell into the ocean. More than 44 acres of coastline collapsed and sent a glowing swirl of red-hot
bursting from a cliff. Lava is liquid rock that comes from a volcano.
The lava waterfall from the Kilauea volcano spilled into the Pacific Ocean. Steam shot into the air as the lava hit the water.
""The cliff just caved away like a glacier,"" Hawaii Volcanoes National Park spokesperson Jim Gale told reporters. ""It just sheared off that old wall."" Park officials let tourists watch the spectacular scene well away from the danger zone.
Kilauea, the worlds most active volcano, on Hawaiis Big Island has been erupting continuously since 1983. The November collapse was the largest in 23 years. It took about four hours for the cliff to tumble into the ocean. As the lava hardened, it began to form new land. All the Hawaiian Islands formed that way.
The recent collapse didnt surprise scientists. They had issued a warning months earlier because the cliff had formed cracks. Land collapses are not uncommon in the area. In 1996, a 26-acre area collapsed into the ocean, and in 1999, 25 acres of unsteady land fell into the water.
Thin strands of wiry volcanic glass, called Peles hair, were found about 2,000 feet away. Peles hair is a type of
which forms from lava that cools and hardens. According to myth, Pele was the Hawaiian goddess of fire.

A Pennsylvania man got more than a penny for his thoughts. After 40 years of pinching (or saving) pennies, Lynn Wagner decided it was time to cash them in at the bank.

The wildfires that recently swept through southern California have been called one of the Golden State's worst natural disasters. The raging wildfires destroyed homes, businesses, and forests. Nearly 750,000 acres burned-an area of land about the size of Rhode Island. ""The whole sky seemed as if it was on fire,"" said one California resident.
Investigators say both people and nature were to blame for the fires. The fires spread rapidly because of the Santa Ana winds, which blow hot, dry air from the desert. Cold and rainy weather eventually rolled in to help quench the flames.
About 15,000 firefighters battled flames that were out of control. Thousands of people had to quickly

Choking had been among the leading causes of death in the United States until the Heimlich maneuver was invented. Henry Heimlich, a doctor from New York, devised the emergency maneuver, which was named after him.
In 1974, Heimlich published his findings. One week later, the new technique first saved a choking victim.
Before Dr. Heimlich's discovery, slapping a choking person on the back was the recommended technique. Studies later showed that backslaps could actually cause an object to get stuck even tighter in a person's throat, causing death.
Today, the Heimlich maneuver is the recommended emergency method for a choking victim. Since the move was first introduced, it has saved more than 60,000 lives.

What do these new discoveries mean? Scientists aren't sure, but hope the discoveries will reveal clues about the age of the rings around the sixth planet from the sun. ""I don't think Saturn's rings will disappear anytime soon, but this tells us how the rings are [changing] and how long they might last,"" says Linda Spilker, a scientist with the U.S. space agency, NASA.
Although Saturn's rings appear solid, they are actually made up of pieces of rock, ice, and dust. Those pieces vary from the size of tiny dust particles to the size of large mountains.
Scientists are also studying the shimmering rings to learn more about how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. They say that Saturn's rings are a model of the gas and dust that once surrounded the sunthe center of the solar system.

330,"Wild Weather: Is Global Warming Causing Unusual Storms?
Residents of Barrow, Alaska, are stunned when a severe thunderstorm roars through town. The storm shocks the town; it is the first thunderstorm they have ever seen.
For over 36 hours, a wild blizzard dumps about 100,000 tons of snow on a ski course in Austria. When even the ski lifts stop working, the storm puts a world championship skiing competition on hold.
Those are just two of the many cases of wild weather, such as blizzards, tornadoes, hurricanes, and heat waves, that have been taking place around the world. A recent report from the United Nations (U.N.) says that wild weather may become increasingly common worldwide.
The U.N. report blames the unusual weather on
, or a rise in temperature worldwide.
Certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, settle in Earth's atmosphere. Those gases act like the glass windows in a greenhouse, trapping heat from the sun and causing a rise in temperature.
According to the report, during the next century, global warming will cause average temperatures worldwide to increase by 2 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit.
World temperatures have been slowly increasing at least since 1850, when scientists began keeping records of world temperatures. The 1990s were the hottest ten years on record.
Scientists aren't sure what is causing global warming. Most scientists agree that burning gasoline, oil, and coal as fuel is the most important cause. Burning those fuels releases lots of carbon dioxide.
Some scientists, however, say global warming is mainly caused by forest fires, volcanic eruptions, and other natural events that release carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere.
Craig Idso, from the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, said he doubts that worldwide temperatures will increase much more than they have already. According to Idso, an increase in carbon dioxide may be a good thing, since plants need carbon dioxide to grow. By taking in more of the gas, plants ""will grow like gangbusters,"" he said.
The effects of global warming will vary from place to place, scientists say. In the United States, global warming could cause warmer weather in Alaska, more forest fires in California, crop failures in the Midwest, and longer growing seasons in the Northeast.
In the meantime, many companies are working to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere. For example, automobile manufacturers are developing new fuels that could replace gasoline and limit carbon dioxide emissions.
Michael Glantz, from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that people will learn how to live with global warming. ""Society is more robust than we give it credit for,"" he said. ""People may learn to live more comfortably in a new, warmer world.""

The oath is the only Inauguration Day event required by law. Every president since George Washington has taken the oath. On April 30, 1789, Washington was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City, which was then the country's capital.
In 1801, Thomas Jefferson was the first president to be inaugurated in Washington, D.C. In 1809, the first organized inaugural ball was held in Washington, D.C., for James Madison. In 1817, James Monroe's inauguration was the first to be held entirely outdoors. Over the years, inauguration traditions have evolved from simple events to elaborate ceremonies.
Since George Washington's time, presidents have used inaugural addresses to unite the country and inspire people. Abraham Lincoln gave his second inaugural speech in 1865, not long before the Civil War ended. He used his speech to draw the country together.
Other presidents' inaugural words are still quoted today. When Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural speech in 1933, the United States was at the height of the Great Depression. That was a time when many people were out of work. He brought promise with his words ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.""
When John F. Kennedy took office in 1961, he encouraged people to help their country. His speech challenged Americans: ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.""
What message will President Bush convey? He will likely continue the message expressed in his victory speech. ""A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation,"" he said. ""We have one country, one Constitution, and one future that binds us. And when we come together and work together, there is no limit to the greatness of America.""
George Washington's second inaugural speech, in 1793, was the shortest on record. At only 135 words, it lasted just eight minutes.
In 1841, William Henry Harrison gave the longest inaugural address. At 8,445 words, it lasted almost two hours!
In 1925, Calvin Coolidge's inaugural speech was the first broadcast on the radio.
Harry S. Truman's speech in 1949 was the first to be shown on television.
After Jimmy Carter was sworn in as president in 1977, he became the first president to walk the parade route instead of riding in a car.
In 1997, Bill Clinton's inauguration was the first to be transmitted over the Internet.

, or the exact point where the earthquake struck, was about 65 miles off the coast of El Salvador in the Pacific Ocean.
Officials in El Salvador said more than 700 people were killed and many people were still missing days after the quake. Thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed. As a result, many people were left without shelter.
San Salvador, the nation's capital, was the scene of terrible destruction. Much of the damage was caused by mudslides that buried many buildings.
To help the survivors of the earthquake, dozens of countries, including Japan, Spain, and the United States, rushed teams of rescue workers to El Salvador. The rescuers searched for people buried under mud and rubble from collapsed buildings.
To clear the wreckage, rescue workers used bulldozers, shovels, and their hands. Rescuers also used specially trained dogs, which have a keen sense of smell, to locate victims buried by the quake.
Thick layers of mud made rescue work difficult. ""Mud seals off everything considered essential for survival, such as oxygen,"" explained Gary O'Shea, director of the International Rescue Corps of the United Kingdom.
In addition to sending teams of rescue workers, many countries sent money, food, clothing, water, and medical supplies to help in the recovery efforts. (Ask your teacher how you can help the earthquake victims in El Salvador.)

After the rescuers leave, the people of El Salvador will still be faced with a massive rebuilding effort. One young survivor, who had lost three sisters in the quake, looked at the devastation and said, ""It's like the world here is upside down.""

759,"Standing on a cliff, a sharpshooter carefully aimed his rifle at a Mexican gray wolf. Bulls-eye! The wolf went down. A short time later, he shot a second wolf.
The wolves, however, weren't injured. The sharpshooter had shot special darts at them. The darts contained a drug that put the wolves to sleep.
U.S. government officials picked up the sleeping wolves. They planned to move the wolves to an area far away from people.
The two wolves are part of a program to bring wolves back to Arizona and New Mexico. Until about 1900, the Mexican gray wolf lived in both states. Some of the wolves ate cattle and attacked people. People hunted the wolves because they thought the animals were dangerous. By 1950, few wolves were left in the area.
The U.S. government has brought wolves back to those states. But ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico say wolves are causing problems again.
What's the scariest animal? Is it a grizzly bear, a shark, or a wolf? Or is it something else? Believe it or not, deer are more dangerous.
Deer may seem harmless, but they can cause a lot of trouble. Deer often wander onto busy roads. When they do, they can cause car accidents. In 2001, deer caused 26,000 car accidents. A year earlier, they caused 83 human fatalities.
Ranchers say the wolves that the sharpshooters hit with darts killed 19 calves. The ranchers fear that the wolves might attack people as well.
""I can handle the bears and the mountain lions and the bobcats,"" said one rancher. When you see [those animals], they take off. They're scared of you. These wolves, they're not scared. And that's what scares me.""
The ranchers say wolves cannot be reintroduced to their area because too many people live there now. ""You can't turn back the clock,"" one person said.

Stalagmites rise from the ground. Stalactites resemble icicles and hang from a caves ceiling.
Californias newly discovered cave creatures hold clues to monitoring changes in the environment.
caves of two national parks in central California, scientists made an amazing discovery. They found 27 previously unknown species of spiders, centipedes, millipedes, and scorpion-like creatures. The scientists explored 34 of 238 known caves in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks over three years and recently released their findings.
or animals without backbones. The discoveries included a tiny pill bug that is
or almost clear. Its internal organs are visibleeven its bright-yellow liver! There was also a daddy longlegs with a jaw larger than its body, as well as a little, bright-orange spider. Some creatures were so tiny that scientists had to use the fine hairs of a paintbrush to collect them.
""We thought we might find a handful of new species,"" says Joel Despain, a cave expert for the parks. ""It was amazing to find 27.""
Why had the cave creatures gone undetected? Though it is rare to find unknown animal species on Earths surface, the same is not true for caves. Like the deep sea, caves are difficult to reach and havent been explored as thoroughly as the surface.
Discovering so many unknown species was thrilling for Jean Krejca. She is a scientist with Zara Environmental, the Texas-based group that led the project. ""You get the feeling that youre Lewis and Clark, charting undiscovered territory,"" says Krejca. ""Caves are one of the last frontiers.""
This millipede is one of the less strange creatures scientists find in caves. Creatures are often blind and have no pigment.
The creatures are unique not only because they are found just in caves but also because some are found in only a single cave or a specific part of a cave. ""There are usually more creatures at the caves entrance because there is more food there,"" scientist Rob Myers of Zara Environmental told
""The farther back in a cave, the more you find creatures have adapted to cave life. What you find is more and more strange. The creatures are often blind and have no pigment.""
A creature such as the pill bug, for example, doesnt need pigment in its skin because it doesnt have to protect itself from the sun. And the daddy longlegs probably developed such big jaws to quickly grab prey, which is scarce inside caves.
The next task is to name the new species. Specialists called
are working to classify and name the creatures.
Scientists will also study the new species to determine whether their populations are healthy. Cave animals can teach scientists a lot about the environment because the creatures are sensitive to changes in the
An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that interacts with the environment. If cave creatures decline, it could signal problems or changes in the environment.
The recent discoveries have led park officials to plan to protect the caves and the newfound species. ""Now that we know the species are there, we can use them to learn more about cave ecosystems and life on this planet,"" says Myers.
Think Critically Why, do you think, is more food found at the entrance to a cave?

""Caves are absolutely dark,"" Rob Myers of Zara Environmental told
""They are darker than your bedroom gets at night. There is zero light in a cave, so you cant see a hand in front of your face.""
When a spelunker heads into a cave, he or she wears a helmet with a headlamp and carries an extra flashlight. The cave explorer also wears elbow pads and kneepads to crawl along the rocky floor. Many caves are underground, so the explorer slides down on ropes connected to special harnesses.
While there, a spelunker might see the magnificent cone-shaped formations of

Most U.S. kids go to school for 180 days per year. But is that long enough? Many people don't think so. California's governor, Gray Davis, recently said he wants schools in his state to add 30 days to the school calendar. Across the country, other schools are adding on days and weeks.
Some teachers say they have more to teach than ever before and could use the extra time. They teach more and harder subjects and provide additional information on topics such as safety and ethics.
Moreover, many educators worry that summer vacation is a waste of time. Many parents work away from the home, and many kids spend summers home alone or at camps that do not stress education. ""What you have is three months of time in which kids forget what they've learned and get into trouble,"" said Delaine Eastin, an educator in California.
Not everyone agrees that kids need to spend more time in school. Some say that schools need to make better use of the time they already have.

Skin may not seem very important, but it is. It protects your body from burns, dirt, germs, and dangerous rays from the sun. It keeps fluids inside your body. And it contains all the nerves that allow you to feel things.
Skin is the largest organ in your body. If you stretched out an adult's skin into a flat sheet, it would cover an area of about 21 square feet. A square foot is a square whose sides each measure 1 foot.
Skin may cover a large area, but it is very thin. It is only about 1/8 inch thick. Despite being so thin, skin is made of three layers. The outermost layer is the epidermis. Just below the outermost layer is the dermis. Beneath those two layers is the subcutaneous tissue.
The epidermis contains a chemical called keratin. Keratin makes skin tough and waterproof. Keratin keeps germs out of your body.
The dermis is mainly made of blood vessels and nerve endings. The dermis provides the epidermis with food and oxygen.
The lowest layer, the subcutaneous tissue protects the body from blows. It also regulates the body's temperature.
All three layers of your skin protect you. Because your skin protects you, you should protect it by keeping it clean and eating a healthful diet. You should use sunblock when you are in the sun. If you take care of your skin, it will last a lifetime.

""I never got used to these 4- or 5-foot crevasses that are hundreds of feet deep,"" said Weihenmayer. ""You had to jump across them. You have to be very careful when you land.""
For most climbers, jumping over a crevasse is hard enough. But for Weihenmayer, jumping over the cracks was particularly hard because he is blind.
Last spring, Erik Weihenmayer became the first blind climber to reach the peak of Mount Everest. He was part of a team of climbers that was sponsored by the National Federation of the Blind.
Mount Everest is 29,035 feet tall and sits on the border between Nepal and China, two countries in Asia. According to many climbers, Mount Everest is one of the hardest and deadliest mountains in the world to climb because of the mountain's height.
""There are a lot of things that can happen up there. You're not ever really sure that you're going to make it,"" Weihenmayer told
. Climbers can suffer from illnesses caused by many things, including the altitude.
sickness occurs when a climber does not get enough oxygen.
The team took more than two months to complete the climb. Weihenmayer spent much of his time moving the team's supplies up the mountain to a base camp, which was located at 17,600 feet. The time spent moving gear helped Erik Weihenmayer get used to the altitude. ""You're letting your body get used to the elevation, the air, the temperature,"" Weihenmayer said.
Weihenmayer, who had already climbed several of the world's highest peaks, had help getting up Mount Everest. ""[People] would walk ahead of me with a bell,"" he said. ""I tried to stay in their footsteps. I tried to stay [close] behind them so I could hear their steps, and I stepped into those places.""
For Weihenmayer, climbing Mount Everest was the toughest but most rewarding experience of his life. When he got to the top, Weihenmayer stopped to think about what he had done.
""I thought about the ground underneath me. I felt these cool flags [at the peak] that were up there in the breeze,"" Weihenmayer said. ""I thought about my family, friends, and about where I was.""

Moving slowly and silently through more than a million acres of wetlands in Florida, water is the lifeblood of the Everglades. However, for the past few decades, the Everglades has been losing its lifeblood.
President Bill Clinton plans to sign a new bill into law that may breathe new life into the Everglades. The bill is called the Everglades Restoration Act. The act will help restore parts of the Everglades to the way they were many years ago, say supporters. Critics of the plan say that it does not go far enough to restore the Everglades.
The Everglades is like a shallow, slow-moving river that covers millions of acres. The ""river of grass,"" as the Everglades is called, is 50 miles wide and 120 miles long. It flows from Lake Okeechobee into Florida Bay.
A large part of the river of grass is contained within the Everglades National Park. The park covers about 1.5 million acres (about the size of Delaware). Many plant and animal species, including alligators, panthers, egrets, and manatees live in the park.
An alligator suns itself in the Everglades. Manatees, many kinds of birds, and panthers can be found in these wetlands.
The Everglades Restoration Act will spend about $8 billion to restore the river of grass over the next 30 years. The act will be managed in part by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
One important part of the act calls for the removal of dams, dikes, and flood control gates. The Corps of Engineers began installing many of those devices in 1948 to control the flow of water in the Everglades. Those devices protect towns and farms from flooding and provide
By removing dams and closing canals, the Corps of Engineers will restore the flow of water in the river of grass to the way it was more than 100 years ago. That's when people first began to drain water from the Everglades.
The act will also improve water treatment plants. Those plants clean wastewater coming from farms or towns near the Everglades. The improved plants will allow less water pollution to flow into the Everglades. The Corps of Engineers will also build reservoirs, relocate roads, and shut off drainage canals.
The maps show (1) how water flowed through the Everglades before farms and towns began draining water from the Everglades, (2) how water now flows through the Everglades, and (3) how water may flow when the plan is completed.
Many people, from environmental groups to private citizens, applaud the act. ""This is as major a restoration as one would hope for,"" said Charles Lee, a spokesperson for the Florida Audubon Society.
Critics of the plan, however, say it does not go far enough toward restoring the wetlands. For example, the Everglades once covered 9 million acres, say officials from the Sierra Club, an organization that works to protect the environment. The Corps of Engineers drained much of that land so it could be used as farmland and to build houses. More of that land should be returned to the way it used to be before the 20th century, Sierra Club officials have said.
Whatever disagreements people may have, all agree that the restoration of the Everglades will take a long time and a lot of hard work. Once the act becomes law, said Stuart Applebaum of the Corps of Engineers, it will be time to ""roll up our sleeves [and get to work] for the next 30 years.""

Is your backpack weighing you down? If so, consider lightening your load. A recent study shows that lugging around a bulky backpack that doesn't fit correctly can lead to poor
If someone tells you that good posture is important, that person is referring to the position of your body when you stand, sit, or walk. Carrying around too much weight in your backpack can force you to bend forward. Slouching over can round your shoulders and cause your upper back to curve.
Over time, the extra stress on your back can create posture problems. Some doctors think those problems may lead to neck and back pain.
Thirteen children, ages 8 and 9, participated in the backpack study. They walked about 1,130 feet. That is about the average length of a child's walk to school. The kids walked with backpacks that weighed 9 to 13 pounds. The children also walked without backpacks.
The study's researchers found that the heavier the backpack load, the more children bent down to support its weight. Afterward, some kids complained that their lower backs and shoulders hurt.
Heidi Orloff, one of the researchers, said that she could tell when the backpacks were too heavy or the kids were tired. ""The kids' chins drop to their chests,"" she told
An estimated 40 million school-age children in the United States use backpacks. Some health groups say that more than half of those students may be carrying backpacks heavy enough to affect their posture.
When worn correctly, backpacks have many benefits. They have lots of compartments that help you stay organized. Compared with shoulder bags, backpacks are a better way to carry around the items you need for school. Your body's strongest muscles-in the back and stomach-support the weight of a backpack. A shoulder bag often puts strain unevenly on your body.
However, most health experts recommend that kids carry backpacks that are no more than 15 percent of their body weight. That means a 70-pound student should wear a backpack that weighs less than 10 1/2 pounds. Orloff also said that spot checks around the country show that many children are carrying backpacks that weigh between 20 and 25 pounds. Now, that's quite a burden!
Below, you'll find some tips to help ease your load. Your back will thank you!
Choose a backpack that is the right size for your body.
Use both shoulder straps and fasten the waist strap to balance the weight evenly.
Adjust the shoulder straps so that the backpack is close to your body.
Pack only what you need and place the heaviest items closest to the center of your back.

Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.

Thanks to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the grizzly is making a comeback. Congress passed the act to protect animals that were in danger of becoming extinct.
Wildlife officials hope to remove grizzly bears in the Yellowstone National Park area from the endangered species list within the next year. Steven Williams, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told USA Today that the change is ""a tribute to the American people's commitment to wildlife [protection].""
Why is it important to protect endangered animals?
Scientists have worked to help bring grizzlies back from the brink of extinction. They set the animals free in their original habitats. They also plan to limit the number of roads in areas where grizzlies live. That action will give grizzlies more room to roam-and will help make life more bearable for them!

For example, Irwin was recently on the Australian island of Tasmania. Irwin was working with the World Wildlife Fund to rescue stranded whales. He wants to call attention to whale hunting in the South Pacific Ocean. ""This practice [whaling] has to stop,"" Irwin said.

Wind gusts that raged across the Midwest reached 90 miles per hour in five states, according to the National Weather Services Storm Prediction Center. One gust clocked in at 107 miles per hour in Kansas.
Tornadoes can strike in any month in any part of the world. In the United States, peak activity for tornado season is from April through July.
scientists who study weathersay the series of 113 damaging storms that tore through the Midwest will beat the recent record for the number of tornadoes on a single day in March. The previous record was 69 on March 13, 1990. ""For this early in the year, its a heck of a deal,"" says weather expert Joe Schaefer. ""What happens after that is anybodys guess.""
After the thunderstorms caused the series of deadly twisters, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for Michigan and Indiana. If a

for an area, a tornado has been spotted. In the case of a tornado warning, people should seek safe shelter immediately.
The National Weather Service also employs storm spotters to help predict where and when a tornado will strike. The trained volunteers are positioned before a storm hits to report what they see developing in the sky. Their reports confirm what weather forecasters see on their radar screens.
For many, there is no escaping the tornadoes wrath. ""It was over before you knew it,"" Greg Kospar of Bentonville, Arkansas, told reporters after the storm. ""The house is gone.""
The strength of a tornado and its potential to cause damage are rated using the Fujita scale, with 0 being the weakest and 5 being the strongest. A new tornado rating system is scheduled to go into effect early next year.

Carved into the famous granite monument are the faces of four U.S. presidentsGeorge Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Mount Rushmore is located in the Black Hills of South Dakota. For five weeks this summer, a crew washed the presidents' faces.
To kick off the cleaning, workers scaled the mountain and sprayed the left side of Jefferson's forehead with water. They also blasted Jefferson's eyelid and jaw with handheld hoses to wash away decades of dirt.
""Apart from the dirt, we are concerned with the lichens,"" Mount Rushmore official Judy Olson told
. Lichens are small plant-like organisms that can grow on hard surfaces, such as rock and bark. They make an acid that can harm the faces. ""The lichen roots are digging into the stone,"" Olson says.
The workers took special care near the cracks on the stone faces. They used pressure washing instead of chemicals. Pressure washing has been used to clean other historical structures, including the Statue of Liberty in New York City and the Coliseum in Rome.
Mount Rushmore was designed by American sculptor Gutzon Borglum. From 1927 to 1941, his team worked on the memorial. They used drills and dynamite to blast into the cliff. Each head is as tall as a six-story building.

Volcanoes can remain quiet for years and then erupt violently, sometimes without warning. Using the latest technology, scientists hope to better
Mount St. Helens is located in Washington.
Scientists say Mount St. Helens is one of the most closely monitored volcanoes and the most active volcano in the lower 48 states. Mount St. Helens is also among 13 active volcanoes that are located in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. That range is home to several powerful volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier and Mount Hood.
Although scientists say a large eruption at Mount St. Helens is unlikely, they are cautious because of the volcano's history. Officials have sealed off a 5-mile area around the volcano.
Mount St. Helens erupted with tremendous force in May 1980, blowing more than 1,300 feet off its top and killing 57 people. The blast destroyed thousands of acres of forest and scattered ash for thousands of miles. Mount St. Helens continued to rumble until 1986 but has been quiet since that time.
How can scientists tell when a volcano will awaken from its slumber? ""We measure earthquake activity, changes in the mountain, and volcanic gases,"" said Driedger.
Although scientists can't tell exactly when or with what force a volcano will blow its top, they rely on advanced equipment to help them predict eruptions. Special devices called
are installed around volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens to detect earthquakes. Earthquakes always strike before a volcano erupts.
Volcanoes are mountains where hot, liquid rock called magma deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure can cause magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the crater at the top of the volcano and vents, or cracks, along its side. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called lava. Once lava cools, it hardens into rock.
Scientists use special global positioning instruments to measure movements on the slopes of the mountain--a clue to the buildup of
. Magma is red-hot molten rock located inside the volcano. It is called
when it pours out of the volcano.
As magma rises, volcanoes release carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Sensors on helicopters test the air for gases that signal rising magma. ""The gases are like telegrams that tell us what's going on inside the volcano,"" said Driedger.
More than 500 million people around the world live near active volcanoes. Monitoring volcanoes is a dangerous job, but scientists take precautions to stay safe.
""By watching volcanoes, we learn how they work,"" said Driedger. ""The more we know, the better prepared we can be to save property and lives.""

Students at Sky Oaks Elementary School in Burnsville, Minnesota, learn chess as part of the curriculum. ""It's fun to play,"" said Alex Powell, a fourth-grade student at Sky Oaks.
Chess is a game of skill between two players. It likely began during the 7th century in India. The object of the game is to

Studies show that playing chess sharpens critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. ""It helps kids with their schoolwork,"" said Alex's teacher, Ray Nyberg. ""They have to think and be analytical.""
Principal Patrick Flinn says that Sky Oaks has been teaching chess sessions to students for more than 15 years.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
Many schools use chess to help students develop thinking skills.
Chess has become increasingly popular with kids today. More than 41,000 students under age 14 are members of the United States Chess Federation. Many kids also participate in the game through clubs offered after school and through community organizations.

A sneaky snake has slithered out of hiding. Students and teachers at Hauppauge Middle School on Long Island, New York, are happy once again. Slim, their 2-foot-long ball python, is back in his tank in a science classroom.
""We were so used to seeing Slim every day that it seemed strange when he wasnt there,"" sixth grader Brian Pattison told
Earlier in the school year, teachers were putting Slim and Otis, another ball python, into their tank. Then the teachers became distracted by a disturbance in the hall, and the snakes escaped.
The teachers quickly recaptured Otis. Slim, however, raced out into the hallway and disappeared. A search of the school began.
""Slim has been part of our school family for six years, so you can imagine how worried we were when he went missing,"" says school principal Maryann Fletcher.
Ball pythons like heat, so school officials set up portable heaters. They also tried to lure the hungry snake out of hiding by providing boxes of tempting crickets.
No one worried that Slim might hurt a person. Ball pythons are gentle snakes from western Africa. Four weeks after the escape, a night custodian found Slim.
""I am happy to say Slim the Snake has returned,"" wrote Fletcher in a note to parents. The principal joked, ""I received a note as follows: Vacation was great!  The food was nothing to talk about.  Feels good to be home!""

Although the constitution has been approved, Iraqis clash over the countrys future.
Nothing was going to stand in the way of
Zeinab Sahib, a mother of three, as she voted on Iraqs constitution. She cast her ballot at a school in Baghdad, the war-torn countrys capital. ""I came to vote because I am tired of terrorists, and I want my country to be safe again,"" she says.
Sahib was one of 7 million Iraqis who voted to accept or reject the new constitution on October 15. The ballots took days to count by hand, but the constitution passed. Seventy-eight percent of Iraqis voted to make the constitution the countrys new set of laws. ""It is a landmark day in the history of Iraq,"" White House spokesperson Scott McClellan told reporters. ""The political process is continuing to move forward in Iraq, and it is an encouraging sign to see more and more people participating in the process.""
The new constitution marks a step toward establishing a
in Iraq since U.S.-led forces removed Saddam Hussein from power in 2003. A democracy is a type of government in which people vote for their leaders in elections.
Bringing democracy to Iraq has been a challenge. Violent attacks continue throughout the country as
, or rebels, try to prevent Iraq from becoming a democracy. More than 150,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq, helping to bring peace and stability to the country. The U.S. military has also been training Iraqis to protect themselves from insurgents.
Although the constitution was approved, the country is deeply divided. Not all Iraqis agree on how Iraq should be run. Iraq is made up of three major groupsShiites (SHEE-ights), Sunnis (SOON-eez), and Kurds.
Under Saddam Hussein, who was a Sunni, Shiites and Kurds had little voice in the government. The Shiites who live in southern Iraq and the Kurds who live in northern Iraq largely voted for the new constitution. The Sunnis, a minority group, live in the middle of the country and voted against it.
U.S. troops patrol the site of a car bomb explosion in Baghdad, Iraq, in March 2004.
Many Sunnis, who were in control during Saddam Husseins rule, say the constitution favors Shiites and Kurds. The constitution allows the Shiites and Kurds to govern their own areas. Those regions have more oil than where most Sunnis live. The Sunnis worry that the Shiites and Kurds will control most of the oil and leave them weak and powerless.
Along with granting more power to local governments, the new constitution allows Iraqis to vote for leaders every four years. On December 15, Iraqis will vote on a permanent government. They will choose a
, a lawmaking body, like the U.S. Congress. The new government will have the power to revise the draft constitution. If they decide to revise it, voters will have to approve the changes.
As Iraqis begin running their own government, the United States hopes to begin withdrawing its troops. Since the war began three years ago, more than 2,000 U.S. troops have died. Recent polls show that support for the war has dropped and that many Americans want troops to come home. Others warn that the country still faces many obstacles on its path to stability.
In the meantime, President George W. Bush praised the high participation in Iraqs vote. He says, ""The Iraqis are making inspiring progress toward building a democracy.""
Why are the people of Iraq divided over their form of government?
Size: 168,754 square miles (about twice the size of Idaho)
Religion: About 95 percent of Iraqis are Muslims. They practice the religion of Islam. Shiite Muslims make up about 60 percent of Iraqs population. Sunni Muslims make up about 35 percent.

A new study shows that the number of ocean creatures is on the rise.
A gold-speckled and red-striped goby fish stands guard while a snapping shrimp digs a burrow. Both use the burrow for protection. The fish and the shrimp live off Guam, an island in the Pacific Ocean.
The goby fish is among 106 new
, or types, of fish that scientists counted in the world's oceans in 2004 as part of a 10-year study. That means more than two new species of fish were discovered each week last year!
About 1,000 scientists from 70 countries are participating in the ocean count. They will finish their study in 2010.
Water covers about two-thirds of Earth's surface. The five main oceans are the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian, the Arctic, and the Southern.
This map shows the five main oceans.
So far, scientists have discovered nearly 15,500 species of fish in the world's oceans. They are among 230,000 known plants and animals living beneath the ocean's surface.
Scientists believe that they may find up to 2 million life-forms by the time they complete their count. ""We have barely skimmed the surface,"" said one scientist.
Why are scientists conducting the study? They want to learn more about the oceans, which are among the least-known parts of Earth's surface. Scientists say species found below 1,200 feet are 50 times more likely to be new. One scientist involved in the study said that less is known about the ocean than is known about ""the far side of the moon.""
Scientists plan to use the results of the study to prevent people from overfishing. They also want to use the information to protect ocean life.
Scientists have added some new ocean creatures to their growing list.
A previously unknown creature was found that lives near Antarctica. It has eight arms and is related to the octopus.
Coral-like algae were found in the waters off Alaska. The hard red plants look like toy jacks.
An ocean creature related to the jellyfish could be new. It was found in Arctic waters.

During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote the poem that later became the national anthem. That war was fought against Great Britain. On September 13, 1814, Key watched as British troops bombed Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland.
The flag flying over the fort survived the night. Key was so moved by the sight of the American flag that he wrote a poem that was later set to music. In 1931, Congress made the song the official national anthem.

is a made-up tale that is often accepted as truth. Now an American scientist claims he has discovered the remains of Atlantis on the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.
According to the age-old myth, Atlantis was a place of great wealth. The ancient kingdom gleamed with gold and silver and was a center for art and learning.
Over time, the people there became corrupt and greedy. As punishment, the gods unleashed powerful earthquakes and floods that swallowed up Atlantis and sank it to the ocean floor.
The only account of this legendary lost land comes from the long-ago writings of Plato. He was an ancient Greek writer who lived about 2,500 years ago. People don't know how much of Plato's text is factual, because he wrote about an event that had happened 9,000 years before his time.
Robert Sarmast, the American scientist behind the recent claim, performed sonar tests of the Mediterranean seafloor. Sonar tests use sound waves to find underwater objects.
Sarmast believes that he has found Atlantis in the Mediterranean Sea, between Syria and Cyprus.
Sarmast says his tests revealed human-made walls and structures that matched Plato's description. ""If you compare [my findings to Plato's description], you will be astonished,"" Sarmast told reporters. ""We hope that future expeditions will bring back physical proof.""

Even though the coqui and greenhouse frogs are each only about the size of a dime, they make a huge racket. Instead of making soft chirping or gentle croaking sounds, the frogs chirp as loudly as a lawnmower. ""You'd never believe so much noise could come from a creature that small,"" Stevens said.
Scientists say the frogs in Stevens's backyard recently arrived in Hawaii. They came from islands in the Caribbean Sea, south of the United States mainland. Scientists think the frogs were accidentally shipped to Hawaii in flowerpots.
Since arriving in Hawaii, the foreign frogs have spread to 150 areas. In some areas, more than 8,000 can be found on a single acre of land. Each one is adding to the noise level.
The frogs are more than a noisy nuisance; they are causing other problems, as well. They eat insects that birds and other frogs used to eat. Each night, each thunderous frog can eat at least six insects.
The number of frogs is increasing because no other animals prey on them. If the foreign frog population keeps growing, other frogs and birds in Hawaii might not have enough insects to eat and might starve.
Some officials worry that the frogs might cause some people to leave Hawaii because of the racket. ""We get a lot of complaints from residents,"" said Fred Kraus, a spokesperson for the state. ""Some [have] threatened to leave the state.""
Residents of Hawaii are trying to capture the shrill frogs, which live in trees. Recently, Stevens and some of his neighbors went out looking for the noisy critters. They used ladders to climb into trees and capture frogs. ""We got them all,"" he said.
However, within a few months of the frog roundup, more frogs moved into Stevens's neighborhood. ""It was hopeless,"" Stevens said. ""There were just too many [frogs to capture]. Now they're out of control.""

The scientists went to Sicily to learn from the 3,000-year old volcano. One of the things they wanted to learn is how to predict when a volcano will erupt.
Dozens of vulcanologists bravely climbed Mount Etna each day. They hoped that the mountain of fire would be a good teacher. ""We will probably learn more about this volcano during this eruption than had been learned in 3,000 years"", said Borris Behnke, a German scientist.
Climbing Mount Etna is more dangerous than climbing some other volcanoes. The scientists risked being burned by the rivers of lava flowing down the volcano. Hot lava flowed from both the top of the volcano and from many
, or holes, along the volcano's sides.
Etna was also hurling huge rocks into the air. ""Some of them are bigger than cars and some might be as big as trucks,"" said Behnke.
Some of the scientists didn't need to climb Mount Etna. Over the past few years, scientists had placed hundreds of sensors on the volcano. The sensors gather data about the lava flow and send the data by radio to scientists located a safe distance from the volcano.
The sensors also record earthquakes. Earthquakes in a volcanic area can mean that the volcano is about to erupt. In the days before Mount Etna erupted, the sensors had picked up more than 2,600 small earthquakes.
Behnke says that lava may erupt from Mount Etna for at least six more months. During that time, he plans to climb the volcano many times, risking his life to learn firsthand what is happening.

Even though cell phones are a hot fad, some scientists are ringing an alarm about them. The scientists say that cell phones might pose a health threat.
In the United States, more than 90 million people use cell phones. Many of those people are kids. For kids, cell phones are about more than phone calls, says Anne Charlton of the University of Manchester in England. ""It's all about the cool factor,"" Charlton said.

Most cell phone users don't think about the health risks the phones might pose. Some scientists warn that cell phones give off radiation that might be harmful to users. One recent study shows that cell phone radiation might increase a person's chance of getting some kinds of cancer.
Other medical experts say cell phones don't pose a health threat. They point to studies that have not found any link between phone use and cancer.
Scientists say that people can protect themselves from cell phone radiation. One way is to use a headset instead of talking directly into a cell phone. Or, for an even simpler solution, people can make shorter calls.
When the first cell phones were sold, they all had the same ring. Today, most cell phones can be made to ring one of several different tones. But at least one cell phone manufacturer plans to change that.
Nokia plans to start making phones that play pop tunes when they ring. Users could choose tunes by the Spice Girls, Enrique Iglesias, Lenny Kravitz, and many other artists.
By choosing pop tunes instead of the standard ringing sound, cell phone users can program their phones to match their personalities and moods, explained a company spokesperson.

Last year, a federal appeals court in California ruled that the pledge is
because it contains the phrase ""under God.""
If something does not uphold the principles of the U.S. Constitution, it is considered unconstitutional.
According to this lower court, the words ""under God"" suggest the government
, or supports, religion. That violates the First Amendment. The First Amendment of the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and press. People often refer to this freedom as the separation of church and state.
The court's decision affects nearly 10 million schoolchildren in nine western states. The states that are part of the lower court's ruling include Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. The ruling does not apply to public schools elsewhere in the United States.
Michael Newdow of California brought the case to court. He argued that his daughter, now in the fourth grade, should not have to listen to the pledge recited daily, because of its reference to God. ""I'll keep fighting to uphold the Constitution,"" he told CNN.
The Elk Grove School District in Sacramento, California, didn't agree. In response, the school district asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. The Supreme Court has the power to overturn the lower court's ruling.
The Pledge of Allegiance, written by Francis Bellamy, is published in a Boston magazine called
On Columbus Day, about 12 million American schoolchildren say the pledge for the first time.
The words ""my Flag"" are changed to ""the flag of the United States."" A year later, ""of America"" is added to the end of that sentence.

National outrage followed the lower court's decision. To many Americans, saying the pledge is a way to express their

The official points out that there are religious references in the Declaration of Independence and the national anthem. The nation's money carries the motto ""In God We Trust,"" as well.
Once the case begins next year, the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., will likely be the scene of protests. People on both sides of the debate will want their voices heard.
Until the Supreme Court issues a final ruling, the ban on the pledge has been put on hold. But as critics of the lower court's decision argue, reciting the pledge remains

forest animals in Rudyard Kiplings famous story The Jungle Book. When Kipling wrote his classic childrens book in 1894, more than 40,000 tigers roamed the forests of India. Today, there are only a few thousand left.
Wildlife officials recently started conducting Indias largest
or population count, of Bengal tigers. Last year, India also set up a task force to help save these animals from extinction. Three of the eight types of tigers have become extinct in the last 70 years.
""Its five minutes to midnight for the tiger,"" says Callum Rankine of the World Wildlife Fund. ""This is an issue affecting not just India but tigers worldwide.""
Although most of the worlds tigers live in India, the endangered cats also prowl other countries in Asia. These survivors, too, are under attack. The major threats to tigers include
There is a high demand for tiger body parts in Asia. In China, healers use bones, tails, and other body parts to make traditional medicine. People make clothes and rugs from the animals thick black-and-orange coats. Some people eat tiger meat. Poachers can make more than $70,000 per animal by selling its body parts.
Humans also compete with tigers for land. Millions of people now live in or near areas where tigers prowl. Developers build roads through forests, loggers clear forests for lumber, and farmers use the land for crops. All those practices destroy the tigers habitat.
As their habitat disappears, can these fierce felines be saved? ""Yes, but its not a sure thing,"" tiger expert James L. David Smith told
Some countries in Asia, such as Thailand, have good conservation policies, but others are still far behind.
is the protection of species. Wildlife officials are especially concerned about the fate of the large cats in India, where poaching is a huge problem, even in protected land areas.
Wildlife officials are using new computers, hightech cameras, and radio collars to track and count Bengal tigers in India. This state-of-the-art equipment will make sure that no cat is counted twice. The task force will also work closely with the Chinese government to help stop the illegal trading of tiger parts. It plans to educate farmers and ranchers about how to live with the tiger. Smith stresses that people who live closest to the majestic beasts need to help protect them from disappearing. He is involved with projects in several Asian countries where the endangered cats live. Smith says these projects have been successful because wildlife officials work closely with local people.
""This approach is powerful because these village rangers soon become recognized in their villages as experts,"" Smith says. He explains that it motivates people to make good decisions about the tigers future.
Sunita Narain, one of Indias top environmental officials, agrees. ""The country has no choice but to make peace with the communities that share the tigers home,"" she says. ""If not, we will lose the war of conservation, tiger by tiger.""
Do you think there is any way to stop poachers? Why or why not?
There were once eight types of tigers in the world. Today, only five are left. (
The tiger is the worlds largest cat. It can weigh up to 700 pounds and grow up to 9 feet long. Its tail is about 3 feet long.
Unlike many other big cats, tigers love to swim. The felines can often be found bathing in ponds, lakes, and rivers.

A recent study shows that how kids answer those questions tells a lot about whether they are headed for trouble. The study says kids who spend their free time aimlessly often get into trouble.
The study, called the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, was funded by the federal government. More than 90,000 kids between the ages of 12 and 18 took part in the study. Those kids attended 134 different U.S. schools. The study followed them from 1994 to 2000.
About half of the kids in the study said they were not involved in dangerous activities. But 25 percent said they had tried a cigarette, 26 percent said they had picked up a gun, and 47 percent said they had tried alcohol.
The study found that kids who spend their free time hanging out with nothing to do, who get poor grades, or who don't talk with their parents are eight times more likely to take part in unhealthful activities later on, such as smoking cigarettes or trying drugs.
Kids who hang out with friends who drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or have tried drugs are likely to do what their friends are doing, said Robert Blum. Blum is one of the doctors who conducted the study. In other words, kids tend to act like their friends, Blum said.
""How young people do at school and what they do with their free time are the most important [ways of predicting] risky behavior,"" said Blum.
Kids should get involved in interesting activities, Blum advised. Instead of hanging out with kids who are already trying what the study calls ""high-risk activities,"" Blum said that kids should play sports, read, talk with parents, or do homework.
The National Longitudinal Study finds that kids who are involved in activities usually don't get into trouble. Here's a story written by a
kid reporter about a few kids who know how to spend their time:
There are a lot of good kids. I know three of them who live in my hometown, Lockport, Illinois.
Amanda Clemmons and Heather Grein are best friends. Recently, they celebrated their birthdays together.
The two girls invited about 60 kids to a birthday party. The girls, however, asked their friends to bring pet supplies instead of presents. Their guests brought leashes, paper towels, pet food, treats, kitty litter, and toys to the party. Amanda and Heather then donated the pet supplies to the TLC Animal Shelter in Homer Township.

He scrambles up high ladders, walks down the sides of buildings, and rides in a fire engine. He is learning to be a firefighter at the New Haven Fire Academy.
Woolfolk and 28 other students are currently learning what it takes to become a firefighter. Classes at the fire academy, which is in Connecticut, last for about 22 weeks. On most days, the students go to school from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. However, once a week, school lasts until 10 p.m.
For two days each week, the students sit in a classroom to learn science, math, and emergency medicine. They learn the science of fires, how to calculate water pressure, and how to treat medical emergencies.
During the other three days, the students go outside and learn how to hook hoses to fire hydrants, climb buildings, rescue people trapped in burning buildings, and many other things.
""Firefighters have to know lots of different things,"" said Pablo Menendez, an instructor at the school. ""We have to treat medical emergencies, know how to handle dangerous chemicals, and rescue people who have fallen from cliffs.""
Teamwork is one of the most important lessons students learn at the school. ""Working together saves lives,"" said Capt. William Seward, the director of the academy. ""Students need to learn that they are part of a team.""
Fighting fires is not easy. The suits and equipment a firefighter wears weigh about 40 pounds.
Firefighters are very busy. In New Haven, they respond to 32,000 emergency calls a year. Each time firefighters go out, they know they might not come back. Across the United States, about 100 firefighters die each year.
""That's why the lessons learned here at the academy are so important,"" said Seward. ""What they learn here can save their lives.""
Firefighters know how dangerous their jobs are. Their training helps them overcome their fear of heights and fires. ""When you're up there on the ladder looking down, it's scary,"" said one student. ""To do this job, you've got to wipe out the fear.""
Firefighters overcome their fear for one reason. ""I wanted to help other people,"" said Leah Harwin. ""I think it is important to help other people whenever you can.""

spoke to Buzz Aldrin about NASA's planned return to the moon, a future on Mars, and his children's book,
, which was recently featured at the National Book Festival in Washington, D.C.
What does it feel like to walk on the moon?
Aldrin: You knew that you were there, but it was unreal at the same time. It's so different and unusual that it's almost dreamlike.
What was the most memorable part of walking on the moon?
Aldrin: There are two moments that are not recorded on film. They're recorded in my mind. One was just the second or two after we shut the engine down and we realized that the spacecraft was on the moon. That really was the major achievement. When I was outside seeing the Earth, my other thought was that there were only three human beings who were not on Earth. [The third was Michael Collins, who was orbiting the moon in a craft that would take the astronauts back to Earth.]
Your children's book is about following your dreams. Did you dream of being an astronaut?
Aldrin: Well, there wasn't any such thing as an astronaut until about 1958 or 1959.
[the Soviet space satellite] didn't go up until 1957, so thinking of human beings in space was not at all common.
Will returning to the moon have the same impact as it did when you and Mr. Armstrong first set foot on the moon?
Aldrin: No, I don't think there is any way you can replace that competitiveness [to reach the moon first] that existed, that pioneering spirit. The moon is a proving ground in our backyard. We've been there before, but it's preparing us to visit another planet.
You've been a supporter of a piloted mission to Mars. Why do you think it's so important that we send humans to Mars?
Aldrin: Now we can send robots to Mars, but that just wouldn't satisfy the human desire to want to expand our horizons. We've always done that. I can't answer by saying that there is going to be something profitable that will be returned from Mars, other than perhaps storytelling or making movies en route.
Your sister gave you the name ""Buzzer"" when you were youngand then it got shortened to Buzz. And that stuck?
Aldrin: It certainly did. It made it very recognizable and unique.

For years, the U.S government has been studying UFO sightings. Much of the information that the government has gathered on UFOs is top-secret.
Now a new group wants the government to tell everyone what it knows about UFOs. The group is called the Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFI).
""It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the real nature of this phenomenon,"" said John Podesta. Podesta is a former White House official and a CFI member.
The members of CFI asked the government to release information about specific UFO sightings. One such sighting happened in December 1965.
On that cold night, people in western Pennsylvania saw a bright light streak through the sky. The light looked liked it crashed behind some hills.
The mysterious object might have been a rock from space. A space rock that crashes into Earth is called a meteorite. However, several witnesses claimed that soldiers searched the area where the object ""crashed."" They say the soldiers loaded a car-sized object onto a truck, placed a tarp over the object, and drove it away-never to be seen again.
The members of CFI claim that the U.S. government has never released information about the sighting and the object. ""We can't come up with a reason why this information is being withheld. The government won't even acknowledge that the incident took place, but we know that it did,"" said one CFI member.
For now, the exact nature of some UFOs remains a mystery. CFI members hope that the answer lies in secret government papers. They say they are only searching for the truth and they want everyone to know the truth.

Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.

Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""

Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

that react to light. The retina is the lining in the back of the eye. It connects to the brain.
Marsupials have three types of cones in their eyes. Most mammals, including dogs and horses, have only two types of cone cells. That leaves them unable to see blues or reds.
Australia is home to most marsupials. This continent is often called the ""land down under."" That is because it lies in the Southern Hemispherethe half of Earth below the equator. Much of central Australia is desert. The Australian desert is called the outback, because it is so remote. More than 90 percent of the Australian population lives along the coast.

Thanks to Arrese's most recent discovery, scientists hope to learn more about mammals' eyesight. ""Before my findings, scientists were firmly convinced that among mammals, only primates, including humans, could see a full range of colors,"" she says.
In addition, her research has put the spotlight on the pouch-bearing creatures. Scientists will use the latest research to learn more about marsupials. ""For a long time, marsupials were considered not as interesting as other mammals,"" says Arrese. ""Now all that has changed.""

Despite the benefits, wind power is far from perfect. Opponents of wind farms say the biggest problem is unreliabilitywhen the wind doesn't blow, there is no power. They also argue that wind turbines can be an eyesore and threaten birds and other wildlife that fly into the blades.

Martin Luther King, Jr. at the March on Washington, August 28, 1963.
On a summer day in 1963, more than 200,000 people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to rally for equal rights. There, they heard Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Today, construction of a memorial honoring King is under way about a half mile from the Lincoln Memorial, where King gave that famous speech. The new memorial will be the first on the National Mall to honor an African American.
The groundbreaking ceremony for the King memorial was held on November 13. President George W. Bush, former President William Jefferson Clinton, poet Maya Angelou, and talk show host Oprah Winfrey were among the speakers at the event. ""We give Martin Luther King his rightful place among the many Americans honored on the National Mall,"" Bush told the crowd of about 5,000 people.
King (19291968) dedicated his life to helping others. As a boy growing up in the U.S. South, King witnessed African Americans being treated unfairly. At that time, the South was
or separated by race. Under the law, African Americans were not allowed to attend the same schools as white people and had to sit in the backseats of buses. African Americans also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains.
When King was older, he worked to change those unjust laws. During the 1950s and 1960s, he gave speeches and organized peaceful marches and protests.
Beginning in 1955, King led the famous Montgomery bus boycott to protest segregation. For 381 days, African Americans

King gained national attention from the boycott. As a result of his work, civil rights laws were passed.
are personal rights to freedom and equality guaranteed to all U.S. citizens and protected by the Constitution.
The King memorial is scheduled to be completed in 2008. The design uses water, stone, and trees to represent the themes of justice, democracy, and hope. The King memorial will also include a boulder called the Stone of Hope, from which will emerge a 30-foot figure of King. The memorial will contain a circular stone wall chiseled with King's words.
King's dream was for all people to be treated fairly and equally under the law. The design of the memorial is based on a line from his historic ""I Have a Dream"" speech: ""We will be able to hew [cut] out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.""

The strange substance is not some weird goo from space. It is actually bee waste. The environmental workers found an unusually large number of beehives near the towns where the goo fell.
When the bees from those hives flew over the communities, they dropped the waste. Because it was a good year for bees, there was a lot of waste. Luckily, the bee goo is made mostly of pollen and is harmless.

And they're off! Teams of specially trained dogs are racing to the finish line across one of the toughest terrains in the world.
Along a jagged trail of snow and ice, the teams battle Alaska's below-zero temperatures. They are competing in the Iditarod (igh-DIT-ah-rod) Trail Sled Dog Race, which kicked off on March 6.
The Iditarod is the longest sled dog race in the world. This year, about 90 sled dog teams are running the roughly 1,110-mile route.
The race, now in its 32nd year, starts in the city of Anchorage and ends in the city of Nome. The stretch of land the teams must cross is almost equal to the distance from New York City to Miami.
A team of 12 to 16 dogs tow each sled. It can take more than two weeks for teams to complete the race. In 2002, a record holder completed the race in 8 days, 22 hours, 46 minutes, and 2 seconds.

During their journey, mushers set up camp to make sure the dogs get enough food, water, and rest. The mushers and dogs are required to stop for at least one 24-hour period and two 8-hour periods.
Not surprisingly, dog mushing is Alaska's state sport. Before mushing became a popular sport, dog teams served as an important form of transportation.
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, miners discovered gold in Alaska. Thousands of people traveled there for the gold rush.
During that time, sled dogs helped people get from place to place and transported gold, mail, and supplies. ""Dog teams were important to settling Alaska during this time,"" race director Joanne Potts told

In January 1959, Alaska became the 49th state. More than twice the size of Texas, Alaska is the largest state.
Alaska's nickname is ""The Last Frontier"" because much of the land is wilderness that remains unsettled.

In addition to celebrating progress toward peace, the Nobel committee gives awards for achievements in other areas, such as literature, physics, chemistry, and medicine. Each of the winners receives $1.4 million, a gold medal, and a diploma.
The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway. The other Nobel Prizes are given out in Stockholm, Sweden. Both countries are in Europe.

is a crowded, dirty area with poor living conditions within a large city.
Once every eight days, she wakes up before dawn and treks down a hill from her run-down shack to a pumping station to beg for water. She stands in line with as many as 150 other people. When her turn finally comes, she gets aboard a tanker truck full of brownish, smelly liquid.
The truck then climbs the hill and pours the water into a dumpster and six barrels. Martinez and her family use that water to bathe, clean, and wash. Although the water is free, it is not
or drinkable, so Martinez also buys bottled water at a store. She imagines what it would be like ""to just turn on a faucet.""
Representatives from 148 countries recently met in Mexico City for the fourth World Water Forum in the hopes of making Martinezs dream a reality. More than 1 billion people around the world do not have access to safe drinking water, according to the United Nations. The forum participants met to exchange ideas about how to quench the thirst of the worlds soaring population.
Although more than two-thirds of Earths surface is covered in water, there is only a limited amount of drinking water in the world. Salty seawater makes up about 97 percent of the worlds water. Another 2 percent of water is frozen at the North and South poles.
Half a percent is too far underground to be reached, which leaves about half a percent of
for all the people and animals on Earth. Freshwater does not have any salt in it. Earths freshwater supply is renewable only by
Although most Americans have access to clean water, people in many countries around the world do not. Some countries in Central and South America, Asia, and Africa have some of the most

Participants at the seven-day World Water Forum discussed ways of pooling the worlds money and resources to save water. They proposed building more dams to collect rainwater.
The participants suggested that more decisionmaking power about water be given to people in small towns and villages. They also called for governments, not corporations, to take charge of providing water. Around the world, people agree that access to water is a basic human right.
Governments know they need to act now to save the worlds liquid resource. ""Water is endangered and so are we all,"" Loc Fauchon, president of the World Water Council, told reporters.
Water moves from the air to the land and back to the air again and again. The repeated journey is known as the
Because water travels in a cycle, it can carry pollutants into the ocean, the air, and the ground.
The suns heat changes water into a gas, or vapor.
The water vapor meets cool air and changes back into tiny droplets of water.
Those water droplets form clouds. As the drops get heavier, they fall from the clouds as rain, sleet, or snow.
Most precipitation falls into the ocean. Some falls on the land and moves into bodies of water.
What are some ways in which you can help conserve water?

The NBA has brought back its old ball after trying out a new ball covered in synthetic material.
For the past few months, players had to use a ball covered with a synthetic, or human-made, material. Many players, including O'Neal, complained the plasticcoated basketball was a bad decision. They said the new ball didn't bounce as well as the leather ball. The new ball also cut their hands. ""The new ball is terrible,"" O'Neal, the Miami Heat center, says.
Scientists at the University of Texas at Arlington ran experiments comparing the synthetic and leather balls. The biggest difference they found was in the way the new ball absorbs moisture.
The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture than the leather ball does. That means the synthetic ball doesn't become heavier when it comes in contact with players' sweat. It also means the synthetic ball can become slippery because moisture stays on its surface, scientist Kaushik De, who helped conduct the study, told
The return of the leather ball has many NBA players jumping for joy. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us.""

""It's very important to educate children about environmental issues,"" says principal Deanna Duncan. ""If we don't take care of [Earth], there isn't another one.""
CIS is just one of hundreds of schools in the United States that are going green. A
is built with recycled and environmentally friendly materials. Green schools are designed to use less energy than traditional school buildings.
The majority of the energy supply in the United States comes from the burning of
such as oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels were formed from the remains of prehistoric animals and plants. People use fossil fuels when they drive their cars, heat their homes, and power farms, factories, and cities.
Though people depend on fossil fuels, those energy sources have their drawbacks. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air and releases gases that contribute to global warmingthe gradual rise in Earth's average temperature.
Hoover Dam generates clean energy by using water to spin turbines.
Fossil fuels are gradually being used up. To conserve them, scientists are looking to
sources. Renewable energy is power from sources that can't be used up and do not pollute the environment. Water, wind, and solar power are types of renewable energy.
President George W. Bush announced an energy plan that calls on lawmakers to ensure that ecofriendly fuels are developed and made easily available to Americans. Gas is a fossil fuel used in cars, and the price to fill up a gas tank is rising. Gas costs about $3 a gallon in some parts of the United States.
At CIS, students are excited for construction to begin on their new school building. ""I think the school is going to be a lot better,"" Drew Barsody, 10, told
""I'm looking forward to seeing the solar panels.""
These wind turbines convert wind into electricity.
Here are some common environmentally friendly energy alternatives.
Solar Power: Solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat and electricity. California and Arizona are two states that use solar power. One drawback of solar power is that energy can't be collected if the sun isn't shining.
Energy produced from windmills is used to generate electricity. The amount of electricity generated from wind has been growing in recent years, tripling since 1998 in the United States. Electricity is produced from wind in 30 states, including California, Texas, and Iowa.
is one of the oldest sources of energy. Hydropower often comes from dams or waterfalls. Of all renewable energy sources, it is most often used to generate electricity. In 2004, it accounted for 7 percent of all the electricity generated in the United States.
Ethanol is a clean-burning fuel that can power cars. It is created from several sources, such as corn crops. Typically, a small amount of ethanol is combined with gasoline to fuel vehicles. That helps decrease the fuel's cost and harmful emissions.

Ecuador is home to hundreds of types of frogs and toads. But now scientists are worrying about their health.
The mountains and thick forests of Ecuador, in South America, are home to 417 types of frogs and toads. Tiny red-eyed tree frogs hide inside flowers.

Over the last 50 years, many amphibian species have become extinct. Two of every five of the 3,046 species that live in North and South America are at risk of vanishing.
Why are these creatures in trouble? Their
is being destroyed as loggers cut down trees to make room for farms and roads. A habitat is a place in nature where a plant or an animal makes its home. Disease, weather changes, and pollution are other causes of the decline in amphibian populations.
Scientists are concerned about the decrease in the number of frogs. The health of frogs is closely linked to the health of the environment. ""Amphibian extinction is an indicator of [a problem with the environment],"" scientist Jonathan Campbell told
Because amphibians breathe through their skin, they easily absorb pollution. They are usually the first to disappear when the environment is under threat. As a result, some frogs are born with

Ostriches don't fly. Instead, they use their wings to attract mates, alert other ostriches to danger, and keep their balance. Being stuck on the ground doesn't slow ostriches down, though. They can run as fast as a car can travel--up to 50 miles an hour for about 30 minutes.
At the farm in South Africa, the ostriches roam an area of flat land almost the size of 200 football fields. The workers at the farm take care of the ostrich eggs--the biggest of all bird eggs.

His journey through the Andes Mountains in South America was not easy. Bingham hacked his way through thick forests and climbed slippery slopes. One wrong stop could have sent him plummeting off a cliff.
After crawling up a snake-infested mountain, Bingham stumbled upon one of the greatest finds of the last century. He uncovered ruins from the ""lost city"" of Machu Picchu (MAH-choo PEE-choo).
Until Bingham's discovery, the ruins remained hidden for more than 400 years. Machu Picchu, which lies high atop a peak, is an ancient city that belonged to the Incas. Its name means ""old peak.""
Thanks to a traveling museum exhibit, people in the United States can go back in time to experience Incan life in Machu Picchu. The exhibit, called ""Machu Picchu: Unveiling the Mysteries of the Incas,"" is currently on display at the Chicago Field Museum.
""It is the first exhibit of its kind,"" museum project manager Hillary Hansen told
. ""It is the largest traveling exhibit of Inca objects.""
that Bingham collected are on display--from ceramic jars to copper and bronze jewelry. Artifacts are objects that people made long ago.
Machu Picchu is an ancient city that belonged to the Incas.
The Incas were people who ruled one of the largest empires in South America. Their empire extended from present-day Colombia into western Argentina.
Their vast civilization began to spread in about 1200. It lasted through the mid-1500s.
When Bingham discovered Machu Picchu, he thought he had found the birthplace of the Inca Empire. Since that time,
have learned that the city served as a summer residence for Incan kings. (Archaeologists study artifacts to learn about the past.)
The Incas built Machu Picchu between 1450 and 1470 for the ruler Pachacuti. The royal family would relax, hunt, and entertain foreign visitors there.
Machu Picchu wasn't just a home for nobles. About 500 common people lived in the stone city and worked for the royal family as farmers, artisans, and servants.
The city was abandoned in the mid-1500s, not long after the Spanish
(conquerors) arrived. The Inca Empire collapsed under Spanish rule.
Today, Machu Picchu is a popular tourist attraction. Nearly 400,000 people visit the ancient grounds each year.
Scientists still research the area to unlock more mysteries about the Incas. ""In the scheme of things, we still know very little about Machu Picchu,"" said Hansen.
Machu Picchu, which is located in Peru, was a city of palaces, temples, farms, and small houses.
Many of the buildings at Machu Picchu are made of large stones. The stones are so tightly wedged together that a piece of paper cannot fit between them.
Machu Picchu's farmland was carved into steps because it was hard for farmers to plow up and down the mountain. That allowed farmers to plant crops on the flat parts of the land and prevented rain from washing soil downhill.
The Incas had no writing, no money system, and no knowledge of the wheel. How do you think they created such a large empire?

George Washington never lived in the White House, but he selected the architect, James Hoban, to design it. The house took eight years to build, from 1792 to 1800.
John Adams, the second president, was the first to live in the White House. When he and his wife moved into the house on November 1, 1800, many of the rooms were not finished.
In 1814, when James Madison was president, British soldiers set fire to the White House. Workers took nearly three years to rebuild the famous house.

472,"Experts hope 2006 will be the year the world is polio-free.
Will polio be declared a disease of the past?
World health groups are fighting a war
with a crippling and sometimes deadly diseasepolio. Their efforts are paying off. Polio has been wiped out in 10 African countries, according to a recent report.
Since mid-2003, nearly 200 children in those 10 western and central African countries were
for life, but no new cases have been reported since last June. When people are paralyzed, they are unable to move different parts of their bodies and may be unable to walk.
The disease raced across Africa and into Asia after people in Nigeria refused the polio
mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think well get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told
She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria.""
Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly
disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havent been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims.
With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world. On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government approved the use of a vaccine that stopped people from getting the disease. Jonas Salk was the doctor who invented the first polio vaccine.
A boy in Africa receives an oral polio vaccine from a WHO (World Health Organization) worker.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world thanks to Salk, it still threatens children in Africa and Asia. Major efforts were recently under way to
or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been
Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door.
To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November.
After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Its uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives.""
Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization.
Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why?
Jonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.
From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Roosevelts death, Salks vaccine was declared officially safe.
In October 2005for the first time in 26 years in the United Statesfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnt at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.

As smoke billowed from the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, a dark cloud seemed to descend over the world.
As news of the terrorist attacks spread, people were shocked and horrified by the terrible events.
Throughout the world, people expressed outrage at the attack. ""It's just sick,"" said one firefighter. An airplane expert said, ""This is perhaps the [worst] terrorist attack that's ever happened in the world.""
Like adults, kids were very upset by the attacks. Many of them first learned about the brutal attacks at school.
In many schools, students and teachers comforted one another. Teacher Diane Bulens said the principal at her school in California told the teachers to watch out for the students and then ""told the kids to take care of the teachers.""
Donna Taylor, a teacher in Ohio, said some of the students in her school had friends and family in New York and Washington, D.C.
One student was worried about her father, who was in New York. Taylor offered to let the student use her cell phone to learn whether her father was OK. He was!
Taylor told her students that terrorists wanted ""to disrupt everyone's lives, but we aren't going to allow them to disrupt our day.""
Even though teachers and students looked after one another, many were still fearful that something more would happen. Erin Ricketts, age 11, feared that her state would be attacked. ""I heard California may be next,"" she said. She added that she was worried ""because my mom works in a big building.""
After school, many students went home to talk with their parents about the attacks. Doctors say that in this tragic time, kids, parents, and teachers need to talk to one another. By coming together, Americans will grow and become stronger than ever.

Kids really can make a difference. Just ask 15-year-old Ryan Hreljac (HURL-jak) of Kemptville, Canada. When he was 6, he learned about the shortage of safe drinking water in some parts of the world. Today, Ryans Well Foundation has raised more than $1.5 million to build more than 200 wells in 11 countries, most in Africa.
During his mission to raise money, Ryan became pen pals with Akana Jimmy, an orphan who lived in Africa. In Jimmys tiny village of Agweo, Uganda, there was no clean water until Ryan raised enough money to buy the village its first well. A new book tells the story of their life-changing friendship
Ryan and Jimmy and the Well in Africa That Brought Them Together.
Jimmy used to wake up before midnight and walk 3 miles to the nearest pond. There, he would fill a large plastic container with
or polluted, water. Jimmy made that trip three times every day before heading to school. ""Because you dont have any choice, you drink it,"" he told
In 1998, Ryans first-grade teacher told the class that polluted water was causing thousands of children to become sick and even die. For Ryan, a lack of clean water was unimaginable. His teacher said the cost of building a well in Africa was just $70. Determined to help, Ryan spent months doing household chores to earn enough money to pay for a well.
Later that year, Ryan proudly took his savings to WaterCan, a Canadian organization that helps provide safe drinking water to impoverished countries. To his disappointment, Ryan was told that the cost of building a well was much higher: $2,000.
or promised, to continue raising money. Word of his mission spread, and soon the media picked up his story. To Ryans astonishment, people started sending him donations. By 2000, Ryan, then 9, had raised enough money to build his first well. With help from Canadian Physicians for Aid and Relief, Ryan chose Jimmys village as the site for the well.
Ryans well changed the lives of the people in Agweo and especially affected Jimmys life. Thats when the two boys became pen pals. They became friends when Ryan traveled to Uganda in 2000 to help complete the well.
In 2003, Ryans family arranged to bring Jimmy to their home in Canada. ""We used to live as friends,"" Jimmy, now 17, says, ""but now we live as brothers.""
The two teenagers hope their book will raise awareness about unsafe drinking water and prompt people to take action to help. ""The situation is difficult, but you have to start somewhere,"" Ryan says. ""We need to work harder to make the world a better place.""
To find out how you can help Ryan and Jimmy bring safe drinking water to countries in need, go to
More than two-thirds of Earths surface is covered in water, so you might think there is enough to go around. You may be surprised to learn that only a scarce, or limited, amount of the water is drinkable. Salty seawater makes up about 97 percent of the worlds water. Another 2 percent is frozen at the North and South poles.
More than 1 billion people around the world dont have access to safe drinking water, according to the United Nations. Why isnt all the freshwater available to people safe for drinking? Chemicals from factories, fertilizers from farms, and untreated sewage pollute the water supply. ""One of our goals is to educate people about the importance of clean water,"" says Ryan.

The centennial celebration honors the Ancient Pueblo (PWEH-bloh) people, formerly known as the Anasazi (ah-nuh-SAH-zee). The word

Why did the Ancient Pueblo abandon the region? ""We dont know the exact reason,"" says Puskar. Some possibilities are climate change, drought, or overuse of the areas soil and other resources.

On June 29, 1906, Congress passed a bill to establish Mesa Verde National Park. The bill, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt, protects the cultural treasures at this historic Native American site. It is a federal crime to remove or destroy any historic object or monument on land owned by the U.S. government.

Mesa Verde National Park protects more than 600 cliff dwellings built by the Ancient Pueblo. The two largest dwellings contain about 160 rooms each.
By building their dwellings out of stone, the Ancient Pueblo could construct homes on top of one another. By 1100, their structures were as large as some modern-day apartment buildings.

Much of that minority increase is due to immigration to the United States, the census reported. One in five kids has at least one parent who moved to this country from another country.
Del Pinal added that kids are more diverse than their parents because the number of marriages between people of different races is four times higher than it was in 1990. Two out of every five kids are part of at least one minority group.
Nearly 3 million kids have parents who have different ethnic backgrounds. For example, one parent may be from Asia and another from Europe.

It began in Philadelphia and will travel to four other states during the yearMissouri,Texas, Colorado, and Georgia.
""In his 300th year, we want people to understand why Ben Franklin is still so important,"" spokesperson Nicola Twilley told
""We want to bring him and his
to life."" A legacy is something passed on to future generations.
Why is Philadelphia making such a big fuss about Franklins birthday? In 1723,when he was 17 years old, Franklin made his home there. He worked to make life in that city better. In Philadelphia, he helped set up the countrys first hospital, public library, and volunteer fire department.
During the 1700s, Philadelphia was the center of American government. When Franklin was young, America was made up of 13 colonies ruled by England. Franklin helped America gain independence. He also helped write the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.
""Hes very inspirational,"" says Twilley. ""He came from a poor background. He had only two years of school. He made himself into one of the greatest Americans of all time.""
If you could interview Ben Franklin, what would you ask him? Why?
Ben Franklin only attended school from the ages of 8 to 10. But his love of learning lasted a lifetime.
Even at a young age, Franklin was a scientist and an inventor. At the age of 10, Franklin invented wooden swim fins to help him swim faster.
When he was 12 years old, Franklin worked in his brothers printing shop. Later, he opened his own shop.

On the third night, some kids went to bed one hour earlier than usual. Others went to bed one hour later. The next day, experts tested the kids again.
Here is what the experts found: The kids who slept an extra hour improved their test scores. Some kids did better by as much as two grade levels! The kids who lost an hour of sleep did not improve their scores.
Most third graders need at least nine hours of sleep each night, say experts. However, studies show that many kids are not sleeping enough. That can make it hard for kids to pay attention in school.
Going to bed early is not easy, experts agree. But its worth it! One extra hour of sleep may mean the difference between doing well and falling asleep in class.
Here are some tips to help you get a good nights sleep:
relax with quiet time before going to sleep.
go to bed at the same time each night.
eat a big meal or exercise right before bed.
drink soda pop with caffeine in the evening.
Along with helping kids do well in school, why is sleep important?

Most people would not get excited about finding an old toothbrush lying around. But what if that brush was more than 250 years old? That's right! Scientists recently dug up a toothbrush that old!
The brush was discovered in Germany. Experts think it dates to about 1750. That could make it the oldest toothbrush found in Europe.
The brush is so old that its bristles have rotted away. Its 4-inch handle is made of animal bone. One end of the handle was carved into a tiny spoon. Scientists believe the spoon was used to clean out the owner's ears.

George W. Bush taking the Oath of Office on January 20, 2001, after his first election.
George W. Bush first took the Oath of Office in 2001. That is when he became the 43rd U.S. president. The oath is the only part of the day's events that is required by law. Every president since George Washington has taken this oath.
In 1961, John F. Kennedy gave one of the most famous inaugural addresses. Kennedy was the 35th president of the United States. He said, ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."" What do you think his message meant?
In 1977, Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. president to walk in the inaugural parade. The parade starts at the Capitol and ends at the White House. The White House is the president's home for the next four years. Every president except George Washington has lived there.
An inaugural ball is a formal dance. The first official ball was held in 1809 for President James Madison. So far, no president has attended more inaugural balls than President Bill Clinton in 1997. He and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton attended 14 in one night!
George Washington's inaugural address in 1793 was the shortest. His speech lasted only eight minutes. In 1841, William Henry Harrison gave the longest inaugural address. It lasted almost two hours!
Cold weather caused quite a problem at the inaugural ball for Ulysses S. Grant in 1873. The ball was held in a tent, which wasn't heated, and the valves on the band's musical instruments froze!
In 1981, guests at Ronald Reagan's inaugural balls received a sweet treat. Forty million jelly beans--one of Reagan's favorite candies--were eaten to celebrate!

Lincoln served as president during the Civil War (18611865). During that war, Southern states tried to break away from the country. They fought for their right to own slaves. Northern states were against owning slaves. Lincoln was also against slavery. In 1863, he signed the Emancipation Proclamation. It helped free most U.S. slaves.

In 1842, Lincoln married Mary Todd. Together they had four sons.
Lincoln became the 16th U.S. president in 1861. The Civil War started a few weeks later. Lincoln won reelection in 1864.
The war was coming to an end in April 1865. Lincoln was shot on April 14, while watching a play in Washington, D.C. He died the next day. Lincoln is buried in Springfield, Ill.

This year, the Atlantic Ocean is warmer than it usually is. That helps whip up more storms. Warm water provides a lot of moisture for hurricanes, Bell told
The current wind conditions are also perfect for storms, he says. Stronger hurricanes form when the speed and direction of wind is the same along much of the East Coast of the United States.
The worst of the storms may be over soon. Usually by mid-October, [they] dont really affect the United States anymore, Bell says.

Experts have also warned that tourists visiting Machu Picchu are damaging the Inca ruins. In recent years, tourists have started small fires and have littered the Machu Picchu area.
The government of Peru, however, disagreed with the warnings. ""Machu Picchu won't collapse,"" said one government official.
The official said that Machu Picchu has lasted for more than 500 years. He added that he doesn't see why landslides or tourism would destroy the city anytime soon.
The Incas built Machu Picchu sometime around 1460. The blocks used to build Machu Picchu were wedged so tightly together that a razor blade cannot fit between the stones. The ruins include about 200 stone buildings, including palaces, temples, and small homes.
The Incas were a South American Indian people who ruled one of the largest and richest empires on the continent. By 1532, the Incas ruled an area that stretched for 2,500 miles along the west coast of South America. The Inca empire included parts of what are now Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.
The Incas were skilled in farming and in building stone structures and roads. They were also skilled craftspeople, making many fine gold and silver ornaments. They studied the stars and knew how to predict the seasons of the year.
Spanish soldiers, led by Francisco Pizarro, attacked and conquered the Incas in 1532.

Overfishing is partly to blame for the problem. Penguins eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called
Fishing boats are catching large amounts of krill. That leaves less food for penguins to eat.
Another reason for the decline in the number of penguins is global warming. Global warming is the slow increase in average temperature around the world. It is causing sea ice to melt. Penguins need the floating sea ice as a place to rest while they search for krill.

Fifty years ago, the courageous act of Rosa Parks changed history.
For years, Rosa Parks stood up to unfair laws against black people. Then on December 1, 1955, she changed the history of the United States forever. Rosa Parks was riding a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and was told to give up her seat to a white passenger. When she refused, she was arrested and taken to jail.
At that time, states in the South were
by law. The law kept black people from having the same rights as white people. Black people were forced to sit in the back of city buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, water fountains, and other public facilities.
After Parks was arrested, thousands of people refused to ride the city buses in Montgomery. The
was led by Martin Luther King Jr. and lasted for more than a year. It was a success. In 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the bus segregation law was illegal.
December 1 marks the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest for not giving up her seat. On that day, people across the United States will honor this important time in history.
Special events will take place in Montgomery, where the equal rights movement began. As part of the day's events, hundreds of kids will march to remember the bus boycott.
""Never again should we foster hate or distrust based on one's skin color,"" says event spokesperson Kenneth Mullinax. The children will march ""as a pledge to treat everyone with equal love,"" he told
""Rosa Parks's not giving up her seat on the bus shows how important it is to stand up for what we believe in,"" says Mullinax.
Today, people can step aboard the bus that Rosa Parks made famous. It is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan. The bus has been restored to look as it did in 1955.

Scientists hope the missions will answer questions about Mars. The spacecraft will take pictures of the planet. Some spacecraft will even collect samples of the soil on Mars to study. NASA first sent spacecraft to Mars in the 1960s. Since then, several spacecraft have landed on Mars. One of the most exciting landings happened in 1997, when
landed on Mars. Millions of people on Earth watched as it's tiny rover, Sojourner, wandered over the planet's surface.
Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is often called the Red Planet because it looks red from Earth. Mars looks red because its surface has lots of iron. The iron has rusted and turned a reddish-brown color. Sometimes, winds on Mars whip the reddish dust into the sky, turning the sky pink.
A dust storm whips across the Martian surface. Dust storms often form in the Martian spring. A dust storm forms when high winds pick up sand and blow it across the surface. Large dust storms can last for months and blanket the entire planet with the red dust.
Two dry riverbeds cut across the surface of Mars. Each riverbed is more than a half-mile deep. Scientists say the riverbeds formed when water suddenly gushed to the surface from inside Mars. The riverbeds might have formed billions of years ago, scientists say. Hundreds of dry riverbeds crisscross the Red Planet.
Valles Marineris is the largest canyon on Mars. It is nearly 2,500 miles long and about 4 miles deep. On Earth, it would almost span the distance between New York City and Los Angeles. (The Grand Canyon on Earth is only 227 miles long and 1 mile deep!) The volcanoes on Mars are larger than volcanoes on Earth. The largest Martian volcano, is about the same size as Arizona at its base.
Mars has ice caps at its north and south poles, much like Earth has. But Martian ice caps are made of water ice and frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. The polar ice caps grow in the winter and shrink in the summer. This photo shows the planet's south pole in summer.
One day on Mars is 24 hours long; one year is 687 days long.
Temperatures on Mars range from -220 degrees Fahrenheit (F) to 68 degrees F.
Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.

South Korean workers have begun rebuilding railroad tracks that will connect South Korea's capital with North Korea's capital. When complete, the tracks will connect the cities for the first time in 50 years.
The two countries fought a war against each other from 1950 to 1953. The United States, China, and other countries also fought in the war. The war ended when North Korea and South Korea agreed to stop fighting. However, neither country signed a peace treaty. Since then, they have been enemies. Today, 2 million soldiers protect the border between North and South Korea.

Their special blue blood is used by doctors to help fight diseases. Now some scientists say the number of horseshoe crabs is falling, and they need our help.
Scientists believe the horseshoe crab population around the world is falling--for many reasons. Fishermen catch horseshoe crabs and use them as bait.

Batman, have you heard? A new kind of ""batmobile"" is in the works!
Scientists in Rhode Island are studying how bats fly. The United States Air Force is funding the $6 million project. It hopes the mammals will offer clues about how to design better-flying aircraft. Mammals are warm-blooded animals that feed their babies milk.
Bats can fly in ways that birds and airplanes can't. The animals' wings have more than 24 joints. The joints allow them to
, or control, their wings while flying. Bats can stretch and bend their wings. This helps them fly higher and faster. Scientist Sharon Swartz says bats' control of their wings is similar to humans' control of their hands. ""Bats are the only flying animals whose wings are really just like human hands,"" she told
Swartz and the other scientists will study about 20 species of bats over the next five years. They are using real bats, high-tech cameras, and wind tunnels in their research. The team hopes to find out why bats can turn sharply without falling. If airplanes could do that, they could
, or move, in tight spaces. They could also fly in more dangerous conditions. The Air Force also hopes to learn how weight affects bat flight. Bats can carry up to 50 percent of their weight while flying. If aircraft designers knew bats' secrets, they could design airplanes that could carry more weight.
Swartz says there is still a lot more to learn about the animals. ""We expect to be studying bats long into the future,"" she says.
It's going to be a hair-raising Halloween for Little Rock Zoo in Arkansas. Three vampire bats were born there recently. Vampire bats are the only type of bat that drinks the blood of other animals. They do this to survive, but don't worry! Vampire bats are usually friendly with people. Of the more than 1,000 bat species, only three are vampire bats.

Robots may help lower the risks of heart operations. A doctor's hand can sometimes shake slightly. Or sometimes, a doctor's hand can be too large to reach some areas of the heart.

During the early 1700s, there was a man who struck fear in the hearts of sailors. Seeing his pirate ship on the high seas might have made them yell, Shiver me timbers!
The News & Observer, Robert Willett/AP Images
Crews bring up a 3,000-pound anchor from the shipwreck.
His name was Edward Teach. People called him Blackbeard. He was a cruel pirate captain with a long black beard. He robbed and hurt people along the eastern coast of North America until 1718. That year, his ship crashed. It sank near North Carolina. Blackbeard got away. He was killed soon after.

It rests on the ocean floor off the coast of Beaufort, North Carolina.
Researchers found many weapons near and inside the ship. The finds included parts of a sword and many cannons. Blackbeard most likely used the battle gear to
other ships. To seize is to take over.
Blackbeards scary appearance also helped him get what he wanted. During battles, the pirate was said to have put lit matches under his hat. That caused smoke to appear around his beard.
Experts are continuing to study Blackbeards ship. They are collecting

Sleepovers arent as fun as they used to be. Or at least they arent in New York, New York. Thats because
are the guests! Bedbugs are tiny insects that feed on blood.
The critters have crawled into the Big Apple and other cities. In fact, more than 20 states have major bedbug problems.
The adult bugs are the size of apple seeds. They may be small, but they cause big trouble. Bedbugs ... can travel far in search of a good meal, says scientist Jody Gangloff-Kaufmann.
Bedbugs hide in homes across the country.
The insects can live in mattresses and couches. They come out at night to eat. While people sleep, the bugs drink their blood. The bites dont hurt, but they can cause itchy bumps.
Those bumps are popping up all over. About 95 percent of U.S. pest control companies reported battling bedbugs in the past year. That is according to the National Pest Management Association. A rise in travel might be one reason. Travelers might carry the bugs in their suitcases.
might also be the problem. Those are chemicals that kill insects. Some pesticides may not be strong enough to get rid of bedbugs.
Officials arent taking the attacks lying down. New York made a law to
or stop, renters from moving into apartments that have bedbugs. That state also passed a law making schools tell parents about bedbug sightings.
Getting the word out is a good idea, Gangloff-Kaufmann told
The best way to get rid of bedbugs starts with prevention, she says.
Got bedbugs? Dogs can tell! Experts have trained pooches to use their powerful noses to sniff out the insects.
Peoples noses are too weak to find the scent. Dogs noses are much stronger. The dogs can locate the insects in just a few minutes.
Once pups find a bedbug, they sit down nearby. Then a pest control expert comes to get rid of the insects. Good dogs!
Why might the number of bedbugs grow quickly in big cities such as New York?

In July, wildlife workers rescued African penguins from Robben Island. Robben Island is in the Atlantic Ocean near South Africa. Workers took 14,500 oily penguins to a wildlife center. Each penguin was carefully washed. It took two people about an hour to clean the oil from each of the birds!
Workers took the cleaned penguins to the east coast of South Africa. The penguins were set free in the ocean and swam back to Robben Island. While the penguins were swimming home, workers had time to clean up the spilled oil.
Workers put a special device on a few penguins. The device sent information to a computer. The computer showed exactly where each penguin was on its 560-mile swim home.
Did you know that there are 17 kinds of penguins? Here are just a few:
The emperor penguin is the largest of all penguins. It stands about 4 feet tall and can weigh up to 100 pounds.

Antarctica is a big icy continent. It is around the South Pole. The South Pole is found at the bottom of Earth.
Penguins are birds. Emperor and Adelie penguins live in Antarctica. The penguins stay warm because they have feathers that are very small and close together. The feathers have oil on them. Cold water can't get through the feathers to touch the penguins' skin. Each year, penguins molt, or lose, their feathers and grow new ones.
Penguins can waddle faster than humans can walk.
Penguins like to line up and dive into the water again and again.
Penguins sometimes toboggan, or slide, on their bellies.
Penguins surf waves to get back to shore.
Weddell seals live in Antarctica. Weddell seals swim in the cold ocean water to catch fish and other ocean animals to eat. These seals don't chew their food. They swallow the food in big pieces.
Weddell seals stay warm because they have a layer of blubber, or fat. They also have a coat of thick fur. The fur keeps water from touching the seal's skin.

Inside the storm, the hunters measure the amount of rain and the speed of the wind. Their work helps weather experts predict where the hurricane will go and how strong it will become.
The three pictures show how a hurricane forms.
 First, small storms begin over an ocean.
 Then strong winds make the storms spin around and come together.
 Soon, a hurricane forms. It spins around and around. Sometimes it moves over land and brings heavy rains and strong winds.

Popocatpetl means ""smoking mountain"" in a language once spoken in Mexico. It is also the name of a Mexican volcano, which people have nicknamed ""Popo."" Mexico is a country just south of the United States.
Late last year, a volcano called Popo erupted. Gases and ash filled the air. No one was hurt by the eruption. Scientists studying Popo knew it was going to erupt. About 50,000 people live in the villages and towns that surround Popo. The scientists warned those people. Many of the residents left their homes before the eruption.

In a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear.
Scientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help.
Scientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled.
Scientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest.
The African elephant is the largest animal that lives on land. African elephants can weigh up to 16,000 pounds.
An elephant's trunk contains more than 40,000 muscles. The trunk is used to smell, breathe, touch, eat, drink, and bathe.

Cockroaches like to rest together in dark places. The scientists put the robots with a group of roaches. Soon, the robots and roaches were all resting together in a dark place.
Then the robots were placed in a light area. When the roaches saw the robots, they ended up resting in the light area too.
What did scientists learn from the study? A few cockroaches can change how the whole group behaves.
The robotic cockroaches did not look like real insects. However, the real roaches did not notice. That is because scientists made sure that the robots smelled like roaches.

Goats are doing their part to help prevent forest fires. Goats eat tall grass, weeds, and small branches. Those plants often spread forest fires in places such as California and Florida.
Many states are using goats to eat plants on mountains and in fields close to people's houses. By eating plants in those areas, the goats leave a clear patch of land. That way, if a fire starts in the forest, it will not be able to spread to where people live.
In 1999, there were about 94,000 forest fires in the United States.
Forest fires in 1999 burned nearly 9,500 square miles of land in the United States.
Most forest fires are started by people. People are sometimes careless with cigarettes and campfires.
Lightning is another cause of forest fires. When the forest is very dry and lightning strikes it, a fire can start.

A bee does the waggle dance. It walks in a figure eight and shakes its body. The farther away the food, the longer the bee shakes. The direction in which it walks tells other bees the way to the food.
Honeybees get food from flowers. When a honeybee finds a field of flowers, it flies back to the hive. The bee tells the other bees where to find the food. How? It dances! The round dance shows that food is nearby. If the food is far away, the bee performs the waggle dance. That dance shows the location of the food.
Fireflies have a chemical inside their bodies. It makes light. Fireflies flash lights at one another. Each
or kind, of firefly has a different flash pattern. That helps the insects find members of their own species. The flash pattern also helps male and female fireflies find one another
Grasshoppers send messages by chirping. They often rub a back leg against a wing. That causes a vibration and makes sound. Mostly male grasshoppers make sounds. They chirp to attract females. Each species of grasshopper has its own call. Some grasshoppers make sounds to warn other males to go away.
A leaf-cutter ant carries a piece of a leaf back to its nest.
