Christianity: beliefs about care of the planet
The relationship between human beings and the earth is increasingly complicated and urgent. Every day there are stories about pollution, global warming and animal species facing extinction. Religion is responding with views on the enviroment and our responsibility for it.
Although human beings are seen as the most intelligent life form on earth, they are responsible for almost all the
done to the planet. If we imagined the earth is aged 46, all the damage done has taken place in the last 60 seconds of the earth's life.
I believe in one God, the Father, the almighty, maker of heaven and earth.
Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.' God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.

When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it to capture it, do not destroy its trees by putting an axe to them, because you can eat their fruit. Do not cut them down. Are the trees of the field people, that you should besiege them?
It is clear that the earth still belongs to God not to humans:
The earth is the Lords, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it.

Portia and Shylock may seem very different at first glance, but on investigation they are actually quite similar.
Para 2 - Wealth, Lack of freedom
Both are rich yet lack real freedom: explain why. (Portia is restricted by her father's will; shylock is restricted by the laws of Venice)
Para 3 - Position of Women and Jews in Venetian society
Develop these ideas further: both Portia (as a woman) and Shylock (as a Jew) are seem as less important than the ruling Christian men.

In the trial scene, neither Portia nor Shylock shows mercy (despite Portia's speech) - why?

. Together, they help us to learn about the characters and understand why they act as they do.
There are various types of love explored in the play. From which characters do we learn about the different sorts of love?
Love in 'A View From the Bridge'
Beatrice, Eddie and Catherine are first seen as a loving family.
Marco loves his family deeply. He has come to America to help them. He misses them a lot.
In the wider sense, Beatrice loves her family in Sicily enough to support her cousins. Family ties are very important.
Eddie and Catherine, although uncle and niece, have become more like a father and daughter. Eddie made a lot of sacrifices to provide Catherine with the best education he could.
Marco and Rodolpho have a strong bond - great enough for Marco to lay down his life for his brother's cause.
Eddie and Beatrice's marriage is obviously not as strong as it used to be: Beatrice asks,
""When am I gonna be a wife again, Eddie?""
They have not slept together for months.
Catherine and Rodolpho quickly fall deeply in love.
Eddie's love for Catherine has become sexual, even though he refuses to admit it. This is the cause of the friction in his own marriage and the dispute with Rodolpho and Marco.
The play shows us that love is not always beautiful - it is responsible for all the
between the characters. It is a deep passion that can create jealousy and cause pain both to the person who loves, the person who is loved and those around them. For Eddie, love also causes conflict within himself when he cannot admit to his illicit love for Catherine.

Alfieri believes that it is best to
: it is better to rely on written law as far as possible and accept it even when you are only 'half' satisfied. The written law may not always act in favour of justice yet it is better to follow the law than to take it into your own hands. In the play we see that Eddie betrays Marco and Rodolpho, there is no law to punish Eddie so Marco takes the law into his own hands, the play ends with a fight to the death. Alfieri reiterates his beliefs at the end of the play:
""Most of the time now we settle for half and I like it better.""
Alfieri values the law more than justice, he sees that when people go against the law to assert justice it can lead to
The play encourages us to ask what is justice? What makes justice? Both Eddie and Marco have strong ideas of what is 'just' and are prepared to go to great lengths to achieve it. The characters often mistake their own desires for justice, they fail to look for a higher principle of justice seperate from their own feelings, this is what leads to conflict.
Here are some more instances in the play when
The story of Vinny Bolzano is an example of how someone obeying the law (as Vinny technically was when he informed on his uncle) is actually doing something unjust. Do you think the treatment of Vinny by his relations was just?
Alfieri tries to warn Eddie about his relationship with Catherine and argues with him to allow her to marry Rodolpho.
When the law is wrong it's because it's unnatural, but in this case it is natural and a river will drown you if you buck it now.
He is suggesting that it is Eddie's feelings for Catherine that are 'unnatural'.
Eddie makes recourse to the law that he spurned when he telephones the Immigration Bureau. Eddie has no fixed principle of justice, his feelings dictate what he believes to be 'just'.
Alfieri tries to make Marco realise who is the real 'judge' of events - God.
Both Eddie and Marco allow their personal feelings to affect their idea of justice. They are not strong enough to take an objective view. We see that Alfieri is right, people are not strong enough to execute true justice, their desires and feeling always take a part. This is why it is better to rely on the law, which although flawed offers an objective view.

""The family had an uncle that they were hidin' in the house, and he snitched to the Immigration.""
""He had five brothers and the old father. And they grabbed him in the kitchen and pulled him down the stairs - three flights his head was bouncin' like a coconut. And they spit on him in the street, his own father and his brothers. The whole neighbourhood was crying.""
It is clear that, in the eyes of Eddie and Beatrice, Vinny had done something very wrong and was justly punished. Eddie is clear that Vinny will never be seen in the neighbourhood again out of shame:
""a guy do a thing like that? How's he gonna show his face?""
Family comes first. To betray one's family is a crime and should be punished - Vinny gets no sympathy despite the injuries inflicted upon him: it was seen that he got what he deserved. It is ironic that Eddie does just the same thing as Vinny - 'snitch to Immigration' - to Marco and Rodolpho at the end of the play.
is shown to be very important, especially to the male characters. It means far more to them than the law. To be honourable is to be respected. If you do anything dishonourable, you lose respect. That is why Marco and Eddie are so keen to protect their names and get a 'just' conclusion. Codes of honour bind families and the whole neighbourhood with a sense of community. Everyone should look out for one another, to betray someone is the most dishonourable action imaginable.
Here are some examples of how honour works in the play:
""It's an honour, B. I mean it.""
when they discuss the imminent arrival of the cousins.
Perhaps one of the reasons why Eddie finds it impossible to admit his love for Catherine is because he knows how dishonourable it is.
Alfieri warns Eddie that he will lose the respect of the neighbourhood if he betrays the brothers.
""You won't have a friend in the world, Eddie!""
It is significant that a lawyer (whom we would expect to uphold the law) is encouraging Eddie to do something illegal by continuing to keep the brothers hidden.
Marco believes the only honourable course is to punish Eddie when Eddie betrayed the brothers. Alfieri tries to persuade him otherwise:
""To promise not to kill is not dishonourable""
- but Marco's sense of honour it too strong. (It is interesting that Marco had given Alfieri his word that he would not harm Eddie, yet then does so: clearly, Marco's need for revenge is stronger than any fear about breaking a promise.
Eddie, however, blindly refuses to believe that he has done anything wrong. He desperately wants to get back his good name after Marco's accusations caused the neighbourhood to turn away from him.
Marco's got my name - and you run tell him, kid, that he's gonna give it back to me in front of this neighbourhood, or we have it out.
Do you think that Eddie dies an 'honourable' death? He does not try to escape his fate - in fact, he encourages it - perhaps because he realised that he had no option.

the governments of Eastern Europe, except Yugoslavia, were hard line Stalinist regimes.
In 1946, in a speech at Fulton in the USA, Churchill declared that an

In the 1945 elections, a Communist-led coalition was elected, but the Communists executed the non-Communists.
East Germany was the Soviet zone of Germany. In 1949, they set up a Communist-controlled state called the German Democratic Republic.
In the 1945 elections, a Communist-led coalition was elected to power. The Communists gradually took over and in 1947 they abolished the monarchy.
Stalin had promised to set up a joint Communist/non-Communist government at Yalta, but then he invited 16 non-Communist leaders to Moscow and arrested them. Thousands of non-Communists were arrested, and the Communists won the 1947 election.
The non-communists won the 1945 elections with Zoltan Tildy as president. However, the Communists' leader, Rakosi, took control of the secret police (the AVO), and executed and arrested his opponents. Tildy was forced to resign and Cardinal Mindzenty, head of the Catholic Church, was imprisoned. By 1948, Rakosi had complete control of Hungary.
A coalition government was set up and led by the non-Communist Benes. However, the Communists' leader Gottwald made sure they controlled the radio, the army and the police. Gottwald became prime minister and set up a secret police force. Non-Communists were arrested. In 1948, Communist workers went on strike, the non-Communist minister Masaryk committed suicide and Gottwald took over the government.

If we are too hot or too cold, the processing centre sends nerve impulses to the skin, which has two ways to either increase or decrease heat loss from the body's surface.
Tiny muscles in the skin can quickly pull the hairs upright to reduce heat loss, or lay them down flat to increase heat loss.
Hairs on the skin trap more warmth if they are standing up, and less if they are lying flat. Tiny muscles in the skin can quickly pull the hairs upright to reduce heat loss, or lay them down flat to increase heat loss.

In part, it is to oblige his family by making a good marriage financially speaking. And in part it is because his father and brother, and Bertha's relatives, kept the madness in her family from him. While Rochester blames himself for falling for Bertha's superficial charm, he cannot forgive the betrayal of the deception. Even after his brother and father die, he is still trapped by the situation.
It is clear that he tries to hide from the reality of it, but when he meets Jane he sees her as extraordinarily different and refreshing.

hydrogels for making soft contact lenses and disposable nappy liners
Polymer molecules can have branches coming off them, which change the properties of the polymer.
Plasticisers are substances that let the polymer molecules slide over each other more easily. This makes the polymer softer and more flexible. For example, poly(chloroethene) or PVC is a hard polymer. Unplasticised PVC, usually called uPVC, is used to make pipes and window frames. PVC with plasticisers is soft and flexible. It is used for floor coverings, raincoats and car dashboards.
Poly(ethenol) is a polymer that dissolves in water to make slime. The viscosity of the slime can be changed to make it thick or runny by varying the amount of water.

The main factors that effect consumer choice are:
For example, if you wanted to buy a computer game on the high street, you would select the shop that sells the product at the lowest price, stocks the widest variety and has friendly and helpful staff. Competition helps improve these factors.
If there is only one retailer the game may not be competitively priced. This is called a monopoly. If there are several retailers, each retailer will lower the price in an attempt to win customers. It is illegal for retailers to agree between themselves to fix a price. They must compete for business.
In order to attract and satisfy customers, software companies need to produce products that are superior to their competitors.

The level of water in the blood plasma can vary depending on:

Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds
Bends low, comes up twenty years away
The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft
Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep

My grandfather cut more turf in a day

Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
To drink it, then fell to right away
Over his shoulder, going down and down
The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head.
But I've no spade to follow men like them.

In this poem Heaney sees his father, an old man, digging the flowerbeds. He remembers how his younger, stronger father used to dig in the potato fields when Heaney was a child - and how his grandfather, before that, was an expert turf digger. Heaney knows that he has no spade to follow men like them - he is a writer, not a farmer - so will dig with his pen. He will 'dig' into his past.

The verb formation which describes the time at which the action occurred, eg past, present or future.
as Heaney describes seeing his elderly father straining among the flowerbeds, then goes into the past tense when he remembers his father and grandfather at work. The last two stanzas return to the present, when Heaney realises that his work is to write. The final line, however, is in the future tense, to emphasise Heaney's determination -
Heaney remembers his own role in the digging: he and other children would gather the new potatoes that his father dug up, and he was responsible for taking milk to his grandfather on Toner's bog. It was this involvement that enabled him to watch his father and grandfather at work and describe their movements so precisely.
His father was clearly skilled at his work. Heaney remembers him
(line 8) and his boot and his knee fitted the spade perfectly (lines 10/11). He uses technical terms (lug, shaft) to stress that the spade is a precise tool.
""By God, the old man could handle a spade""
(line 15) is a simple, loving exclamation of pride.
He was also proud of his grandfather, who was so keen to work that he hardly stopped when Heaney brought him some milk. His work was precise -

Heaney does not explain exactly why he has

of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
in a regretful tone, because Heaney is not outside digging too, and feels he somehow ought to be?
in a proud tone, as Heaney is displaying the skills of his father and grandfather for everyone to appreciate?
in a loving tone, as if the poem is a gift to his father and grandfather?
Well, Heaney's description of his father and grandfather is very loving. He values his sense of connection with them, and he is clearly very proud of the work they did, even though he has
them. Far from regretting his break with the family's traditional work on the land, Heaney asserts that he is continuing their work, by digging with his pen.
The ideas in this poem concern our relationship to our forebears, and to work. Heaney describes his relationship to his father and grandfather purely in terms of their work on the land. He takes the idea of digging, the commonest form of work in any rural community, and uses it as a

Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
There is a sense of Heaney's love of the earth throughout the poem. His father and grandfather seem to be in harmony with the earth; he himself, as a child, loved picking up the potatoes that the earth produced.
By God, the old man could handle a spade.
This reminds us that Heaney's father is now an old man, but also shows his fondness for him: old man is a common term of affection. Heaney is clearly proud of him too.

Heaney boasts about his grandfather's skill - he presents him as a champion digger. Perhaps the young Heaney boasted as a child to his friends about his grandfather's ability.

These roots are both actual roots the grandfather's spade cuts through, and Heaney's metaphorical roots in the land and in his family. Even though he doesn't dig with a spade like his father and grandfather, these roots are still alive in his mind.
In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems deal with the bonds between the generations - in Clarke's poem a mother addresses her child, while in Heaney's a son talks about his father and grandfather.
Both poems make us think about the relationship between parents (especially fathers) and their children
But in Heaney's poem the relationship is very specific and particular, while in Blake's poem it is not so much a real father, as a symbolic one...
Both poems deal with the relationship between generations, and both describe hard, physical work
But the Old Mother is bitter about the drudgery which she must do; while Heaney's poem celebrates the work as creative.
In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other. The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas, and attitudes and tone
Compare Digging with two other post-1914 poems and one pre-1914 poem of your choice that present the relationship between a parent and child. How do the poets show the nature of the relationships?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Gillian Clark's Catrin, Seamus Heaney's Follower, and William Blake's Little Boy Lost/Little Boy Found.
What would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing Digging with each of these three poems.
Catrin is from mother to a child, while Digging is from a child to a father (and grandfather).
Catrin suggests that relationships between parents and their children are not always harmonious, but Digging shows no conflict.
Catrin explores how a mother and child are bound together through the actual birth; Digging suggests that different generations are bound by sharing the same occupation - Heaney, his father and grandfather all 'dig'.
Both of Heaney's poems show the contrast between his father as an old man and his younger self.
Both describe his expertise in farm work as a means of illustrating Heaney's admiration for is father.
In both poems, the young Heaney is present in the fields, but in Digging he was helpful, gathering in the potatoes, while he was a nuisance in Follower.
There is a determination at the end of Digging to work and explore the past, but there is a hint of frustration in Follower - today It is my father who keeps stumbling Behind me, and will not go away.
Heaney gives us a detailed description of his father and grandfather at work, but we are given no visual impression of the father in Blake's poem.
Blake's boy becomes lost as no father was there, which suggests he was irresponsible, but Heaney shows that his father worked hard to provide food for his family.
Digging suggests a close family relationship. Blake, though, shows the love of the boy's weeping mother and the ever nigh love of God.
Blake's poem implies praise of God ' the father' of us all, while Heaney's poem shows his personal love and respect of his father and grandfather.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

You need to consider the reason for choosing a particular material, what it might be used for, and how you would use it.
You'll also need to think about the finish - will it be glazed or covered with papier-mch? It might be that you are casting from your hand or foot, or you want to create a piece based on the body. Before you make it full size, try out a few experiments.
Mix the plaster and pour into a plastic ice cream tub. When it is cool and solid, take it out - it's now ready to carve. Plaster of Paris is relatively soft and so its easy to carve with a knife or metal clay tools. You can also use shaping/smoothing tools such as a surform.
Experiment with images and plaster of Paris by putting things such as photos or text in the bottom of something shallow. For example, take a plastic glue top/lid, mix the plaster and pour over the photo. When it sets, take the solid plaster out of the lid.
Casts can be made by using plaster bandage or by pouring plaster into a mould, or over your hand/foot. Remember that you need to cover your hand with petroleum jelly (vaseline) to stop the plaster sticking to you! You also need to build a wall around the area that is to be cast, to stop the plaster running away.

The French surgeon-doctor Par tested this in a crude and cruel scientific experiment. He gave poison to a condemned criminal, followed by bezoar, and then observed what happened:
Some years ago, a gentleman boasted before King Charles that bezoar was an antidote for all poisons ... It was an easy matter to make trial of this claim on those condemned to be hanged [and a criminal] had poison administered to him ...
An hour after, I found him on the ground on his hands and feet like an animal, with his tongue hanging out of his mouth, his eyes wild, vomiting, with blood pouring from his ears, nose and mouth. Eventually he died in great torment, seven hours after I gave him the poison. I opened his body and found the bottom of the stomach black and dry, as if it had been burned, whereby I realised that he had been given sublimate of mercury, whose force the bezoar could not stop. Therefore the king commanded: Burn it!
When you have read this famous source about bezoar, can you find evidence that Par conducted a scientific experiment?
Par followed a clear scientific path, with four steps, consisting of:

The formation of glaciers and the process by which they shape the landscape around them is called glaciation.
Glaciers once covered large areas of the Earth and shaped the landscape around them. The legacy of ancient glaciers lives on - for example in areas such as the Lake District.

When the temperature reaches freezing point, the water inside cracks freezes, expands and causes the cracks to widen. When the temperature rises, the water thaws and contracts.

People talk about truth in five different ways.
This is the sort of truth that we can find in pictures, novels or films. We are not saying that what we are looking at, reading or watching is actually true. However, we might say that it is 'true to life'. By this we mean that it is believable - it could happen - although it is not actually true itself.
This is quite straightforward. We can say that we 'know' that something happened in the past even though we were not there and did not see it for ourselves. We know that it happened because we have seen

When we talk about moral truth we mean that we 'know' that something is right or wrong. This is almost like an

that this is wrong anyway. This sort of truth is linked with the moral argument for the existence of God.

People who follow a particular religion may say that by doing so they are
the 'real truth' about life and about God. This definition of truth is linked with the argument from experience.

There are various types of love explored in the play. From which characters do we learn about the different sorts of love?
Love in 'A View From the Bridge'
Beatrice, Eddie and Catherine are first seen as a loving family.
Marco loves his family deeply. He has come to America to help them. He misses them a lot.
In the wider sense, Beatrice loves her family in Sicily enough to support her cousins. Family ties are very important.
Eddie and Catherine, although uncle and niece, have become more like a father and daughter. Eddie made a lot of sacrifices to provide Catherine with the best education he could.
Marco and Rodolpho have a strong bond - great enough for Marco to lay down his life for his brother's cause.
Eddie and Beatrice's marriage is obviously not as strong as it used to be: Beatrice asks,
""When am I gonna be a wife again, Eddie?""
They have not slept together for months.
Catherine and Rodolpho quickly fall deeply in love.
Eddie's love for Catherine has become sexual, even though he refuses to admit it. This is the cause of the friction in his own marriage and the dispute with Rodolpho and Marco.
The play shows us that love is not always beautiful - it is responsible for all the
between the characters. It is a deep passion that can create jealousy and cause pain both to the person who loves, the person who is loved and those around them. For Eddie, love also causes conflict within himself when he cannot admit to his illicit love for Catherine.

is to examine the lines. Many of them are written in
, so they have ten syllables which are organised in five pairs. The first syllable is weak, the second stronger. So if we look at a typical line, we traditionally show the weak or unstressed syllable with an 'x' above it and the stressed syllable with an '/' above it:
x / x / x / x / x /
(In this example, the words 'ever' and 'degrees' are split up to reflect the two syllables)
Reading it like this, we can hear an obvious beat. We can also see that the key words tend to be stronger, and just hearing these we can still make some sense of the line (wound - heal - by - (de)grees). If we only have the unstressed syllables, there is very little we can understand (What - did - er- but - de ). Using this technique, you can sometimes see what Shakespeare might be trying to emphasize. It also provides a structure to the play - it holds things together and we can even anticipate where an actor will finish speaking.
It also means that when the pattern changes, there might be a reason for this. For instance, important characters tend to use this verse form a lot, but less important ones never use it. Iago is different - he switches around, and tends to stop using verse when he is telling his secrets to us.

that had existed for many years in the run-up to the First World War.
You need to think about these causes carefully, when trying to determine who or what was to blame for the war.
In the 1930s, historians such as Sydney Bradshaw Fay argued that there were four underlying long-term causes of the First World War:
- the belief that your country is better than others. This meant nations were assertive and aggressive.
- the desire to conquer colonies, especially in Africa. This brought the powers into conflict - especially Germany, which wanted an empire, against France and Britain, which both already had empires.
- where military concerns influence a country's policy, especially the attempt to build up a strong army and navy. This gave the nations the means and the will to make war.
- in 1882, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy formed the Triple Alliance. Alarmed, France and Britain in 1904, then Russia in 1907, formed the Triple Entente. Thus Europe was divided into two armed camps, obliged to help each other if there was a war.

The Monster is also revolutionary in its hostility towards authority (its 'father').

When writing this book, Mary was influenced by the scientific revolution of the time. She had heard about one man, Galvani, who had supposedly re-animated dead tissue, and another, Aldini, who had wired up a criminal's corpse to a battery so that his jaw appeared to move and a fist to clench.

Mary said her story was born out of long days and nights on holiday with Percy, Byron and another friend, when persistent rain had kept them indoors with only the works of German Gothic writers for amusement. This led to the idea of a ghost-story contest, for which the young Mary wrote her initial draft, inspired by a nightmare she'd had. The Gothic features of the story include its horrific descriptions, use of overpowering emotions and exotic, often remote, settings.
Other writers to influence Mary were Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who had read his poem

Banquo laughs at the prophecies but Macbeth is excited, especially as soon after their meeting with the witches Macbeth is made Thane of Cawdor by King Duncan, in return for his bravery in the battle. He writes to his wife, Lady Macbeth, who is as excited as he is. A messenger tells Lady Macbeth that King Duncan is on his way to their castle and she invokes evil spirits to help her slay him. Macbeth is talked into killing Duncan by his wife and stabs him to death. No-one is quite sure who committed this murder and no-one feels safe, but Macbeth is crowned king.
Now that Macbeth is king he knows the second prediction from the witches has come true, but he starts to fear the third prediction (that Banquo's descendants will also be kings). Macbeth therefore decides to kill Banquo and his son, but the plan goes wrong - Banquo is killed but his son escapes. Macbeth then thinks he is going mad because he sees Banquo's ghost and receives more predictions from the witches. He starts to become ruthless and kills the family of Macduff, an important lord. Macbeth still thinks he is safe but one by one the witches' prophecies come true, Lady Macbeth cannot stop thinking about Duncan, becomes deranged and dies.

The two main themes in 'Of Mice and Men' - foreshadowed by the reference to Burns' mouse - are loneliness and dreams. They interlock: people who are lonely have most need of dreams to help them through.
Study the table below, showing both the loneliness and the dreams of each of the main characters. You could use a table like this as the basis for an exam answer about
Central, unifying ideas that run through a text or performance.
Loneliness and Dreams in Of Mice and Men
George is not lonely during the novel, as he has Lennie. He will be lonely afterwards, without his best friend.
George and Lennie share a dream - to own a little patch of land and live on it in freedom. He is so set on the idea that he even knows of some land that he thinks they could buy.
Lennie is the only character who is innocent enough not to fear loneliness, but he is angry when Crooks suggests George won't come back to him.
George and Lennie share a dream - to own a little patch of land and live on it in freedom. Lennie's main desire is to tend the soft-haired rabbits they will keep.
She is married to a man she doesn't love and who doesn't love her. There are no other women on the ranch and she has nothing to do. She tries to befriend the men by hanging round the bunkhouse.
She dreams of being a movie star. Her hopes were raised by a man who claimed he would take her to Hollywood, but when she didn't receive a letter from him, she married Curley.
When Candy's ancient, ill dog was shot, Candy has nothing left. He delayed killing the dog, even though he knew deep down that it was the best thing, as he dreaded losing his long-time companion.
Candy joins George and Lennie's plan of owning a piece of land. His savings make the dream actually possible to achieve.
Crooks lives in enforced solitude, away from the other men. He is bitter about being a back-busted nigger. He is thrilled when Lennie and Candy come into his room and are his companions for a night.
Crooks dreams of being seen as equal to everyone else. He knows his civil rights. He remembers fondly his childhood, when he played with white children who came to his family's chicken ranch, and longs for a similar relationship with white people again.

914,"The size and age of Jekyll and Hyde
Jekyll is much bigger than Hyde. This is seen particularly when Hyde's small body is found in the much larger clothes of Dr Jekyll. The author is perhaps suggesting Hyde is a smaller part of Jekyll, but that if people repress the bad in them it will take over and destroy them.
Hyde is younger and more energetic than Jekyll. This suggests evil is something that develops later in life, after a period of childhood innocence. It also suggests Stevenson felt there is something primitively energetic and exciting about mankind's baser nature; that the 'higher', respectable nature of social humans is

1168,"The question in the exam might ask you to compare the parent/child relationship in Blake's
with those described in another pre-1914 poem and two post-1914 poems of your choice. So - what might you want to say about the view of parents and children in these two poems? Briefly note down some points that you would want to include in your essay, then compare your ideas with those in our sample answer on the next page.
The characters are not drawn in any detail - we only know there is a little boy, a mother and a father, and God.
We are not told why the son becomes lost: the father does not speak to his son, nor answer his pleas in the first poem. Is this deliberate or not? He appears to be a bad father.
However, in the second poem, Blake portrays God as a father. This could suggest that God is a better father than the child's own father. However, it could also suggest that it wasn't the father's fault, but the child's, that the boy was lost in the first poem; God the father guides the child back to where he belongs.
The mother is very upset at the loss of her child and she searches for him. She seems to be looking in the wrong place, though, which suggests that she needs God's help to be a 'better' mother.
The symbolism seems to suggest that God the father is the protector of everyone. We are all his children and we all sometimes veer off the right path, but God will care for each one of us - as he cared for the lost child - and guide us back to where we should be.
The poem is simple in form, uses simple one-syllable words and is childlike and naive - but has a serious message.
You will probably not have included all of these points, and will also have some of your own that are not mentioned here! Of course, all the ideas referred to in the

Alkenes can act as monomers. Under high pressure and in the presence of a catalyst many monomer molecules join together to make polymer molecules. These polymer molecules are saturated.
Most of the compounds in crude oil are hydrocarbons. This means they only contain hydrogen and carbon atoms, joined together by covalent bonds. Remember that a covalent bond is a shared pair of electrons.
The number of hydrogen atoms in an alkane is double the number of carbon atoms, plus two. For example, the molecular formula of methane is CH
Alkane molecules can be represented by displayed formulae in which each atom is shown as its symbol (C or H), and the covalent bonds between them by a straight line.

Iago's general, Othello, is tortured by jealousy and one small item, a missing handkerchief, leads to distrust, broken friendships, murder and suicide.
The play's themes also seem very up to date - they cover all sorts of things, like the role of women, love, jealousy, ambition and betrayal. However, perhaps the most challenging theme from the play is race - Othello is black and has married a white woman. There are lots of references to this and Shakespeare shows how complex the situation was even in his lifetime.

 the total amount of energy present stays the same before and after any changes.
The pendulum shows the principal of conservation of energy in action. Gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and back, over and over again, as the pendulum swings.
The diagram shows a pendulum in three positions - the two the ends of it's swing and as it passes through the middle point.
When the pendulum bob is at the start of its swing it has no kinetic energy because it is not moving, but its
The energy stored by an object lifted up against the force of gravity.
is at a maximum, because it is at the highest point.
As the bob swings downwards it loses height. So its gravitational potential energy (GPE) decreases. The work done on the bob by the gravitational force (weight) pulling it downwards increases its kinetic energy. The loss of GPE = the gain in KE.
At the bottom of its swing, the bobs kinetic energy is at a maximum and its gravitational potential energy is at a minimum - because it is at its lowest point.
As the bob swings upwards it slows down. Its kinetic energy decreases as work is done against its weight. As it gains height the gravitational potential energy increases again.
At the very top of its swing it stops for a moment. It once again has no kinetic energy, but its gravitational potential energy is at a maximum.
At all points during the swing, the total (GPE + KE) is constant.
Note that in a real pendulum the bobs swing will become slightly lower with each swing, because some energy is lost (dissipated, wasted) through heating, due to air resistance.
You should be able to calculate the kinetic energy gained when an object falls from a given height.
A diver who has a mass of 50 kg dives off a diving board 3.0 metres above the water level. What is her kinetic energy when she reaches the water?
Kinetic energy gained = gravitational potential energy lost
Kinetic energy gained = weight  height
You must calculate her weight to use in this equation
Weight = mass  gravitational field strength
Weight = 50 kg  10 N / kg
Kinetic energy gained = weight  height
Kinetic energy gained = 500 N  3 m
You should be able to extend the previous calculation to work out the speed of the object.
How fast is the diver moving when she reaches the water?
Put her kinetic energy (the 1500J you have calculated) into the kinetic energy equation together with her mass
kinetic energy = 1/2  mass  speed
1500 J =   50  speed
= 1500/25 = 60 (This is not the answer yet! It is speed
So her speed = square root of 60 = 7.7 m/s

Darwin studied the wildlife on the Galpagos Islands (a group of islands on the equator, almost 1,000 km west of Ecuador). He noticed that the finches (songbirds) on the different islands there were fundamentally similar to each other, but showed wide variations in their size, beaks and claws from island to island. For example, their beaks were different depending on the local food source. Darwin concluded that, because the islands are so distant from the mainland, the finches that had arrived there in the past had changed over time.

551,"Judaism: beliefs about care of the planet
The relationship between human beings and the earth is increasingly complicated and urgent. Every day there are stories about pollution, global warming and animal species facing extinction. Religion is responding with views on the enviroment and our responsibility for it.
Although human beings are seen as the most intelligent life form on earth, they are responsible for almost all the
done to the planet. If we imagined the earth is aged 46, all the damage done has taken place in the last 60 seconds of the earth's life.
Jews believe that the one G-d whom they worship created the heavens and earth and all forms of life in the six days of creation. Jewish teaching about caring for the environment comes from the Bible:
Then G-d said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.'  G-d blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.'
Because of this passage, people see themselves as being responsible for the world which G-d created and they have to make their own decisions about how to do this.
The Jewish Scriptures do not have a lot to say about the environment. In the Torah (major Jewish prayer) the Jews were told to rest the land once every 50 years so that it would produce more in the future (Leviticus 25:8-11). They were also ordered not to destroy trees when they were attacking a city:
When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it to capture it, do not destroy its trees by putting an axe to them, because you can eat their fruit. Do not cut them down. Are the trees of the field people that you should besiege them?
Respect for trees is also shown in the annual festival of
(New Year for Trees), which takes place on fifteenth day of the Jewish month of
. This has been particularly important since the founding of the State of Israel in 1948 as Israelis have tried to reclaim the desert by planting trees.
Every year, at the New Year festival of
, Jews give thanks to G-d for the creation of the world because, although humanity has the role of steward, the
(the collected 24 books of the Jewish Bible) shows that the earth is still G-ds possession:
The earth is the Lords, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it.
Jews should also show respect to animals:
You shall not muzzle an ox in its threshing.
The righteous one knows [the needs of] his animals soul.
In the Assisi Declarations of1986 Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg said that:
When the whole world is in peril, when the environment is in danger of being poisoned and various species, both plant and animal are becoming extinct... it is our Jewish responsibility to put the defence of the whole of nature at the very centre of our concern The encounter of G-d and man in nature is thus conceived in Judaism as a seamless web with man as the leader and custodian of the natural world.
Explain Jewish teaching about caring for the environment.

Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. Attitude can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
A good way to decide on the tone of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
In a loud, angry tone, to protest about the failure of democracy?
In a sombre, muted tone, to express sadness that a gap remains between rich and poor?
In a dramatic tone, so that we wonder what may happen between the two pairs of people?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
The ideas in this poem are to do with the extreme divisions between rich people and poor people in a supposedly egalitarian society, and the effect these divisions have on how people perceive each other.
Have a look at these quotations, and our suggestions about how they fit into this theme
...the two scavengers up since four am/grungy from their route
We are encouraged to sympathise with these garbagemen who work anti social hours and who become dirty and smelly as a result. The specific detail (four am) and the expressive word grungy make us pity them.
The elegant couple are not described in as much detail as the garbagemen, as if the poet is less interested in them. He uses a clich here, the cool couple - which is how they probably think of themselves...
'as if anything at all were possible/between them...'
It seems that the poet would like to believe that the two pairs he describes really could be friends - but the 'as if' tells us he knows that is only imaginary. He feels that democracy hasn't succeeded because communication between the rich and poor is still impossible.

1678,"Scientists believe the Universe began in a hot big bang about 13,600 million years ago. The Universe continues to expand today. The evidence for the Big Bang theory includes the existence of a microwave background radiation, and red-shift.
Stars do not remain the same, but change as they age. The Universe contains extremely dense objects called black holes, and may consist mostly of dark matter that cannot be seen.
You should know how stars are formed.
Stars form from massive clouds of dust and gas in space.
Gravity pulls the dust and gas together.
As the gas falls together, it gets hot. A star forms when it is hot enough for nuclear reactions to start. This releases energy, and keeps the star hot. The outward pressure from the expanding hot gases is balanced by the force of the star's gravity. Our sun is at this stable phase in its life. Gravity pulls smaller amounts of dust and gas together, which form planets in orbit around the star.
The Sun is halfway through its 10 billion year stable phase
Stars do not stay the same forever. They have a finite life. What happens to them depends on their mass.
Our Sun is a medium-weight star. Stars like our Sun will change to:
6.2 billion years from now the Sun will have become a red giant star
Stars that are much heavier than our Sun have a different fate. A heavy-weight star will still become a red giant. But then:
it blows apart in a huge explosion called a supernova.
the central part left behind forms a neutron star, or even a black hole, if it is heavy enough.
black holes have a large mass, and a large gravity. Even light cannot escape them because their gravitational field is so strong.
Scientists have gathered a lot of evidence and information about the Universe. They have used their observations to develop a theory called the Big Bang. The theory states that about 13.6 billion years ago all the matter in the Universe was concentrated into a single incredibly tiny point. This began to enlarge rapidly in a hot explosion, and it is still expanding today.
All the galaxies are moving away from us.
The further away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away.
These two features are found in explosions - the fastest moving objects end up furthest away from the explosion.
. This is received from all parts of the Universe and is thought to be the heat left over from the original explosion.
Evidence for the Big Bang - higher
You may have noticed that when an ambulance or police car goes past, its siren is high-pitched as it comes towards you, then becomes low-pitched as it goes away. This effect, where there is a change in frequency and wavelength, is called the Doppler effect. It happens with any wave source that moves relative to an observer.
This happens with light, too, and is called 'red shift'. Our Sun contains helium. We know this because there are black lines in the spectrum of the light from the Sun where helium has absorbed light. These lines form the absorption spectrum for helium.
When we look at the spectrum of a distant star, the absorption spectrum is there, but the pattern of lines has moved towards the red end of the spectrum, as you can see below:
. It is a change in frequency of the position of the lines.
Astronomers have found that the further from us a star is, the more its light is red-shifted. This tells us that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and that the further away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away.
Since we cannot assume that we have a special place in the Universe, this is evidence for a generally expanding universe. It suggests that everything is moving away from everything else. The Big Bang theory says this expansion started 13.6 billion years ago with an explosion.
Summary of some of the evidence of the Big Bang and its interpretation
The light from other galaxies is red-shifted.
The other galaxies are moving away from us.
The further away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.
The most likely explanation is that the whole Universe is expanding. This supports the theory that the start of the Universe could have began with a single explosion.

The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 120. Calculate the number of sides.
The interior angles are 120, so the exterior angles are 180 - 120 = 60. The exterior angles add up to 360, so if we divide 360 by 60 we find there are 6 exterior angles. Therefore, there are

These generally have larger capacitance values. Polarised capacitors have a positive pole and a negative pole, so you have to connect them to a circuit the correct way round. The polarity and value of a capacitor are usually shown like this:

Electrolytic capacitors may be either axially mounted (on their side, connected at each end) or radially mounted (upright with both connections at the bottom).
These are usually much smaller than the polarised type, and have smaller capacitance values ranging from a few picofarads to a few microfarads. Because they have no positive or negative poles these capacitors can be connected to a circuit either way round. There are four types of non-polarised capacitor, each named after the material they are made from:

I know that your bedside is besieged by doctors, and of course this fills me with fear. As Pliny said, in order to gain fame they buy it with our lives. They learn their art at our cost, and even our death brings them experience; only a doctor can kill without punishment. Remember what it says on the gravestones: ""I died of too many doctors"".
A letter from the poet Petrarch to Pope Clement VI (c.1350)
Medical men are well educated, for I do not think that an illiterate man can do the work of a doctor. Even so, at the present time, ignorant amateurs and even worse and more horrible worthless and presumptuous women, grab the profession and abuse it and make mistakes and kill people. You need three qualifications to be a doctor nowadays: to be able to lie cleverly, to seem honest, and to be able to kill without caring.

And if you shake the two together then leave them to stand, tiny droplets of oil float upwards. They join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again. To stop the two liquids separating, we need a substance called an emulsifier.
Emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends:
a hydrophilic end - water-loving - that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils
a hydrophobic end - water-hating - that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water
Lecithin is an emulsifier commonly used in foods. It is obtained from oil seeds and is a mixture of different substances. A molecular model of one of these substances is seen in the diagram.
The hydrophilic 'head' dissolves in the water and the hydrophobic 'tail' dissolves in the oil. In this way, the water and oil droplets become unable to separate out. The mixture formed is called an emulsion.
Mayonnaise and emulsion paints are emulsions, but there are others - such as the two in the table.

What is the importance of Dr Lanyon in the novel, and how does Stevenson present him?
Dr Lanyon is an important character in Stevenson's novel because, like Dr Jekyll, he is a scientist and doctor, so he makes an interesting point of comparison and contrast. He is also the only character to actually witness the transformation of Hyde/Jekyll. His account of this is very interesting to the reader. Stevenson saves Lanyon's account until the penultimate chapter, where it dramatically solves most of the mystery about the character of Mr Hyde. (
Opening paragraph briefly but clearly focuses upon a) the importance of Lanyon and b) the authors presentation.
Dr Lanyon first appears in Chapter 2 when Utterson goes to consult him about the strange will of their friend Dr Jekyll. He is described as a ""hearty, healthy"" gentleman with a warm manner of welcoming his friend that is based on ""genuine feeling"". (
Quotation shows evidence of the first bullet point in the question  what Lanyon is like.
) This emphasis on his good qualities and his genuine friendship is important. (
) It makes us trust him and believe his judgement may be right when he says that, because Jekyll ""began to go wrong"", he has seen little of him during the last ten years. In fact, he becomes uncharacteristically agitated and talks angrily of Jekyll's ideas as ""scientific balderdash"". This raises our level of interest in what Dr Jekyll might be involved in. (
Paragraph focuses on two different characters reactions to Lanyon - clear focus on the second bullet point.
) is clearly very friendly with Lanyon, and likes him. Because Utterson appears in the novel much more frequently than the doctor, and is also a steady, reliable, caring man, we tend to trust Lanyon even more. Stevenson makes him appear a model of reliable good sense and decent friendship. Dr Jekyll also tells Utterson that Lanyon is ""a good fellow... an excellent fellow"". But he adds, ""a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant blatant pedant"", and scorns Lanyon's disagreement with ""what he called my scientific heresies"". (
) This again raises our interest in what Jekyll is up to, because his attitudes toward Lanyon are wildly contradictory. (
Up to this point in the novel, Stevenson has made me like and trust Dr Lanyon. He is possibly a bit stuffy (but only possibly - can Jekyll's judgement be trusted?), but his heart is in the right place. In Chapter 6 (Remarkable Incident of Dr Lanyon), however, Stevenson creates a shocking change in Lanyon. When Utterson visits him, he finds a man ""with his death warrant written legibly on his face"". As a reader, I (
Use of ""me"" and ""I"" shows evidence of personal response, which the third bullet point asks for.
) am concerned to find out why. But even though there are hints of a dreadful confrontation between him and Jekyll, a horrific mystery hangs over the cause. The previously cheerful scientist and doctor lives in dread, feels he will soon die, and refuses to talk to Utterson about their former friend, Jekyll. His words ""if you cannot keep clear of this accursed topic, then in God's name, go"" show the author's skill (
Comments directly on how Stevenson makes you respond to Lanyon, which the third bullet point asks for.
) in making the reader fascinated by the mystery.
Lanyon is important to the novel (
Focuses clearly on the fourth bullet point  the examiner can easily follow the structure of your essay.
) because of the dramatic mystery surrounding what he has seen. It excites the reader and draws us in. He is also important because, as a scientist and doctor, his disagreement with Jekyll's ""wrong in the head"" (
) ideas shows us that Jekyll is thinking and working outside of normal science. Jekyll is ""breaking the rules"", an important theme in the novel which would be far less apparent without the character of Lanyon. (
Refers to a theme of the novel.
) In the penultimate chapter, Lanyon's account of what he has witnessed raises the ending of the novel to a fever pitch of horror. Finally, in Lanyon's terrified language, we learn that Hyde is Jekyll and that Lanyon witnessed the transformation - this is why he is important in Stevenson's novel. (
Focused conclusion returns us to the title.

4871,"To put Much Ado About Nothing into perspective, you will need to know a little bit about William Shakespeare and why the play is still so popular over 400 years after it was first performed.
William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564. His father sold gloves and became an important person in the town. William, one of eight children, was the eldest son, and probably educated at the local grammar school. He married when he was only 18 and his wife, Anne Hathaway, was eight years older than him. They had two girls and a boy (who died aged 11).
Nobody knows how Shakespeare began to write, or when he entered the theatre. But we know he became a leading member of the theatre troupe known as 'The Lord Chamberlain's Men'. The company proved very popular, and later, when King James I granted it the right to perform at his court, became known as 'The King's Men'.
Shakespeare wrote more than 30 plays for 'The King's Men', making it the most important theatre company in the country. He often wrote parts for particular actors, too.
He was very successful and wealthy in his time, and his work has remained very popular ever since.
The popularity of Much Ado About Nothing
is one of Shakespeare's best-known plays. There are all sorts of reasons for this, but perhaps the main one is that the basic story still strikes a chord with modern audiences.
The play is all about relationships between the sexes, and we meet two very different couples. One is exactly as we would expect a couple to be: they fall in love almost at first sight and appear ideally suited to each other. However, the man appears to be quite shallow and believes his wife-to-be has cheated on him. He leaves her, but is tricked into marrying her later on.
The second couple are not together as a couple at all. They spend most of their time insulting each other, and both swear they will never marry. However, their friends trick them into falling in love, which they do, and they get ready to marry at the end. One of the most interesting ideas in the play is that the traditional couple are perhaps not really in love, but the odd couple are.
The play contains two basic ideas which have been used in all sorts of films and stories. The first is that a couple have to overcome numerous obstacles before they can find true love. The second is that two very different people who start off arguing later fall in love, and everything ends happily.
has been filmed a number of times and adapted for stage in all sorts of ways. For instance, there are versions set during the Second World War, one in India, and even a version with references to the mafia.

5243,"Infectious diseases are caused by the transmission of pathogens, which are microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. Pathogens can be transmitted by direct contact - horizontal and vertical transmission - and by indirect contact - vehicle-borne transmission and vector-borne transmission.
Pathogens are microorganisms that cause infectious disease. Bacteria and viruses are the main pathogens.
Bacteria come in many shapes and sizes, but even the largest are only 10 micrometres long (10 millionths of a metre).
Bacteria are living cells and, in favourable conditions, can multiply rapidly. Once inside the body, they release poisons or toxins that make us feel ill.
Hepatitis C virus. DNA are enclosed in a protein coat.
Viruses are many times smaller than bacteria. They are among the smallest organisms known and consist of a fragment of genetic material inside a protective protein coat.
Viruses can only reproduce inside host cells, and they damage the cell when they do this. A virus can get inside a cell and, once there, take over and make hundreds of thousands of copies of itself. Eventually the virus copies fill the whole host cell and burst it open. The viruses are then passed out in the bloodstream, the airways, or by other routes.
Microorganisms can be transmitted in two main ways: direct contact and indirect contact.
Direct contact means that the disease-causing microbe is passed from one person to another when their bodies touch in some way.
happens when microorganisms pass from a mother to her unborn baby through the placenta. German measles and HIV can pass this way.
happens when microorganisms pass from one person to another by touching, kissing or sexual intercourse.
Indirect contact happens when microorganisms are carried to a person in some way, instead of by actual body to body contact.
involves an object carrying the disease-causing microorganism.
involves an animal such as an insect. For example, malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes and plague by fleas.
Most pathogens have to get inside our body to spread infection. Once they are inside, the body provides ideal living conditions - plenty of food, water and warmth. Standing in their way is our body's immune system - the body's co-ordinated response to the invading pathogens.
The first line of defence is the body's natural barriers. These include:
Tiny hairs, which line the respiratory tract. They beat continuously to move mucus and dirt up the bronchi and trachea.
The skin covers the whole body. It protects the body from physical damage, microbe infection and dehydration. Its dry, dead outer cells are difficult for microbes to penetrate, and the sebaceous glands produce oils which help kill microbes.
The respiratory system (or gaseous exchange tract) is protected in several ways. Nasal hairs keep out dust and larger microorganisms. Sticky mucus traps dust and microbes. These are then carried away by cilia, which are tiny hairs on the cells that line the gaseous exchange tract.
Tears, saliva and mucus contain an enzyme called lysozyme. This destroys microorganisms.
If microorganisms get into the body through a cut in the skin, the most important thing is to quickly close the wound so more microorganisms cannot enter. A scab does just this. The blood contains tiny structures called platelets, and a protein called fibrin. A scab is basically platelets stuck in a fibrin mesh. The animation shows how this works.

As a wound heals, nearby blood vessels widen to allow more blood to reach the area. This causes inflammation where the damaged area becomes swollen, hot and red. White blood cells called phagocytes move into the area, and destroy bacteria by engulfing and digesting them.

Pathogens contain certain chemicals that are foreign to the body and are called antigens. White blood cells called lymphocytes carry a specific type of antibody - a protein that has a chemical 'fit' to a certain antigen. When a lymphocyte with the appropriate antibody meets a dangerous foreign body (pathogen containing antigen), the lymphocyte reproduces quickly, and makes many copies of the antibody that neutralises the pathogen.
Antibodies neutralise pathogens in a number of ways:
They bind to pathogens and damage or destroy them.
They coat pathogens, clumping them together so that they are easily ingested by
Cells, such as white blood cells, that engulfs and absorbs waste material, harmful microorganisms, or other foreign bodies in the bloodstream and tissues.
They bind to the pathogens and release chemical signals to attract more phagocytes.
Lymphocytes may also release antitoxins that stick to the appropriate toxin and stop it damaging the body.

Tuberculosis, or TB for short, is a disease caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The microorganisms are spread through the air in tiny droplets when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Most people who are infected do not show any symptoms. About 10 per cent of people who are infected will go on to suffer symptoms, which include:
death (in about 50 per cent of cases)
Only infected people who show symptoms of TB can spread the microorganisms to other people.
Prevention and control of TB (Higher Tier)
The BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Gurin) vaccination protects about 75 per cent of uninfected people from becoming infected.
from 2006 about how drug-resistant strains of TB are putting European Union states at risk of a deadly outbreak.
Antiobiotics are drugs that kill bacteria or prevent them from reproducing. Infected people who do not show any symptoms of TB are usually given a course of one antibiotic, but infected people who are showing symptoms of TB need a course of several antibiotics at once. This is to reduce the chance that strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria will emerge.

Image shows a pulley system consisting of two pulley wheels and a belt. The smaller, driver, pulley is 40mm wide and the larger, driven pulley is 120mm wide. The speed of the smaller wheel is 100rpm.
If the pulley wheels are different sizes, the smaller one will spin faster than the larger one. The difference in speed is called the
. This is calculated using the formula:
Velocity ratio = diameter of the driven pulley  diameter of the driver pulley
If you know the velocity ratio and the input speed of a pulley system, you can calculate the output speed using the formula:
Output speed = input speed  velocity ratio
Work out the velocity ratio and the output speed of the pulley shown in the diagram above.
Velocity ratio = 120mm  40mm = 3
Output speed = 100rpm  3 = 33.3 rpm
The velocity ratio of a pulley system also determines the amount of turning force or torque transmitted from the driver pulley to the driven pulley. The formula is:
output torque = input torque  velocity ratio.
Drive belts are usually made of synthetic fibres such as neoprene and polyurethane, with a V-shaped cross section. It is possible to reverse the direction of the driven pulley by twisting the belt as it crosses from input to output. Pulley belts have the advantage over chains that they do not need lubrication (though unlike a chain, a belt can slip).

In the exam you may be asked to look at the information in a graph and describe the area's climate.
Look for patterns in the temperature data
Is the temperature the same all year round? If it is different, how many seasons does the location experience?
Which season is the warmest? Is it warm (10 to 20C), hot (20 to 30C) or very hot (30C)?
Which season is the coolest? Is it mild (0 to 10C), cold (-10 to 0C) or very cold (below -10C)?
What is the range of temperature? (Subtract the minimum temperature from the maximum temperature).
Look for patterns in the rainfall data
Does the rainfall occur all year round?
What is the pattern of the rainfall? Check which season(s) is/are drier or wetter than others.
What is the total annual rainfall? Add each month's total together to get the annual total.
Then put the rainfall and temperature information together - what does it tell you about this area?
Describe the patterns in temperature and rainfall, including how they relate to each other. You now have a description of the climate.

Religion has a great deal to say about 'good' and 'evil'. Religious leaders and sacred texts all encourage believers to live 'good' lives. The problem of evil and suffering is one of the commonest reasons people give for not believing in G-d.
- suffering caused by events that have nothing to do with humans, and which are to do with the way the world is, eg, natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, floods or earthquakes
- suffering caused by humans acting in a way that is considered morally wrong eg, bullying, murder, rape, theft or terrorism the
Human evil and natural evil can often work together, with human evil making natural evil worse  or better! For example, the suffering caused by an earthquake or floods can be made worse by people looting  it can be made more bearable by people showing compassion and making personal sacrifices to help those who are suffering.
It is important to remember that 'evil' is a cause of suffering; 'suffering' is a result of evil.
Many Jewish thinkers say that it is not possible to know what evil is. It is more important to ask what people should do about it.
What does Judaism teach about good and evil?

You could also be asked to write about how characters are presented by Doris Lessing, the writer, or the methods she uses. Whatever you are asked to do, make sure you read the question very carefully and spend some time planning your answer.
One important thing to remember is that these questions might look very different but they often cover very similar ground. For instance, if you are going to write about the old man, you need to show how the writer presents him. Or if you are writing about the problems a character faces, you should also look at their relationships with other characters in the story.
The other thing to remember is that there are a lot of different ways to answer the same question. You do not have to include things in a fixed order.
It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters and themes.
It is also useful to include a personal reaction. This shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied someone else's ideas. For instance, you might feel sympathetic to the old man's situation, or feel he has no right to try to control Alice as he does.
In addition, try to include short quotes in your answer. The previous sections have plenty of examples, like using in a single word:
When he lets the pigeon escape he smiles 'proudly' at his granddaughter.
You can also use a short phrase, such as:
She stares, does 'not smile' and is 'wide-eyed, and pale' with 'tears shivering off her face.
Many people make the mistake of regurgitating numerous sentences, or even complete paragraphs, from the story. There is no need for this. It wastes time and does not provide a focus to your answer. Instead, look for a specific point and the exact word or words to illustrate it. Next, we will look at an example these techniques.

. This, together with social inequality and racism, resulted in increased tensions across the nation.
It was not all boom for American industries. Traditional industries such as coal and textiles did not prosper. In 1929, when the average monthly income of New York bricklayers might be $320, coalminers were earning only $103 a month. Also, during the 1920s, in response to American import tariffs on their products, many other countries put customs duties on American goods, which reduced American exports.
For many American farmers, life in the 1920s was a constant struggle against poverty. During the First World War, farmers had been encouraged to grow as much food as they could. They continued to do this in the 1920s until they had produced more cotton and wheat than they could sell.
As prices dropped, many farmers lived in unhygienic conditions in tin shacks, without electricity or running water. In 1929, when the average monthly income of a skilled manufacturing worker might be $140, farm labourers were earning only $49 a month.
People who were wealthy in America were extremely rich, but few people shared in this prosperity. Only 5 per cent of the American population owned a third of the wealth, while 42 per cent of the population were living below the poverty line.
Before the First World War, many Americans saw their country as a melting pot in which people of different nationalities, races and religions could live in harmony. The Statue of Liberty symbolised the welcome offered to the huddled masses as they entered America. Yet, there were signs that this mood of tolerance was under attack.
The revival of the Ku Klux Klan was a frightening development. The Klan believed in the superiority of the white race. Its members wore white gowns and pointed hats, and burned large crosses as a symbol of their presence. The revival of the Klan started in the Deep South, but spread to other parts of America.

""I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you never to dance with him,""
says Elizabeth with regards to Darcy (Chapter 5). Yet she ends up marrying him. Explain and comment on her change of heart.
The above quotation shows that from a very early point in the book Elizabeth deeply resents Darcy. As a result, she feels confident in promising her mother that she will never dance with him. After the Meryton assembly, Elizabeth must doubt he would ever ask her anyway. In that unlikely event, she would be keen to refuse him (which she does). Before considering how Elizabeth comes to the huge change of heart which results in her falling in love with and marrying Darcy, it is necessary to explain why she felt such resentment towards him in the first place. (
Essay has sense of direction and purpose.
Elizabeth is entirely justified in developing a dislike for Darcy (
), because on their very first acquaintance, at the Meryton assembly, he observes of her:
""She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me.""
It is no wonder Elizabeth's first impression of Darcy is that he is conceited and vain. Not only does he seem full of unattractive pride, he has slighted her looks, which is deeply offensive, especially to a young woman. (
) His only excuse is that Elizabeth 'overhears' this and it was not intended for her. He is at an immediate disadvantage, as he does not know he has offended her so directly.
After this point, Elizabeth looks to fuel her dislike of Darcy. His former childhood friend George Wickham is only too keen to assist her. After hearing that Elizabeth (with regard to Darcy) thinks
), Wickham begins to recount his relationship with Darcy. You can tell Elizabeth is keenly looking for fault in Darcy:
""Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart.""
and she is suitably outraged when Wickham informs her that Darcy, in direct contradiction of his late father's bequest, deprives him of a livelihood. She concludes that he must be publicly disgraced and accuses him of malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity. (
) The strong words reflect her strong emotions. (
But the thing which makes her resent Darcy above all else is when she discovers he had been instrumental in ruining the future happiness of her sister, Jane, by persuading Bingley she was unsuitable for him. Being very close to Jane, the effect of this news was overwhelming, causing agitation and tears.
It was unfortunate timing on Darcy's behalf that the next day he proposed marriage (albeit it in a undiplomatic fashion) - the violence of Elizabeth's rejection shocked and even angered him. As a result of this, Darcy wrote Elizabeth a lengthy letter which was the turning point in her attitude and affections towards him. He explains that he only advised Bingley to leave Netherfield after observing that Jane had given absolutely no indication she felt any affection for his friend; Darcy also reveals the truth about Wickham's corruption and immorality.
The effect of the letter on Elizabeth was huge: (
""She grew absolutely ashamed of herself 'How despicably have I acted!' she cried.""
We have seen neither shame nor self-reproach in Elizabeth before, which reflects the impact of Darcy's words. (
Comment which also gives wider context of whole novel.
) She confirms the depth of her feelings by saying her shame is absolute; despicably is also a powerful condemnation. (
The second major event which persuades Elizabeth to change her opinion of Darcy radically is a visit to his Derbyshire estate, Pemberley (which she only agrees to after finding out he won't be there, such is her embarrassment). Servants were not usually known to speak of their employers in glowing terms (
) and Elizabeth might have expected Darcy's employees to be no different, especially considering his aloof manner. However, his housekeeper gushes with praise and loyalty for him, saying:
""I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.""
This contradicts Elizabeth's prejudiced views completely (
) and she finds that this was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion. (
) Further, she discovers he is generous to the poor and loved by his tenants.
""She thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth.""
Her opinion of him is again forced to change, not merely to a neutral standpoint but to one of affection, which is confirmed by the use of words like 'gratitude' and 'warmth', whereas the effect on her is extraordinary. (
) This is heightened when Darcy returns to Pemberley unexpectedly and is gentlemanly to a fault, inviting her uncle to fish there whenever he wishes and even asking Elizabeth if she would meet his young sister - a great compliment, as he is protective of her.
""It is impossible that he should still love me.""
considers Elizabeth. The fact that this thought enters her head at all shows she is falling in love with him. (
Elizabeth's affection for Darcy deepens significantly when she discovers he was responsible for ensuring Wickham married Lydia, thereby keeping her all-important reputation. (
Context of plot; social and historical context.
) Not only did he first try to dissuade Lydia from marrying Wickham, but when she refused he came to a financial arrangement with his former friend. All this he did in secret, thereby removing any suspicion that Darcy might have been doing this to openly impress anyone. Elizabeth has reached the stage that her heart did whisper that he had done it for her, but such has been the change in her affections (
) that she feels herself unworthy of his attentions.
""For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.""
The choice of the word 'proud' is deliberate. It shows the comprehensive change of heart in Elizabeth. Formerly, she had criticised Darcy for his pride; now, in a total emotional turnaround, she feels proud of him. (
Comment showing originality of interpretation; reference to language; directly related to essay title.
Elizabeth's change of heart is indeed complete, and is confirmed by the couple finally overcoming past events and agreeing to marry. Elizabeth is aware how much her feelings for Darcy have altered, as the narrator makes clear in saying her sentiments had undergone so material a change. (
Conclusion of essay ties in with conclusion of novel; well-chosen embedded quotation confirms argument.

4308,"Successful product design depends on asking the right questions about the proposed product's function, purpose, shape, form, colour and texture. Product designers need to be able to analyse existing products, and be aware of new technologies and consumer demand for the new product.
The first stage in designing your own products is writing the
document containing details of a product's required characteristics, and all the processes, materials and other information needed to design the product
. Throughout the design and making process the designer should check that the product matches the specification - and that quality is maintained.
Product design analysis means studying how well a product does its job. When you are analysing the design of a product you need to ask these questions:
What are the different parts of the product and how do they work together?
A visual element. Shape is the visual appearance of something.
A style of poem, with a particular pattern of rhythm, rhyme pattern or regular line length (eg sonnet, couplets or ballad).
A visual element. Texture is the way surfaces look and feel.
non-functional additions to a product to make it more interesting or appealing. Decoration may be done using line, colour, shape or additional materials.
The different elements that make up a system or device.
How well does the product do its job compared with other similar products?
If two or more products are similar and do the same sort of job, what are their unique points?
The table below will help you understand the meaning of shape, form, colour, texture and decoration.
Shape is two and three dimensional - a flat area which has lines round it.
Form is three-dimensional - it is a solid object made up of shapes joined together. The object shown in this picture shows how form has been used to create an attractive design.
Colour is used to make a product more interesting and attractive. Colour may be applied to a product, eg by painting, or use can be made of the natural colour of the material, eg acrylic.
Texture is used to make an object more interesting. Surfaces are made 3-dimensional to some extent by the use of grooves, patterns and the application of other materials such as fabrics.
Decoration may be achieved by the use of different colours, shapes or materials. A decoration may be pasted onto a product, or be part of the material itself.The object in this picture has been decorated to make it look more interesting.
Make sure you understand what the product actually does and how it works.
Learn carefully how products are made in industry - especially look at what materials are used and how they are
Apply this knowledge to the product you are asked to analyse.
Think carefully about possible markets for different products: Who would buy the product? Why would they buy it? Where would it be used? Who would use the product?

Quarrying was used by early settlers in Britain for building stone and extracting metals for weapons.
Quarrying creates jobs in areas where there are limited opportunities.
There is a huge demand for the products of quarrying such as building stone and cement. This is linked to the demand for new homes in the UK.
It provides income to local councils through taxation.
Good communications are needed for transporting the products of quarrying. As a result many remote rural areas benefit from improved access.
It is an important part of the UK economy. Over 30000 people are employed in quarrying itself and related industries.

695,"Integrated circuits are the basic component of modern
technology dealing with the building of electronic circuits and devices using microchips (large numbers of extremely small integrated circuits)
You need to know about three types of integrated circuit that are important in controlling electronic systems. These are:
(a circuit) having two states, one of which is stable. A monostable circuit needs to be pushed into the unstable state by a control input, and will jump back after a set time to the stable state - giving a single, timed output signal.
(a circuit) having two states, neither of which is stable. An astable circuit therefore oscillates between the two states, giving a constant on/off digital output. Used, for example, to make LEDs flash continuously.
Integrated circuits are the basic component of microelectronics. ICs are complete, self-contained circuits, with dozens, hundreds or even thousands of separate components such as transistors, diodes, resistors and capacitors etched into a tiny silicon chip.
ICs have three big advantages over conventional circuits with discrete components:
The chip inside an IC is usually packaged inside a piece of black plastic with tiny pins protruding to allow connections to the circuit. In ICs the pins are arranged in a 'dual-in-line' (DIL) configuration, or as a surface mount chip with either eight, 14 or 16 pins. The surface mount chip is much smaller and is designed for machines to build the circuits.

Walt Whitman, 1819 - 1892. Getty Images / Hulton Archive
Walt Whitman was born into a large family in New York in 1819 and brought up in Brooklyn. He had little schooling, beginning work as an office boy when young. He later became a writer and contributed to newspapers and magazines throughout America, including the frontier. He published
, his first and best known book of poems, in 1855.
He was active in politics as a Democrat. Through his writing, he hoped to stir up national feeling and encourage Americans to free themselves from their colonial past. During the Civil War (1861 - 1865) he volunteered to work in a hospital amongst the wounded and contracted an infection as a result. He was very moved by the suffering he saw.
He suffered a stroke in 1873 and moved to Camden, New Jersey, just inland from Barnegat. Barnegat is on the Atlantic coast in what is now called Ocean County and is a popular sailing base. It is possible that this poem was actually written in 1880 (not 1856, as stated in the

lamps work in a different way. They transfer a greater proportion of electrical energy as light energy. This is the Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp.
From the diagram, you can see that much less electrical energy is transferred, or 'wasted', as heat energy.
The efficiency of a device such as a lamp can be calculated using this equation:
efficiency = (useful energy transferred  energy supplied)  100
The efficiency of the filament lamp is (10  100) 100 = 10%. This means that 10% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy (90% is transferred as heat energy).
The efficiency of the energy-saving lamp is (75  100)  100 = 75%. This means that 75% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy (25% is transferred as heat energy).
Note that the efficiency of a device will always be less than 100%.

Be clear about what the examiners will be looking for. For example, to get a grade A, you must be able to write an accurate account in the past tense. You must also be able to give and justify ideas and points of view. There are a number of other criteria that an ""A"" candidate has to meet.
Be sure that your teacher has given you the criteria for writing that match the grade you are trying to achieve.
Make sure that you have a vocabulary book/record that covers each area of the syllabus.
Build up your personal vocabulary by learning a small number of new words every day.
Be clear about which aspects of grammar you need to revise. For example, you will need to be able to use verbs in the present, perfect and future tenses if you are aiming for a grade C or above. In the higher tier exam you will also be expected to use the imperfect tense .
Use the notes you prepared for the speaking test as part of your revision for writing. They are certain to contain a lot of useful words, phrases and ideas.
Get plenty of regular practice. Use past papers. Use this website - both the 'Revision Bites' and the 'Test Bites'.
Make sure you practise the different types of task that could occur at your level. Popular foundation tasks are lists, diary entries, postcards, short letters, messages and forms to fill in, so for instance you will need to know how to write dates and how to begin and end letters.
Popular higher tasks are formal letters, factual or imaginative narratives, articles and job applications.
Do some practice tasks under exam conditions.
Go carefully over all old work that has been corrected by your teacher. Try to understand where you went wrong so that you can avoid making the same mistakes again. Then write your work up as a fair copy with no mistakes. It is easy and effective to revise from perfect copies of your own work.
Have a look at model answers that can show you, for example, what a grade A essay looks like. The 'Revision Bites' and 'Test Bites' in this website often contain model answers.
If you are doing coursework, be sure that you know the rules of your exam board in relation to drafting and redrafting, as well as the use of support materials such as text books, grammar books and vocabulary lists.
You must come to the exam with a clear idea of the strategies that will help you work well under pressure. Here are some suggestions.

The poem is a striking list of vivid impressions of a beach in a winter storm. It is not a complete sentence, but as if anything fixed and solid (like rules of grammar) are destroyed by the storm. Our expectations are deceived - we imagine that the poem will build up to a striking main verb to complete the sentence emphatically, but that doesn't happen - we are left on a cliff-hanger.
The natural elements that are described using verbs normally applied to people or animals - the waves are careering, the wind breasting - which is disconcerting: the elements are somehow alive, and more powerful than humans. The reference to demoniac laughter even suggests the supernatural.
The poet uses alliteration to heighten our sense of the storm. In line 6 he combines alliteration with consonance: On beachy slush and sand spirts of snow fierce slanting - which give the impression of the harsh, hissing, swirling snow.
There is a lot of repetition in the poem and some near-repetition: for example, beachy slush and sand (line 6) is echoed by Slush and sand of the beach (line 10). Perhaps the reader feels bombarded by words as the poet did by the storm, as we are given the same image again and again.
The poem ends on a sinister note: the savage trinity are still warily watching and so we are left with the idea of an evil presence. We are haunted by the idea that the elements are stronger than man - and possibly threatening.

In the first 20 years of the 20th century, British society underwent profound changes.
There was growing awareness that more would have to be done to protect the weakest and poorest members of society.
A series of laws was passed which attempted to deal with the problem of poverty. The foundations of what became known as the 'welfare state' were laid.
An Act of 1918 gave many women over the age of 30 the vote. Finally, women could play a full part in national political life.
[Meanwhile,] it was the trade unions who did the most to bring a new political party for the workers into existence [and] help Labour candidates to stand in Parliamentary elections.

She has a no-nonsense, practical approach, makes clear observations and is assertive. At the end, she is brave enough to tell Eddie the truth: You want somethin' else, Eddie, and you can never have her!
She is upset by the conflict within the family that the relationship between Rodolpho and Catherine causes. She continually tries to be the calming influence. At the end, however, she remains loyal to Eddie, choosing to stay with him rather than attend Catherine's wedding. She is rewarded for this with Eddie's dying words -
She is 17 years old, the orphaned daughter of Beatrice's sister Nancy.

Later we hear that perhaps she is too familiar with Eddie now she has grown up: Beatrice tells her not to wander round the apartment in her slip, which shocks and saddens Catherine - the stage directions say, She is at the edge of tears, as though a familiar world had shattered. She had never before imagined there was anything wrong with her relationship with Eddie.

553,"Food risk and benefit (Ideas about science)
There are risks attached to everything, and this includes the foods that we eat. You need to weigh up the data to assess the risks of eating certain foods, such as aspartame which is an artificial sweetener.
It is impossible for anything to be completely safe. No matter how careful we are, there are risks in our everyday life. Even staying in bed all day involves a certain amount of risk  for example, you could fall out of bed.
It is possible to make assessments of the risks that we are exposed to. These assessments can then be used to enable us to make decisions about the actions we will and will not take.
Information about the size of the risks can be presented in different ways. We could, for example, have data that tells us that for every thousand people who take an action, how many are harmed by it. In some cases the data we have refers to laboratory animals, so the chances of similar problems occurring in humans are not supported.
Aspartame is commonly used in 'diet' drinks
Risks can arise from new technological or scientific advances. Aspartame was developed as a replacement for sugar. It is about 200 times sweeter than sugar, therefore much less has to be added to food. It is commonly used in diet foods and therefore helps to prevent obesity, which is thought to contribute to heart disease and strokes.
But aspartame has been found to cause cancer in rats when fed in large doses over long periods of time. The risk of heart disease and strokes may be reduced by eating foods that contain aspartame instead of sugar, but this in turn may increase the risk of getting cancer.
Scientific research and applications are subject to official actions and laws. Aspartame has been approved for use as a food additive because it is considered to be safe.
Read on if you are taking the
We do not have enough evidence to say for certain how great the risk is for certain actions. For example, the data that we have to link aspartame with cancer comes only from research on laboratory animals. We cannot use this data to predict with certainty how safe it is for humans to eat food containing aspartame.
The precautionary principle means that when there is not enough evidence to assess fully the risk of an action, but it is possible that it may turn out to have a high risk, it is better to avoid the action. This can be summed up as it is better to be safe than sorry.
It is up to each person to assess whether they should apply the precautionary principle to a particular action, such as eating food containing aspartame.

This is an example of 'sustainable agriculture'. It benefits small farmers and enables them to use their land efficiently. The projects use cheap, appropriate technology to increase yields in ways that make farmers more independent and conserve their natural resources.
Farmers in 50 developing countries have adopted sustainable techniques and some have experienced increased yields. By combining science with traditional knowledge, sustainable agriculture could meet the long-term food needs of developing countries without damaging the environment.
Genetically modified (GM) foods, for example, could change food production methods. They allow more food to be produced in a smaller area using fewer resources. Some people are against GM crops and question whether it will reduce hunger in LEDCs and are concerned about the impact on the environment.
In the 1960s high-yielding varieties of crops were used to increase food production - this became known as 'The Gene Revolution'. In the Gene Revolution, genes from one plant were copied and inserted into another to give it new characteristics. This allowed foods to be developed to suit specific environments and food demands.

The table shows the properties of these three sub-atomic particles.
The number of electrons in an atom is always the same as the number of protons, so atoms are electrically neutral overall. Atoms can lose or gain electrons. When they do, they form charged particles called ions:

A description of all the differences between two things (in this case, two texts).
between the way Batman saw his separation with Robin, when he 'generously' let him free to explore the wild blue yonder (line 3), to Robin's more down to earth view of events - ditched me... in the gutter (line 5). We wonder what really happened between them...
Robin uses various cliched phrases as he tells us that he has scotched that... rumour, sacked it, blown the cover... let the cat out (lines 6-9), perhaps because he is boasting of the power that releasing these secrets has given him over Batman. The casual language makes it sound as if he is showing off to his mates. The casual use of motor for the Batmobile also suggests he is trying to impress us.
The word caper (line 9) is a pun, reminding us of the capes that Batman and Robin always wore.
Lines 12 and 13 are spoofs of tabloid headlines. Holy is an adjective that Robin used a lot when exclaiming, such as 'Holy smoke!' Here, Armitage has exaggerated it for comic effect. The 'new' Robin seems to be making fun of his 'old' self.
Robin becomes scornful when he uses the

He makes fun of his superhero outfit, again sounding scornful by describing it as a fashion writer might - that off-the-shoulder Sherwood-Forest-green and scarlet number (lines 15-16). He prefers the more ordinary jeans and jumper, now that he is an ordinary kid.
It is ironic that he calls Batman baby in the final line, because although it is a term of endearment, he uses it to belittle Batman. Robin the kid has grown up while Batman, the superhero, has diminished to a baby. The phrase boy wonder had a new meaning, because Robin has managed to break free of his idol.
You will have noticed that every line ends with -er (order, wander, yonder). Think about the famous Batman theme tune: Er er er er, er er er er, er er er er, er er er er, Batman! Armitage is mimicking the theme tune through his rhyme scheme.
This effect is intensified through the internal
In poetry, the use of words which have the same or a similar sound - eg 'flow' and 'bow' - to form a pattern of sound.
, as many words within the lines also end with -er or -our (gutter, rumour, elder)
The very last words of the poem, announcing that Robin now is the real boy wonder (line 24), create the climax of the rhyme scheme.
Armitage uses very long sentences: there are only 5 in the whole poem. This adds pace to the reading, as we are only allowed short pauses for breath, and helps to convey the energy that Robin has now he is free of Batman.

As Hippocrates had built on Egyptian ideas, so later Greeks built on the ideas of Hippocrates. Succeeding generations of Greek doctors learned to observe human anatomy, wrote down their findings, and took their knowledge all over the known world.
After philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato decided that the human body was not needed in the afterlife, Greek doctors at Alexandria in Egypt began to

Thus the Greeks began to find out in a systematic way about the

Then, derived from his study of mathematics, the Greek philosopher Pythagoras came up with the idea of the
. This gave Greek doctors their idea of the underlying cause of disease. We can read about this in the 70 books ascribed to the Greek doctor Hippocrates, who thought that disease occurred when the humours of the body fell out of balance.
Greek doctors made careful studies of the different kinds of illness - in particular they noted the
Man's body has blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. These make up his body and through them he feels illness or enjoys health. When all the humours are properly balanced and mingled, he feels the most perfect health. Illness occurs when one of the humours is in excess, or is reduced in amount, or is entirely missing from the body.
Hippocrates, 'On the Constitution of Man' (c.500BC)
Hippocrates was a real doctor, but most of the books ascribed to him were written by his disciples. (To help you remember the four humours, along with blood and phlegm, think of yellow bile as vomit, and black bile as diarrhoea.)
I shall describe what the plague was like ... At the beginning the doctors were unable to treat the disease because of their ignorance of the right methods. Equally useless were prayers in the temples, consulting the oracles and suchlike.
Thucydides, 'History of the Peloponnesian War' (c.500BC)
Silenus had become overtired from drinking and exercising at the wrong time and had caught a fever. He began with pains in the stomach, heavy head and a stiff neck.

2521,"Successful writers usually write about something that is important to them, so they have to choose the best way to express it. Your exam grade depends on what you write, so make it your business to be interested in the topic you get asked about. You may feel confident reading a text, but can you write one?
In the exam,you will be asked to write one or two non-fiction texts for yourself. There are essentially four steps to writing any piece of non-fiction:

Once you've read the question, work out:
: what format or layout is being asked for.
: what you are being asked to write - what's the purpose of the text.
A professional writer works through the same checklist.

before starting any piece. This is how she broke down the purpose, audience and genre of her article:
""I also have to think about format as well - how best to present the information in the piece.""
""[The audience for the paper] ranges from 8- to 14-year-olds, which means that I have to keep my writing really clear, really concise and to the point. But my main aim is to be informative as well as entertaining.""
""The first thing I have to do when I'm starting an article is think about the purpose. In the case of zoos, it's quite simple - a for and against piece. I want to present a balanced viewpoint and let [the readers] make their own minds up.""
Ask any examiner and they'll tell you a plan is vital. If you have an hour for the question, you should spend about 15 minutes on the plan.
To keep to the point - planning stops you rambling off the point.
To keep it well-structured - this makes sure you keep the right points in the right order.
To keep track of time - planning allows you to organise your time effectively and takes the pressure off - once it's done, you know where you're going.
So, before you start, make a plan! Basically, it's no good having a bright idea five minutes before the end of the exam. It's too late then - your thinking time needs to be at the start.
Your plan is based on what you've decided about genre, audience and purpose. That allows you to plan for the main points of content. So, make notes first about these points and get them in the right order by planning how you're going to begin, what's going to come in the middle, and keep on planning right through to the end. A decisive ending makes an impact.
Planning the end is particularly important because not knowing when to stop writing will lose you marks. It shows you don't understand what you're trying to do. Also, nothing will be gained from restating your arguments. So make your points, back them up if necessary, and then shut up.
Now, if you still think planning isn't important, take it from a professional writer. It's Kitty again!
[Writing an article]... is 90% research and planning and 10% writing.
And to prove her point, here's one she did earlier:
Education - limited value as not natural environment.
Conservation - doesn't always help and where are the animals taken from?
Danger to public - there have been accidents involving animals.
Not cruel - many animals bred in captivity, well looked after.
Education - allows people unique access to wild animals and raises awareness of conservation.
What to think about when you start writing:
You've worked out what the question is about and made your plan, so this is where you start composing. You are writing your answer against the clock, so you probably need a couple of reminders to keep you thinking straight.
Once you've got a plan, your writing will already be organised into chunks, providing a kind of structure or way through the information. When you write, organise these chunks into paragraphs. As a rule of thumb, each paragraph should contain one main point or argument.
You may be asked for a particular type of layout (eg letter, report, article), so make sure you take this into account.
Finally, just a note about the type of language you're going to use. Look back at the points you made about audience. That will tell you how you need to tailor your language: whether you're writing something formal or casual, to an older or younger audience for example.
""I think the first sentence and the first paragraph are the most important. That's what draws the reader in to the feature as a whole. It has to set the scene.""
""The way that I end a feature is equally as important as the way I begin it.""
Is just as important as the beginning
Paying attention to the opening and closing sentences can help your writing a lot. You need to
Once you've started writing - stick to the structure, but try to make your writing flow easily from one point to the next.
Fluency means leading your reader smoothly through your writing, controlling the pace and linking points together.
It's no good having brilliant thoughts if they come out in an unconnected jumble. Keeping it fluent is down to handling a few simple, but very important, linking words: but... and... therefore... so... although... moreover... consequently... thus... but... however... whilst... which... that... also... though... yet.
Keep in the forefront of your mind the audience for whom you are writing - your tone must be consistent throughout, so watch the language that you use.
If you've organised that final paragraph, you'll leave your audience KNOWING your main ideas or your opinion. The final sentence is vital here - it might be open-ended and balanced, or it might be a passionate point of view.
The ending says a lot about how well you have put your writing together - and it stays longest in the reader's memory.
It is important that you leave a few minutes at the end of your exam to
what you have written. Spelling mistakes and grammatical errors can lose you vital points and are easily spotted with careful checking. Also, when you read through what you have written, you can check that it flows properly and that your tone is consistent.

Limestone is a valuable natural resource that is used to make things such as glass and concrete.
Limestone quarries take up land-space. They are visible from long distances and may permanently disfigure the local environment.
Limestone quarrying provides employment opportunities that support the local economy in towns near the quarry.
Quarrying is a heavy industry that creates dust, noise and heavy traffic. This has a negative impact on local peoples quality of life.

Metal carbonates such as calcium carbonate break down when heated strongly. This is called thermal decomposition. Here are the equations for the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate:
Other metal carbonates decompose in the same way. Here are the equations for the thermal decomposition of copper carbonate:
Notice that in both examples the products are a metal oxide and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide gas can be detected using limewater. Limewater turns cloudy white when carbon dioxide is bubbled through it.
Metals high up in the reactivity series - such as calcium - have carbonates that need a lot of energy to decompose them. Metals low down in the reactivity series - such as copper - have carbonates that are easily decomposed. This is why copper carbonate is often used at school to show these reactions. It is easily decomposed, and its colour change, from green copper carbonate to black copper oxide, is easy to see

Think about the title. It does not tell us anything about Batman and Robin - it's only when we begin to read the poem that the identity of the 'kid' becomes clear. However, if we go back to the title having read the poem, it may remind us of other young people who are caught up in the shadow (line 20) of someone they admire, and their need to forge their own identity.
Batman is at first presented as a real superhero: he is described at the start in the alliterative phrase Batman, big shot, as someone who gives orders to Robin. Yet as we read on, his status is diminished. We hear that he

Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.
Gore-Tex has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.
Teflon is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.

Don't put any finish on the surfaces to be glued.

1653,"Evidence for the Big Bang - higher
You may have noticed that when an ambulance or police car goes past, its siren is high-pitched as it comes towards you, then becomes low-pitched as it goes away. This effect, where there is a change in frequency and wavelength, is called the Doppler effect. It happens with any wave source that moves relative to an observer.
This happens with light, too, and is called 'red shift'. Our Sun contains helium. We know this because there are black lines in the spectrum of the light from the Sun where helium has absorbed light. These lines form the absorption spectrum for helium.
When we look at the spectrum of a distant star, the absorption spectrum is there, but the pattern of lines has moved towards the red end of the spectrum, as you can see below:
. It is a change in frequency of the position of the lines.
Astronomers have found that the further from us a star is, the more its light is red-shifted. This tells us that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and that the further away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away.
Since we cannot assume that we have a special place in the Universe, this is evidence for a generally expanding universe. It suggests that everything is moving away from everything else. The Big Bang theory says this expansion started 13.6 billion years ago with an explosion.
Summary of some of the evidence of the Big Bang and its interpretation
The light from other galaxies is red-shifted.
The other galaxies are moving away from us.
The further away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.
The most likely explanation is that the whole Universe is expanding. This supports the theory that the start of the Universe could have began with a single explosion.

Heavy industry in the Ruhr  A case study
Natural resources such as coal, iron ore and limestone enabled the iron and steel industry to develop in the Ruhr. The chemical and textile industries also grew due to good transport links and available workforce.
Canals and rivers such as the Rhine were used for transport and power.
The area developed industrially in the 1930s and 1940s to supply arms for Germany.
Up until the 1970s the factories and associated services were an important source of employment for people in the region.
The decline in the Ruhr's importance as a heavy industrial area has caused job losses in steelworks and coal mines. Many people have left the area, eg cities such as Dortmund, due to economic and associated social problems.
The environmental legacy of the heavy industry in the area includes waste tips from coal mining, air and water pollution.
Many of the original raw materials are exhausted, there are high labour costs and old, outdated machinery. This has led to cheaper steel being imported from south east Asia where labour costs are lower. This is one of the drawbacks of globalisation for MEDC industry.
Many of the problems and changes in the Ruhr have also been experienced in other industrial regions in the EU such as South Wales.
There is still a large workforce living in the area that have had to learn new skills as industries have changed.
New industries, eg electronics, are moving in to replace the traditional heavy industries.
Much of the derelict land has been improved to provide a more pleasant living and working environment.

- Liverpool had made millions of pounds from the slave trade, which meant there were consumers with money to buy cloth, and rich merchants with money to invest in building factories.
- the port of Liverpool allowed hundreds of tons of cotton to be imported from Egypt and America.
- the Lancashire coalfield provided coal to power the steam-engines.
- millstone grit in the Pennines meant that the water was soft, which made it easy to wash the cotton.
- the climate was damp and mild, which was necessary for spinning the cotton thread, although the mills had to be kept excessively hot and humid.
- was poor, so the people of Lancashire had more time to spend on industry.
- large numbers of women and children, pauper apprentices from the poorhouses and migrants from the countryside were prepared to work in the factories.
- up until 1774, a duty was charged on cotton cloth to protect the woollen industry. In 1774, this was abolished, and vast amounts of cotton cloth could be produced and sold at a profit.
Note that all except the first point also applied to Glasgow/Clydeside, which explains why the cotton industry was also established there.

New medical drugs have to be tested to ensure that they work, and are safe, before they can be prescribed. There are three main stages of testing.
The drugs are tested using computer models and human cells grown in the laboratory. Many substances fail this test because they damage cells or do not seem to work.
Drugs that pass the first stage are tested on animals. In the UK, new medicines have to undergo these tests. But it is illegal to test cosmetics and tobacco products on animals. A typical test involves giving a known amount of the substance to the animals, then monitoring them carefully for any side-effects.

4888,".' You may well have heard or read other statements like this about the two Russian revolutions of 1917, but what is the evidence?
the German government helps the Bolshevik leader
, offering people: 'Peace, bread, land', and proclaims: All power to the Soviets'.
the Bolsheviks try to take power in a revolution called the July Days, but are defeated.
a pro-tsarist, General Kornilov, leads a revolt against the Provisional Government. The government has to ask the Bolsheviks for help to defeat him. As a result, the Bolsheviks become so popular that:
the Bolsheviks take control of the Petrograd Soviet, and the prominent Bolshevik Leon Trotsky, leader of the Red Guards, becomes its president.
late at night, Trotsky's Red Guards helped by the Kronstadt sailors move quickly to take over the bridges and the telephone exchange. They cut off Petrograd from the rest of Russia.
next, the Red Guards take over government buildings, the banks and the railway station. Finally, at 9.40pm, signalled by a shell fired from the cruiser Aurora, they move in and take over the Winter Palace, the headquarters of the Provisional Government. There is no resistance.
Why did the Bolsheviks succeed in November 1917?
- the Provisional Government had lost all support. When it was attacked, no one lifted a finger to help it.
- Lenin's message of Peace, bread, land' was
what the people - who were sick of war, hunger and hardship - wanted. Also, the Bolsheviks were popular because they had defeated Kornilov.
- the Red Guards, organised by the brilliant Trotsky, were well-trained and ruthless. They took over the government almost bloodlessly and almost without anyone noticing.
What was the nature of the Bolshevik takeover?
Communist writers - and Soviet film-makers such as Eisenstein - always tried to suggest that the Bolsheviks were swept to power in a huge wave of popular enthusiasm:
The revolution of 1917 was a proletarian revolution; it was the shining proof of the proletariat's political capacity to constitute itself as a ruling class and to move towards the organisation of a communist society... Workers of the world, unite!
Manifesto of the Communist Left to the workers of Europe, 1944
Historians nowadays, however, think that the Bolshevik revolution was the work of a small group of fanatical revolutionaries who succeeded mainly because the Provisional Government was so unpopular:
October was the result of one man, Lenin, who had to drag not merely the toilers but his own party into a battle that few had enthusiasm for. The masses did not take action for themselves The October revolution was a con.

Kid is from the point of view of the younger character, whereas We Remember is the voice of the older.

Yeats: The Song of the Old Mother
Both poems see tension between two generations.
Both are from the point of view of the older generation.
In neither poem are the young able to put their own point of view
... but it does seem that the young people in Yeats's poem are satisfied with life - in contrast to the child in Duffy's.
Both poems are from the point of view of the older generation.
... and both seem subtly to complain about the younger generation. Margaret complains that she has not heard from her son, while in We Remember, the speaker seems on the defensive with the insistent Nobody...
Margaret's love of her son appears true and genuine (she states I have no other earthly friend), while the speaker in Duffy's poem leaves this ambiguous - You were loved.
Both poems are about the distance between parents and a child, yet in Margaret's case it is an enforced separation, whereas in We Remember we feel that the separation is the fault of the parents.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

Before you start building a website, identify the target audience, purpose, structure and content. Consider all the points in this checklist:
- who is the website aimed at? There may be several different audiences, so you might need to tailor the website to the different types of people who will use it.
- are you trying to sell something, or to educate and inform? What are the key things people will want to locate when using the website? The key information should be easy to identify and find, so should be placed in a prominent position, either on the homepage or through clear links.
- what are the main sections within the website? Will they make sense to someone who is visiting your site for the first time? Do the links on the website lead the user to the right point? It is vital to consider the website as a whole when you are planning your design.
- try not to present too much information on each page. People dont like scrolling down to locate the information they are looking for.
to people with disabilities? Could a person with poor eyesight use your website? Or someone who has difficulty using a mouse? A well designed website will be accessible to a variety of people. Other things to consider include colour, text size and use of media (eg images or animated content). It is important not to distract too much from the purpose of the website by using features such as animated gifs, scrolling banners, flashing buttons etc...

Below is a section of text from a leaflet about ancient forests. The leaflet was produced by the environmental campaigning organisation, Greenpeace.
Look at this section of the leaflet. What type of audience do you think it is aimed at?
Jackie Marsh from Greenpeace reveals who the intended audience for this leaflet is:
""The main audience for this... is the teenagers who are interested enough to contact us about the subject. But we've also designed the information in such a way as to be useful to their teachers if they want to base a class on it. The way that we've organised it makes it as versatile as possible for as many different audiences as possible.""
So how can we tell that the intended audience is teenagers and teachers?
The language is not too technical, but neither is it too childlike. Therefore, it suggests the text is aimed at young adults.
Unfamiliar words appear in bold so that they can be identified and discussed.
Photographs are used to support the text.
There is factual information about the height, age and measurement of trees that would be useful to a class discussion on the topic.

Fluency means leading your reader smoothly through your writing, controlling the pace and linking points together.
It's no good having brilliant thoughts if they come out in an unconnected jumble. Keeping it fluent is down to handling a few simple, but very important, linking words: but... and... therefore... so... although... moreover... consequently... thus... but... however... whilst... which... that... also... though... yet.
Keep in the forefront of your mind the audience for whom you are writing - your tone must be consistent throughout, so watch the language that you use.
If you've organised that final paragraph, you'll leave your audience KNOWING your main ideas or your opinion. The final sentence is vital here - it might be open-ended and balanced, or it might be a passionate point of view.

In our work on 'Food, Glorious Food' we looked at how we in the developed world have lots of food to eat and yet we have a problem in our society with young girls and some boys starving themselves in order to become thin. Nowadays it is fashionable to be thin and most of the stars of film and television are super-slim. Young girls see models and pop stars who are generally very thin and want to be like them. Although in our society there are now more obese people than ever before, because of our obsession with weight there are also more people who regularly diet to try and control their weight. An eating disorder sufferer can die if nursing staff are unable to get her to eat.
In another part of the world people are dying because of a lack of food. Sometimes this is because of drought, sometimes war and sometimes because their governments don't make sure that their people are well fed. We in the developed countries send aid to drought-stricken countries to help - although there are times when the aid doesn't get to the people it is meant for. Sometimes in these countries the people in power eat well and have all the advantages that we in developed countries have, while their people are living below the poverty line. In these countries to be thin isn't fashionable - they don't have the luxury of fashion as they are too preoccupied with staying alive.
The images of the two different people are so similar and yet their reasons for looking like this are worlds apart. How ironic that with all our advantages we abuse and waste our food - having food mountains that we can't sell and in poorer countries they haven't enough food to eat at all. How sad that we choose to waste or not eat our food, sometimes even to the point of death and there are those who die because they haven't got the basic foods they need.

1422,"Euthanasia is not suicide but the assisted ending of someone's life who is suffering. Most religions offer teaching on euthanasia and the end of life.
Euthanasia is illegal in the United Kingdom but it was legalised in certain circumstances in the Netherlands in 2002 and assisted suicide was legalised in the State of Oregon (USA) in 1997.
- the person concerned asks someone to help them die, perhaps by asking for help to take an overdose of painkillers
- euthanasia is carried out without the patients consent, for example, if they are in a persistent vegetative state and no longer able to live without a lifesupport machine, which is then switched off
Remember that a person's decision to take their own life is known as 'suicide'.

To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He pleases.

Anyone who throws themselves down from a rock and commits suicide will be throwing themselves into Hell. A person who drinks poison and kills themselves will drink it for ever in Hell. A person who stabs themselves will stab themselves for ever in Hell.
If people are suffering badly they should ask Allah for help:
O ye who believe, seek the help of Allah through steadfastness and Prayer; surely Allah is with the steadfast.... We will surely try you with somewhat of fear and hunger, and loss of wealth and lives and fruits; then give glad tidings to the steadfast, who, when a misfortune overtakes them do not lose heart, but say: Surely, to Allah we belong and to Him we will return.

The solar system consists of planets, dwarf planets, asteroids and comets in orbit around the Sun. The orbits of the planets are almost circular, but the orbits of comets are ellipses - very squashed circles. Asteroids sometimes hit the Earth and this could have serious consequences.
Galaxies contain billions of stars, and the distances involved are huge. The universe contains at least one billion galaxies.
The conditions in space are hostile to life and spacecraft must be designed to protect their occupants. Space probes can explore other planets without needing astronauts. Scientists are using different methods to see if there is life on planets other than the Earth.
planets and dwarf planets in orbit around the Sun
satellites - moons - in orbit around most of the planets
comets and asteroids in orbit around the Sun
There are eight planets, including the Earth, and smaller dwarf planets, such as Pluto, Ceres and Eris.
The Solar System showing from left to right from the Sun - Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto
The Sun's gravity keeps the planets, dwarf planets, comets and asteroids in orbit. The gravity of a planet keeps its satellites in orbit.
The planets take different amounts of time to go around the Sun. A single orbit is called the planet's year, and the further out a planet is the longer its year takes.
The orbits of the planets in the solar system are almost circular  with the Sun near the centre. Many diagrams - including these here - show the orbits very squashed from top to bottom. This is to give a sense of perspective or to fit the diagram to a page in a book.
The orbits of the eight planets and Pluto
Comets are balls of ice and dust in orbit around the Sun. The orbits of comets are different from those of planets - they are elliptical. A comet's orbit takes it very close to the Sun and then far away again. The time to complete an orbit varies - some comets take a few years, while others take millions of years to complete an orbit.
Comets have a range of different orbital periods and all leave a trail of debris behind them
Comets are often visible from Earth when they get close to the Sun, because the Sun's heat vaporises material from their surface, and this vapour forms a tail.
Asteroids are rocky objects, smaller than planets. Most of them are found in an 'asteroid belt', in orbit around the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. The minor planet Ceres is found here, too. Asteroids can crash into each other. When they do, they may break apart and their orbit may change.
The orbits of some asteroids cross the Earth's orbit. At various times during the Earth's history, asteroids have hit the Earth. When this happened, a tremendous amount of energy was released, throwing up billions of tonnes of dust. This blocked heat and light from the Sun, making the Earth very cold.
It is thought that it was the collision of an asteroid with the Earth that helped to drive the dinosaurs to extinction. Scientists worry that an asteroid could still hit the Earth and cause a global catastrophe.
Our Sun is a star. It seems much bigger than other stars in the sky because it is much closer to Earth. Stars form immense groups called galaxies. A

can contain many millions of stars, held together by the force of gravity.
Our Sun is in a spiral galaxy called the Milky Way. The Sun is about half-way from the centre of the galaxy, on one of the arms.
The Milky Way galaxy is home to planet Earth
The distances involved in galaxies are huge. The distance from one star and another in a galaxy is millions of times more than the distance between the planets in the solar system. Meanwhile, the distance from one galaxy to another is millions of times more than the distance between the stars in a galaxy. The universe contains at least one billion galaxies.
The space between planets is called interplanetary space. These are some of the conditions there:
the temperature varies from very cold - away from the Sun - to very hot - in sunshine
the gravitational field strength is close to zero, so objects are effectively weightless
there is a lot of cosmic radiation - radiation from the Sun and distant objects in space
If astronauts are to explore space, scientists and engineers must design systems to protect them from these conditions.
Spacecraft provide the conditions needed for astronauts to survive in space. They provide:
an atmosphere (and equipment to remove waste gases such as carbon dioxide)
insulation and heating to provide a suitable temperature for life
exercise equipment to reduce the effects of weightlessness (bones become weaker the longer an astronaut is in space, and exercise helps to slow this process down).
The walls and windows of spacecraft are designed to withstand the impact of 'micrometeorites' (tiny pieces of fast-moving rock). But they cannot protect astronauts from all the cosmic radiation in space, which can cause cancer. The Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field shield life forms on Earth from most of this, but scientists are not sure how they can protect astronauts in space. This limits how long a mission can last without damaging the health of the astronauts.

Space probes are space craft that can visit other planets without the need for astronauts. Some of the missions undertaken by such craft include:
Viking 1 and Viking 2 - landed on Mars in the 1970s, took photographs and analysed soil samples

from 2005 about the Hubble Space Telescope.
The Earth's atmosphere contains about 21 per cent oxygen as a result of photosynthesis by plants. If we found evidence of oxygen in the atmosphere of another planet, it could indicate the presence of life forms. It is possible to detect oxygen and other gases on other planets by studying the light reflected between planets.
from 2006 about how a new type of research radio telescope could pick up TV transmissions from alien civilisations - if they exist.
It is thought possible that alien civilisations, which are capable of transmitting radio signals, may exist. The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) is a programme that uses radio telescopes to look for non-natural signals coming from space. It should be possible to even detect alien TV programmes, if they exist!

In developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, farmers can easily buy and use synthetic

. Using intensive farming methods results in high yields of crops.
In many developing countries farmers cannot obtain or cannot afford to pay for synthetic fertilisers. They use other methods of agriculture to provide nutrients for their crops. This may include the use of manure, crop rotation or slash and burn agriculture. In slash and burn farming, areas of forest are burned and the ground used to grow crops for a few years until nutrients run out. Generally these methods lead to lower yields of crops.

He is a small man, but has brains and a quick wit.
He has been a good friend to Lennie, ever since he promised Lennie's Aunt Clara that he would care for him. He looks after all Lennie's affairs, such as carrying his work card, and tries to steer him out of potential trouble.
He needs Lennie as a friend, not only because Lennie's strength helps to get them both jobs, but so as not to be lonely. His threats to leave Lennie are not really serious. He is genuinely proud of Lennie.
He shares a dream with Lennie to own a piece of land and is prepared to work hard to build up the money needed to buy it.
""...with us it ain't like that. We got a future. We got somebody to talk to that gives a damn about us. We don't have to sit in no bar room blowin' in our jack 'jus because we got no place else to go. If them other guys gets in jail they can rot for all anybody gives a damn. But not us.""
He is honest with people he trusts. For example, he tells Slim that he used to play tricks on Lennie when they were young, but now feels guilty about it as Lennie nearly drowned.

When the courts convicted Dutch Communist van der Lubbe, but did not convict other Communist leaders, Hitler was furious and replaced the courts with the Nazi People's Courts.
Although it did not give the Nazis the majority that Hitler had hoped for in the Reichstag, it gave them enough seats - after Hitler had arrested all the communist deputies and the other parties had been intimidated by the SA - to get the Enabling Act passed, which is all Hitler needed to do.
Arguably the critical event - it gave Hitler

Many historians believe that Nazi Germany only appeared to be a dictatorship. In fact, officials were left to make most of the decisions themselves, and the Nazi government was badly-organised, and chaotic.

Use the ""washing line"" idea. Hang your work from an imaginary horizontal line. This also works with a strong vertical line.
Create a ""horizon"" in the display . Make sure that all your work goes above and below the imaginary horizontal line. This will also works with a vertical line.

Later, the men realise they were tricked - Hero was completely innocent.
To compensate, Claudio agrees to marry someone else, even though he cannot see her face during the ceremony. Afterwards, he is delighted to find out that Hero is still alive and he has just married her. The other surprise is that the other plan works: Beatrice and Benedick actually fall in love and at the end she accepts his marriage proposal.

My art exhibition shows a series of artwork that I have created which all deal with my journey from Nigeria to England. During the term, I have created a series of art pieces that concentrate on the theme of 'Identity'. In the art pieces, I explore the journey that I have made from Nigeria to live in England. The reason that I have focused on this subject under the title of 'Identity' is because, the journey I have made was a life changing journey and it is a significant part of my identity.
I first started exploring this journey by creating self portraits, this was to develop my skills and ideas in art to help me to become more advanced. I then planned and created a collage of Africa. This collage shows the journey that I made to England from Nigeria, through symbols, colours and pictures used to represent the contrasting countries. The main elements that I included in my collage work is that England has a cool calm atmosphere and climate whilst Nigeria is hot and roars with excitement and noise. Nigeria has a beautiful collection of exotic animals that run wild and free, whilst in England the animals are locked up in a zoo. The environment in England is clean and fresh but in Nigeria, it is dirty and humid. I chose to show my journey this way because it is an effective way of showing the striking difference between England and Nigeria.
After the first collage I realised that collage is my strongest point in art and I began to produce a series of mixed media pieces that featured collage. 'Tree of Life' is a piece where I used a symbol of a tree to represent my life growing out of a symbol of Africa. In 'The first self portrait collage' I used maps to show the physical part of my journey. 'The second self portrait collage', is a piece where I used the different flags of England and Nigeria to show my journey and the comparison between England and Nigeria.
I have linked my theme of 'Identity', with numerous artists because they have all been exploring a similar theme to me. Gerard Quenum is an African artist who uses dolls to symbolise identity, Richard Long, an artist who expresses his journeys through photographs, Louise Bourgeois who deals with her identity by using memories of her childhood, Frida Khalo a Mexican artist who uses powerful images to show her identity and Henri Matisse who uses his knowledge of African art and refines it into a simpler form in his pieces of art. I have been to the National Gallery, the Tate Modern, the October Gallery, the Century City exhibition and the library to learn about artists that may have connections with my theme.
I have been exploring my cultural and family background through family photographs. This is because the photographs prompt ideas for units of work and they tell different stories through the atmosphere or pose in the picture.
The journey in the art pieces is presented in mixed styles of aboriginal art and African art. I do this to experiment with the different ways of presenting my journey to viewers and to give a variation in the techniques and arts styles that I use.
My progress whilst creating units of artwork has improved dramatically compared to the beginning of term where I was unable to develop and explore ideas. Overall, I am pleased with the way that I have managed to link all my units of artwork together all under the topic of 'Identity'. I have improved my art skills from the beginning of the term, when I had very little art skills. I am glad that I can now expand and explore ideas, compared to when I first started art and I could not develop an idea because of lack of experience and knowledge of art.

Droughts endanger lives and livelihoods through thirst, hunger (due to crops dying from lack of water) and the spread of disease.
Millions of people died in the 20th century due to severe drought and famines. One of the worst hit areas was the Sahel region of Africa, which covers parts of Eritrea, Ethiopia and the Sudan.
Droughts and famines can have other geographical impacts. If drought forces people to migrate to a new home it could put pressure on resources in neighbouring countries.

Neurons carry electrical signals, and are connected by synapses.
Neurons carry signals from one place to another, around the many parts of the nervous system. They connect sense receptors to the central nervous system and also connect one part of the nervous system to another, for example in the brain and spine. They also

Polymers are usually disposed of by burying them in landfill sites or burning them in incinerators. These methods of disposal cause environmental problems, and waste valuable resources.
The properties of polymers depend on the structure and bonding found in their molecules. Smart materials such as Gore-Tex have more useful properties than other polymers.
Polymers are large molecules formed from many identical smaller molecules (monomers).
. Addition polymers are formed from alkenes. For example:
ethene can polymerise to form polyethene, which is also called polythene
a typical use of polythene is for a plastic shopping bag or plastic bottle
a typical use of polystyrene is for insulation and protective packaging
Some polymers are not made from alkene monomers. These are called condensation polymers. Nylon and polyesters are like this. They can be drawn into very fine fibres and woven into cloth for clothing. Often, natural fibres such as cotton are mixed with nylon or polyester fibres to make a soft but hard-wearing cloth.

731,"The final part of your oral exam will take the form of a conversation with your examiner. The conversation will cover different topics, such as holidays, home and family, school and work. The number of topics that must be covered varies from syllabus to syllabus. EDEXCEL allows you to choose one of the topics. The other exam boards do not.
What you must be able to do
At foundation tier, the most important thing is to answer all the examiner's questions clearly, so that a German-speaking person would understand. Of course, you should try to be as accurate as possible, but small mistakes will not always lose marks. The best foundation tier candidates will be able to refer to the past, present and future. They will also be able to express personal opinions.
To do well at higher tier, you will need to be accurate and fluent. You will have to produce longer sequences of speech and use a variety of structures, tenses and vocabulary. You will also be expected to express ideas and justify your point of view.
Ask your teacher to show you the standard of work required at different levels. He/she should be able to demonstrate the differences between performance at grades E, C and A.
Most of your preparation will have added value, as it is likely to be useful in your writing exam as well.
Prepare as much material in advance as you can. Take one topic at a time. Your teacher will probably give you some possible questions for each topic.
As well as preparing answers to questions, practise giving a continuous speech on each topic.
Start simple. Later on you will find opportunities to improve your work by adding a few more interesting details. Remember - it is easy to improve a simple piece of work. It is much harder to simplify something that is too complicated!
Do not prepare notes with words or phrases that are too difficult or complicated. If you do, you will not manage a confident, lively conversation and you will get a low mark.
Sometimes you may hesitate in the conversation. Try to do this in German. Don't say ""
"". Instead, prepare some useful German ""fillers"" such as
The better prepared you are, the easier it will be to seem relaxed, fluent and spontaneous in the exam.
Look at the examiner. Eye contact is very important. It will help the examiner to help you.
Avoid making the conversation sound like a rehearsed set of questions with easy answers. One way to do this is to think of each question as a ""trigger"" to help you say as much good German as you can. For example, if your examiner asks you to talk about your family, don't just name the members of your family and wait for the next question. Instead, develop your reply by taking one member of the family and describing their personality, as well as their physical appearance. You could then give your opinion of that person and say whether you get on well together, and why.
Don't panic if the examiner asks you a question you have not prepared. Short answers, as well as complete sentences are both acceptable. Try to be spontaneous and to respond quickly and confidently.
If you don't understand a question, ask the examiner (in German) to repeat it ""
"". If you still don't understand, say so ""
"" and let the examiner move on. Avoid long silences.
Don't worry if things get harder as the conversation develops. Remember, it's the examiner's job to ""push"" you as far as you can go. If everything was too easy, the examiner would be letting you under-achieve.

The relationship between human beings and the earth is increasingly complicated and urgent. Every day there are stories about pollution, global warming and animal species facing extinction. Religion is responding with views on the enviroment and our responsibility for it.

We must consider the welfare of future generations in our planning for and utilisation of the earths resources.

Euthanasia is illegal in the United Kingdom but it was legalised in certain circumstances in the Netherlands in 2002 and assisted suicide was legalised in the State of Oregon (USA) in 1997.
- the person concerned asks someone to help them die, perhaps by asking for help to take an overdose of painkillers
- euthanasia is carried out without the patients consent, for example, if they are in a persistent vegetative state and no longer able to live without a lifesupport machine, which is then switched off
Remember that a person's decision to take their own life is known as 'suicide'.
Christianity teaches that all life comes from God:
Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.' So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.'
The bible also teaches that life is sacred:
Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit.
For this reason Christians believe that it would be wrong to take life:
Elsewhere in the Bible it's clear that human beings are not meant to choose when they die:
For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted.
, Pope John Paul II said that to cause death in this way was 'a grave violation of the law of God'.
However, if large doses of painkillers are used to help ease a persons suffering, and as a result of these the person ultimately dies, this is understood as double effect. The intention was not to kill the person, but to allieviate suffering. In the same way the Church does not believe that doctors should use any extraordinary treatment to keep people alive against the odds.
The Church of England holds similar views saying that
""there are very strong arguments that people should not be kept alive at all costs when they are suffering intolerable pain""
One response from Christianity to the question of euthanasia has been the creation of hospices. These are special places where terminally ill people are cared for and allowed to die with dignity without resorting to euthanasia.

Unfortunately volcanic eruptions and earthquakes cannot be prevented.

As a volcano becomes active, it gives off a number of warning signs. These warning signs are picked up by

The key techniques for monitoring a volcano
Hundreds of small earthquakes are caused as magma rises up through cracks in the Earth's crust.
Temperatures around the volcano rise as activity increases.
Thermal imaging techniques and satellite cameras can be used to detect heat around a volcano
When a volcano is close to erupting it starts to release gases. The higher the sulfur content of these gases, the closer the volcano is to erupting.
Gas samples may be taken and chemical sensors used to measure sulphur levels.

In stage two, the total population starts to rise as death rates start to fall, but birth rates remain quite high.

Limited access to family planning services and education about contraception. Contraception and other methods of family planning may not be culturally or religiously acceptable.
Children are a valuable source of labour and income for a family. They can work on the land from a young age and as they get older they can earn money in other jobs.
Children can help to care for younger children and elderly family members.
High rates of infant mortality (infant deaths) mean that women need to have many children in order to ensure that some survive through to adulthood.
It may be traditional or culturally important to have a large family.
LEDCs have a high population-growth rate which means that they have many young dependants. Governments in LEDCs and international bodies and charities are working to reduce birth rates and slow down rates of population growth.
In the late 1970s, the Chinese government introduced a number of measures to reduce the country's birth rate and slow the population growth rate. The most important of the new measures was a
, which decreed that couples in China could only have one child.
In 1950 the rate of population change in China was 1.9% each year. If this doesn't sound high, consider that a growth rate of only 3% will cause the population of a country to double in less than 24 years!
Previous Chinese governments had encouraged people to have a lot of children to increase the country's workforce. But by the 1970s the government realised that current rates of population growth would soon become
Unsustainable resources are those which cannot be used forever and cannot be replaced or recycled after they are used. The use of fossil fuels is unsustainable for example.
The one-child policy, established in 1979, meant that each couple was allowed just one child.
Benefits, including access to education, childcare and health care, were offered to families that followed this rule.
Those who had more than one child didn't receive these benefits and were fined.
The one-child policy was keenly resisted in rural areas, where it was traditional to have large families The one-child policy has been enforced strictly in urban areas, but remote rural areas have been harder to control.
Many people claim that some women, who became pregnant after they had already had a child, were forced to have an abortion and many women were forcibly sterilised. There appears to be evidence to back up these claims.
The birth rate in China has fallen since 1979, and the rate of population growth is now 0.7%. However there have been negative impacts too.
Due to a traditional preference for boys, large numbers of female babies have ended up homeless or in orphanages, and in some cases killed. In 2000, it was reported that 90% of foetuses aborted in China were female.
As a result, the gender balance of the Chinese population has become distorted. Today it is thought that men outnumber women by more than 60 million.
China's one-child policy has been somewhat relaxed in recent years. Couples can now apply to have a second child if their first child is a girl, or if both parents are themselves only-children.
While China's population is now rising more slowly, it still has a very large total population (1.3 billion in 2008) and China faces new problems:
The falling birth rate is leading to a rise in the relative number of elderly people.
There are fewer people of working age to support the growing number of elderly dependants. In the future China could have an ageing population.

Coping with an ageing population in the UK
There are decreasing numbers of economically active people in the population and more elderly dependents.

In humans and other mammals, gender is controlled by a pair of sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes, XX. Males have one X and one Y chromosome, XY.

Gregor Mendel, a German monk, carried out experiments with pea plants in the 19th century. He had pea plants that had only produced red flowers for several generations, and pea plants that had only produced white flowers for several generations. When he bred the red-flowering plants with the white-flowering plants, all the offspring produced red flowers. Mendel was able to show that red flowers in pea plants is a dominant characteristic, and white flowers in pea plants is a recessive characteristic.

When using your voice during your drama, think about:
- does your voice sounds appropriate - perhaps harsh or soft, angry or happy? Is it suitable for the character you're playing?
- have you got the loudness or quietness of your speech right? Can everyone in the audience hear you?
- does your character speak with a high or low pitched voice? If you were playing a hanging judge, would a squeaky voice sound right?
- how quickly do you say your lines? Too fast, and the audience won't keep up, too slow and they might get bored. Can you alter the pace according to what's happening in the drama? (Ask friends for feedback!)

There's a vast range of spoken language you can use in a drama. The words you choose need to be just right for the character, the setting and the situation. Here are some pointers to help you.
- remember to change the way you speak to different people. We wouldn't say ""Hello, darlin', you all right?"" to a judge in real life, so if you're playing a judge in a drama, keep the register formal, and don't ask your witness ""Right, mate, what happened next then?"" Our language register should match the role that we play.
- use this in stylised drama, or in genres such as pantomime.
- apart from the obvious, this can be useful if you want to reflect Shakespearean times, or to evoke Shakespeare's plays.
- use this if you want to reflect down-to-earth daily life. We might have local words for various objects, for example. However, remember
to use slang in the wrong setting. Using 'OK' instead of 'Yes' in a Victorian drama, for example, would sound very strange!

The speaker describes a vision in a dream of a gas victim 'guttering, choking, drowning'. The listed verbs are associated with a lack of air and death.

has been used for many years in production to perform specific tasks in mass production. The draw back with this method is that computer-controlled machinery replaces workers leading to large-scale redundancies. This has happened in the motor industry.
This sort of machinery is very expensive, so a company will be taking a risk as a product may not be successful. On the other hand, production levels and quality improve, which leads to less wastage and therefore lower costs.
CAD allows designers, engineers and architects to manipulate a 3D image. An image can be altered on-screen so the effects of any changes are seen instantly. This represents a huge saving in time and costs as a prototype need not be built at each stage. Customers can even design their own products and email them to the business. The products can then go straight into production.
The most important application of CAM in production is the use of robots. These can be programmed to copy the physical movements of workers. They are particularly useful for repetitive tasks, or for those dangerous to health, for example, working with poisonous gases or radioactivity. The advantage of robots over humans is that they don't get tired or ill but they do need to be maintained.
Furry Fabrics Ltd is bringing out a new line of synthetic fur hats. They will have a variety of designs, colours and sizes. Which method of production would you advise that they use? Give reasons for your choice of production method.
When you have finished take a look at the sample answer on the next page
I think Furry Fabrics should use Batch production for their new line of products. They do not know how big their market will be, so it would be more sensible to produce their hats in batches. This means they will not make too many unpopular hats that they can't sell.
Paula's answer shows that she understands some of the basics of this topic. She has not explained in any detail why she would choose this method of production, or that she has considered any other methods. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade.
I think Furry Fabrics should use batch production for their new line of products. They are not making something for one customer, so job production is not appropriate. They do not know how big their market will be, so mass production would also be inappropriate. It would therefore be more sensible to produce their hats in batches. This means they will not make too many unpopular hats that they can't sell, and they can produce more of the models that are selling well.
Dean has answered the question quite well, and given good reasons. He has shown that he understands the topic. He could have given more detail, and used more business terms to get a higher grade. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade.
I think Furry Fabrics should use batch production for their new line of products. They are not producing a
good, so job production is not appropriate. They do not know how big their market will be, or what the demand will be for particular designs, colours or sizes, so mass production would also be inappropriate. It would therefore be more sensible to produce their hats in batches, and monitor the sales for each of the models. This means they will reduce wastage and costs, by not making unpopular hats they can't sell. At the same time, they can increase the frequency of the runs on the models that are selling well.
Rose has given an excellent answer. She has shown that she understands the topic well and has given good detailed reasons. She has also shown that she can used business terms like a customised good or batch production correctly. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.

The Government takes about a third of most workers' pay, through income tax and National Insurance contributions. The basic rate of income tax is currently 20% for those earning a salary less than 34,800 a year. Tax cuts are popular, but remember tax pays for school, roads and many other public services.
The amount of money taken from people by the government to spend on public services.
Income tax is taken off an employee's salary. This results in less money to spend in the shops.
VAT is added to goods and services. The standard rate is 17.5%. A rise in VAT increases prices.
This is a tax on company profits. A rise in this tax means companies keep less of their profits leading to less company investment and the possible loss of jobs.
These are payments made by both the employee and the employer which pay for the cost of a state pension and the National Health Service. If this increases a company's costs will be higher and could result in redundancies.

The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas and attitudes and tone.
Compare Kid with one other post-1914 poem and two pre-1914 poems of your choice that are written in the first person. What impression of the speaker do we get?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Duffy's Stealing, Yeats's Song of the Old Mother, and Browning's My Last Duchess.

is when Muslims fight to protect their religion.
When the Prophet Muhammad was asked which people fought in the name of Allah, he said:
""The person who struggles so that Allahs word is supreme is the one serving Allahs cause""
The idea of Jihad is often misunderstood by non-Muslims who then see Islam as not being a pacifist religion.

Your reader will be motivated to read your writing if your characters are interesting and believable. If you imagine how characters

Readers like to 'hear' what characters say to each other. Good written dialogue is the same as taking part in a

Always think carefully about your characters. How do you think they should sound? What kind of language will they use? How will this help your reader understand your main character better? Precise dialogue will convince your readers.
Listen to the way different people speak. Consider what their conversation tells you about their:

Remember that slang and the use of accents or dialect is fine in dialogue, but be sparing. Make sure your readers can still understand what your character says.
You are required to vary your vocabulary to create effect in your coursework. Dialogue is a good way to do this.
Imagine two characters in a local shop. They witness the same event.
A girl wearing a hoodie is accused of stealing a chocolate bar.
She empties her pockets to show the shop owner that he's made a mistake.
The shop owner threatens to call the police anyway.
The girl decides to run out of the shop.

You're marked on your ability to 'engage and sustain the reader's interest'. That means you mustn't allow your reader to get bored or forget about individual characters. Appropriate dialogue will really benefit your writing, making your characters seem real, although don't be tempted to get carried away.
Ask yourself the following questions when you think about and write dialogue:
Will the reader learn something important about the character's feelings or personality?
Will the reader learn something important about another character?
Will the reader learn something important about events in the story?
Will the character's speech prompt something important to happen in the story?
If you can't answer yes to any of the questions, then don't include the piece of dialogue: if it's unnecessary it will only slow down your story.

6642,"If you are studying the higher paper, you will also need to know about tree diagrams, the and/or rule and conditional probabilities.
Tree diagrams allow us to see all the possible outcomes of an event and calculate their probability. Each branch in a tree diagram represents a possible outcome.
, the outcome of one has no effect on the outcome of the other. For example, if we toss two coins, getting heads with the first coin will not affect the probability of getting heads with the second.
A tree diagram which represent a coin being tossed three times looks like this :
From the tree diagram, we can see that there are eight possible outcomes. To find out the probability of a particular outcome, we need to look at all the available paths (set of branches).
The sum of the probabilities for any set of branches is always 1.
Also note that in a tree diagram to find a probability of an outcome we

  P (2 Heads and a Tail) = P (H H T) + P (H T H) + P (T H H)
Bag A contains three red marbles and four blue marbles.
Bag B contains five red marbles and three blue marbles.
A marble is taken from each bag in turn.
Find the missing probabilities for the tree diagram:

What is the probability of getting a bead of each colour?

When two events are said to be
they cannot happen at the same time. For example, if a die is thrown, the events 'obtaining a 6' and 'obtaining a 1' are mutually exclusive, as they cannot happen at the same time.
The events 'obtaining a six' and 'obtaining an even number' are
mutually exclusive, because throwing a six fits into both categories.
When two events, A and B, are

When two events, A and B, are

A bag contains 5 green beads and 4 red beads. A bead is taken from the bag, its colour noted, and it is then replaced. A second bead is then taken from the bag. What is the probability that the two beads are different colours?

rule will make sure you know when to add and when to multiply when calculating probabilities from tree diagrams.
Conditional probability is when the probability of one event depends on a previous event - eg, if items are being picked from a bag in turn, but not replaced.
A bag contains 4 red marbles and 5 green marbles. If we draw 2 marbles from the bag, then the colour of the second marble will be
To work out the probabilities for the
Here are two different sets of probabilities. Each set depends on which colour marble was taken out in the first event.
If the first marble out of the bag is red, the probabilities for the
P (second marble is red, given that the first marble was red) =
P (second marble is green, given that the first marble was red) =
However, if the first marble is green, there are four red and four green marbles left in the bag.
P (second marble is red, given that the first marble was green) =
P (second marble is green, given that the first marble was green) =
. They are best represented on a tree diagram. After each event, the top and bottom numbers of the probability change. In this example, the bottom number will decrease by one each time an event occurs (one marble is removed).
The easiest way to work out conditional probabilities is to draw a tree diagram with the probabilities on each branch.
To find out the total probability of something which has a couple of possible outcomes, remember to add the probabilities together. Multiply along the branches to find each probability, and add together the outcomes.
Remember that the sum of the probabilities for any set of branches should always be 1.
From the tree diagram, we can see that:
P (one marble of each colour) =

Bezoar is a stone that grows in the stomach of a goat found in the Middle East. It was thought to be an antidote to poison (the word is Persian, and means 'counterpoison').
The French surgeon-doctor Par tested this in a crude and cruel scientific experiment. He gave poison to a condemned criminal, followed by bezoar, and then observed what happened:
Some years ago, a gentleman boasted before King Charles that bezoar was an antidote for all poisons ... It was an easy matter to make trial of this claim on those condemned to be hanged [and a criminal] had poison administered to him ...
An hour after, I found him on the ground on his hands and feet like an animal, with his tongue hanging out of his mouth, his eyes wild, vomiting, with blood pouring from his ears, nose and mouth. Eventually he died in great torment, seven hours after I gave him the poison. I opened his body and found the bottom of the stomach black and dry, as if it had been burned, whereby I realised that he had been given sublimate of mercury, whose force the bezoar could not stop. Therefore the king commanded: Burn it!

When we see Juliet in Act 2, Scene 2, it is clear she is totally in love with Romeo. She declares it not knowing he is there, and, despite all the obstacles in their path, only asks him to pronounce his love for her 'faithfully', calling him 'gentle Romeo'. Her trust is complete, just as it is later in the scene when she promises Romeo she will put all her 'fortunes' at his feet and follow him' throughout the world'. Juliet describes her love using conventional similes, so her bounty is 'as boundless as the sea' and her love 'as deep' (as the sea). However, Juliet is also capable of quite astonishing language. The oxymoron of 'sweet sorrow' illustrates perfectly her passion and devotion to Romeo. This is a very different Juliet to the one we meet with her mother and the Nurse...

it started - the underlying factors after the Second World War, ideological differences, Soviet expansion after the war, and American policies that aimed to stop Communism. But who do Historians
Historians have changed their views about who was to blame for the Cold War over the years:
All western writers before the 1970s, and many since, blamed the Cold War on the Soviet Union and its ""attempt to impose its ideology on the rest of the world"".
In 1959 the historian William Appleman Williams was the first to suggest that America was to blame.
The Revisionists said America was engaged in a war to keep countries open to capitalism and American trade.
Revisionists said that Truman's use of the atomic bomb without telling Stalin was the start of the Cold War.
John Lewis Gaddis first published this idea in 1972.
Russia or America was to blame, but that the Cold War was the result of misunderstandings on both sides, and the failure to appreciate each other's fears.
Russian historians such as Zubok and Pleshakov have been able to study the Soviet Union's secret files for the first time.
These files show that Soviet leaders during the Cold War were genuinely trying to avoid conflict with the USA. This puts more of the blame back on America.
Modern historians stress the Cold War as a clash between capitalism and communism.

Forestry is sustainable as long as forests are allowed to replace themselves, or are replanted after felling, but often this is not done. The result is that the worlds forests are steadily shrinking.
This process is called deforestation. It has some important consequences:
soil erosion increases, which causes barren land, flooding and land slides
atmospheric pollution is caused when forests are cleared by burning trees
The term biodiversity refers not only to the number of different species, but also to all the variations within and between species, and all the differences between the habitats and ecosystems that make up the Earths biosphere.
The loss of forests reduces biodiversity and we run the risk of losing organisms that might have been useful in the future - for example as sources of new medicines. There is also a moral responsibility to look after the planet and its resources.

Asteroids can crash into each other. When they do, they can break apart and change orbit.
The orbits of some asteroids cross the Earths orbit. At various times during the Earths history, asteroids have hit it. A tremendous amount of energy was released, throwing up billions of tonnes of dust and hot rocks. Together with smoke from widespread fires, this blocked heat and light from the Sun. It changed the Earths climate, making it very cold.
It is thought that an asteroid colliding with the Earth helped to drive the dinosaurs to extinction. Scientists worry that an asteroid could hit again and cause a global catastrophe. The chances of this happening are very small, but the damage caused by a large asteroid would be huge.

When an atom emits alpha or beta radiation, its nucleus changes. It becomes the nucleus of a different element. This is because the number of protons in the nucleus determines which element the atom belongs to. These are the changes that occur to the number of particles in an unstable nucleus when it emits a radioactive particle:
In each case, a different element is left behind.

Aim to learn your script or develop your drama as completely as possible with around three weeks to spare.
Your teacher will be choosing your group, and may make suggestions about casting.
On the other hand, you and your group may make these decisions.
You will need to work with the group from the start of the work.
You should try to give your ideas as you go along, during the development and rehearsal process.
These things need to be found quickly, so they can be used during rehearsals, if possible. Charity shops are good sources of costume items. Sometimes Art and CDT departments will help you to make props - if you ask nicely! (Letters of appreciation always go down well afterwards, too.)
Why not have props in a named box for each student, so that everyone's responsible for their own things?
Placement of props off-stage before the performance should also be each student's responsibility - and same goes for collection afterwards.
A list in (or on) the box would help you check everything's there.
Lights and sound should be prepared during the development period.
Lighting plans will need to be made, and put onto cue sheets.
Tapes, CDs or mini-disc recordings will be needed for music or sound effects, unless you're working with live music and sound.
Agree who's responsible for the cue sheets or CDs etc, if you don't have a performance support student.
Make sure that everything is kept secure.
Think about using any back-projection of images - or maybe video?
If you're using them, have them ready around half-way through the process, so that they can be fitted into the rehearsals. This gives time to make alterations.
You may just use your normal drama lessons for rehearsals.
If you're keen to do well, perhaps ask your teacher for extra sessions as the exam approaches - perhaps at lunchtimes.
Consider working at the houses of members of the group, perhaps at weekends.
This is an important part of the process. Aim to have
Consider inviting another class to watch, perhaps a group from KS3, who are considering Drama as an option!

Sujata Bhatt: from Search For My Tongue
The poem contains lots of similes and metaphors (imagery), similes is when you use like and metaphors is when you don't use like. I liked the line about spitting it out (tongue) it reminded me of a horror film.
Second sentence: personal response, but needs developing
Treatment of how the poem is written is poor - suggests G/F grade
The whole poem is about tongues really, there are lots of images of tongues. Sujata describes her mother tongue as if it was something growing in her mouth, which gets bigger or smaller. She thinks that if she doesn't speak Indian from day to day it will die away. It's like, use it or lose it. But it never actually disappears because at night the tongue 'blossoms out of my mouth', so it's come to life again.
Gets hold of the importance of this image in the poem
In English, we use the word 'tongue' to mean 'language' as well as your actual 'tongue'. The poet compares knowing two languages to having two tongues in your mouth, which she calls 'the mother tongue' and 'the foreign tongue'. She is afraid that the mother tongue might shrivel away ('rot and die') like a plant with no roots. But in the last part of the poem, the mother tongue seems to grow back during the night, and 'push the other tongue aside'. It's like when she dreams, she dreams in Gujarati, and this keeps the language alive for her. It connects her to her memories. The image of two tongues growing in your mouth is weird, and a bit disturbing. You can imagine how it would feel. But then it 'blossoms' which also suggests something beautiful. I thought this was a memorable image.

Being able to recognise changes in mood and emotion in a script is important as you need to convey this to your audience.
Using these methods, decide how you would express the emotion of anger.
What happens to your face, body and voice when you feel angry? How do you walk when you're in a bad mood? Which gestures do you use to show someone you're angry with them?
Frown, tightly clenched jaw, a tight mouth or even bared teeth.
Tense shoulders, a swift and purposeful walk almost like a march.
Strong and forceful gestures. Perhaps even clenched fists.
Either very loud and out of control or very quiet and menacing.
Maybe if you're very angry you won't pause often, you'll talk very quickly without giving the other person a chance to talk. Or the pauses might be long - a deafening silence!
Now try this with other emotions, eg surprise, excitement, happiness, sadness. See how your body, face and voice change with each emotion.
Another way to practise emotions is to do mood walks - put all the elements together to develop a walk that represents each emotion, then greet (or growl at) people with the appropriate tone of voice.

Ray, the main character in this extract, has stolen a motorbike and caused an accident that killed someone. He has told nobody, but knows that he can't hide for much longer. He is about to get on a bus, but realises that the one person who can link him to the crime is the conductor of that very bus. Before he can run off, he bumps into Mrs Fitzroy, his best friend's mum.
Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. Write one paragraph for each bullet point.
He hung back, groping wildly for some excuse to prevent him getting on, but the bell rang and the engine increased its impatient rumble and his legs carried him upwards on to the platform, and he felt Mrs Fitzroy clamber on behind. The bus began to move. He turned towards the stairs, but she caught hold of his arm.
""Let's go downstairs. I don't like the smoke."" Again he felt her hand guide him, and he ducked his head and began to walk along the aisle. ""Yeah"".
""This'll do,"" she said, and he turned back and sat beside her - the less fuss he made, the less obvious he was, the better. As he settled, he kept his face bent low, aware of the conductor walking towards them. He brushed past, and, noticing things with a total clarity, Ray saw the dark blue uniform that he was wearing and noted the heaviness and thickness of the material. He heard him clumping up the stairs, and he wondered, absurdly, if he was wearing heavy boots, too.
Mrs Fitzroy was opening the bag which she had on her lap, and Ray felt in his pocket for his fare. If he had the right change, he could just hand it to the conductor without looking up. Yes, he had a ten and two pence piece. He glanced at Mrs Fitzroy and saw to his dismay that she was taking out a pound-note from her purse. That would mean a delay while she got her change - plenty of chance for him to be recognised. Could he offer to pay her fare? It would seem strange, but anything was better than being seen.
What kind of atmosphere does the writer create in this extract and how do they do it?
Ray's thoughts and actions as he gets on the bus
how the writer uses language to create the atmosphere.
In this text, the writer creates an atmosphere of fear and tension. Ray's thoughts and actions at the start of the passage show that he is under a lot of pressure. He tries to think of an excuse to 'prevent him getting on' the bus, but knows that this will just make Mrs Fitzroy suspicious. When he tries to go upstairs, she insists they stay downstairs. Nothing seems to be going his way, and this leads us to believe he may well be spotted by the conductor.
As the conductor approaches, Ray's fears increase which creates more tension. He keeps his face 'bent low' to avoid being recognised, and also notices things 'with a total clarity'. This shows that he is very scared and alert, ready for something to go wrong. When he realises Mrs Fitzroy has no change, he feels 'dismay'. The reader is kept on the edge of their seat waiting for the conductor to come along.
The writer uses language, as well as events, to create tension. The phrase 'groping wildly for some excuse' shows Ray's panic and gives the impression that he feels he has no control over events. The way he notices the 'heaviness' of the conductor's uniform, and wonders if he was 'wearing heavy boots as well' might mean that he is afraid of the man. Ray asks himself 'Could he offer to pay her fare?'. This shows he is tense; he is running through possibilities in his mind. The writer uses Ray's fears to create an atmosphere of tension for the reader.

Food chains - Changes to food webs
Let's look at the food web again and ask some questions about its predator-prey relationships, with some possible answers.
What would happen if the grass died?
The grass is the producer, so if it died the consumers that feed on it - rabbits, insects and slugs - would have no food. They would starve and die unless they could move to another habitat. All the other animals in the food web would die too, because their food supplies would have died out. The populations of the consumers would fall as the population of the producer fell.
What would happen if the population of slugs decreased?
Slugs, rabbits and insects all eat grass. If there were fewer slugs there would be more grass for the rabbits and insects. With more food the populations of rabbits and insects would increase. However, the thrushes would have to eat more insects to maintain their population, so it is also possible that the population of insects could decrease. This is turn may reduce the populations of voles and frogs.
What would happen if the population of insects decreased?
There would be more food for the rabbits and slugs, so their populations would increase. However, there would be less food for the frogs and voles, so their populations would decrease. This means less food for the foxes and hawks. However, there are likely to be more rabbits and thrushes for them to eat, so their populations are likely to stay the same.

271,"> Preparing, planning and checking - Punctuation
The most important thing with punctuation is to make sure your sentences are correctly marked at the start and end:
The starts are easy; they should all have capital letters.
The endings have full stops (or the equivalent, such as question marks). However, endings cannot have commas. Commas are only used inside sentences, never right at the end of one.
One quick way to check is to read your work to yourself (it doesn't have to be aloud). If you 'run out of breath' or need to pause in your reading to add emphasis, ask yourself whether a comma or a full stop is needed. If so, put one in.
Other areas which often cause problems are:
If you have included the actual words that somebody speaks, make sure you put them inside speech marks. Remember to close the speech marks as well as open them!
Always use question marks when writing a question whether it is direct or rhetorical. Look out for rhetorical questions in persuasive texts eg ""How long will it be until all our countryside is destroyed?"". Writers use rhetorical questions to emphasise a point and they do not expect the reader to genuinely answer the question.
Be careful when using exclamation marks as overusing them can spoil a text. They should be used only to show excitement, surprise, shock or humour eg ""Stop the car!"" she yelled.
To show when a letter has been missed out:
Remember: ask your teacher for some advice if you feel unsure about any aspect of punctuation.

Decimals - Place value and ordering decimals
We use a decimal point to separate units from parts of a whole (like tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc).
0.1 is a tenth, 1/10 of a unit
0.01 is a hundredth, 1/100 of a unit
0.001 is a thousandth. 1/1000 of a unit
In 52.13, the value of the figure 1 is 1/10 , and the value of the figure 3 is 3/100.
When ordering numbers, always compare the left digits first.
Eg Which is greater, 2.301 or 2.32?
Both numbers have two units and three tenths, but 2.301 has no hundredths, whereas 2.32 has two hundredths. Therefore, 2.32 is greater than 2.301.
Another way to look at it is to add a zero to the end of 2.32 (this doesn't change its value as it's after the decimal point).
The two numbers are now 2.320 and 2.301 and it is quite easy to see that 2.320 is bigger (just as 2 320 is bigger than 2 301).
Q1. In the number 3.546, what is the value of the figure 4?
Q2. Place the following numbers in order, smallest first: 3.2, 3.197, 3.02, 3.19
A1. The value of the figure 4 is 4/100.
A2. Did you get 3.02, 3.19, 3.197, 3.2?
All the numbers have three units, so start by comparing the tenths. 3.02 has no tenths, 3.197 and 3.19 have one tenth, and 3.2 has two tenths. Therefore, 3.02 is the smallest and 3.2 is the largest.
You could also write the numbers as 3.020, 3.190, 3.197 and 3.200 and compare them.

 But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
Be not her maid, since she is envious:
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
 It is my lady!  O, it is my love!
She speaks  yet she says nothing. What of that?
Her eye discourses. I will answer it.
 I am too bold. Tis not to me she speaks.
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night!
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
O speak again, bright angel!  For thou art
As glorious to this night, being oer my head,
As is a wingd messenger of heaven
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name 
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love
And Ill no longer be a Capulet.
(Aside)Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
Whats Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
Whats in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet.
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name 
And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Call me but love, and Ill be new-baptized.
What man art thou, that thus bescreened in night
I know not how to tell thee who I am.
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of thy tongues uttering, yet I know the sound.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
How camst thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb 
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls,
For stony limits cannot hold love out 
And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet
And I am proof against their enmity.
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
I have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes.
And but thou love me, let them find me here.
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogud, wanting of thy love.
By whose direction foundst thou out this place?
By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot, yet wert thou as far
As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Fain would I dwell on form  fain, fain deny
What I have spoke.  But farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay 
And I will take thy word. Yet if thou swearst
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers perjuries
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
Or if thou think I am too quickly won,
Ill frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo  but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light.
But trust me, gentleman, Ill prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheardst, ere I was ware,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discoverd.
Lady, by yonder blessd moon I vow,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops 
O swear not by the moon, th inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract tonight.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden 
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.
This bud of love, by summers ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Th exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it 
And yet I would it were to give again.
Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
But to be frank and give it thee again:
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.

Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow
By one that Ill procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite 
And all my fortunes at thy foot Ill lay,

Sometimes the Moon looks like a full circle. That is called a 'full Moon'. At other times we see a crescent shaped Moon, because we can only see the edge of the part that is lit by the Sun.

Romeo and Juliet first key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Montagues and Capulets have just had a fight in a public place in Verona. Prince Escalus stopped it and warned that if it happens again, those involved will be punished by death.
The first set scene begins with Montague asking Benvolio how the fight began.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
Benvolio tells him that servants from both families were fighting and that when he tried to stop them, Tybalt turned on him.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.
After that, lots of other people joined in until the Prince came and stopped the fighting.
Lady Montague is worried about her son, Romeo. He wasn't involved in the fighting but she wonders where he is. Benvolio explains that he saw him skulking about before dawn. Montague says that this is not unusual behaviour for Romeo: people have seen him crying and sighing on his own before daybreak before.
The audience finds out a lot about Romeo before he even walks onto the stage. What are your first impressions of Romeo?
Montague says he has tried to talk to his son, but he won't open up to him.
Parents and children - You might be able to sympathise with Romeo not wanting to talk about his feelings with his father.
He says he is like a flower that never gets to open because it has been stopped from blossoming by a worm that has eaten into it.
This is a simile to show that no one can get near to Romeo whilst he is in such a bad mood.
When Romeo arrives, Montague and Lady Montague leave Benvolio to try and find out why he is in such a bad mood all of the time.
- Time - There are lots of references to time in this play. The events in this play take place in just less than one week. Romeo and Juliet both feel that time drags whilst they are apart from one another.
Romeo tries to explain that he is in love with a girl who doesn't love him back. He doesn't make himself very clear though and Benvolio has to work hard to get him to tell him about it. Romeo comes up with lots of confusing descriptions of love to try and explain how he feels.
The list of opposites in Romeo's speech ('loving hate', 'heavy lightness', etc) are called oxymorons. They give us an important clue to his character. His confusing speech shows us how confusing the world is to him as a young man. It also shows us that Romeo likes to play with language.
""Here's much to do with hate, but more with love""
- Love and Hate - Romeo is commenting on the street brawl that has just happened: it's about hating an opposing family and feeling love and loyalty towards their own. Taken on its own, the line sums up the play as a whole: it's about two families that hate each other, but more about the love between Romeo and Juliet.
Romeo speaks in rhyme to try to describe how he feels.
Romeo's speeches are often in rhyme. He also likes wordplay, metaphors and similes. Romeo loves to talk about love, but does he really know what love is at this point? You could say that Romeo, at this point is 'all talk and no action'.
He says that love is like smoke made from the hot breath of lovers and that the flames are the sparks in their eyes. But if it doesn't work out, love is a sea of tears. He also describes love as a kind of madness and a poison.
- Love - The language that Romeo uses to describe love gives us an idea of what Romeo believes love to be at this point. For him it's about desire, which sounds like lust rather than true love.
Benvolio brings Romeo back to earth with a straightforward question: who is the girl he is in love with?
Whilst Romeo is pouring his heart out, Benvolio's responses could be performed in a number of ways- sympathetic, impatient, humorous. All three work.
Romeo still won't give him a straight answer though.
Romeo and Benvolio are good friends. We can see this through the way they banter with one another.
He tells Benvolio that the girl is very beautiful but she doesn't want to fall in love. It seems that she is very pure and Romeo says that because she isn't interested in men, her beauty will be wasted!
- Love - We never meet Rosaline in the play and only have Romeo's description of her to go by. It's hard to tell whether she really is a very good girl or whether she simply doesn't fancy Romeo!
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste
Benvolio says that the best thing to do is to forget her. He advises Romeo to look at other attractive girls. Romeo swears that he can never forget her; he'll never find anyone as beautiful as her. Benvolio bets that he will.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.

Atmosphere and setting - PEE and useful phrases
As well as having lots of ideas, you need to explain them clearly. An effective way of doing this is to PEE. PEE stands for:
Read through the following extract. How does the writer create an atmosphere of cold and loneliness?
Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness - a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.
The extract describes a cold, empty landscape.
The text states that the trees have been ""stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost"".
The land is described as ""desolate"" and it contains ""a laughter more terrible than any sadness"".
This suggests that the place is completely isolated.
The fact that it seems to be full of terrible laughter suggests it is a very cruel area, which would be hard to explore.
If you are going to use quotations from the extract in your answer, remember to set them out properly. Here are some points to remember:
Quotes of three words or less can be used in the sentence you're writing - for example ...when the writer talks about the ""futility of life"" he means...
Longer quotations need to be included on a line of their own and with a space before it (known as an indent) - for example ...the writer describes the landscape as a ""desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold"" he creates a picture that...
Short, well-chosen quotations are better than long, vague ones.
Also remember that certain words and phrases are especially helpful when you're explaining an idea in detail. They can be particularly helpful if you are commenting on implicit meaning. The following wordbank shows you some of those phrases, and you might be able to add some more:
Some other words and phrases that may be useful are those that help move your argument on. These are called connectives. Here are some examples:

It's often useful to be able to find a percentage of a quantity. For example, you might be told that bus fares are going up by 5% and you need to know how much more you will need each week.
Here are a couple of ways you could do it:
Find 1% of the quantity by dividing it by 100.
Find x% of a quantity by multiplying 1% of the quantity by x.
Rakesh has a box containing 60 pens. 20% of the pens are red. How many is that?
You need to find 20% of 60.
1% of 60 is 60  100 = 0.6
So 20% of 60 is 0.6  20 = 12
Find x% of a quantity by multiplying that quantity by x/100

Before this scene, Prospero and his slave, Caliban have exchanged cross words.
The First Key Extract begins with Ferdinand hearing Ariel's song.
Ariel's song calms the stormy waters. In 'The Tempest', music is linked closely to magic and illusion.
He wonders where the sounds are coming from.
Illusion - Ferdinand does not know where the sound is coming from. He assumes that it is magic and tells us that the music not only calmed the storm, but also made him feel better.
He follows the sound, and when the song begins again, it suggests to Ferdinand that his father has drowned.
When Miranda sees Ferdinand approaching, she can't believe her eyes. She doesn't think that Ferdinand is real.
Illusion - Ferdinand is a living human being, but Miranda is convinced that he is a magical creature. In 'The Tempest', things are never quite as they at first seem.
Prospero explains that he is a man, not a spirit and that he is looking for other survivors of the shipwreck. Prospero feels excited that Miranda and Ferdinand seem to like each other: it was his plan all along
Power - Prospero claims that he has used magic to make Miranda and Ferdinand fall in love. Prospero likes to control and manipulate people through his magic.
, and he promises to reward Ariel with his freedom for helping to get them together.
Ferdinand asks Miranda if she is an ordinary girl or a goddess.
Miranda can't believe that Ferdinand is an ordinary mortal. She thinks he's a 'spirit'. She calls him 'divine' and 'noble'. Ferdinand refers to her as a 'goddess'. The language they use suggests that they worship one another.
He is shocked when she speaks his language. When he hints that he is the King of Naples, Prospero challenges him.
Prospero likes to be in control. As soon as Ferdinand suggests that he has any sort of power, Prospero tries to undermine him. Prospero's questions are sarcastic and mocking in his attempt to show Ferdinand who is boss.
Ferdinand sadly explains that he believes that his father, the King of Naples, has drowned in the shipwreck along with the Duke of Milan and his son. Prospero watches Ferdinand and thinks to himself that he will be able to manipulate him easily now that Ferdinand is in love with his daughter.
Think carefully about what kind of man Prospero is. Is he a caring father who will do anything to get the best for his daughter? Is he manipulative and controlling? Love is a powerful emotion. Should people use love to control others?
Miranda can't understand why her father is being so abrupt with Ferdinand. She has fallen in love at first sight with Ferdinand.
Love - Miranda admits that she has feelings for Ferdinand. It is the first time she has ever felt this way. Do you think that she would have fallen in love with Ferdinand even without Prospero's magic?
She wishes that her father could see things from her point of view.
When Ferdinand offers to make Miranda his queen, Prospero steps in. He is worried that his plan won't work if Ferdinand wins Miranda's heart too easily.
Prospero says: 'But this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning/Make the prize light'. He means that he can't let Ferdinand think that it was too easy to get Miranda to be his girlfriend, because he might not treat her well if it's really easy to make her love him.
He says that Ferdinand is lying about being a king and accuses him of being a spy.
Power/ Illusion - Prospero wants to manipulate Ferdinand. He will make him suffer and work hard for Miranda's love. When Ferdinand claims to have some power of his own as the heir to the throne, Prospero takes this power away by accusing him of being a spy and taking him prisoner. Prospero knows that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne. 'The Tempest' is all about the confusion between what is true and real, and what is illusion.
Miranda tries to speak up for him
You might think that Miranda is brave to speak up for Ferdinand. Apart from being a powerful magician, Prospero has quite a temper! Her speech also shows us how innocent she is. She can't believe that anyone who looks so lovely on the outside can be anything other than lovely on the inside. In 'The Tempest', Shakespeare shows us that things are not always as they first seem.
but Prospero tells her off and threatens to imprison Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Ferdinand a 'traitor'. He threatens to 'manacle' his neck and give him sea water to drink and acorn shells to eat. Prospero doesn't mean any of these threats, but in making them he shows that he has power over Ferdinand and could make him a slave just as he made Caliban his slave. Throughout the extract, Prospero uses words like 'usurp', 'traitor' and 'impostor' which all seem a bit strong when referring to Ferdinand. When Antonio took Prospero's place as Duke of Milan, he did 'usurp' him, and in doing so, he was a 'traitor' and in calling himself the Duke of Milan, Antonio is an 'imposter'.
When Ferdinand draws his sword, Prospero uses magic to make it impossible for Ferdinand to move.
Miranda tries desperately to stop her father but he won't listen. Ferdinand comes to the conclusion that all his problems - his father's death, the shipwreck, Prospero's threats - mean nothing, as long as he can see Miranda once a day, even if he is in prison.
Love/ Illusion - Ferdinand suddenly doesn't mind being Prospero's prisoner, as long as he has Miranda to love. He says it's all like a 'dream'. Does love have that kind of dream-like power to overcome difficulties? Or is it another one of Prospero's spells?
Prospero is pleased that his plan to make Ferdinand fall in love with Miranda has worked. He praises Ariel
Love/ Illusion - When Prospero tells Ariel that he has done well, this suggests that Miranda and Ferdinand's attraction towards one another is not true love, but a magic trick, an illusion, that Ariel has conjured.
Prospero promises Ariel that he will be free
Freedom and Slavery - Just as Prospero has made Caliban a slave and threatened to imprison Ferdinand, he has the power to set Ariel free. When Prospero arrived on the island, Ariel was trapped in a pine tree and Prospero set him free, so he has a debt of gratitude towards him. Also, Ariel is gentle whereas Prospero has a temper. It could be that Ariel is a little afraid of his master.

The different substances in mixtures are usually easily separated from one another. The method you use depends upon the type of mixture you have.
This is good for separating dissolved substances that have different colours, such as inks and plant dyes. It works because some of the coloured substances dissolve in the liquid better than others, so they travel further up the paper.
from a liquid. (An insoluble substance is one that does not dissolve).
Sand, for example, can be separated from a mixture of sand and water using filtration. That's because sand does not dissolve in water.
from a liquid (a soluble substance does dissolve, to form a solution).
For example copper sulfate crystals can be separated from copper sulfate solution using evaporation. Remember that it is the water that evaporates away, not the solution.
from a solution. For example, water can be separated from salty water by simple distillation. This method works because the water evaporates from the solution, but is then cooled and condensed into a separate container. The salt does not evaporate and so it stays behind.

Here is the opening paragraph of a text about boxing:
Boxing, amongst other hand-to-hand fighting, has been with us for thousands of years. Originally it was nothing more than bare fist fighting between two willing, and sometimes unwilling, competitors for the entertainment of others. Some people argue that it is a relatively safe, disciplined, highly skilled and technical sport that brings enjoyment and employment to a great many people. Others claim that it is a dangerous and barbaric spectacle that has no place in the civilised world. This article will explore each side's claim in more detail.
Why is this an effective opening for the text?
It is totally in keeping with the title.
It uses a formal, impersonal tone, which is appropriate for an argument text.
It gives a summary of both sides of the argument.
Let's consider some alternative beginnings and see if they are suitable. Decide what you think of each one and then read our comments below.
This article will talk about the damage that can be inflicted when two men stand face-to-face with the sole intention of knocking each other out with their fists. It will go on to argue that boxing, or legitimate assault, has no place in the twenty first century.
This extract certainly gets straight to the point. Although this beginning is quite formal, it is certainly not impersonal as the writer lets the reader know exactly what they think about boxing. The reader can be sure about what the answer to the question in the title will be from the first sentence.
The bell goes and the two warriors approach each other. They are quick. They are strong. They are hard. They are ready to hurt and be hurt.
A left fist launches and connects with a nose. The crowd are on their feet. Cheering. Wanting more. Wanting blood.

Clover is a plant and it is the producer in this food chain. Its bar goes at the bottom of the pyramid:
Energy is lost to the surroundings as we go from one level to the next, so there are fewer organisms at each level in this food chain. A lot of clover is needed to support the snail population. A thrush eats lots of snails, and a hawk eats lots of thrushes, so the population of hawks is very small.

He tried to reach up and tear the band away, but there were sharp bands round his wrists as well. He tried to move his feet, but there were more cold, sharp bands around his ankles.
Westall refers to the bands around Ralph's body four times. This isn't because he couldn't think of another phrase. He is emphasising how tightly Ralph is trapped to create a sense of fear and tension. He also allows us to build up a picture gradually, just like Ralph does as he is regaining consciousness. Bit by bit, both Ralph and the reader realise that every part of him is tied up - there is no chance of escape.

Solids cannot flow because their particles are only able to vibrate and cannot move from place to place.
Liquids can flow because their particles can move over each other. When water is poured into a glass, the particles of water move over each other and into the corners of the glass. The particles keep on moving over each other as the water takes the shape of the glass. The animation shows how this works.

Gases can flow because their particles can move in all directions. When a Bunsen burner is connected to a gas tap and turned on, natural gas flows through the rubber tubing. The particles of natural gas are free to move anywhere inside the tubing, and pressure forces them through the tubing into the Bunsen burner.

Diet, drugs and health - Digestion and enzymes
Our teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. Enzymes are needed so that this break-down happens quickly enough to be useful.
Take care - enzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients:
. Carbohydrase enzymes break down starch into sugars.
The saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough, the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet.
. Protease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. Digestion of proteins in the stomach is helped by

Try to convince us to do or agree with something, such as spending money or agreeing with a certain belief.

Often use a personal style so that the text seems to speak directly to the reader.
Show clear links between points, such as ""if you donate 20 you will be helping a sick animal"" or ""using our deodorant will attract women"".
Stories can also be persuasive as well. A writer may want you to like or dislike a character. The way that they describe a character can persuade you to do either of these. Look at this extract from 'Jane Eyre':
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at the table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye with flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mamma had taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate health'.
How does Charlotte Bront try to persuade, or convince, us that John Reed is an unpleasant character in this paragraph?
She makes him sound unattractive, with his ""dingy and unwholesome skin"" and ""heavy limbs"".
She suggests that he is greedy as he ""gorged himself habitually at the table"". She suggests that this is why he is so unhealthy, so that we don't feel sorry for him.
She makes him sound spoilt because his mother is keeping him home from school, even though his so-called ""delicate health"" is his own fault.

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
When you are persuading people, you usually use a different style. You don't need to show both sides - all you have to do is present your ideas. For instance, imagine you had to persuade people to buy a certain toothpaste. You could write about the great taste, or how clean your teeth feel or how white they are. It doesn't really matter what you find to write about as long as you get them to buy it.
But you wouldn't write about other makes of toothpaste. You don't persuade like this, because it sounds like you aren't sure. So the first thing to remember is:
- if you are writing about how great chips are, keep repeating the idea. Convince yourself how good they are - they might even be a healthy option, because lots of doctors are bound to like them and chips wouldn't be so popular if they weren't really great, would they? Once you have convinced yourself, it's much easier to convince others. So next you need to remember to...
- it's always better to hear how good your idea is rather than how bad other people's are. So write about the things that show your ideas in the best light. For instance, aren't chips just great for a quick snack? Why were chips voted the most popular option in our school at lunchtime? And finally don't be frightened to...
- If you don't seem too sure, or if you can't make your ideas stand out, then you aren't really persuading as much as you can. And if that is the case, you need The Persuaders' Toolkit.
- don't worry about saying the same thing again and again - people forget, so repeat yourself and they will remember. Even when you think they might remember, you can always repeat yourself another time.
- using words such as ""we"" or ""I"" always sounds a lot more convincing. We all know that, don't we?
- why would you use questions? Well, they make people think. They also get your readers involved in what you are writing. So will you use them when you persuade? If not, why not?
- words are your ammunition. In seconds, they can make your friends laugh, or your teacher angry, so why not use them properly to persuade your readers?
For instance, don't just write ""the pressure of doing school work"", because there is no real feeling there. Instead, how about: ""the endless trauma, the desperation and the mindless suffering that school work inflicts on students"".

Notice how we say 'stays red'. This is better than saying 'nothing' or 'stayed the same', because it tells us the colour we actually see.
Universal indicator is a mixture of several different indicators. Unlike litmus, universal indicator can show us
how strongly acidic or alkaline a solution is. This is measured using the pH scale. The pH scale runs from pH 0 to pH 14.
Universal indicator has many different colour changes, from red for strong acids to dark purple for strong bases. In the middle, neutral pH 7 is indicated by green.
Universal indicator shows how acidic or alkaline a solution is
These are the important points about the pH scale:
acidic solutions have pH values less than 7
alkaline solutions have pH values more than 7

Weathering and erosion are often confused, so be careful when answering questions about them.

For example, a basalt cliff may be weathered by freeze-thaw, a type of physical weathering. This means that pieces of the cliff may break away.
Erosion happens when these pieces of rock fall away down the cliff.
In the photograph you can see a basalt cliff. At the bottom there are heaps of rocks, caused by weathering then erosion.
Rivers and streams can move pieces of rock. This is called

As the pieces of rock are carried along by the water, they bash against each other and the river bed. They gradually wear away because of this. They become smaller and more rounded.

It can be observed and measured, and experiments can be designed to test how it works.
Human behaviour is affected by many variables. It can be more difficult to study than the behaviour of other animals.
Fieldwork does not always mean you have to work in a field. It means investigations that take place outside the laboratory.
Some scientists spend many hours watching and studying the behaviour of animals. They may be interested in how the animals live alone, group into families or form large groups such as herds.
Scientists can tag sharks to study their behaviour.
Animals can signal to each other. For example, they may call to each other to warn of danger. Some scientists are interested in such signals. They record and study them to try to work out what the signals mean.
Some animals migrate over large distances to find food or nesting sites.
Animals can be tagged by attaching tracking devices to them. Tagging lets scientists follow the journeys the animals make.
The work of Lorentz and Pavlov has been mentioned in this Revision Bite. These scientists studied animal behaviour under controlled conditions.
The behaviour of woodlice is often studied in schools. Several woodlice are put into a choice chamber with four different conditions:
The woodlice are left on their own for a while, and then the number of animals in each quarter is counted. Woodlice prefer dark and damp conditions. The quarter of the choice chamber with these conditions contains most or all of the woodlice.

Imagine giving some advice to a friend who is being bullied. You'd probably think of a few ideas very quickly:
You could improve your work by adding other types of sentences. At the moment, it's just a list of orders. What about adding a question or two? Like this:
Why don't you talk to someone at school about it?
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now?
This pushes your friend to think about something. It also gives them the opportunity to start talking about it.
Then you could add a statement or two, like this:
Bullying is more common than many people think.
The worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone.
If we combine these ideas and sentences, we have an interesting and varied piece of writing. All we need to add are some connectives, like 'and', 'but', 'so' or 'because'. Now we have writing that makes a real impact and which can offer advice as well as persuading people, like this:
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now? Why don't you talk to someone at school about it? Because bullying is far more common than many people think.

Explain = What? When? Who? Where? How? Why?
This difference is reflected in the question you will be asked, so our question about the leaflet might look a little different now:
Write a leaflet for both the pupils and their parents, outlining some of the main features of school life in Year 7 and beyond. In particular, explain why pupils have several teachers each day and why the detention system is used.
This is a little harder than the earlier version, but it's still about your school. Therefore, you still need lots of information about the classes, the organisation and the timetable. So you could still use our two basic approaches, timelines and topic centres, like this:
However, you can also put these together, like this:
Now, we can see a number of topics, so perhaps the three big circles represent registration, lesson times and detentions. They occur in that order each day, but the reasons for them are very different. So the smaller circles answer how and why as well as what, when and who. For instance, what are detentions? When do they take place? Who is in charge of them? How do pupils get put in detention? Why does the school use detentions?
This approach gives your answer a very clear structure. The writing deals with a number of subjects in turn and each subject should be in its own paragraph. You can add details and explanations as you write out each paragraph. It makes it easier for you to write and easier for your audience to read or listen to.

When you describe, you need to give lots of detail and make the words interesting for others to read. For example, if you wanted to describe your home, you wouldn't just write lots of facts, like this:
My house was built in 1972 of red brick with a pitched concrete tiled roof. The house was extended in 2003 with a small UPVC conservatory and an adjoining patio area of approximately 8 square metres...
This gives lots of facts, but these are the types of facts that someone buying a house might need. Most people would find a description like this boring. So what should you do?
The first thing is to think about what you want to show other people. Do you want to concentrate on the roof tiles or the types of bricks used? Or do you want to tell them about the fence panel your brother broke when he was chasing you last summer?
You could also write about the time Stephanie threw a tennis ball and it got stuck in the guttering - it's still there - and when it rains really hard the gutter overflows. You might even have a gnome in the front garden, which your grandad bought - it looks stupid, but you won't move it in case you offend him.
Each of these details is far more interesting than roof tiles or measurements. So, when you are describing something, think of drawing a picture or taking a photograph. You focus on a certain point, write a paragraph about it, then move to the next point and the next.

Juliet says that she will do what the Nurse suggests, but when she leaves the room, Juliet says to herself that the Nurse is two-faced. She decides to see if Friar Lawrence will help her. If not, she thinks she will have to commit suicide.
Paris goes to visit Friar Lawrence to arrange his wedding to Juliet. The Friar tries to stall for more time. When Juliet arrives, she gives Paris 'the cold shoulder' until he leaves. She begs the Friar to help her, threatening to kill herself. The Friar has a plan if Juliet has the guts to carry it through. He knows of a drug that will make her seem as though she is dead for forty-two hours. This will mean that she will be put in the family tomb along with Tybalt. Then the Friar will let Romeo know the truth, so that he can come and take her away when she wakes up and they can go off together to Mantua. Juliet isn't scared. She takes the drug home with her.

What sort of atmosphere is Wells trying to create and how does he use figurative language to do this?
The writer is trying to create an atmosphere of fear and tension in the extract. He describes the passage as being ""draughty"" and mentions that it is underground. This makes it seem creepy and ghostly. The fact that the character only has a candle to light his way makes the story seem old-fashioned, and also creates drama because we know that the draught could blow it out! The way the echoes ""rang up and down"" and the fact that the man stops because he thinks he hears a sound, adds to the ghostly effects.
The shadows also help to create a sinister atmosphere as they flicker around and make it even harder for the man to see what's ahead. The writer uses figurative language such as personification to describe them. He says that they ""cower and quiver"", come ""sweeping up"" and that they ""fled"". All of this makes them sound alive, or perhaps like ghosts. The words used are all linked with fear, so that even the shadows seem to be afraid of what's in the corridor. This is very eerie and helps to create a very tense atmosphere.

The action moves to an island near where the ship is in trouble. Prospero, a magician, and his daughter Miranda, are living on the island with two others.
One is Ariel (a sprite, or elf-like character) - who'd once been kept in a tree by an evil witch, Sycorax. Prospero had released him from the tree with his magic.
The other is Caliban (big and nasty, the son of Sycorax) - who Prospero had been kind to. Both Ariel and Caliban are Prospero's servants.
Prospero, we now learn, had caused the storm on purpose. It was because of something that had happened long ago, as he tells Miranda ...
Twelve years earlier, he says, Prospero was the much loved Duke of Milan, a great city in Italy. Miranda was a young princess.
Prospero was always reading. This meant that his brother Antonio (who is on the ship in the storm) had so much power that he wanted more, and plotted against Prospero, with the help of the King, Alonso.
One night, Prospero tells Miranda, he and Miranda were seized, and sent out to sea alone in an open boat. They were lucky to survive, although Prospero's magic books were on the boat. Finally they came ashore on the island where they now live.
When his story is over, Prospero makes Miranda sleep before calling for Ariel, to find out how the plans he has made for the ship in the storm are going.

447,"The extract comes from a book called 'Face' by Benjamin Zephaniah. Natalie is a Year 9 student and lives in East London. She is out with her boyfriend and his friends. They have stopped to chat with some boys from school. Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. You can use the bullet points to help you.
After a couple of minutes she realised that her every move was being watched by a group of three girls and she couldn't help noticing how tough they looked. All three were wearing dark blue baggy jeans. She was pretty sure they were Londoners born and bred but thought they could find a job working for the Jamaican tourist board, not simply because of their dark skin but also because of their clothing. One had a T-shirt saying 'I love Jamaica'. Another wore a T-shirt that was a Jamaican flag and the third just had a West Ham football shirt on, but she, like the others, was adorned with yellow, black and green bangles, badges and necklaces. Natalie thought they looked good, but dangerous.
Natalie shifted nervously. She didn't know quite where to look but she had to put on a front. The other three girls made no attempt to hide the fact that they were on Natalie's case. They began to whisper to each other and smile as they stared at her. Natalie felt illuminated in her green satins and began to wish she had chosen clothes which weren't so loud. What are they grinning at? she wondered. Is it my clothes? My shoes? My hair? Do I look too innocent? Suddenly the three girls began to walk toward Natalie. Her heart began to race, the palms of her hands began to sweat. She felt like falling apart but she held herself together.
'You from round here, den?' said the big girl wearing the Jamaican flag.
'Yeah, I wanid to go there but they wouldn't let me, said I had ta go ta Lonsdale Park, said it was nearer. What ya doing here?'
The other two girls continued to look her up and down. Natalie expected trouble and in her mind she cursed the boys for bringing her there and for the way they had got lost in their silly conversation about football and cars.
'I'm just hanging around with my boyfriend and his mates.'
At this point the girl wearing the West Ham shirt reached into her back pocket. Natalie swallowed hard as the girl pulled out a couple of leaflets. After separating one from the other she handed one to Natalie. 'Dat's the place to be, check it out, good vibes, good music. Ya like rap?'
Natalie wanted to kick herself. She had completely misread the situation. They weren't out for a fight, they wanted to find out if she liked clubbing. They wanted to find out if she was one of them, an Eastender.
'Yeah,' Natalie replied, feeling a sense of relief. 'Yeah, rap's cool...' She began to wonder if she sometimes looked threatening and if she herself had been misjudged in the past. For people to be friendly, did they have to have permanent smiles on their faces?
How does the writer show Natalie's thoughts and feelings changing during the extract?
her first reactions to the girls she sees
the way she acts just before, and when, they speak to her
her thoughts at the end of the passage.
Just before the girls speak to her, Natalie seems even more anxious. She is used to being out on the streets of London and feels she needs to 'put on a front' and look tough. She is afraid they may be laughing at her clothes or hair, which makes her seem insecure about herself. However, when the girls come up to speak to her she hides her nerves and answers their questions. The way she uses short answers like 'Yeah' suggests she does not want to give too much away about herself or get into a fight.
When she realises the girls are actually being friendly and want to give her a flyer for a club, Natalie's feelings change completely. She is ashamed of being suspicious and feels like 'kicking herself'. She realises the girls are Eastenders just like her. The writer shows how this makes her think about her own image. She wonders if people think she looks threatening, too. At this point she comes across as an intelligent, thoughtful girl who wants to learn how to judge people fairly in the future.

a) The house was built in 1975. It was a typical semi-detached, but it did have quite an impressive front door. Most of the windows were double glazed and the garden was quite neat.
b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.
There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.
So you need to think about TAP (text, audience and purpose) and make a good start to your writing. You should try to 'set a context', which is like setting the scene. So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on.
a) The subject I am going to write about today is why the local park should not be closed.
b) Have you ever stopped to wonder how many hundreds of people make regular use of our Memorial Park?
a) It is unlikely that newspaper readers who enjoy all the things that our park has to offer will want it to disappear forever under tons of concrete.
b) 'Ashfield Park will be ruined,' claim protestors who held a meeting last night to organise opposition to the council's plans for a car park.
It should be clear that the ""b"" versions are better - they fit the style and show that the writer has used TAP to make their writing work. Remember - you need to make it interesting right from the start.

Some variation within a species is inherited, and some variation is due to the environment.
Variation in a characteristic that is a result of genetic inheritance from the parents is called
Children usually look a little like their father, and a little like their mother, but they will not be identical to either of their parents. This is because they get half of their inherited features from each parent.
Each egg cell and each sperm cell contains half of the
needed for an individual. When these join at fertilisation a new cell is formed with all the genetic information needed for an individual.
Here are some examples of inherited variation in humans:
Gender is inherited variation too, because whether you are male or female is a result of the genes you inherited from your parents.
Characteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle. For example, if you eat too much you will become heavier, and if you eat too little you will become lighter. A plant in the shade of a big tree will will grow taller as it tries to reach more light.
Variation caused by the surroundings is called
. Here are some other examples of features that show environmental variation:
flower colour in hydrangeas - these plants produce blue flowers in acidic soil and pink flowers in alkaline soil.
Some features vary because of a mixture of inherited causes and environmental causes. For example, identical twins inherit exactly the same features from their parents. But if you take a pair of twins, and twin 'A' is given more to eat than twin 'B', twin 'A' is likely to end up heavier.

Making eye contact with the person that is talking to them
Using facial expressions to show that they understand or are reacting to what is said
Allowing the person who is speaking finish before they respond
Repeating, in their own words, what the person has said to show that they understand
Referring back to comments that have already been made

We'd better be quiet. We're annoying her.
Choose the statement that is most true:
Emily is the best listener, because she says the least and she's just trying to get on with her work

473,"Writing the speech is only half the task - the next part is presenting it.
The idea of presenting a speech might make you nervous but some people make speeches every day as part of their jobs. Think about your teachers - they regularly stand up before you and present to the class.
You might notice that some teachers are more interesting to listen to than others. It is not necessarily what they say that keeps you interested, but often how they say it. What do your teachers do to keep your attention? Make a list then compare it with the tips below.
Your listeners will switch off if they can't hear you. Use a loud and clear voice, and if you're unsure if your audience can hear you at the back - just ask ""Can you hear me at the back?""
If you speak too quickly, you won't be clear. If you speak too slowly, your audience is likely to go to sleep. Vary your pace for effect and use dramatic pauses where appropriate.
If you speak like a robot, in the same boring tone, your audience will quickly drift off. Speak naturally and use the pitch of your voice to show your emotions.
You don't have to gurn at your audience! But if you don't look like you're interested in what you have to say, your audience won't be either.
Again, keep it natural, but if you stand like a statue, you won't be very interesting to watch or listen to. On the other hand, too much arm flapping and leg hopping will distract your audience from the point you're trying to make.
Use them, but use them effectively. They need to be big enough to see, interesting to look at and relevant to what you are talking about. Don't be tempted to make a big poster to hide behind!
Choose words that are interesting, descriptive and appropriate to your audience. Don't baffle your audience with jargon or slang or lots of big words that are too difficult for anyone else to understand.
If it's appropriate to your audience and task, try to use Standard English. You don't have to be too formal or put on a silly accent, just speak in a way that is easy for everyone to understand.
Most people feel nervous about speaking formally in front of other people. Here are some tips to help you conquer your nerves:
Write your speech out in full and read it several times - this will help you gain confidence in the content.
Prepare small cards with key points of your speech. By now you should be familiar with your speech so these points will help you keep to your structure. Avoid the temptation to read your speech in full - the idea is to test your speaking skills, not your reading skills!
Practice your performance before the real thing. Try practicing at home on your own, and then in front of family or friends. If you have visual aids, be sure to practice using them.
On the day, take a deep breath, smile and try to enjoy it.
Improve your public speaking and maybe you'll be TV Presenter one day. But it's not all bad!

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - Language
Think about how language is used in the two Key Extracts - for example, where it seems the same in both, and where it seems different.
When Montague talks about how Romeo is in a bad mood and avoiding sunlight, he uses lots of imagery to do with darkness.
When Romeo describes Juliet he uses lots of words and imagery to do with light. Even the night imagery involves brightness with stars and the moon.
The metaphors and similes used by the characters in the first extract (especially Romeo) are quite complicated. Benvolio and Romeo enjoy using puns to make jokes together. Language is used in clever ways.
Romeo still uses language skillfully, but Juliet wants honesty rather than clever poetry. When Romeo starts to swear by the moon, she won't let him finish his clever metaphor. Juliet uses imagery to make her thoughts clear, eg Romeo is like a rose; Juliet's love is as deep as the sea.
Much of the first extract is in rhyme. In the scene between Romeo and Benvolio, this helps to bring out the humour in their banter.
Romeo and Juliet both speak in blank verse: they are talking about love in a much more sensitive way than Romeo did when he was talking to Benvolio. Juliet's final line in the scene finishes Romeo's to make one line of blank verse. (Blank verse is unrhymed and has lines that have 10 syllables each). This shows how close they have become.
If you get a question about language in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with your answer:
How is love described in the two extracts?
Love is described in many different ways in the two extracts. By the second extract, love is described in a more positive light.
In the first extract, Romeo uses oxymorons because he is confused about his feelings for Rosaline. Romeo compares love to poison and madness.
In the second extract, Romeo uses words to do with light and heaven when describing his feelings for Juliet. Juliet talks about love in terms of truth and promises.
In the first extract, love means many different things to Romeo. Love is confusing to Romeo and seems to have a dark side that he has no control over. Love is ruining his life. By the end of the first extract, you might think that Romeo has confused his feelings of lust for love. In the second extract, love is related to light and heaven for Romeo. Perhaps when he meets Juliet, he realizes what true love is. For Juliet, love is about truth and honesty. She is almost overwhelmed by her feelings for Romeo. For both characters, love is a powerful and wonderful force.

You can solve simultaneous equations by adding or subtracting the two equations from each other.
Add the two equations together and you will find that the y disappears:
3x + 2x + y - y = 9 + 1
6 - 5 = 1 (which is correct)
To make the 3x's disappear we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
3x - 3x + 2y - (-y) = 8 - 5
6 - 1 = 5 (which is correct)
So the solution is x = 2, y = 1

499,"> Drama - Drama from your imagination
Taking part in drama doesn't always involve learning lines from scripts - often you'll be asked to improvise. Usually you will work in groups or pairs to devise a piece of drama from your own imagination. You'll need to be able to think on your feet and become a different character.
This might sound difficult, but you've probably improvised before without realising it - in games you used to play as a child. If you've ever played pirates, nurses or superheroes when you were younger, you were improvising - although don't think running around your classroom with a tablecloth for a cape pretending to be Superman will impress your drama teacher - it probably won't!
As with any English work, you need to think about your audience when you devise drama. Your drama needs to entertain them and keep their attention. Your drama also needs to be believable - your audience is likely to become disconnected if your story or characters are too far fetched.
The story of your drama begins with your character. Ask yourself: what does my character feel, think and react?
Here are two ideas for a character:
You are a journalist who has uncovered a story that will have big consequences and you're about to tell the world. Would your character be confident or scared?
You are a global superstar - singer, actor and producer - and paparazzi follow your every move. You live a glamorous and privileged life, but what are the secrets behind the smiles?
When you have decided on your character, you need to create a scene.
Here are some ideas for a scene based on the characters above. Can you think of any more?
You're about to appear on the most popular morning TV programme and expose your discovery when you suddenly receive a startling phone call. Who is on the phone? What do they say? How do they make you feel?
You've landed a part in a popular soap but you don't get on with the other actors. Should you tell the press the truth or pretend that you all get along?
You've been working late in the library just double checking a few facts for your article when you notice a menacing looking man watching you. Does your character panic or keep calm? Do they run or confront the man? Maybe they are being paranoid?
The press have published some false rumours about you and you're really upset. Your agent has secured a slot on a popular chat show to give your side of the story. Do you accept the offer or decide to lie low? How do you feel?
Your article has been published and has been a massive hit. You're receiving job offers from high profile newspapers and magazines and your life is about to change for the better. How do your family react? What do you decide to do?
You've found out that one of the other band members is planning to leave the group and go solo. You confront them - can you persuade them to stay, or would it be better for everyone if they left?
When you have a rough idea of your character and scene, you can think about what your character might say. If you're given time to prepare you should write a short script. If working in pairs or a group, you could improvise the scene first to get more ideas.
You may be allowed to use props to make your scene more realistic and interesting. Only use a prop if it is relevant, otherwise it could end up distracting you and your audience. If you decide to use props and costumes, always practice with them first.

If you were to compare the scores in the two subjects, English and Maths, which measure of average would you use and why?
The range of scores in English (37) is far greater than that in the Maths (4).
The mean score in each subject is 78 which implies that the scores of the students are more-or-less identical in English and Maths. But looking at the actual scores, you can see that this is not the case.
If you compare the medians (71 and 78), you might assume that the students generally scored less in English, (which is partly true, but there are also some much higher scores there too).
If you just state the modal score for each subject (101 and 78), you have no information about the scores of the other students.
So, which is best? It seems that to give maximum information,
a combination of the median and the range would be best.
So, in summary, English has a median score of 71 and a range of 37, and Maths has a median score of 78 and a range of 4.

Rubbish does not vanish when it is thrown away. A lot of it is buried in

rubbish is important because fewer landfill sites are needed, and the materials in the rubbish are re-used.
Fertilisers are chemicals used by farmers to help their crops grow well. Rain can wash fertilizers off the fields and into rivers. This causes water plants to overgrow and block out the light. Other plants die as a result. They use up oxygen as they rot away, and fish and other animals suffocate. This process is called eutrophication.

A simple sentence generally has one main verb and communicates one idea. For example:
There can be several words in the verb, so
- has two words in the verb.
- has three words in the verb.
However, in each example there is just one main verb and idea. This is the simplest type of sentence and usually it's very easy to understand.
A compound sentence generally joins two simple sentences together. We typically use words like 'and', 'or' and 'but' to join the ideas. For example:
It was cold but we still went to town.
It was raining and we stayed indoors.
This makes the two ideas equal in the sentence - if we take away one part of it, we are left with a simple sentence again. These are very common when we are speaking and they are not difficult to understand.
A complex sentence communicates more than one idea, so it's like a compound sentence in a way. However, the ideas are not equal. This is because one part is like a simple sentence, so it can stand on its own. The other part can't - it needs something else to support it. For instance, look at this sentence:
You can't persuade me to go to town, no matter how hard you try.
We can take away the first part, but then we are left with:
Now this is not a simple sentence and it doesn't stand on its own - it needs something else to make sense.

Food chains - Getting carbon dioxide, light and water
Remember that the equation for photosynthesis is:

Let's see how plants get the carbon dioxide and water they need for this process.
Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves. The carbon dioxide
through small holes in the underside of the leaf called stomata. (One of these holes is called a stoma. The plural is stomata.)
The lower part of the leaf has loose-fitting cells, to allow carbon dioxide to reach the other cells in the leaf. This also allow the oxygen produced in photosynthesis to leave the leaf easily.
A leaf usually has a large surface area, so that it can absorb a lot of light. Its top surface is protected from water loss, disease and weather damage by a waxy layer.
The upper part of the leaf is where the light falls, and it contains a type of cell called a

The roots have a type of cell called a root hair cell - these project out from the root into the soil. Roots have a big surface area and thin walls, which allow water to pass into them easily.
Note that root cells do not contain chloroplasts, as they are normally in the dark and cannot photosynthesise.
The water absorbed by the root hair cells passes through the plant in
tubes, and eventually reachers the leaves. If a plant does not absorb enough water, it will wilt or go floppy. Without water it may also not photosynthesise quickly enough, and it may die.

The part that illusion has to play
The example below is about power. Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on how the characters talk about magic and illusion
Prospero is a controlling character who seems to be obsessed with power and status. Ferdinand is a prince, but he has no status on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero pretends not to believe that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne of Naples and insists on taking him prisoner. He calls him a ""spy"", a ""traitor"", and an ""impostor"". He accuses him of lying. He threatens to ""manacle"" him and starve him. He uses his magic powers to prevent Ferdinand from defending himself. He also has control over Ariel and even talks about how his daughter will have ""control"" over Ferdinand when he falls in love with her.
Prospero is only pretending to be cruel and unwelcoming to Ferdinand as part of his plan, but it seems as though he is enjoying himself in the process. Even Miranda is alarmed at his behaviour.
The extract seems to suggest that Miranda and Ferdinand's love for each other will turn out to have a power that is stronger even than Prospero's magic.

Stanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for a while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed animals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it. Sometimes he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games. Maybe he'd make some friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake.

He is willing to make the best of a bad situation.
The writer suggests that Stanley spent long periods, when younger, playing alone with stuffed toys.
Stanley thinks that he will have the chance to make friends and 'at least he'd get to swim in the lake'.
The writer lists the sort of games Stanley played with his stuffed toys at 'Camp Fun and Games' in a way that suggests he was playing on his own - the toys became his friends.
He is going to a boy's prison work camp, but, instead of thinking about the horrors he might face, he shows that he is hopeful and ready to make the best of things.

Approximation - Rounding to a given number of places
Decimal places are counted from the decimal point:
So, the number 5.1492 has four decimal places and 4.34 has two decimal places.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places, look at the number in the next decimal place.
If it's less than 5 round down
If it's 5 or more, round up
Q1. Round 7.2648 to 2 decimal places (d.p.)
Q2. Round 8.352 to 1 decimal place
To round to two decimal places, look at the number in the third decimal place. It's a 4, so round down.
To round to one decimal place, look at the number in the second decimal place. It's a 5, so round up.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places then the answer must have that number of decimal places, even if you have to add some zeros.
For example, rounding 3.40021 to two decimal places gives 3.40 (2 d.p.).
You need to write both decimal places, even though the second number is a zero, to show you rounded to two decimal places.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The wedding night
Juliet can't wait for her wedding night. But when the Nurse tells her what happened to Tybalt, Juliet doesn't know whether to love or hate Romeo. She can't believe that he is being sent away and threatens to kill herself, so the Nurse promises to find Romeo and bring him to Juliet's bedroom.
Friar Lawrence is hiding Romeo. When he tells Romeo what Prince Escalus has decided, Romeo says that he would rather die than be sent away. The Nurse arrives. Romeo tries to stab himself, but the Nurse and the Friar stop him. The Friar gives Romeo a good telling off for being so ungrateful and for behaving like a girl! He and the Nurse arrange for Romeo to spend his last night in Verona with Juliet as long as he promises to leave for Mantua first thing in the morning.
The Capulets are grieving for Tybalt. Paris comes to see Juliet but she won't come down from her bedroom. Capulet tells Paris that he will sort things out between them because he is sure his daughter will do what he tells her to do. He suggests that Paris marries her on ThursdayIt is now Monday.
Romeo and Juliet have spent the night together. Juliet hears a lark (larks sing at dawn), but tries to persuade Romeo that it was a nightingale (nightingales sing at night) because she doesn't want the night to end. When Romeo says that he will stay and face death for her, Juliet changes her mind and makes him hurry to get up and leave. Juliet has a premonition of him dead in a grave.

Romeo and Juliet first key extract - Performance
When you write about performance, mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:
haracters and how you respond to them
anguage used - the detail about love, for example
ssues and ideas - like time, love and hate
Once you understand how the audience should feel, you can decide how you might direct a particular scene. Remember, there are lots of different ways to perform the same scene. A good answer depends on how well you explain yourself.
Here is an example of an answer to a question about performance. Think about how you might answer the same question.
How should an actor playing Benvolio behave?
Benvolio's replies to Romeo could either show that he is a good listener who wants to understand his friend's problems, or that he is amused by what Romeo has to say because he knows that his friend is not serious about this girl.
When Benvolio speaks to Montague, the mood is serious. When Romeo arrives, he has to ask lots of questions because Romeo is evasive. Some of Benvolio's comments could be said in a sarcastic or sympathetic way. The jokes that the two characters share show that they are good friends. Benvolio gives advice at the end of the scene that shows that he doesn't believe Romeo's love for Rosaline is serious.
The way Benvolio behaves towards Romeo shapes the way the audience perceives Romeo. This is important because Romeo is the main character. The audience has to like him and worry about him for the tragedy to work. If the actor playing Benvolio speaks his lines in a patient and sympathetic way, it makes Romeo seem like a young man who finds the world confusing. If Benvolio's lines are spoken humorously, the comedy in Romeo's speeches will be brought to life.

Humans have instincts, but it is possible for us to overcome natural urges to follow a certain behaviour. For example, a hungry person might want to start eating immediately when they sit down at the dinner table, but they have learned that good manners mean they should wait until everyone is seated and ready to eat.
Most people start smoking before they are adults
People often imitate each other. This can help them learn something new and useful, such as new skill in lessons, sport or at work. It can also lead them to show less useful behaviour. For example, young people may start smoking, drinking alcohol or taking drugs as a result of copying each other to fit in.
Conditioning can be used to change the behaviour of people. Advertisers are very skilled at this. They use pictures of their products which make the them look glamorous or exciting, often by using famous actors or sports people.
By associating the product with attractive images the advertisers are trying to set up a conditioned response to their product. People will respond positively and buy the product.

The second half of the writing focuses on the points in favour of the healthier options. Again, if you want any further information, click the check ideas button to see our comments.
However, this evidence does not show the whole picture. Many students say they would prefer to see more choice in the canteen. They point out that eating jacket potatoes every day is boring, and that the cold fillings are inadequate in winter. It has been suggested that more sandwiches, salads and a bigger range of hot main meals would be much more appealing. Many of these students currently bring their own food to school simply because they feel there is so little choice. These numbers include Grange High's many vegetarians.
Now the writer moves on to the views in favour of healthy food. The impersonal tone is maintained in the first sentence. The formal connective 'However' is used to signal a change in the argument. The writer returns to the facts - jacket potatoes are the only healthy option - and suggests some alternatives. She builds on the evidence mentioned earlier. She is building up towards her conclusion now.
Nevertheless, it remains true that junk food is popular and easy to produce. If students start going off site they may get injured or into trouble, and the school could be held responsible. Therefore, it seems impractical to ban junk food altogether. But is there another answer? I believe there is: the canteen could offer a wider selection, including healthier options, for one term, and see whether it is successful. If it is, and we see more students using the canteen and eating the healthy options, the canteen could make this change permanent.
This detailed paragraph begins to suggest the solution. Formal connectives are used ('nevertheless' and 'therefore') to signal that the argument is coming to an end. She returns to a personal expression, 'I believe there is...' because she is summing up her findings.
In conclusion, the solution seems clear: if a good selection of food is provided then everyone will be happy - and the canteen will almost certainly gain more customers. Thank you for your time.
The final paragraph is short and direct. It sums up the main conclusion of the speech in a positive way: 'everyone will be happy' and 'the canteen will almost certainly gain...' which leaves the audience with a clear picture of her final point of view. Rather than trying to persuade people one way or the other, the speech has tried to suggest a solution where everyone gains. This isn't always possible, but it can be a helpful way of concluding without sitting on the fence and telling the audience to make up their own minds. As you can probably guess, this is an excellent answer.

""The eyes were the worst. It was not my imagination. They were in truth like the eyes of a dead man, not blind, but staring, unfocused, unseeing. The whole face, for that matter, was bad enough. It was vacant, as if there was nothing behind it. It seemed not only expressionless, but incapable of expression. I had seen so much previously in Haiti that was outside the ordinary normal experience that for the flash of a second I had a sickening, almost panicky lapse in which I thought, or rather felt, ""Great God, maybe this stuff really is true..."".
This is how William Seabrook described his encounter with one of the most horrifying creatures ever to step from the realms of the supernatural. For Seabrook was face-to-face with a zombie - a walking corpse. And in that moment he was prepared to believe all that he had heard about zombies since he first arrived on the island of Haiti.
The zombie's fate is even worse than that of a vampire or werewolf. The vampire returns to his loved ones. He may be recognised and laid to rest. The werewolf may be wounded and regain human form. But the zombie is a mindless automaton (robot), doomed to live out a twilight existence of brutish toil (animal-like labour). A zombie can eat, move, hear, even speak, but he has no memory of his past or knowledge of his present condition. He may pass by his own home or gaze into the eyes of his loved ones without a glimmer of recognition.
Neither ghost nor person, the zombie is said to be trapped, possibly forever, in that ""misty zone that divides life from death"". For while the vampire is the living dead, the zombie is merely the walking dead - a body without soul or mind raised from the grave and given a semblance (appearance) of life through sorcery. He is the creature of the sorcerer, who uses him as a slave or hires him out - usually to walk on the land.
From 'The Book of Great Mysteries' edited by Colin Wilson and Christopher Evans.

A1. They did this to make the whole text sound more believable, and to add lively detail to the factual section which follows it.
A3. They help the reader to build up a picture of the zombie, making the writing more dramatic.
A4. He had seen 'so much previously in Haiti that was outside normal experience' that he thought it might be a real zombie.
A5. The words which tell us he didn't really believe this are: 'for a flash of a second', 'panicky lapse' and 'maybe'.
A6. The writer uses the phrase 'one of the most horrifying creatures ever to step from the realms of the supernatural'. You might also have picked out the phrase 'walking corpse'.
A7. Zombies are compared to vampires and werewolves.
A8. The zombie's fate is worse because it can't think, it can't return to human form, it is doomed to slave labour and it has no memory of its home or loved ones.
A9. The text has two purposes: firstly, to inform us about zombies, and secondly, to entertain.

. A simple sentence consists of one clause that has a subject and a verb. A simple sentence puts across one simple idea.
A complex sentence is used to put across more
ideas. A complex sentence contains one main clause that can make sense on its own, and one or more minor clauses that are linked to it.
The main clause is the 'big dog barked' because it has a subject and a verb and makes sense by itself.
The minor clause is 'When I arrived'. Although it is a clause with a subject and a verb, it doesn't make sense on its own, it needs a main clause.
We can add more minor clauses to make a more complex sentence.
We can even split the main clause with a minor clause and still have a complex sentence.

368,"A debate is an organised argument. You might think you've never taken part in a debate before but you probably have without realising it! When you discuss topics in class or at home, and put forward different points of view - this is debating. Debating allows you to discuss your ideas and find out what other people think about a particular topic.
If you're asked to take part in an organised debate at school, this is likely to be a more formal discussion and follow a set of rules.
Here are some simple rules for formal debates:
First of all, you need two teams: the proposition team and the opposition team.
Then you need something to argue about. This is called a motion.
The proposition team starts. Their first speaker has to tell everyone what the motion is all about.
The opposition team goes next. Then the teams take it in turns until everyone has had their say.
The last speaker on each team has to sum up their team's main argument.
Your team will need to do plenty of preparation - writing out the main points of your argument. During the debate, your team is allowed to pass notes to each other so that you can add or change things as you go along. The most convincing team wins the debate. Try to guess in advance what your opposing team might argue to avoid being caught out.
Use these tips to make your arguments as convincing as you can:
Use facts - it's hard to argue against a fact so use as much evidence and as many statistics as possible.
Use opinion too - debating is all about getting your opinion across and persuading others to agree with you, so use a good balance of fact and opinion.
Listen to the other team and comment on what they have said. You then have a chance to convince the audience of the other side of the argument.
Structure your argument - as if you were writing an essay, you need a clear introduction, a middle and a conclusion.
Arguing isn't about shouting the loudest - present your arguments in a clear controlled voice. Don't lose your temper or get too emotional about the arguments.

Drawing pins make good use of pressure
Drawing pins have a large round end for you to push. The round end has a large area, so it applies a low pressure to your thumb. The sharp end has a very small area. The same pushing force produces a high pressure there, so it pushes into the notice board.
If you swing round on one leg of a chair, you put four times as much pressure on one point of the floor as you do if you sit properly. This is because four chair legs spread the pressure over four times more area than one chair leg can.

If the value of x is negative, tackle the equation in the same way - aim to get all xs on one side of the equation.
5x - 2 = 12 - 2x
Your aim is to get all the unknown x terms on one of the equation side only, so start by adding 2x to both sides: 7x - 2 = 12
Next add 2 to both sides: 7x = 14
And finally, divide by 7 to give
As always, you can check your answer in the original equation. So substitute x = 2 back into 5x - 2 = 12 - 2x
(5  2) - 2 = 12 - (2  2)
10 - 2 = 12 - 4
This makes sense, so the value x = 2 is correct.
Add x to both sides to give 5x = 10.
To find x, divide both sides by 5 to get x = 2
Solve the equation 4x + 1 = 2x + 5
Start by subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation to give

Variation and classification - Continuous & discontinuous
Some of the features of the different organisms in a species show continuous variation, and some features show discontinuous variation.
Human height is an example of continuous variation. Height ranges from that of the shortest person in the world to that of the tallest person. Any height is possible between these values. So it is continuous variation.
For any species a characteristic that changes gradually over a range of values shows continuous variation. Examples of such characteristics are:
If you record the heights of a group of people and draw a graph of your results, it usually looks something like this:
The more people you measure, and the smaller the categories you use, the closer the results will be to the curved line. This shape of graph is typical of a feature with continuous variation. Weight and foot length would give graphs similar in shape to this.
Human blood group is an example of discontinuous variation. There are only 4 types of blood group. There are no other possibilities and there are no values in between. So this is discontinuous variation.
A characteristic of any species with only a limited number of possible values shows discontinuous variation. Here are some examples:

Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew. Were you by when it began?
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
I drew to part them. In the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
O where is Romeo? Saw you him today?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun
Peered forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad 
That westward rooteth from this city side,
So early walking did I see your son.
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood.
I, measuring his affections by my own,
Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Being one too many by my weary self,
And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
I neither know it, nor can learn of him.
Have you importuned him by any means?
Both by myself and many other friends:
Is to himself  I will not say how true 
But to himself so secret and so close,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.
See where he comes. So please you, step aside.
Ill know his grievance or be much denied.
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, lets away.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeos hours?
Not having that which, having, makes them short.
Out of her favour where I am in love.
Alas, that Love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Alas, that Love, whose view is muffled still,
Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Heres much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs:
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers eyes;
Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.
What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.
This is not Romeo: hes some other where.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will 
A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.
A right good mark-man! And shes fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Well, in that hit you miss. Shell not be hit
With Cupids arrow. She hath Dians wit,
And in strong proof of chastity well-armed,
From Loves weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide th encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
O, she is rich in beauty  only poor
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
Be ruled by me: forget to think of her.
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
To call hers  exquisite  in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing fair:
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who passed that passing fair?

The second set extract begins with Romeo hiding from Mercutio and Benvolio in Juliet's garden. Romeo thinks to himself that Mercutio can never understand how he feels because he has never been in love.
""He jests at scars that never felt a wound""
He watches Juliet as she stands on her balcony thinking out loud. He thinks that she is like the sun
Romeo uses lots of words and images that relate to light when he describes Juliet.: 'sun', 'stars' 'brightness'.
and that the moon is jealous of her because she is so beautiful. He says that her eyes are like two stars that are so bright that they would stop night-time from being dark if they were in heaven, and the birds would sing because they would think that night was day.
Romeo uses more words and images to do with light to describe Juliet.
He idolises her and compares her to an angel.
When Romeo says that Juliet is like an angel from heaven, on the one hand, he is saying how lovely she is. On the other hand, you could say that he doesn't really see her as a flesh and blood person. He idolises her. Do you believe that he can really love her when he doesn't actually know anything about her? Or do you believe in love at first sight?
Juliet, not realising that Romeo is hiding in her garden, imagines what she would say to Romeo if he were there. She says out loud that she wishes he wasn't a Montague, but says that it doesn't really matter because she loves him anyway, and hopes that he loves her. After all, a name is just a word; it doesn't really mean that much.
If we used another word for a rose instead of the word 'rose', eg 'poo', the rose would still be a rose, it wouldn't smell like poo just because we used that word. In the same way, Romeo is still lovely even though his name is Montague.
When Juliet is thinking these things aloud on her balcony, she doesn't know that anyone else is watching. Have you ever practiced saying something to someone, even though you know that you would never be brave enough to say it?
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet
When Romeo replies, Juliet nearly jumps out of her skin.
""My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself""
When Romeo calls her 'dear saint', Juliet realizes who he is. Romeo called her 'dear saint' at the party.
Juliet is very worried for Romeo's safety; he is a Montague on Capulet property. Romeo uses very poetic and exaggerated language to describe how he managed to climb over the walls.
Romeo has been quite brave and perhaps foolish to break into Juliet's garden. He likes to takes risks and doesn't think clearly about the seriousness of his actions. He uses poetic language to exaggerate his bravery.
He declares that he'd rather die than live never having the opportunity to love Juliet.
Juliet admits that she is embarrassed that Romeo heard the things that she was saying about him. She asks him if he loves her too, but she doesn't give him the chance to answer.
Juliet is worried that she has shown herself to be too keen on Romeo. In Shakespeare's day, nice girls weren't supposed to show that they were interested in boys.
Juliet's speech is very long! Is she nervous or embarrassed? Is she a chatterbox? Is she so excited about her new love that she can't stop talking about it?
Romeo begins to use poetic language about the moon to describe how much he loves her, but Juliet won't let him finish.
Time - Juliet won't let Romeo finish his sentences! Poor Romeo! We already know how much he loves to speak! Juliet's mind is working very quickly. She is excited, but also worried about how suddenly they have fallen in love.
She says that if he swears by the moon, he might turn out to be just as changeable as the moon (the moon changes its shape throughout the month).
She worries that they have fallen in love so quickly.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.
She tries to say goodnight, but she is excited and passionate about her feelings for Romeo and can't seem to stop talking about it.
""My bounty is as boundless as the sea.
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite""
Juliet's use of imagery seems more heartfelt than Romeo's: her love is as deep as the sea, and the sea never runs out. That's passion!
Juliet's Nurse shouts to her from inside the house. Juliet asks Romeo to wait. As she goes into her bedroom, Romeo thinks to himself that their love seems like a dream.
Love - Is this true love? How could it have happened so quickly? Do you believe in 'love at first sight'? Remember, that same evening that he met and fell in love with Juliet, Romeo was moping about saying that he would never love anyone as much as he loved Rosaline! Romeo might argue though that he didn't really know what true love was until he met Juliet.
Juliet comes back out onto the balcony and tells Romeo that if he is serious about her, she will send a messenger out to him tomorrow to find out where and what time they will get married!
Time - events happen very quickly in this play. In less than a week, Romeo and Juliet fall in love, get married and die.
She says goodnight to him as her Nurse impatiently tells her to come inside.
Romeo finds it hard to say goodnight to her.
Romeo said that he was in love with Rosaline in the first extract. Less than a day later, he claims to be in love with Juliet. Has he really thought about the consequences of marrying Juliet. Perhaps, when you are in love, nothing else matters. What do you think?

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to advise
Once you can argue and persuade, it should be easy to advise. The trick is to be gentle - it's no good pushing your ideas at your readers, or trying to impress them. Instead, you should come across as friendly, as someone who just wants to help.
For instance, imagine you're writing to advise someone in Year 9 who is moving house and has to change schools. We know that it won't be easy - they'll have to make new friends and cope with all sorts of changes. So you need to be sympathetic and give some ideas you think could help.
The first thing might be to plan each main idea in a separate paragraph because it's easier to follow like this. Then think about how you want to present your ideas. It might be fine to give some information as an order, such as:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone.
You can add information to this - perhaps explaining why and giving an example of what to do, so now your paragraph looks like this:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone. Most people will be glad to help and it's the quickest way to make friends. You can ask a teacher, but it might be better to ask one of the other pupils. Choose a friendly face if you can, and don't be shy - it might be their first day too.
It is not just the information that makes this a good piece of advice, it's also the style. It includes words like ""might"" and ""can"". These make the ideas softer - they are not in your face and pushing you to agree, they just guide you. And they are very simple to use, so make sure you include words like ""should, can, could, might, ought to and may"" - each one turns an idea into a piece of advice.

The salt produced depends upon the metal and the acid. Here are two examples:
It doesn't matter which metal or acid is used, if there is a reaction we always get hydrogen gas as well as the salt.
There is a simple laboratory test to see if a gas is hydrogen. A lighted wooden splint goes pop if it is put into a test tube of hydrogen. This is because the flame ignites the hydrogen, which burns explosively to make a loud sound.
All acids contain hydrogen atoms. Apart from hydrochloric acid, this is not clear from their names, but you can tell they contain hydrogen from their chemical formulae. Remember that the chemical symbol for hydrogen is H.

Stanley didn't have many friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.
What does this extract show us about the main character?
Stanley is another big male, but it is clear that the writer wants us to react differently to him than we did to Jim Wellings in the earlier extract.
Stanley is a lonely boy, because he ""didn't have many friends at home"". He is bullied and teased, even by adults. The fact that the teacher causes him ""embarrassment"" by showing him up in front of the class proves that he feels uncomfortable about his weight.

Meanwhile, in Mantua, Romeo waits for news. A servant called Balthasar arrives and tells Romeo that he has heard that Juliet has died. Romeo decides to buy some poison. He plans to go to see Juliet's body where he will take the poison and die next to her.
Meanwhile, Friar John explains to Friar Lawrence that the letter he wanted him to take to Romeo explaining the truth about Juliet didn't get delivered. Friar Lawrence decides to go to the tomb and wait for Juliet to wake up while he sends another letter to Romeo.
That same evening, Paris goes to Juliet's tomb with some flowers. He hears a noise and decides to investigate.
Romeo pays Balthasar off and breaks into the Capulet tomb. Paris tries to stop him. Romeo begs him to leave him alone, but Paris thinks he is vandalising the tomb. They fight. Romeo kills Paris. Just before Paris dies he asks Romeo to place him next to Juliet's body. Romeo is sad that he had to kill Paris and takes him into the tomb to be near Juliet.
When Romeo sees Juliet lying in the tomb, he can't believe that she is dead because she looks so beautiful. He hugs her and kisses her. He takes the poison then kisses her again and dies.
Friar Lawrence finds the bodies of Paris and Romeo just as Juliet is about to wake up. Juliet wakes up and asks the Friar where Romeo is. He hears a noise and begs Juliet to come away with him, but when she finds out that Romeo is dead, she refuses to go with him. Friar Lawrence runs away.
Juliet tries to kiss the poison off Romeo's lips. His lips are still warm, but there is not enough poison left on them to kill her. She takes his dagger and stabs herself.
Some watchmen discover the bodies outside the tomb. They also find the Friar who is crying and shaking. Prince Escalus and Juliet's mother and father arrive with Romeo's father. Friar Lawrence tells them all the truth about the wedding and their children's deaths. He feels so guilty that he asks the Prince to punish him, but Prince Escalus won't because the Friar is a holy man. Prince Escalus blames Montague and Capulet, but he also blames himself for not doing enough to stop the violence. Capulet and Montague decide to end their rift. Montague offers to have a statue of Juliet made. The play ends as the Prince says that this is the saddest story ever told.

Food chains - Toxic materials in the food chain
Toxic materials are poisonous. Some quickly break down into harmless substances in the environment. Others are

Mercury compounds were used until quite recently to make

Unfortunately, when it gets into the food chain mercury damages the
of mammals, including humans. The diagram shows how mercury can accumulate in the food chain.
Tiny plankton in the sea absorb the mercury compounds. When the plankton are eaten by small fish, the mercury they contain stays in the fish. As the fish need to eat a lot of plankton, the concentration of mercury in them becomes higher than its concentration in the plankton.
The small fish are eaten by larger fish, and these are eaten by still larger ones, such as tuna fish. This creates a high concentration of mercury in the tuna. People eating contaminated tuna may get mercury poisoning. Mercury is now banned from many chemical products and mercury use in industry is carefully regulated.
DDT is an insecticide that can pass up the food chain from insects to small birds, and then from the small birds to birds of prey, like hawks. It can accumulate in the birds of prey, giving them a large amount of DDT. Concentrations of DDT in birds causes weakness in their eggs, and reduces their population. DDT is now banned because of this.

change from hot weather in the summer to cold weather in the winter
change from long hours of daylight in the summer to shorter days in the winter

Let's look at two examples of how organisms are adapted to such changes.
If you have ever been to the seaside and looked for creatures in rock pools, you are likely to have seen lots of limpets on the rocks.
When the tide is in, limpets move over sea-covered rocks, scraping off tiny bits of seaweed. When the tide goes out, limpets clamp themselves very tightly against the newly exposed rock. This makes it difficult for predators to pull them off the rock to eat them. It also stops the limpets losing water, or being washed away by waves.
The snowshoe hare lives in Canada and other parts of North America.
The snowshoe hare has brown fur during the summer, to help camouflage it amongst the earth and plants. Its fur is white during the winter, to help camouflage it in the snow. This adaptation makes it more difficult for predators to see the snowshoe hare, whatever the season.

The Earth's rocks do not stay the same forever. They are continually changing because of processes such as weathering and large earth movements. The rocks are gradually recycled over millions of years. This is called the rock cycle.
For example sedimentary rocks can be changed into metamorphic rocks, and these can be weathered and the pieces transported away. These pieces could be deposited in lakes or seas and eventually form new sedimentary rock. Many routes through the rock cycle are possible.

a little. If a rock is heated and cooled many times, cracks form and pieces of rock fall away. This type of physical weathering happens a lot in deserts, because it is very hot during the day but very cold at night.
Wind, rain and waves can all cause weathering. The wind can blow tiny grains of sand against a rock. These wear the rock away and weather it. Rain and waves can also wear away rock over long periods of time.
Water expands slightly when it freezes into ice. This is why water pipes sometimes burst in the winter. You might have seen a demonstration of this sort of thing at school - a jar filled to the brim with water eventually shatters after it is put into a freezer.
The formation of ice can also break rocks. If water gets into a crack in a rock and then

This process of freezing and thawing can continue until the crack becomes so big that a piece of rock falls off.

Formal and informal writing - Informal writing
Writing is informal when it reads as though someone is chatting to the reader. In the right situation, it makes your writing seem more friendly and natural.
Which of the following would you NOT write using informal language?
b) An essay about a Shakespeare play
c) A talk aimed at students your own age or younger
e) A story written from the point of view of a character (in the first person)
b) An essay should always be written using formal language. All of the other situations would suit a more informal style.
Tips to make your informal writing more effective
""Dear reader, I'm really glad you've found the time to open this letter.""
2. It's okay sometimes to use the kind of words that are more usual in speech than writing:
""You don't have to put up with bullying. We'll stick together and make it stop.""
3. Contractions sound more natural in certain types of writing eg a talk to fellow students:
""It's good to know that we're all going to work together on this.""
Don't baffle your reader with too much slang.
Think carefully about structure - informal writing is different to speech and needs carefully planned paragraphs to keep it clear and easy to read.
Sometimes there is opportunity to break the rules of Standard English and use English in unexpected ways. Two good examples of writers who achieve this are poet Benjamin Zephaniah and writer Andrea Levy in her book Small Island.
If you're asked to write a story, it would be a mistake for you as the author to use incorrect grammar and slang - but inside speech marks, your characters can!

Ariel brings Ferdinand (the King's son) to Prospero's cave. Ferdinand thinks he's the only survivor from the shipwreck. Miranda, who has seen no other man but her father during her time on the island, sees Ferdinand and thinks he must be a spirit - while Ferdinand thinks Miranda is a goddess. The two young people fall in love, but Prospero is not pleased, and makes Ferdinand his prisoner.
On another part of the island we discover one of the groups of shipwreck survivors. They begin to wake up. They're surprised that their clothes seem fresh and new.
Ariel's magical song puts them to sleep again - all except Sebastian (the King's brother) and Antonio (Prospero's brother). Antonio convinces Sebastian that they should kill the King (Alonso) so that Sebastian can take his place. Fortunately everyone else wakes up again, before they can carry out their plan.
Elsewhere on the island, Trinculo, a jester who was on board the ship, comes across Caliban. Trinculo's drunken friend Stephano turns up, and gives Caliban strong alcohol. This makes Caliban believe that Stephano is more powerful than Prospero (who Caliban hates).
Meanwhile, Ariel, who has made himself invisible, watches the three drunken clowns. He causes havoc by whispering the accusation ""thou liest"" in Caliban's ear, then Stephano's. They become confused and fight.
Caliban reveals his plans to destroy Prospero and take over the island. Stephano drunkenly agrees. Caliban is delighted that Stephano has agreed to his plan and they sing to celebrate. Ariel plays a tune to accompany their singing which frightens both Trinculo and Stephano.
Caliban tells them not to be afraid in a moving speech that describes the beauty and magic of the island. Stephano, Trinculo and Caliban follow the sound of the music.

If there are two digits after the decimal point in the question, there will be two digits after the decimal point in the answer.
a) There were two digits after the decimal point in the question (4 and 3), so you must have two digits after the decimal point in the answer.

In an equation the '=' sign means that the two sides are identical. But what happens when the two sides are not identical?
If this is the case you need to use inequalities to show the relationship between the two sides.
For example, if x > 2, then x = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ... (x is greater than, but not equal to 2, so don't include the 2).
If y is  4, then y = 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, ... (y is less than or equal to 4, so do include the 4).
If z  3, what are the possible values of z?

A species becomes extinct when there are no more individuals of that species left. An extinct species has gone forever.
Here are some of the things that can cause a species to become extinct:
a change in the physical environment, such as a change in the long-term temperature or rainfall patterns
competition from another species that is better adapted, including competition from humans
For example, dinosaurs became extinct millions of years ago. This was probably due to changes in the environment. But many species have become extinct more recently because of competition from humans.
The dodo was a flightless bird found on the island of Mauritius. It became extinct in the seventeenth century because of human activities. Humans disturbed the dodo's habitat and also brought new predators to the island, like pigs and dogs.

Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.
For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.
By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.
You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:
Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:
In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:
To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:
Divide both sides by 2, to give:
a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7
b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7
When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers.
For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7.
7 + 5 does equal 12, so your answer is correct.

It's up to you to make your mind up about a setting, in just the same way that it's up to you what to make of a new place you visit.

This was the worst nightmare yet. He was standing with his back pressed against a smooth wall cold as ice. The cold nibbled at his buttocks and legs; it ran up and down the knobbles of his spine, making him shiver; it invaded his lungs so he could hardly breathe; he felt he had been shivering a long time.
In the extract, the writer intends to create a very creepy, sinister atmosphere. The way that he describes Ralph's imprisonment makes it sound very unpleasant. He is ""pressed"" against a wall that is ""cold as ice"" and the cold is creeping into every part of his body, making him shiver. Ralph also feels as if he can ""hardly breathe"" because of the cold.
. The simile; ""a smooth wall cold as ice"", helps the reader relate to Ralph as they will know what ice feels like. The writer also uses personification; the cold ""nibbled"" at Ralph, it ""ran up and down"" his back and ""invaded"" his lungs. This makes the cold sound as if it were alive, running over and into Ralph, trying to eat away at him. This adds to the feeling that he has been overpowered and is in danger.

In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Second Key Extract takes place outside Prospero's cave. Ferdinand is carrying logs. He thinks to himself that he doesn't mind the hard work because he is doing it for Miranda,
Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble.
even if her father is cruel and grumpy.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
Miranda comes to see him. Neither of them realise that Prospero is watching them from a distance.
On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance?
Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
but he says he has too much to do, so she offers to carry some logs for him.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
He says he would rather break his back than see her work. Miranda insists again that she should help him.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Looking on, Prospero sees how much Miranda is in love with Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Ferdinand asks Miranda her name and when she tells him, she remembers that in doing so, she has broken her promise to her father.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand admits that he has liked lots of different women in the past
Ferdinand uses the word 'bondage' to describe his reaction to listening to beautiful women talk. It links back to the issue of Freedom and Slavery in the play. Ferdinand means that he has been like a slave to beautiful women in the past.
, but they have always disappointed him with some fault or other in the end.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
However, Miranda, he says, is perfect. Miranda, on the other hand, hasn't met any men except for her father, or any women, except for herself. Even so, she says that she can't imagine liking anyone more than she likes Ferdinand.
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand tells her that he is a prince, possibly a king (although he hopes his father isn't dead). He wouldn't usually put up with having to carry logs like a slave
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
but he knew as soon as he saw Miranda that he'd do anything for her. When Miranda asks him if he loves her, Ferdinand says he loves, prizes and honours her more than anything else in the world. This makes Miranda so happy that she cries. As Prospero watches them together, he is moved.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Ferdinand asks Miranda why she is crying. She says she thinks she isn't good enough for him
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!
but realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else. Ferdinand happily agrees to marry her. They say goodbye and part.
Prospero is happy for them, but he claims that their engagement is no surprise to him as it was all part of his plan. He goes to get his magic book because he has lots of work to do before supper time.
Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance?
Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand uses the word 'bondage' to describe his reaction to listening to beautiful women talk. It links back to the issue of Freedom and Slavery in the play. Ferdinand means that he has been like a slave to beautiful women in the past.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?

This is one version of the speech. You will find comments beneath each paragraph, explaining what the writer has done well.
I'm sure you've all heard the saying ""we are what we eat"". Have you been into the school canteen recently? The selection is similar to that in many schools: a main meal which is usually meat-based, a variety of burgers and pizzas, a dessert and, for the health-conscious, jacket potatoes with one or two cold fillings. The question we are here to consider today is whether this is a reasonable selection, or whether changes could be made in Grange High School's canteen.
The speech begins dealing with the problem straight away. It starts with a short, familiar phrase and a rhetorical question, to involve the audience and make them listen to the speech. The current selection of food is outlined to set the scene, followed by the main question to be tackled. The opening is very friendly and easy to follow. This is a great start.
A survey conducted recently by Year 9 students suggested that many students are happy with the food on offer. They stated that the burgers and pizzas were their favourite food and that they were ""tasty, filling, cheap and quick"". These choices, sometimes called ""junk food"", are the best sellers and the canteen staff say the profit from these makes it possible to offer some of the less popular options.
The writer now looks at the evidence for keeping junk food. They've imagined a survey and comments from the canteen staff - this is fine as it's relevant and makes sense.
Some students admit that the junk food in the canteen is the only reason they stay in school at lunchtimes. Although we are not allowed off site during school times, it is well known that some students do sneak out to local chip shops and other takeaways. A substantial number of students who took part in the canteen's survey said they would be more likely to do this if the canteen offered more healthy food.
The final argument for junk food is explained. The writer introduces a rather controversial point, but softens it with the phrase 'it is well known...' so that no one is blamed. Again this keeps things formal and balanced.
So far, the writing looks really good, but it seems like the conclusion will be in favour of junk food. Is there any way of balancing the argument? Go to the next page to see how this is done.

""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

It's not just adults who have expanding waistlines. Over the past 20 years, the percentage of overweight kids in the United States has doubled. About 15 percent, or 9 million kids, are overweight today. That is one out of every six kids.
Obesity is becoming a serious dietary problem in the United States.
Being overweight can lead to serious health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes, later in life. ""Obesity ... is now the most serious dietary problem affecting the health of American children,"" said nutrition expert Marion Nestle.
So why are so many people packing on the pounds? People gain weight when they take in more
than they use up through activity. A calorie is a measure of the amount of energy from food.
Exercise burns calories, but kids today aren't moving as much as kids did in the past. Studies show that kids spend more time than ever before watching television, playing video games, and sitting at computers.
Some schools have also dropped recess in favor of more classroom time. Other schools have cut back on their physical education programs.
On average, an American kid eats a fast-food meal once every three days.
At the same time, portions at many fast-food restaurants have become supersized. In 1957, the average hamburger weighed 1 ounce and had 210 calories. Today, it has grown to 6 ounces and contains 618 calories.
Many people can't resist the larger portion sizes and have included more fries, burgers, and other fast foods in their diets. On average, it is estimated that an American kid eats a fast-food meal once every three days.
Megameals can't take all the blame. Each year, kids are exposed to more than 10,000 television ads for candy, soft drinks, and other sugary snacks. Very few television ads promote healthful foods, such as fruits and vegetables.
Many schools are changing their lunch programs to include more fruits and vegetables.
To help fight the problem, the U.S. government recently issued new guidelines for healthful eating. The guidelines recommend that kids exercise for at least 60 minutes a day and eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Parents, schools, and health officials are also helping kids battle the bulge. Even some fast-food restaurants are working to make their meals more healthful.
Schools in California, Texas, and New York toughened their junk food policies. They have banned soft drinks and other junk food. Candy and other sugary snacks in school vending machines are being replaced with more healthful choices, such as nuts, bottled water, and granola bars. Schools are also reworking their lunch programs to include more fruits and vegetables.

Thailee and Paige are among 40 fourth and fifth graders at Meadowbrook Elementary School who taste-tested foods such as blueberry burgers, dried plum barbecue sauce, and asparagus salsa. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) conducted the taste test. It was part of a national school lunch event. USDA officials are encouraging schools to find creative ways to add more fruits and vegetables to lunches.
The kids' opinions from the taste test carry weight. If kids like the new healthful lunch options, the foods might be added to school cafeteria menus across the country. ""It [will] be up to the students and the schools whether they'll see [these food items] on their menus,"" said John Lund, an official with the USDA.

To enter the exhibit, visitors walk through a turnstile similar to one they would find at a baseball stadium. Inside, more than 100 objects from 1840 through the present are on display. The exhibit includes scorecards, baseball cards, bats, painted baseballs, artwork, and even an autographed quilt among its many items.
""It's baseball history and trivia,"" Elizabeth Warren told
when describing the exhibit she organized. ""It combines baseball and art.""
Warren says that Jackie Robinson is depicted on many objects, more than any other baseball player. In 1947, Jackie Robinson made history. He became the first African American baseball player in the major leagues when he joined the Dodgers. At that time, the Dodgers were located in Brooklyn. Today, they are in Los Angeles.
""Jackie Robinson was a hero both on and off the field,"" said Warren. ""He's such a great role model.""

The 22-year-old man from Alaska lost the use of his legs seven years ago in a car accident. He is believed to be the first paraplegic to climb Mount Fuji.
""I want to show people what I am able to do,"" Reilly said from the top of Mount Fuji. ""Maybe it will inspire them.""
How exactly did he make his climb? Reilly used a special bike that he powered with his arms. Reilly traveled with a support team of eight people and reached the
, or peak, of the mountain within four days. The climb normally takes about six hours.
Reilly's journey, however, was not without obstacles. His team was stopped by a park ranger who said mountain bikes weren't allowed on the trail. They managed to persuade the park ranger to allow them to continue their journey. Although Reilly's bike was built to climb rocks, the trail was covered with volcanic ash and gravel, making for a difficult ride.
What does Reilly teach people about overcoming challenges to reach their goals?
Mount Fuji is one of the most-climbed peaks in the world. Reilly chose the mountain because he wanted to pick one outside the United States. Since losing the use of his legs, Reilly has also climbed peaks in Colorado and California.
Now that he has accomplished his goal, he has already set his sights even higher. He hopes to climb Mount Rainier in Alaska and the tallest peak in South America. ""I hope to climb one mountain every year,"" he said.

Only the superintendent and school officials, such as principals, can watch.
Before watching the class on computers, officials are required to enter a password. Parents, teachers, and students would need court permission to watch.
Many teachers and students say they feel safer with cameras and are pleased to have them in the classrooms. Others say they don't feel the same way.

For most climbers, jumping over a crevasse is hard enough. But for Weihenmayer, jumping over the cracks was particularly hard because he is blind.
Last spring, Erik Weihenmayer became the first blind climber to reach the peak of Mount Everest. He was part of a team of climbers that was sponsored by the National Federation of the Blind.
Mount Everest is 29,035 feet tall and sits on the border between Nepal and China, two countries in Asia. According to many climbers, Mount Everest is one of the hardest and deadliest mountains in the world to climb because of the mountain's height.
""There are a lot of things that can happen up there. You're not ever really sure that you're going to make it,"" Weihenmayer told
. Climbers can suffer from illnesses caused by many things, including the altitude.
sickness occurs when a climber does not get enough oxygen.
The team took more than two months to complete the climb. Weihenmayer spent much of his time moving the team's supplies up the mountain to a base camp, which was located at 17,600 feet. The time spent moving gear helped Erik Weihenmayer get used to the altitude. ""You're letting your body get used to the elevation, the air, the temperature,"" Weihenmayer said.
Weihenmayer, who had already climbed several of the world's highest peaks, had help getting up Mount Everest. ""[People] would walk ahead of me with a bell,"" he said. ""I tried to stay in their footsteps. I tried to stay [close] behind them so I could hear their steps, and I stepped into those places.""
For Weihenmayer, climbing Mount Everest was the toughest but most rewarding experience of his life. When he got to the top, Weihenmayer stopped to think about what he had done.
""I thought about the ground underneath me. I felt these cool flags [at the peak] that were up there in the breeze,"" Weihenmayer said. ""I thought about my family, friends, and about where I was.""

The secretive leopards are the latest of at least 52 new plant and animal species found in the rain forests on Borneo within the past year.
Scientists compared Borneo's clouded leopards with similar cats found on Southeast Asia's mainland. They paid special attention to the marks on the animals' skin. ""The moment we started comparing the skins on the mainland clouded leopard and the leopard found on Borneo, it was clear we were comparing two different species,"" says scientist Andrew Kitchener. Unlike the mainland clouded leopard, the Borneo cat has a double

The newly discovered leopard is Borneo's largest

There are about 5,000 to 11,000 Borneo clouded leopards living on Borneo, according to scientists. The Sumatra population is likely to be between 3,000 and 7,000.

Even though the coqui and greenhouse frogs are each only about the size of a dime, they make a huge racket. Instead of making soft chirping or gentle croaking sounds, the frogs chirp as loudly as a lawnmower. ""You'd never believe so much noise could come from a creature that small,"" Stevens said.
Scientists say the frogs in Stevens's backyard recently arrived in Hawaii. They came from islands in the Caribbean Sea, south of the United States mainland. Scientists think the frogs were accidentally shipped to Hawaii in flowerpots.
Since arriving in Hawaii, the foreign frogs have spread to 150 areas. In some areas, more than 8,000 can be found on a single acre of land. Each one is adding to the noise level.
The frogs are more than a noisy nuisance; they are causing other problems, as well. They eat insects that birds and other frogs used to eat. Each night, each thunderous frog can eat at least six insects.
The number of frogs is increasing because no other animals prey on them. If the foreign frog population keeps growing, other frogs and birds in Hawaii might not have enough insects to eat and might starve.
Some officials worry that the frogs might cause some people to leave Hawaii because of the racket. ""We get a lot of complaints from residents,"" said Fred Kraus, a spokesperson for the state. ""Some [have] threatened to leave the state.""
Residents of Hawaii are trying to capture the shrill frogs, which live in trees. Recently, Stevens and some of his neighbors went out looking for the noisy critters. They used ladders to climb into trees and capture frogs. ""We got them all,"" he said.
However, within a few months of the frog roundup, more frogs moved into Stevens's neighborhood. ""It was hopeless,"" Stevens said. ""There were just too many [frogs to capture]. Now they're out of control.""

Sixteen countries including the United States sent soldiers to help South Korea. All 16 countries were members of the United Nations. China and the Soviet Union helped the North Koreans. About 2 million died in the war. Many of the casualties were civilians. More than 107,230 U.S. soldiers were killed.
Most of the fighting ended when an armistice, or agreement to stop fighting, was signed on July 27, 1953. Land mines were placed in the DMZ to keep the two sides from combat.
However, the two sides never signed a peace treaty. The two sides continued to fight occasionally. Now the countries are trying to settle their differences and work together.

276,"Scientists have given new meaning to the words ""jet speed."" In early March, a NASA jet set a new record for speed.
The unpiloted X-43A jet flew nearly 5,000 miles per hour. That is equal to seven times the speed of sound. The aircraft made a 10-second powered flight and then glided for six minutes before plunging into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.
Before taking off on its own, the jet launched from the wing of a plane in midair.
A rocket, which was later released, helped boost the jet's speed.
""Everything worked according to plan. It's been wonderful,"" said NASA's Leslie Williams. ""We've been waiting a few years.""
NASA attempted to fly a similar unmanned jet three years earlier. However, a failure in the launch system caused the flight to explode.
In 1947, American pilot Chuck Yeager became the first person to fly at
speed, or faster than the speed of sound. NASA hopes its record-breaking feat will lead to a new era of supersonic flight for military, business, and space ventures.

198,"""May I stay up just a little longer?"" That's the cry heard from kids every night in many U.S. households. That's because most kids don't want to go to bed.
Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks.
The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8? hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said.
Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said.
In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should.
Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school.
Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep.
Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' ""
If a kid loses one hour of sleep a night, how many hours of sleep does he or she lose in a week? A month? A year?

In Washington, Dana spent a day with U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut. Dodd, a Democrat, was first elected to the Senate in 1980.
Dana met the senator at 8:30 a.m. at the National Archives, where many of the country's most famous documents are kept. The senator showed Dana several of those documents, including the Constitution and the Emancipation Proclamation.
During the next eight hours, Dana learned what a U.S. senator does. ""Senator Dodd is very busy,"" Dana said later. ""But he always had time for a smile and to explain to me what he was doing. I had lots of fun spending the day with him."" Here's what the
reporter learned during her day with Senator Dodd.
After visiting the National Archives, Dana and Senator Dodd go to the Russell Office Building, where most senators have their offices. While Dana waits for the senator to return from a meeting, she does some work at the senator's desk.
Dana and Senator Dodd walk to a meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The committee is meeting to consider President George W. Bush's nomination of Richard Armitage as deputy secretary of state.
Dana and the senator head to the Senate Chamber in the Capitol. The Capitol is located a short distance from the Russell Office Building. The two take a special subway that connects the office building to the Capitol. Usually, only government officials ride on the subway. Dodd and the other senators are meeting in the Senate Chamber to vote on a bill. It is the first of six votes the senators will cast throughout the day.

To meet the city's rules banning high-sugar foods from schools, Snapple had to create four new 100-percent juice drinks.

410,"South America's frog populations are on the decline. That spells trouble for the environment.
Ecuador is home to hundreds of types of frogs and toads. But now scientists are worrying about their health.
The mountains and thick forests of Ecuador, in South America, are home to 417 types of frogs and toads. Tiny red-eyed tree frogs hide inside flowers. Bumpy-skinned toads use their sticky tongues to catch mosquitoes and other prey. Colorful poison dart frogs rest on tree branches. These brightly colored frogs are packed with poison, which protects them from their enemies.

, or died out, in North and South America in the last 100 years. ""It's the same magnitude event as the extinction of the dinosaurs,"" says scientist Luis Coloma.
. Amphibians are animals with backbones that spend part of their life in water and part on land. Frogs and toads lay jellylike eggs in water. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, which breathe through gills. As the tadpoles grow into frogs or toads, they develop lungs and live on land.
Like reptiles, such as lizards and snakes, amphibians are
. That means their body temperature depends on the environment. Unlike reptiles, amphibians lack protective scales. Amphibians must live near water so that their skin stays moist.
Over the last 50 years, many amphibian species have become extinct. Two of every five of the 3,046 species that live in North and South America are at risk of vanishing.
Why are these creatures in trouble? Their
is being destroyed as loggers cut down trees to make room for farms and roads. A habitat is a place in nature where a plant or an animal makes its home. Disease, weather changes, and pollution are other causes of the decline in amphibian populations.
Scientists are concerned about the decrease in the number of frogs. The health of frogs is closely linked to the health of the environment. ""Amphibian extinction is an indicator of [a problem with the environment],"" scientist Jonathan Campbell told
Because amphibians breathe through their skin, they easily absorb pollution. They are usually the first to disappear when the environment is under threat. As a result, some frogs are born with
, or wrongly shaped, body parts, such as extra legs and eyes. When frogs with strange body parts are found in an area, it is a clue that the environment is polluted or suffering.
Scientists are fighting to save amphibians. Some scientists believe that South America's poison dart frogs have chemicals in their body that can be used to treat diseases, such as cancer. The scientists want governments to pass laws that will reduce pollution and to create parks that protect the amphibians' habitat.
""Almost half of the extinctions are happening for unknown reasons,"" scientist Robert Kaplan told
. ""Scientists have a lot of work to do, and quickly.""
Here are some of Ecuador's threatened frogs and toads.

To learn about elephant seals, go to
Until recently, however, those beaches were quieter because elephant seals were almost extinct. But in the last few years, the seals have made one of the most amazing comebacks of any animal.
Nearly a century ago, only 100 elephant seals were left in the wild. Hunters had killed the animals for their

In 1972, the U.S. government passed a law protecting elephant seals. Now, because of that law, more than 150,000 of the seals live in the wild.
Elephant seals spend much of the year swimming in the Pacific Ocean, far from shore. The seals are looking for food, such as fish and squid. They can swim about 35 miles from shore and dive as deep as 5,000 feet below the ocean surface to search for food. (That's about as deep as a whale can dive!)
By December, elephant seals head for beaches in California and Mexico. They hit the beaches to mate and raise their young. When male elephant seals, called
, haul themselves out of the water, they can weigh as much as 4,500 pounds, or two small cars.
Ao Nuevo is Spanish for ""New Year.""
The world's largest colony of elephant seals spends the winter at the Ao Nuevo State Reserve in California. As many as 5,000 elephant seals spend the winter there. Visitors to the reserve can see the giant seals. One visitor said the animals are ""a cross between a beanbag and a Volkswagen bug.""
However, visitors have to watch out for the giant animals. Seals may look fat and slow, but they anger quickly and can move 20 feet in two seconds.
Some visitors are scientists who want to figure out ways to help seals survive.
One way scientists have learned about elephant seals is by attaching radios to the backs of the animals. The radios send out signals. The radios have helped scientists learn how far and how deep elephant seals swim.

87,"Journey to the Center of the Earth
What's under your feet? If you look at the ground, that question is answered easily. But dig a little deeper-about 4,000 miles deeper. That's where you will find Earth's core.
No one has ever journeyed to the center of Earth. However, scientists are trying to figure out what's there.
For a long time scientists believed that Earth's core is made of solid iron and nickel metals. Now, according to a new theory, or idea, a powerful nuclear reactor is located in Earth's core.
Earth may not be the only planet in the solar system that houses a nuclear reactor. Some scientists say nuclear reactions occur at the centers of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
All four of those planets give off, or radiate, more energy than they get from the sun. The scientists say a large energy source must lie hidden deep inside those planets.
Inside Earth's core, atoms, or tiny particles, of uranium split apart. When the atoms split, they give off lots of heat.
Scientist J. Marvin Herndon says the nuclear reaction in the core triggers volcanoes, moves the giant plates of rock that make up Earth's surface, and causes a magnetic field to surround our planet.
Earth has a magnetic field similar to a magnet's. Just like a magnet, Earth has a north pole and a south pole. The north pole has a positive magnetic charge; the south pole has a negative charge.
Earth's magnetic field changes over time. Over long periods of time, the magnetic poles move around. Sometimes the magnetic field completely disappears.
Herndon says the nuclear reaction at Earth's core causes those changes. He says the nuclear reaction changes. Sometimes it gives off lots of energy. At other times, it gives off less energy. And sometimes it stops for a short time.
If there is a nuclear reactor in Earth's core, someday it will stop completely. That would cause volcanoes to stop erupting, Earth's plates to stop moving, and the magnetic field to disappear forever.
The magnetic field protects Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. If the field disappears, life on Earth would end. But don't worry about that. The nuclear reaction in the core will not stop for 2 billion years, Herndon says.

Ostriches are the world's biggest birds. They have plump, round bodies covered with feathers, and long, skinny necks covered with soft fluff. Male ostriches weigh up to 350 pounds and can grow up to 8 feet tall. That's a foot taller than basketball player Shaquille O'Neal!
Ostriches don't fly. Instead, they use their wings to attract mates, alert other ostriches to danger, and keep their balance. Being stuck on the ground doesn't slow ostriches down, though. They can run as fast as a car can travel--up to 50 miles an hour for about 30 minutes.
At the farm in South Africa, the ostriches roam an area of flat land almost the size of 200 football fields. The workers at the farm take care of the ostrich eggs--the biggest of all bird eggs. At almost 3 pounds, each egg is about the size of a football. Even though an ostrich egg looks fragile, it is very strong. You could put a 300-pound weight on the egg without cracking its shell. Believe it or not, even a baby elephant could sit on an ostrich egg!

Loud parents are a growing problem at youth sporting events. Nearly 60 percent of people think that parent behavior in youth sports is worse today than it was five years ago, according to the National Association of Youth Sports. ""Parents are trying to yell and scream to make their kids play better, and that just doesn't work,"" sports expert and former coach Gregory Dale told
Dale and other sports experts are fans of an idea called ""Silent Saturdays."" Silent Saturdays are special game days during which parents aren't allowed to yell, scream, shout, or even speak. They can only clap to celebrate good plays and whisper to each other. Sports programs from California to New Jersey have instituted Silent Saturdays. Is quieting the sidelines a good call?
Silence helps keep parents' behavior under control.
Some sports leagues think zipping parents' lips is a great idea. The Dynamo Soccer Association in Bourbonnais, Illinois, started having Silent Saturdays last year. ""We're not trying to punish parents,"" Dynamo Soccer board member Ben Smith told
""It's just a stress-free day for the kids.""
At first, some parents were skeptical, or unsure, of the idea. But Smith says the quiet games were a big success. Instead of shouting, parents held encouraging signs and applauded. Everyone could hear the kids talking to each other on the field during the games. ""There was no negative criticism throughout the day,"" adds Smith. This year, the Dynamo board is considering two Silent Saturdays, and nearby soccer leagues are giving the program a try.
Parents should be allowed to cheer on their kids.
Silence doesn't work for everyone. For example, two grandparents in Bourbonnais were disappointed because they had traveled to cheer at their grandkids' game, but they had arrived on a Silent Saturday. Some experts think keeping family members quiet isn't the solution. ""Parents hate it,"" Jim Thompson, head of Positive Coaching Alliance, told
""If you want parents to be positive, this is not the best way to do it.""
Thompson says the solution is to train parents to cheer in a way that promotes
or fair play. Thompson prefers ""Honor the Game Days"" to Silent Saturdays. What's the difference? ""Rather than telling parents to be quiet, at Honor the Game Days, [we tell parents] how to support their kids,"" he says.

Guide horses are usually between 26 and 27 inches tall and weigh between 80 and 100 pounds-about the same size as many guide dogs.

Petting can distract a guide animal from its job of keeping a blind person safe. Cuddles and Shaw have traveled many places together, including the Empire State Building in New York City.

Temperatures are on the rise in Antartica. What does that mean for emperor penguins and other wildlife?
Emperor penguins and other Antarctic wildlife ""feel the heat"" as their icy home melts away.
In the hit documentary March of the Penguins,
emperor penguins make an amazing journey. They cross the vast continent of Antarctica, a frozen area that surrounds the South Pole. The penguins leave their ocean homes and cross the ice on a dangerous trip. They are blinded by blizzards and toppled over by strong winds. But each winter, they do this to lay their eggs and raise their chicks.
That cycle of life may be in trouble though. Scientists have discovered an alarming rise in temperatures around Antarctica. ""The region at the peninsula has warmed up about 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 40 to 50 years,"" Wayne Trivelpiece, a scientist who studies Antarctica, told Weekly Reader.
A recent study also shows that the ocean near the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed since the 1960s. A
is a stretch of land surrounded on three sides by water. A change in temperature could spell trouble for penguins, whales, seals, and other creatures at the South Pole.
Although researchers are certain about the increase in temperatures, they are still unsure about the cause. Many scientists blame
the gradual rise in Earths average temperature.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth. Temperatures there rarely reach above freezing. Although it is too cold for humans to permanently live there, many animals swim in the icy waters surrounding the continent. Penguins, for example, waddle across the ice and dive into the cold ocean waters in search of food. They eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called
In warmer water, however, krill have trouble surviving. ""Warming temperatures have led to a decline in sea ice,"" says Trivelpiece. ""Sea ice holds the food that krill need to survive. Without the ice, there is less food for krill and without the krill, the penguins are not surviving.""
These changes could upset the balance of the food chain and endanger larger animals and birds. A loss of penguins could leave leopard seals and whales hungry. (See

Some heat from greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is necessary. Without them, Earth would be too cold to support life. But burning fossil fuels can release too much carbon dioxide into the air, which can cause temperatures to rise.
Scientists are working to persuade governments to reduce their use of greenhouse gases. Experts say that if greenhouse gases continue to gather in the air, temperatures will likely be higher by 2100 than any time in human history.

Scientists found the lemurs on Madagascar, an island nation off the southeast coast of Africa. Madagascar is home to more than 30 species of lemurs. Most lemurs are the size of small rodents, but some can grow to be as large as a medium-sized dog. Lemurs are usually
animals, which means they mostly sleep during the day and come out at night.
The discovery surprised scientists. ""It's incredibly rare to discover a new species of primate, let alone three new species,"" said Steven Goodman of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.
Lemurs live only in the island nations of Madagascar and Comoros.
The smallest lemur weighs about 1 ounce.
The newly discovered species live only in the rain forests along Madagascar's west coast. They weigh a few ounces and eat beetles, fruits, and plants.
All lemurs on Madagascar are in trouble, however. Scientists fear that lemurs are in danger of becoming extinct.
One threat is from people cutting down the trees in which lemurs live. The trees are being cleared to create farmland. Another threat to lemurs comes from hunters who are trapping the primates for food.
To protect lemurs and the rain forests in which they live, wildlife officials in Madagascar have set up special parks and nature reserves. Loggers and hunters cannot cut down the trees or hunt the animals in the nature reserves.
Scientists hope that the special areas are large enough to protect all the species of lemurs that are living today. Scientists are especially concerned because there may be undiscovered species that need protection. ""So many areas of Madagascar haven't been [explored],"" said Dean Gibson of the Duke University Primate Center. ""I think there are more [species] to find.""

Such legends are important to native Hawaiians. Today, however, ancient gods are a part of a fiery debate in this land of spirits.

Currently, scientists use 13 telescopes in a special 11,000-acre area called the Science Reserve on Mauna Kea. Using those telescopes, scientists have made several important astronomical discoveries. The scientists who use the telescopes pay a fee to the University of Hawaii, which built the observatories.
The use of the mountain for scientific research, however, is the source of a debate between scientists and some native Hawaiians. Some Hawaiians believe that the top of Mauna Kea is sacred, or an important place to their religion. They believe that the peak is the home of the snow goddess Poli'ahu.
According to officials at the Center for Hawaiian Studies, the university is making money from the site without sharing much of the money with native Hawaiians.
""We don't get a penny from Mauna Kea, and it's our land,"" said Jon Osorio, of the Center for Hawaiian Studies.
University officials say that a master plan, completed in June, addresses native Hawaiian concerns. The goals of the plan include educating people about Mauna Kea. It also states how many telescopes the university can build in the future.

A year after the devastating tsunami that hit southern Asia, rebuilding efforts continue in full force.
Each day, 10-year-old Sarjm walks through the hot sand and past
the rubble where homes used to stand. He can see and even taste the ocean. The ocean used to make him happy. It provided fishermen like his father a way of making a living.
But on December 26, 2004, the ocean turned black and changed his village. It left behind destruction and fear. A memorial outside his school is a constant reminder of the 49 schoolchildren who lost their lives in the tsunami that struck on that date.
Debris of beach resorts washed away in the December 26 Indian Ocean tsunami at Khao Lak, Thailand, seen December 30.
The young boy talks about how his older brother and younger sister were both ""taken by the black wave."" Clapping his hands together, he told
Sadly, it is a story shared by thousands of other children. Sarjm lives in Kottapalli, a fishing village located at the southernmost tip of India. India was one of 12 countries devastated by last years tsunamione of the worst natural disasters in history. The series of gigantic waves, which resulted from an undersea earthquake, flattened coastlines and reduced fishing villages to rubble. More than 280,000 people died.
Now, one year later, many people are still homeless. But slowly, smiles are returning, and laughter once again rings through some of the fishing villages. Relief agencies have been working to help rebuild homes, schools, and lives with donations from people around the world.
Some of those donations came from American students who
or came together, to raise money to help people affected by the tsunami. From schools in small towns to those in big cities, students held bake-a-thons, participated in read-a-thons, and even sold their own belongings at garage sales. The pennies, quarters, and dollars are helping rebuild homes and bringing hope to children whose hearts and lives were shattered.
Nine-year-old Selso, who lives in a fishing village near Sarjms village, was one of those children. Before the tsunami destroyed his home, Selso, his sister, and his three brothers had never had a toilet or electricity in their house. Their house had only two rooms, and at night they all slept together on the dirt floor. ""We knew people who died, but my family was lucky,"" Selso told Weekly Reader. ""We only lost our home.""
Selsos mother used to worry about scorpions and snakes getting inside, but now all that has changed. Volunteers from Habitat for Humanity worked with Selsos family to construct a new home with electricity and plumbing. Habitat for Humanity volunteers build homes with families who have suffered. The organization plans to build 10,000 homes in the area during the next two years. ""This is the happiest day for my family,"" says Selsos dad, Michel. ""My children now have a safe, dry home where they can do their homework.""
With the help of relief agencies, some schools have also opened. Many are housed in temporary locations under thatched roofs. Classrooms are also beginning to receive textbooks and other much-needed supplies.
""When a school opens in a disaster zone, everyone feels a sense of hope,"" said Carol Bellamy, the executive director of the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), after the disaster. The U.S. Agency for International Development is another organization that has helped build playgrounds where children can enjoy new equipment.
As rebuilding efforts continue, many children remain terrified of the ocean. Volunteers have worked with Sarjm and other kids to talk about what happened. ""I was afraid to go back to the ocean,"" Sarjm says, ""but we were taught that the tsunami was very rare and would not happen again. I am not afraid to look at the water anymore.""
Why is it important to feel safe? What makes you feel safe at home? at school?
After the tsunami, countries in southern Asia began to put together a plan for a warning system in the Indian Ocean. Earlier this year, the U.S. government also announced a plan to improve the U.S. warning system by 2007. Under the plan, the number of devices that monitor waves from a tsunami will be increased. The warning system would provide an alert for U.S. coasts ""within minutes, and in some cases, within seconds of a tsunamis formation,"" according to scientist John Marburger.

People saw green, blue, and red lights. The lights formed different patterns. Some looked like rings. Others looked like curtains. And still others looked like pillars. The lights continually changed shape and color.
are also called the northern lights and southern lights.
Usually, only people living close to the North Pole and South Pole see auroras. But auroras were unusually active this fall. Even people in Arizona saw the lights.
Auroras are caused by the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The solar wind is made of tiny particles that stream away from the sun. Earth's magnetic field is similar to the field that surrounds a magnet. When the solar wind strikes Earth's magnetic field, gases in our atmosphere glow. Those glowing gases form an aurora.
The kind of glowing gas determines an aurora's color. Glowing oxygen makes red, yellow, and green auroras. Glowing hydrogen and helium make blue and purple auroras.
Don't worry if you missed the colorful auroras in October. An aurora can form at any time of year. If the solar wind continues to be as strong as it was in the fall, you may see the northern lights on any clear night.
The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth. You could line up more than 1 billion hot dogs end to end between Earth and the sun.
If you could drive to the sun in your family's car, it would take you nearly 2 million years. That's if you drove 55 miles per hour and didn't take any rest stops.
Light from the sun travels a lot faster than you can in your car. A beam of light travels at about 186,000 miles per second. It takes sunlight a little more than 8 minutes to reach Earth.

or the variety of plants and animals in a particular area. The Amazon is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant diversity. It is home to the biggest flower in the world, a bird-eating spider, and a monkey about the size of a toothbrush.
Scientists estimate that they have identified only a small number of all species that live in the rain forest. As loggers and farmers destroy the forest, animals and plants may become extinct before they are discovered.
Deforestation affects people too. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines we need come from the rain forest.
The Amazon is often called the ""lungs of the world."" Its trees clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans. Carbon dioxide is a
Greenhouse gases trap the suns heat close to Earth. Without the trees in the rain forest, the Earths climate would become much hotter.
Stopping the destruction of the rain forest is not an easy task. Brazils government recently created two national parks in the Amazon rain forest. The governments efforts placed 3.7 million acres of rain forest off-limits for development. The protected area is more than twice the size of Maryland.
Others think that this is not enough. ""The single most important factor contributing to forest loss is population growth in Brazil,"" scientist Jim Bowyer of the University of Michigan told
""People make the forest their home. All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive.""
Scientists estimate that if deforestation continues at its current rate, the rain forest may survive only another 40 to 50 years. ""We need to address the real causes of deforestation, like poverty and population growth,"" says Bowyer. ""Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest.""

And they're off! Teams of specially trained dogs are racing to the finish line across one of the toughest terrains in the world.
Along a jagged trail of snow and ice, the teams battle Alaska's below-zero temperatures. They are competing in the Iditarod (igh-DIT-ah-rod) Trail Sled Dog Race, which kicked off on March 6.
The Iditarod is the longest sled dog race in the world. This year, about 90 sled dog teams are running the roughly 1,110-mile route.
The race, now in its 32nd year, starts in the city of Anchorage and ends in the city of Nome. The stretch of land the teams must cross is almost equal to the distance from New York City to Miami.
A team of 12 to 16 dogs tow each sled. It can take more than two weeks for teams to complete the race. In 2002, a record holder completed the race in 8 days, 22 hours, 46 minutes, and 2 seconds.

During their journey, mushers set up camp to make sure the dogs get enough food, water, and rest. The mushers and dogs are required to stop for at least one 24-hour period and two 8-hour periods.
Not surprisingly, dog mushing is Alaska's state sport. Before mushing became a popular sport, dog teams served as an important form of transportation.
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, miners discovered gold in Alaska. Thousands of people traveled there for the gold rush.
During that time, sled dogs helped people get from place to place and transported gold, mail, and supplies. ""Dog teams were important to settling Alaska during this time,"" race director Joanne Potts told

that the race is as much about the people, culture, and landscape of Alaska as it is about the dogs. ""I've been interested in the Iditarod since I was a kid,"" he said. ""To experience this race firsthand is like a dream come true.""
In January 1959, Alaska became the 49th state. More than twice the size of Texas, Alaska is the largest state.
Alaska's nickname is ""The Last Frontier"" because much of the land is wilderness that remains unsettled.
Mount McKinley, in Alaska, is the tallest mountain in North America.
In 1867, the United States bought Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million, or about 2 cents per acre.
Contrary to popular belief, Alaska is not one giant icebox! In some parts of the state, summer temperatures can reach into the 80s.

Tensions further increased when North Korea's leader, Kim Jong II, opened up nuclear power plants. The power plants had been closed under an agreement that North Korea made with the United States nearly ten years ago. Officials in North Korea say the power plants will only be used to generate electricity.
However, people in the United States and countries near North Korea, like South Korea and Japan, are concerned. They think that North Korea will use the plants make nuclear arms. North Korea recently kicked out U.N. weapons inspectors. That only added to the mistrust.

Republicans and Democrats compete for control of Congress.
The countdown to Election Day has begun. On November 7, Americans will head to the polls to vote in the
Midterm elections happen in the middle of a presidents term in office. (Voters choose a president every four years. The next presidential election is in 2008.)
Members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate meet in the Capitol in what is called a joint session.
Midterm elections give voters a chance to choose people to represent their state in
Members of Congress make up the U.S.
Congress, the legislative branch of government, makes our nations laws.
On Election Day, candidates will compete for 33 of 100 seats in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Elections for governors will also be held in 36 states.
Members of Congress typically belong to one of the two main
in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about government goals. This election will decide whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party controls Congress for the next two years.
Republicans currently have control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Republicans have had the upper hand in the House since 1994. Republicans have also controlled the Senate for most of the past 12 years.
A party controls the House of Representatives or the Senate when its members win a
or more than half, of the seats in it. (See
.) Why is control of Congress so important? The party in power can more easily accomplish its goals and shape U.S. law.
For months, representatives from both political parties have tried to win over voters. Their members have been speaking about important issues, or problems, our country faces. Some of those issues are the war in Iraq, gas prices, and health care. (See
""Our country is facing some serious challenges here and around the world,"" Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told
""At home, our economy has made it harder and harder for working people to make ends meet."" He added that ""the war in Iraq and emerging threats from other nations present new challenges to our national security.""
""Our top priority is to ensure that we continue to keep Americans safe while spreading freedom and democracy abroad,"" Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told
""Republicans will also work to keep taxes and healthcare prices low so that families have more money to spend on things that are important to them.""
Which party will come out on top in this election? Its up to the voters to decide.
Here are some key issues on voters minds this election season.
Recent polls show that Americans support for the war in Iraq has dropped. President George W. Bush and many Republicans say the war is an important part of making the United States safer. Many Democrats say its time to rethink U.S. strategy in Iraq.
Gas prices have been high for the last year. Only recently have they begun to dip. Many voters are worried about the high cost of gas. They want to hear plans for making gas more affordable.
About 45 million Americans dont have health insurance. If they get sick, it will be difficult for them to pay for medical care and drugs on their own. Voters are looking for ways in which the government can make health care more affordable.

, or types, of fish that scientists counted in the world's oceans in 2004 as part of a 10-year study. That means more than two new species of fish were discovered each week last year!
About 1,000 scientists from 70 countries are participating in the ocean count. They will finish their study in 2010.
Water covers about two-thirds of Earth's surface. The five main oceans are the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian, the Arctic, and the Southern.
This map shows the five main oceans.
So far, scientists have discovered nearly 15,500 species of fish in the world's oceans. They are among 230,000 known plants and animals living beneath the ocean's surface.
Scientists believe that they may find up to 2 million life-forms by the time they complete their count. ""We have barely skimmed the surface,"" said one scientist.
Why are scientists conducting the study? They want to learn more about the oceans, which are among the least-known parts of Earth's surface. Scientists say species found below 1,200 feet are 50 times more likely to be new. One scientist involved in the study said that less is known about the ocean than is known about ""the far side of the moon.""
Scientists plan to use the results of the study to prevent people from overfishing. They also want to use the information to protect ocean life.
Scientists have added some new ocean creatures to their growing list.
A previously unknown creature was found that lives near Antarctica. It has eight arms and is related to the octopus.
Coral-like algae were found in the waters off Alaska. The hard red plants look like toy jacks.
An ocean creature related to the jellyfish could be new. It was found in Arctic waters.

The size of an elephant should make it easy to spot, right? That is not the case for some elephants in India.
Several elephants in New Delhi--the capital of that Asian country--have been hit by cars and killed. So a wildlife group has begun fitting the elephants with safety reflectors.
The reflectors work like the ones you find on a bike, bouncing back light from oncoming cars. The reflectors are attached to ropes that hang near an elephant's tail and hind legs.
In New Delhi, about 30 elephants work at night to help clear fallen trees. Many elephants are also forced to walk in the dark, after working at weddings and other religious festivals late at night. The elephants' dark skin makes it difficult for drivers to see them in the evening.

is a made-up tale that is often accepted as truth. Now an American scientist claims he has discovered the remains of Atlantis on the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.
According to the age-old myth, Atlantis was a place of great wealth. The ancient kingdom gleamed with gold and silver and was a center for art and learning.
Over time, the people there became corrupt and greedy. As punishment, the gods unleashed powerful earthquakes and floods that swallowed up Atlantis and sank it to the ocean floor.
The only account of this legendary lost land comes from the long-ago writings of Plato. He was an ancient Greek writer who lived about 2,500 years ago. People don't know how much of Plato's text is factual, because he wrote about an event that had happened 9,000 years before his time.
Robert Sarmast, the American scientist behind the recent claim, performed sonar tests of the Mediterranean seafloor. Sonar tests use sound waves to find underwater objects.
Sarmast believes that he has found Atlantis in the Mediterranean Sea, between Syria and Cyprus.
Sarmast says his tests revealed human-made walls and structures that matched Plato's description. ""If you compare [my findings to Plato's description], you will be astonished,"" Sarmast told reporters. ""We hope that future expeditions will bring back physical proof.""
A scientist from Germany says the newly found ruins are underwater volcanoes that spewed mud, not the remains of Atlantis. Other scientists say the only location for Atlantis was Plato's imagination.

The old saying is true-you are what you eat! That's because your health depends on what you put into your body. Here are some nutrients you might find in breakfast foods:
Complex carbohydrates found in foods such as cereal provide your body with energy. Your body stores up the energy and uses it when you need it!
Protein also supplies your body with energy and helps fight infection. Eggs and cheese are good sources of protein.
Vitamins and minerals help the body grow. Milk and other dairy products provide your body with vitamin D and calcium, a mineral that helps build strong teeth and bones. Fruits and vegetables are good sources of vitamins and minerals. You should eat at least five servings of them a day.

Breakfast eaters also have another reason to smile. Eating breakfast in the morning helps keep tooth decay at bay.
A new study found that kids who do not eat breakfast are more likely to have tooth decay than kids who do. Why? Kids who skip breakfast tend to reach for sugary snacks during the day.
Experts say that if you find yourself crunched for time in the morning, don't rule out breakfast. Being creative with your morning routine can help you make time.
You might try planning your outfit the night before or getting up 10 minutes early. Some families even set the breakfast table before going to bed.

218,"Technology brings past U.S. leaders into the present.
George Washington and Abraham Lincoln are taking a step out of the history books. Two new presidential museums are using the cutting edge of technology to tell the stories of past U.S. presidents.
A group of students from nearby Rockledge Elementary School recently took a trip to Washington's home in Mount Vernon, Virginia. There, they saw a lifelike statue of Washington mounted on his horse during the Revolutionary War (17751783). The statue is an exhibit in a new museum at Mount Vernon.
""It was cool!"" 10-year-old Jack Eghtessad from Woodbridge, Virginia, told
describing the statue. ""It didn't look fake.""
At the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, students from the city's Iles Elementary School gasped. Lincoln's ghost appeared before them in the museum's library. ""I felt like I was really seeing Lincoln,"" exclaimed Samantha Mackey, 11.
or changing, the way kids learn about presidents. Recently, historians have started using more special effects to tell the stories of famous leaders. The new Mount Vernon museum has been open for only four months, but already it has drawn more than 90,000 visitors. February 19 will be the first Presidents' Day it is open.
Experts used paintings, historical documents, and the latest digital technology to create three statues of Washington for Mount Vernon. One of the statues shows Washington at age 19. Another statue depicts him at age 45, leading the Continental Army in the fight for
or freedom, against the British. The third shows him at 57, when he became the first U.S. president. (See
The museum is also home to a special-effects theater that plays a
or true-to-life movie, about Washington's life. As the film plays, the theater's seats rumble with the cannon fire of major battles. Fake snow even falls from the ceiling as the film shows Washington crossing the Delaware River in a surprise attack on the British military in 1776.
""We are, in a way, definitely on the cutting edge,"" says Ann Bay, the Mount Vernon museum's educational director. ""We were inspired by the Lincoln museum.""
Springfield's Lincoln museum reopened with new special-effects exhibits in 2005. Since then the museum has averaged more than 12,000 visitors a week. Visitors can see a life-size re-creation of Lincoln and his family, use interactive computer stations, and tour the ""ghost library.""
make it look as if ghosts of Lincoln and other historical figures appear in the room. Lincoln historian Thomas Schwartz told
that the special effects draw students into Lincoln's story. In one exhibit, visitors watch as an electronic ticker counts the more than 618,000 Americans who were killed while Lincoln was president during the Civil War (18611865). They see Lincoln's sad reaction to the huge death toll.
""These are real people that had real tragedy, real joy, and real emotion in their lives. People need to understand that,"" Schwartz says. He thinks that special effects help get that point across to visitors.
This life-size model of Washington at age 19 gives visitors a glimpse of the first U.S. president in his youth. Washington was born into a wealthy Virginia family. His first job was mapping out land. He then joined the British army and fought in the French and Indian War (17541763). During the Revolutionary War (17751783), he led the Continental Army against the British to win American independence. In 1789, he was elected the first president of the United States.
Unlike Washington, Lincoln did not have enough money to pay for school. This wax statue shows Lincoln teaching himself by reading between chores. He went on to become a successful lawyer, and in 1860 he was elected the 16th U.S. president. He led the country during the Civil War (18611865) between the states in the North and the South. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation ended slavery in 1863. He was killed in office shortly after the war ended.
In what ways might special effects help students learn history?

Washington's widow, Martha, freed her husband's slaves on January 1, 1801. Martha was carrying out the wishes of the country's first president, who had died on December 14, 1799. In his will he had requested that his slaves be freed after his wife's death.
During the ceremony, Alexander, a descendant of a slave who worked at Mount Vernon, told visitors, ""I hope you all feel, as I do, a sense of joy, a sense of sadness but also a sense of hope that the contributions of good people will always be remembered.""
Jennifer Saxon, a spokesperson for Mount Vernon, told
that Mount Vernon couldn't have prospered without slave labor. ""Slaves did most of the work,"" she said.
When Washington was born, many Americans owned slaves. Those people used slaves to plant crops and perform many other duties. Most people thought slavery was OK. When Washington was 11 years old, his father died and left him ten slaves.
During the American Revolution, which began in 1775, some people began to think that slavery was wrong and should be ended. Washington was one of those people. He vowed never to buy another slave.
In his will, Washington wrote that all his slaves should be freed. ""Upon the [death] of my wife,"" he wrote, ""it is my...desire that all the slaves which I hold in my own right shall receive their freedom.""
To make sure Washington's wishes were carried out, Martha freed his slaves in 1801, a year before she died. Martha, however, kept the slaves she owned when she freed her husband's slaves.
Even though Washington freed the slaves he owned, slavery remained legal in some states for another 64 years, until 1865. Slavery did not end in the United States until after the Civil War ended it.

If you have had a cavity, you have probably felt the bite of a dentist's whirling drill as it cuts into your tooth. Soon, however, the dentist may no longer need a drill.
Tooth decay is a disease. So dentists at Harvard University decided to fight the disease that causes cavities. ""We decided to try to beat the disease, rather than just drill and fill [cavities],"" said dentist Daniel Smith.

, or germs, that live on teeth. The germs make an acid that causes cavities.
The vaccine is a new way to prevent tooth decay. Brushing after meals and cutting back on sweets are two other weapons used to fight cavities.
, a chemical that strengthens teeth, also fights cavities. Fluoride is added to water and toothpaste. But many countries can't afford to put fluoride in water, and fluoride doesn't kill cavity-causing bacteria.
""[Tooth decay] is an epidemic worldwide,"" Smith said. ""Even if you have fluoride, you still have the bug [that causes tooth decay].""
So far, the scientists have tested the vaccine on rats. The rats that took the vaccine didn't get many cavities.
Now the scientists want people to try the vaccine. If it works, dentists may have a lot less drilling to do--other than drilling it into people's heads to remember to take the vaccine!

President George W. Bush and many members of the U.S. Congress think so. On October 26, Bush signed the Secure Fence Act of 2006 into law. The law will allow the building of 700 miles of new fencing along the 2,100-mile border between the United States and Mexico.
The fence is designed to keep people from entering the United States without permission. About 6 million illegal immigrants from Mexico live in the United States today. An
is someone who leaves one country to live in another country. If people enter a country without permission, they are called illegal immigrants.
Most illegal immigrants leave Mexico to find jobs in the United States. They usually cant find jobs in Mexico that pay as much as those in the United States do.
Some Americans say illegal immigrants take away jobs from U.S. citizens. Others say, however, that illegal immigrants help the U.S. economy by doing jobs that many Americans dont want.
The signing of the bill led to great anger in Mexico. Mexican officials say a fence would not stop illegal immigration and would be an insult to Mexico. Mexican President-elect Felipe Caldern pledged to challenge the fence at the United Nations. Bush, however, called the fence ""an important step in our nations efforts to secure our borders.""

Two brothers crept carefully through the mountains in China. The boys, along with their mother, sister, and aunt, had fled their home in North Korea. They hoped to find a better life in South Korea.
Like China, North and South Korea are countries in Asia. If the Chinese police had found the family, they would have sent them back to their country to be punished or even killed.
The brothers, Young Hoon* and Young Jun, and their family members walked, rode in cars, and flew on an airplane to reach South Korea. Their journey took about a year.
They were lucky. There are about 200,000 to 300,000 North Koreans now hiding in China. But only about 2,000 of them are expected to make it to South Korea this year.
Young Hoon, Young Jun, and their family members risked their lives to reach South Korea. Why? If they had stayed in North Korea, they faced starvation. Many North Korean children are hungry because their families cannot find food. In fact, over the past ten years, about 2 million people in North Korea have starved to death.
About a year after their arrival, the brothers tell me they are happy in Seoul, the busy capital city of South Korea. I visited Young Hoon and Young Jun at the Hannuri School, an after-school program for teens who have left North Korea and come to South Korea to start new lives.
Teachers at Hannuri help the North Koreans with their schoolwork. Many of the teens did not go to school regularly in North Korea, so they are behind in their lessons.
Even though North and South Korea are neighbors, the two countries are very different. North Korea is very poor. Its leader spends most of the country's money on the army, not on food for the people.
South Korea is more like the United States. The country has enough food for everyone, and most people drive cars, go to work, and eat at restaurants.
Young Hoon, 18, and Young Jun, 15, say that in North Korea they lived in a hut and ate mostly corn and potatoes. In South Korea, their lives are much different. The brothers live in an apartment and eat well. They love movies and video games.
North and South Korea are countries in eastern Asia. Korea used to be one country. It was divided in half after World War II (1939--1945). In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, starting the Korean War (1950--1953). After the Korean War, the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, was set up to divide the two countries. I visited the South Korean side of the DMZ. Everywhere I looked there were soldiers. I wasn't allowed to talk to them because they were on duty.
The brothers tell me about their plans for the future. Young Hoon wants to be a pilot. Young Jun wants to help people. They also hope to do something they never could have even dreamed of while living in North Korea--they want to visit the United States.
Young Jun is already prepared to visit. An American he met on his way to South Korea gave him a U.S. dollar. Despite plenty of opportunities to spend the money in South Korea, Young Jun has kept it. After all, he tells me, he's going to need it when he gets to the United States.

A team of Japanese scientists snapped the first photographs of one of the deep sea's most mysterious creaturesa giant squid. It was the first time a giant squid was photographed in the wild! The researchers took more than 500 pictures of the sea creature off the coast of the Bonin Islands in Japan.
How did scientists nab pictures of the 26-foot-long sea monster? They tracked down the squid by following the only creatures that feed on itsperm whales. Once they determined where the whales dined, the scientists attached a robotic camera to a fishing line with bait. Then they took pictures of the purplish-red squid attacking its prey nearly 3,000 feet beneath the ocean's surface. The squid became caught on the camera but eventually swam away after one of its tentacles broke off. Squid have eight arms, two tentacles, and two huge eyes that can each grow to the size of a volleyball!

Choking had been among the leading causes of death in the United States until the Heimlich maneuver was invented. Henry Heimlich, a doctor from New York, devised the emergency maneuver, which was named after him.
In 1974, Heimlich published his findings. One week later, the new technique first saved a choking victim.
Before Dr. Heimlich's discovery, slapping a choking person on the back was the recommended technique. Studies later showed that backslaps could actually cause an object to get stuck even tighter in a person's throat, causing death.
Today, the Heimlich maneuver is the recommended emergency method for a choking victim. Since the move was first introduced, it has saved more than 60,000 lives.

The 30-foot-wide wings carried Leden about 35 feet into the air. Her flight lasted for 17 seconds.
The plans for Leden's flight were 500 years in the making, but she was airborne for a fraction of a minute.
The story of Leden's flight begins in Italy in the late 1400s. Italy is a country in Europe. At the time, Italy was caught up in the Renaissance. Many great artists lived during the Renaissance.
One of the greatest artists of the Renaissance was Leonardo da Vinci. Though da Vinci is best known for his art, he was also an inventor. He drew many machines that wouldn't actually be built for centuries. For example, he drew pictures of an armored car, a helicopter, a hot-air balloon, and a submarine.
Between 1490 and 1505, da Vinci made several drawings of a glider. A glider is an aircraft that doesn't have an engine. It glides on air currents. The wings that Leden used were based on da Vinci's glider.

No one knew whether the glider would actually fly. Some people worried that if it did fly, the glider might also crash. ""It was the most dangerous flight of my life,"" Leden said after she flew the glider.
Leden flew da Vinci's glider a total of 20 times. Each flight was short, but she didn't crash. Later, Leden said the glider flights were ""very, very thrilling. It shouldn't have worked, but it did!""

Rocky Mountain moose are on the moveand they're flying firstclass. Wildlife workers are using helicopters to send Utah's moose to Colorado. In exchange, wildlife officials in Colorado are capturing bighorn sheep to send to Utah. The animal swap is part of a plan to keep the moose and sheep populations in both states healthy.
Rocky Mountain moose are on the move.
One of the largest moose hauls took place in January, when a single helicopter team captured 24 of the animals in a day. The moose are now roaming free in the Grand Mesa National Forest in Colorado, where the appearance of calves indicates that the moose population is growing. Colorado workers planned to hold up their end of the bargain by capturing 20 bighorn sheep to send to Utah in February.
""This year was a major group move,"" Stephanie Duckett, a biologist with the Colorado Division of Wildlife, told
Biologists are scientists who study living things. Duckett works at Grand Mesa, which didn't have any moose two years ago. ""So far we have moved 90 moose to the mesa,"" she says. Most of those animals came from Weber County, Utah, where the moose population is in trouble.
The moose in northern Utah are threatened by
That means there are too many animals for the environment to feed and support. Overpopulation can lead to animal starvation and disease. ""It's bad for the population and bad for the environment,"" says Duckett.
Wildlife officials often try to prevent overpopulation by issuing permits that allow hunters to kill more animals during hunting season. That wasn't an option with Utah's moose; many of them live on private land where hunting is
or not allowed. Instead, wildlife officials decided to make a trade.
""Here in northern Utah, we have too many moose, and we've lost a lot of our bighorn sheep population,"" Utah wildlife manager Justin Dolling told
Colorado had a healthy supply of bighorn sheep to send to Utah, and Colorado had plenty of room for Utah's extra moose.
Once they had a plan, wildlife officials had to find a way to safely catch the wild mooseone of the largest animal species in North America. They turned to animalcapture expert James Innes and his experienced team of helicopter ""moose muggers."" A moose mugger is an animal worker trained to capture a moose without harming it.

Innes's helicopter chases a moose into a clearing by flying over the forest before dropping a net to catch the animal. Once the moose is down, a moose mugger jumps out of the hovering helicopter and secures the animal's legs. ""You have to use every trick in the book to tie them up,"" says Innes.
Once the moose is secured, it is placed in a canvas bag that hangs from the helicopter and then flown to a base camp. There, a veterinarian, or an animal doctor, gives the moose a checkup before it is placed on a truck and taken to its final destinationGrand Mesa.

There, they heard Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Today, construction of a memorial honoring King is under way about a half mile from the Lincoln Memorial, where King gave that famous speech. The new memorial will be the first on the National Mall to honor an African American.
The groundbreaking ceremony for the King memorial was held on November 13. President George W. Bush, former President William Jefferson Clinton, poet Maya Angelou, and talk show host Oprah Winfrey were among the speakers at the event. ""We give Martin Luther King his rightful place among the many Americans honored on the National Mall,"" Bush told the crowd of about 5,000 people.
King (19291968) dedicated his life to helping others. As a boy growing up in the U.S. South, King witnessed African Americans being treated unfairly. At that time, the South was
or separated by race. Under the law, African Americans were not allowed to attend the same schools as white people and had to sit in the backseats of buses. African Americans also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains.
When King was older, he worked to change those unjust laws. During the 1950s and 1960s, he gave speeches and organized peaceful marches and protests.
Beginning in 1955, King led the famous Montgomery bus boycott to protest segregation. For 381 days, African Americans

King gained national attention from the boycott. As a result of his work, civil rights laws were passed.

The King memorial is scheduled to be completed in 2008. The design uses water, stone, and trees to represent the themes of justice, democracy, and hope. The King memorial will also include a boulder called the Stone of Hope, from which will emerge a 30-foot figure of King. The memorial will contain a circular stone wall chiseled with King's words.
King's dream was for all people to be treated fairly and equally under the law. The design of the memorial is based on a line from his historic ""I Have a Dream"" speech: ""We will be able to hew [cut] out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.""

252,"The Southeast: Exploring the 'Land of the Flowers'
Long before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, Spaniards had explored and settled large parts of what is now the United States.
One of the regions the Spanish explored first was the Southeast. Hernando de Soto and 600 followers were the first European explorers to journey through the Southeast. For nearly four years, de Soto and his followers wandered through the region.
After sailing from Cuba in 1539, de Soto landed in Florida. An earlier Spanish explorer, Juan Ponce de Len, had named the land
, after a Spanish word meaning ""flowery"".
La Florida was much larger then present-day Florida. It covered most of the area in what are now the southeastern states. One of de Soto's men described the animals the explorers found. ""There are many lions and bears in Florida, wolves, deer, jackals, cats and rabbits (also live there),"" he wrote.
Many different groups of Native Americans lived in La Florida. They grew corn, beans and squash. They also fished and hunted.
Because the native groups did not trust de Soto, they often left their villages before the Spaniards arrived. The Native Americans had good reason to fear de Soto. He captured and enslaved some of them.
De Soto and his men were mainly looking for gold. The search for gold led them out of present-day Florida north to what is now Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
After reaching North Carolina without finding gold, the explorers turned west and crossed the Appalachian Mountains. Upon hearing rumors of gold, de Soto led his men into Tennessee and south to Alabama.
In southern Alabama, the Choctaw Indians attacked the explorers. They killed many of de Soto's men, and some of his supplies were taken.
De Soto's expedition then turned northwest through Alabama and into present-day Mississippi. In May 1541, de Soto reached the Mississippi River, near what is now Memphis, Tennessee. Then they crossed into Arkansas, where in May 1542, De Soto died.
The explorers then retreated to the Mississippi River, where they built boats, which sailed down the river to the Gulf of Mexico. Only about half of the people who had landed with de Soto in Florida survived the trek across the Southeast.

The world's newest roller coaster is one wild ride.
As you wait in line, you hear the screams of people riding Kingda Ka. Part of you can't wait to ride the roller coaster; another part of you wants to bolt in the opposite direction. Before you know it, it's your turn to board. You brace yourself.

Congratulations! You have just experienced the fastestand tallestroller coaster on Earth.
Kingda Ka, or the ""King of Coasters,"" opens this spring at the Six Flags Great Adventure theme park in Jackson, New Jersey. The jaw-dropping thrill ride shatters the world's record for roller coaster speed and height. Of the more than 1,000 roller coasters in the United States, it is the latest ""extreme"" coaster to be built.
Six Flags roller coaster designer Larry Chickola says building Kingda Ka wasn't easy. ""We considered the wind strength, the possibility of earthquakes, the weight of Kingda Ka itself, as well as the forces caused by launching a [coaster faster than one] has ever gone,"" he told
enable roller coasters like Kingda Ka to move for most of the ride. According to scientists, energy is the ability to cause change. At the beginning of the ride, Kingda Ka blasts passengers to a speed of 128 miles an hour with technology similar to the kind that launches Navy jets from aircraft carriers. Each train on Kingda Ka is hooked up to a
cable. Liquid under high pressure is pushed through the cable. Along with motors, the hydraulic power rockets the coaster skyward.
After reaching the top of the first hill, the coaster works in the same way your bike does when you roll, pedal-free, down a slope. When a roller coaster is stopped, it has
, or stored energy. At any moment, the coaster can move, so it has the potential for motion.
As the roller coaster starts cruising, gravity takes over and converts the potential energy into
, which is the energy of motion. The repeated changes of potential energy to kinetic energy and then back again drives the roller coaster.
Kingda Ka covers 3,118 feet of track and lasts less than a minute. To roller coaster buff Steve Urbanowicz from New Jersey, the new ride is a scream! ""The ride seems like it's over really quickly, but Kingda Ka packs eight high moments of drama into those 50 seconds,"" he told
Urbanowicz, 46, speaks from experience. He has ridden 876 roller coasters around the world. In fact, he has taken more than 5,000 rides on one in particularthe wooden Cyclone at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, where the first true American coaster opened in 1884. ""I loved going to amusement parks when I was a kid and never grew out of it.""
Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division (reproduction number LC-USZ62-63945)
This illustration from 1886 shows passengers getting a one-minute ride for 5 cents aboard Coney Island's coaster.
The idea for the roller coaster was born in Russia in the 1600s when huge blocks of ice, supported by wood, were made into sleds. Straw or fur covered the icy seats.
Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, is credited with beginning America's amusement park history, in 1875. The nation's first coaster opened there in 1884 and cruised all of 6 miles an hour!
Some of the best coasters of all time were built during the 1920s. That era reigns as the golden age of amusement parks. By the end of the decade, the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression caused many parks to close.
Give another example of potential energy that is being converted into kinetic energy.

""It was amazing,"" said one pilot. ""[The penguins would] all lean back farther and farther as they craned their necks to get a look at the helicopters. Then they'd fall on the ground like a pack of cards.""
Scientists are going to an island near Antarctica to study the problem. The island is home to 400,000 king penguins. King penguins weigh an average 77 pounds and are about 3 feet tall.
The scientists fear the penguin plunge may be causing the penguins to leave their eggs unprotected. As a result, fewer eggs may hatch.
If the scientists find that toppling penguins is a widespread problem, the routes of planes and helicopters flying over the area may be changed.

The long-tailed, tree-dwelling monkey is a highland mangabey (MANG-guh-bee). It is covered with brownish-gray fur and has an off-white belly and tail. The new monkey makes an odd ""honk-bark"" call.
This latest discovery has surprised scientists. ""The chances of finding a large, noisy monkey that no one has ever scientifically described before makes this a rare event indeed,"" says scientist Trevor Jones.
Highland mangabeys are shy creatures. Their shyness makes them difficult to spot. That might explain why scientists were unaware that the species had existed. Another reason is that the monkeys live high in the forest
Scientists are working hard to protect the highland mangabey's environment. It is estimated that fewer than 1,000 of the monkeys live in the wild. Scientists say the discovery shows that there is still a lot to learn about Africa.

Several U.S. states have started cyberschools. One company, K12, recently started a national cyberschool.
K12's founder, William Bennett, believes that K12 and the Internet will give kids a new way to go to school. Bennett said, ""K12 will help connect parents, teachers, and children to one of the most effective educational [tools, the Internet].""
Bennett is not alone in thinking that the Internet can provide an alternative to traditional schools. Kathi Baldwin is a teacher at Valley Pathways, a cyberschool in Palmer, Alaska. She thinks cyberschools are as good as traditional schools. ""We wouldn't do it if we didn't think it could produce an equal education--or better [than traditional education],"" Baldwin said.
Some critics say cyberschools are not as good as traditional schools. Michael Carr is a spokesperson for the National Association of Secondary Principals. He says kids who attend cyberschools don't have as many chances to make friends as other kids do. ""The main worry would be the socialization skills,"" he said.
Lini Hamel, 15, and 400 other students attend the Western Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School (WPCCS). Lini loves the school. ""It has everything. I don't know how to describe it,"" said Lini.
Lini's school and other cyberschools also give kids with severe disabilities a chance to go to school.
Douglas Meikle, 8, is disabled and cannot attend a traditional school. Each morning, the third grader uses a computer in his house to sign on to WPCCS. Then Douglas downloads his assignments. He works with teachers over the computer to complete each assignment. His mother says that the cyberschool has changed Douglas's life.
Aaron Smith, 16, also attends WPCCS. One of the things he likes best about the school is its flexibility. ""You get to work at your own pace,"" he said. ""I don't have to wake up at any certain time. It's just more fun.""

Officials in Singapore, a country in Asia, totally banned chewing gum about ten years ago. Now that country is allowing people to chew some kinds of gum again.
Gum chewers, however, will need a doctor's prescription. A government official said Singapore will allow pharmacies to sell sugarless gum to sick patients if the rubbery substance can help cure them.

Ten years ago, a space shuttle roared into space on a special mission. The astronauts' mission was to put the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit 380 miles above Earth, where it can take better photos of planets, stars, and galaxies than telescopes on Earth can.
During the last decade, Hubble has taken thousands of photos. Many of them have helped scientists learn more about the universe we live in.
The photo shows the Eagle Nebula, a huge cloud of gas in the constellation Serpens. The bright reddish stars that recently formed out of the material that makes up the nebula.
Last December, astronauts worked on the Hubble Space Telescope to repair it and make it even better. Scientists hope the telescope will help them make more amazing discoveries.

Christopher Columbus may be going on one more journey. Scientists have opened a tomb in Spain that they believe contains his bones. The bones are traveling to a laboratory in Spain for testing.
Scientists are trying to solve a mystery: Where is Christopher Columbus buried? The Dominican Republic-an island in Central America-also claims to have the remains of this famous explorer.
In 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain and arrived in North America. He made four trips altogether. Before he died in 1506, he asked to be buried on the island that is today the Dominican Republic. It is part of the area he explored on his third and fourth trips.
When Spain lost control of the island, his body was moved. Spanish officials think it was taken to the island of Cuba before possibly being moved back to Spain. However, the Dominican Republic says the Spanish travelers took the wrong remains. By testing the bones, Spanish scientists hope to get to the truth of the matter.

Most kids who play football get minor bruises and scrapes. Some injure their knees and even break bones. Others get head concussions. But a 10-year-old girl died on September 2. Doctors said a football injury probably caused the fatality.
Taylor Davison, who lived in Illinois, liked to play football. She was the only girl who played in a football league of 400 players.
Taylor played full-contact football. During a practice in August, she complained of a headache and fell down. Three days later, she died. Doctors said she died as a result of a severe blow to the head, possibly caused by a tackle.
Doctors do not know how many child athletes are injured on the playing field each year. ""There is a serious lack of data about what types of injuries are occurring, said Dr. Reginald Washington, a doctor of sports medicine.
Although not enough is known about sports-related injuries among children, Washington and other doctors say kids and coaches can follow certain safety tips. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh give this advice:
Coaches should receive first-aid training. They should also be trained to recognize whether a child athlete has a severe head injury.
Leagues should have rules that require kids to take time off from playing after they have suffered an injury-especially a head injury.
To make sure they are safe, kids should always wear the proper safety equipment when playing any sport.

Last summer, a federal court in California ruled that the pledge is

The court says that the phrase suggests that the government

This May marks the 50th anniversary of a court case that changed history. That case was
. On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that having separate schools for black students and white students violated the U.S. Constitution.
In 1951, Linda Brown, a third-grade student in Topeka, Kansas, was one of many African American children forced to attend black-only schools. Even though the school for white students was just blocks from her house, Linda had to travel all the way across town to an all-black school.
, or separate, public schools were legal at the time--as long as the black and white students had an ""equal"" education. That idea was known as ""separate but equal.""
However, the reality was that segregation was unequal. Schools for black students were generally run-down and overcrowded and lacked supplies. In comparison, schools for white students were newer and had smaller class sizes and better supplies.
When Linda was denied entrance to the all-white school, her father and 12 other parents sued the Topeka school system. The case was eventually heard by the Supreme Court. The Court ruled that ""separate educational facilities are... unequal.""
As a child, Linda Brown was part of the

Rather than finding a smooth surface, scientists discovered a crater near one end of Asbolus 8405. And centaurs are not made entirely of ice, either. Scientists saw material inside the crater that did not look like frozen water. Some scientists now say centaurs are made of a mixture of water, methane, and ammonia ice.

732,"Now you can take a trip to Mars without ever leaving Earth.
A kid reporter journeyed to Mars aboard Disney's new space ride. Find out how close her ride was to the real thing.
kid reporter Sonia Mia Diaz blasted into space on August 22. This 10-year-old from Florida was on a journey to Mars.
Sonia Mia rocketed to Mars aboard a new ride called Mission: SPACE. She experienced the ride during its opening week at Walt Disney World's Epcot Center in Orlando, Florida.
After her mission, Sonia Mia interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the ride's creators. Sonia Mia learned that Disney worked closely with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to develop the new space attraction. The ride lets people experience what a trip to Mars might be like in the future.
On her journey, Sonia Mia never actually left the ground. The ride gives people the feeling of blasting off and traveling through space. ""We really wanted people to feel as close as they could to what it's like to be an astronaut,"" said Bryan.
Sonia Mia read quotes about space exploration as she waited in line. Information about space history fills the attraction. There is even a moon car called a lunar rover on loan from a museum.
Before boarding the shuttle, Sonia Mia and three other riders were given different roles for the mission. Those roles included commander, pilot, navigator, and engineer.
Sonia Mia was assigned to be the engineer. In real life, Sally Ride, the first U.S. woman in space, performed the same role.
After Sonia Mia strapped herself in, the shuttle moved into launch position. The countdown began, and the shuttle blasted off! During the mission, Sonia Mia and her team used buttons and joysticks to perform the tasks associated with their roles. The ride lasted about 4 minutes.
The mission was as intense as Sonia Mia had hoped. What was her favorite part? The liftoff! ""I liked the intensity of the blastoff and the air pressure on my face,"" she said.
So how did the ride live up to a real space shuttle mission? Weekly Reader caught up with NASA astronaut Winston Scott to ask him that question.
Scott launched into space on two shuttle flights. He tested out Mission: SPACE and gave it a big thumbs up. ""It's a thrill a minute,"" he said.
Although no astronauts have been to Mars yet, Scott said the ride's liftoff was realistic. The feeling of moving up the launch pad and being forced back into your seat were similar to those felt on a shuttle.
However, he points out, there are differences. In an actual launch, astronauts feel about three times the force of
. Gravity is the force that pulls things toward Earth.
The blastoff on the ride was also shorter than an actual liftoff. And, he said, riders don't experience weightlessness. On a real space shuttle, astronauts become weightless because there is no gravity.
For many people, the ride brings to mind the courage of space explorers. As Sonia Mia pointed out, ""Going on the ride made me think about how brave astronauts are.""
Sonia Mia Diaz interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the forces behind Mission: SPACE. Here's what Sonia Mia learned.
Imagineers are people who work for Disney.
In general, Imagineering is about storytelling. We build attractions that put people who visit our parks into different worlds and stories. We also use technology to tell stories.
What was your role in creating the ride?
I'm the senior show producer, which is like being a movie director. A movie director guides people and directs the show, including the lighting, music, artists, and motion you experience on the ride.
Where did your team get the inspiration for Mission: SPACE?
People have always had an interest in space. The time and technology were right to create this new space attraction. We worked closely with NASA to develop the science and technology behind the attraction. No one has ever put people into a ride system like this before.
Before the ride, I was warned not to move my head or close my eyes because of motion sickness. I didn't feel sick, but might a person if he or she does those things?
That could happen if you move your head, because of the technology used to create the ride. We give those recommendations because we want people to feel most comfortable. Some people can move their heads, and it doesn't bother them at all.
How many times have you been on Mission: SPACE?
At last count, I've ridden it more than 400 times!

When you come home from school, does your pet dog run to you barking and wagging its tail? Does your cat purr when you pet it? Many pet owners believe that tail wagging and purring are signs that pets are happy.
Most scientists are not sure that animals feel emotions. They say animals never feel happy or sad. In fact, they say, animals probably don't feel love, anger, hate or other emotions either.
Scientist Joseph LeDoux studied rats to find out whether the rodents have emotions. He found that rats do feel at least one emotion--fear. He also found the part of the brain that seems to control fear in rats. In humans, that part of the brain controls fear and some other emotions.
Even though LeDoux says rats feel fear, he doubts that other animals have emotions in the way humans and other primates do. ""A whale may behave as if it's in love,"" he said, ""but you can't prove what it's feeling, if anything.""
A number of scientists say animals do have a range of emotions. Some scientists who have studied such animals as dogs, cats, elephants, lions, and whales say those animals feel emotions. Scientist Joyce Poole studies elephants. She has written that pachyderms often show grief when a relative dies. She says elephants have ""deep emotions.""
Jane Goodall, studies chimpanzees. She says she has seen chimps playing and chasing one another for fun. Goodall also says chimps feel grief. After Flo, a 50-year-old chimp, died, one of her sons, Flint, refused to eat food. Flint's brothers and sisters tried to get him to eat, but they couldn't. Three weeks later, Flint died. Goodall says Flint ""died of grief.""
More recently, scientist Marc Bekoff watched an elk run back and forth through a patch of snow, jumping into the air as it completed each back-and-forth pass. Bekoff said the animal was feeling the ""joy of life.""
Bekoff said he can't prove that animals have feelings, because animals can't talk. But, he said, animals can communicate feelings in other ways. ""I can't prove that another human being is feeling happy or sad,"" he said, ""but I can [guess] how [he or she is] feeling through body language and facial expressions."" Both people and animals use
-- gestures and movements--to communicate without words.

According to this lower court, the words ""under God"" suggest the government

The states that are part of the lower court's ruling include Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. The ruling does not apply to public schools elsewhere in the United States.

Fourth grader Annie Inglese knows how important it is to get the right amount of sleep each night. ""If I don't get enough sleep,"" she says, ""I have trouble getting up in the morning.""
Sleep experts say that kids who do not get a good night's sleep on a regular basis put their safety at risk. Delaying bedtime for other activities can lead to accidents, such as falling off a bike or getting hurt on the playground.
In addition to preventing injuries, children who get enough sleep on a regular basis tend to get better grades and be in a better mood. ""Sleep is just as important as nutrition and exercise in our overall health,"" says Dr. Carl Hunt, a sleep expert with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Estimates show about 1 out of every 4 adults does not get enough sleep. Sleep experts think that number may be just as high for kids. According to the NIH, children ages 7 to 11 need at least nine hours of sleep each night.
Most kids and families today have busy schedules that can keep them from getting enough sleep. Plus, watching television, chatting on the Internet, and playing video games all compete with valuable sleep time.
Going to bed at the same time each night will help you get a good night's sleep. If you have trouble falling asleep, Dr. Hunt advises you to unwind with quiet time. Reading or listening to soothing music can help bring on sleep.

284,"Smack Down! Is Pro Wrestling Bad for Kids?
""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

A new study shows that kids need to lessen their backpack loads.
Chances are youre carrying a heavy burdentoo much weight in your backpack. A new study warns that American kids need to reduce their backpack loads and spread out the weight.
Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, have shown that too much pressure from an overloaded backpack may cause shoulder pain. In addition, an uneven backpack load may lead to pain in the lower back.
Five girls and five boysall 13 years oldparticipated in the study. The kids wore identical backpacks, fitted on the shoulder straps with measuring devices called pressure sensors.
The children first carried 10 percent of their body weight, then 20 percent, and finally 30 percent. With each increase, the kids reported that their pain worsened.
According to previous studies, children typically carry loads that are about 22 percent of their body weight. The new study confirmed that 22 percent of body weight is too high.
Each year an estimated 7,500 emergency room visits result from injuries related to backpacks and book bags, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The researchers hope their information will encourage backpack makers to design wide, well-padded shoulder straps to help spread the weight.
The researchers also hope the results of their study will encourage kids to
or lessen, their loads. ""The weight in the backpack should be minimized as much as possible,"" Brandon Macias, one of the studys lead authors, told
Here are some tips to help you wear your backpack safely.
Dont carry more than 15 percent of your body weight. This means that if you weigh 100 pounds, you should not wear a backpack heavier than 15 pounds.
Choose a backpack that is the right size for your body.
Pack only what you need, and load heaviest items closest to your back.
Always wear both shoulder straps, and fasten the waist strap to balance the backpacks weight evenly.
Adjust shoulder and waist straps so the backpack fits snugly to your body and the weight is evenly balanced.
If your backpack is too heavy, consider using a book bag on wheels, if your school allows it.

Michael, age 7, quickly went into the living room where his mother was sleeping. He woke her up, and the two quickly left the house. They ran to a neighbor's house and called 911. The fire was quickly contained by firefighters.
Michael had recently participated in his school's ""Great Escape"" project for Fire Prevention Week. Michael and his family knew how to exit their home safely during a fire. Firefighter Terrence Campbell of the Glenwood Fire Department said that Michael showed good fire safety behavior. He acted quickly to help his mom leave the house and report the fire, as well as by using a home escape plan to escape danger. ""I feel that his actions from the 1999 ""Great Escape"" project helped Michael know what to do,"" Campbell said.
An escape plan also helped save the lives of the Walker family in Ontario, Canada. Shortly after 3 a.m. on February 18, 1999, a fire began in the ground floor apartment below the Walker apartment. The family awoke to find their apartment filling with smoke.
Everyone reacted immediately. The family put their home fire escape plan into action, and everyone left the building right away and went to their meeting place outside. By the time they got there, flames were racing through the apartment.
Earlier in the school year, 9-year-old twins Ashley and Ryan Walker participated in their school's ""Great Escape"" fire safety program. Mr. Walker says the twins helped the family know what to do when the fire began. ""They pushed the fire procedures,"" he said. ""They learned them at school and had us practice how to get out.""
Although the idea of a fire starting in your home is scary, you can use the prevention skills taught in your school to keep fires from starting in your home. But, if a fire does start, you can prepare your family and yourself by having a ""Great Escape"" plan and practicing it at least twice a year!

Battered communities are continuing to recover from the tornadoes that sent fierce winds and softballsize hail across Missouri, Illinois, Kansas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma.

The previous record was 69 on March 13, 1990. ""For this early in the year, its a heck of a deal,"" says weather expert Joe Schaefer. ""What happens after that is anybodys guess.""
After the thunderstorms caused the series of deadly twisters, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for Michigan and Indiana. If a

The National Weather Service also employs storm spotters to help predict where and when a tornado will strike. The trained volunteers are positioned before a storm hits to report what they see developing in the sky. Their reports confirm what weather forecasters see on their radar screens.
For many, there is no escaping the tornadoes wrath. ""It was over before you knew it,"" Greg Kospar of Bentonville, Arkansas, told reporters after the storm. ""The house is gone.""
The strength of a tornado and its potential to cause damage are rated using the Fujita scale, with 0 being the weakest and 5 being the strongest. A new tornado rating system is scheduled to go into effect early next year.

Do the coins bearing President Lincolns face still make sense? People on both sides of the debate have put in their two centsworth.
Nearly 60 percent of Americans stash their pennies rather than spend them. For many, the penny is annoying. The coins are hard to spend. Vending machines and parking meters, for example, dont accept them. Cashiers often are frustrated when people pay with them.
""The penny has been a nuisance for years, and now it costs more than one cent to make the penny,"" Kolbe told
His plan calls for rounding ""all final sales, up or down, to the nearest nickel.""
Kolbe and others point out that pennies are expensive to produce. Pennies account for more than half of the U.S. Mints coin production. It will cost about $44 million dollars to produce pennies this year. That is nearly $14 million more than it cost in 2005.
Mark Weller of the group Americans for Common Cents believes that efforts to remove the penny will fail because Americans want to keep the coin. ""Two-thirds of the public think its important to have the penny in circulation,"" he told
Weller and others fear that rounding up prices to the nearest five cents will hurt consumers. ""Consumers lose without the penny,"" adds Weller.
He also says that many charities depend on these coins. Last year, children in New York City donated more than 65 million pennies, adding up to more than $650,000.

The above incidents took place in Florida during October. After reading such stories, many people might think that they should not swim in Florida's waters. But shark experts say that would be an overreaction. As scary as they are, shark attacks are rare.
The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) says you are more likely to be hit by lightning than be bitten by one of the more than 350 shark species. In fact, each year about 500 people are hurt by lightning in the United States. In 1999, only 58 shark attacks occurred

, tiny plants and animals that float in water. As a result, basking sharks don't have teeth.
Shark Expert Rodney Fox explained, ""Sharks do not like humans; we are too bony. A lot of people who have been bitten by sharks have survived because the shark spat them out.""
One reason that shark attacks may seem more common than before is that more people are using shorelines for recreation, said George Burgess of ISAF.
Sharks that do bite humans have often mistaken people for other kinds of animals. For example, ISAF officials say sharks attack surfers wearing dark-colored wetsuits more often than they do anyone else. To a shark, the wetsuits make surfers look like seals, a favorite food.
Some shark experts say sharks should fear people, not the other way around.
One of the biggest threats to sharks, said Burgess, is
. Finning happens when a fisher catches a shark, cuts off its fins, and tosses the dead fish overboard. The fins are used to make delicacies such as shark fin soup.
Conservation groups are urging governments to protect sharks. During the summer, the U.S. House of Representatives acted to protect sharks when it passed a bill that could prevent finning in U.S. waters. In order for that bill to become law, the U.S. Senate has to pass it, and the president must sign it.
U.S. Rep. Randy Cunningham introduced the bill. ""We must end the harmful and wasteful practice of shark finning,"" Cunningham said.

Researchers reported that crashes arent causing all those bumps and bruises. Slips and falls, getting jostled during stops and turns, and roughhousing are other ways kids get hurt. Nearly one-quarter of those injuries occur when kids are getting on and off buses.
Though the numbers are higher than thought, they represent a small fraction of kids. There are about 24 million kids who travel on school buses each year. School buses are still the safest way for kids to ride to school, according to the National School Transportation Association.

452,"Right now, 53 million kids--more kids than ever before--are in school in the United States. So many kids are now attending school that many communities don't have enough schools for all of them. To solve that problem, some communities are sending kids to school in old stores, car dealerships, and malls!
The number of kids in school is increasing. In 15 years, eight million more kids than today will attend U.S. schools. Educators wonder what to do with all those kids. ""We need to figure out where we will put these children and who will teach them,"" said Richard Riley, U.S. Secretary of Education.
Educators say 10 million additional teachers will be needed to teach those kids.
Mesa, Arizona, is typical of many communities that have more kids than school space. Mesa has 84 schools and 550 classroom trailers parked around those schools. And still there isn't enough room for all the school-age kids.
To solve its space problem, officials in Mesa are building new schools. The community is also recycling old stores into schools.
This year, 700 elementary students in Mesa are attending the new Pedro Guerrero School, which used to be a supermarket. Where families once shopped for vegetables, kids now learn reading, history, science, and math.
Cassandra Fernandez attends the new school. The fifth grader's mother, who used to shop at the store, was worried when she heard that the city planned to turn it into a school. ""I thought, how are they going to make that [store] into a school?"" she said. Cassandra's mother, however, now likes the school and all the new equipment in it.
Mesa isn't the only community that has recycled old buildings into schools. Schools in Georgia, New Jersey, Ohio, and other states are also recycling schools. Recycling old buildings into schools is less expensive and takes less time than building new schools. Recycling schools also helps the environment by leaving space for trees.

399,"Students in Colorado are riding a school skateboarding trend.
Skateboard class is rolling into schools! For sixth grader Carlos Cervantes, learning to skateboard takes a lot of work, but its worth it. ""[On] the first day of class, I was scared, but I tried it,"" the 12-year-old told
""After two days of practice, I felt more comfortable.""
Carlos is learning to skateboard in an after-school program at West Middle School in Aurora, Colorado. Skateboards are now finding their way into the regular school day as well. Douglass Elementary in nearby Boulder is the first public school in the country to offer skateboarding in gym class.
Douglasss physical education (PE) teacher Richard Cendali starts his skateboarding class by teaching students how to put on their safety gear and how to fall without getting hurt. Then kids start rolling around the gym. ""Sometimes theyre so excited, they fall. Theyre screaming, Im doing it! Im doing it!"" says Cendali, laughing. ""Its such a thrill to see those kids succeed and see their smiles.""
PE instructors around the country have started teaching classes such as skateboarding, in-line skating, yoga, and even rock climbing. Experts call these sports ""the new PE."" These individual sports are designed to help fight childhood
by getting kids involved in fun physical activities. Obesity is the condition of being dangerously overweight. Another goal of these nontraditional activities is to promote lifelong fitness habits.
Since 1980, the percentage of young people who are overweight has more than tripled. The time students spend in PE class, however, is decreasing. Many schools have dropped gym classes to save money or to provide students with more classroom time. Only 8 percent of elementary schools offer gym class to students every day, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Because students have less PE time, teachers are searching for ways to keep kids moving. ""[Skateboarding] is a great activity that keeps kids engaged in physical movement and gives them new skills and interests,"" says West Middle Schools afterschool program coordinator, Lindsey Johnson.
Some people say skateboarding not only offers health and fitness benefits but also teaches life lessons that could help kids with their schoolwork. Students who are learning to skateboard often spend hours practicing a new trick before they get it right. ""Skateboarding teaches kids to believe that if they stick with something, they will ultimately succeed,"" says education expert Richard Sagor of Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon.
Carloss skateboarding teacher at West Middle School, Eric Klassen, agrees. ""A baby will attempt to walk 600 to 900 times before [he or she] is successful,"" Klassen says. ""We tell students that they shouldnt say I cant do it unless theyve tried 600 to 900 times.""
Klassens students take his advice to heart. ""It took me 600 times to learn one new trick,"" says Martin Carrera, 11.
Over the last decade, team sports have dropped in popularity while individual sports, such as skateboarding, have been on the rise. This trend may affect the kinds of activities PE teachers offer in gym class. Learning individual sports gives all students an opportunity to exercise, whether they make it onto a school team or not.
Imagine that your school offers a skateboarding class. Would such a class have a positive effect on you? Explain.

Historians continue to debate whether people should be allowed to visit the shipwreck. Some think it should be left as a memorial to those who sank with the ship.
Marine explorer Robert Ballard found the Titanic wreck 18 years ago. He told Weekly Reader that he had mixed feelings about the discovery. Although he felt both pride and joy, he also remembered that the site is a graveyard. ""I couldn't help but think about the [more than 1,500] lost souls who died,"" he said.
Do you think it's important to preserve the Titanic? Why or why not?
Ballard believes the wreck should be left alone. ""The site is a memorial, and it is better to bring people there through advanced technology rather than ravage the site through salvage,"" he said.

Sumeyya is among the very few people who have caught the disease. So far, the H5N1 virus has infected about 150 people, killing at least 85 people since 1997. The virus does not usually spread from person to person.

Now some lawmakers in Maine want people to pay a 5-cent deposit on each cigarette they buy. If the bill passes, people could return used cigarette butts to get a deposit back.
The lawmakers who introduced the bill say they did so for two reasons. First, such a plan would lead to fewer crushed cigarette butts littering the landscape. ""I think [the law] could work to reduce waste,"" said Maine lawmaker Scott Cowger, who cosponsored the bill in Maine's House of Representatives.
Second, a cigarette deposit law would raise money for antismoking education programs in Maine schools. The bill's sponsors admit they expect only a small percentage of people will redeem cigarette butts. But those nickel deposits that aren't redeemed could add up to as much as $50 million for school antismoking programs.
Some people in Maine have problems with the cigarette deposit bill. Annie Loadwick, of Mercer, Maine, runs a bottle and can redemption center. She said she doesn't want to have to handle and count customer's used cigarette butts.
Maine's governor, Angus King, also does not support the bill. He wants instead to place a tax on cigarettes of 26 cents per pack. The tax, King said, would produce up to $36 million for school antismoking programs.

The centennial celebration honors the Ancient Pueblo (PWEH-bloh) people, formerly known as the Anasazi (ah-nuh-SAH-zee). The word
means ""town"" in Spanish. The Ancient Pueblo, who constructed Mesa Verdes cliff dwellings, are the ancestors of todays Pueblo people of the U.S. Southwest.
The Ancient Pueblo were an agricultural people who

Why did the Ancient Pueblo abandon the region? ""We dont know the exact reason,"" says Puskar. Some possibilities are climate change, drought, or overuse of the areas soil and other resources.
In the late 1800s, explorers found the ancient dwellings and removed pottery, baskets, and other
from the site. An artifact is any object made or used by people in the past.
On June 29, 1906, Congress passed a bill to establish Mesa Verde National Park. The bill, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt, protects the cultural treasures at this historic Native American site. It is a federal crime to remove or destroy any historic object or monument on land owned by the U.S. government.
""Its not often that you come across a hundred years of something special,"" Puskar says about the park.

Mesa Verde National Park protects more than 600 cliff dwellings built by the Ancient Pueblo. The two largest dwellings contain about 160 rooms each.
By building their dwellings out of stone, the Ancient Pueblo could construct homes on top of one another. By 1100, their structures were as large as some modern-day apartment buildings.
Why did the Ancient Pueblo of the Southwest rely on farming rather than hunting?

Some coin collectors say U.S. coins should have a greater variety of pictures. For instance, they want to take the image of Abraham Lincoln off the penny. They want to remove the drawing of Thomas Jefferson from the nickel.
""After almost 100 years, even Lincoln himself would probably say enough is enough,"" said coin collector Fred Weinberg.
Weinberg and others say the presidential portraits are boring. Instead of presidents, the critics want to see patriotic scenes.
""I'm not putting down dead dignitaries, but the public wants to see something new to stimulate pride and interest, not just in coins, but in history,"" Weinberg said.
Officials at the U.S. Mint, which makes coins, say they are looking into the possibility of change. The mint could have a new nickel in 2003, a new dime in 2004, a new half dollar in 2005, and a new penny in 2006.
U.S. coins have honored presidents for almost a century. In 1909, President Abraham Lincoln became the first president to be pictured on a coin.
Later, other presidents were pictured on coins. George Washington's image was added to the quarter in 1932. Thomas Jefferson's picture replaced that of a Native American on the nickel in 1938. Franklin Roosevelt's image appeared on the dime beginning in 1946. John F. Kennedy was pictured on the half dollar beginning in 1964.
Not everyone agrees that a change in change is good. Some people want to keep their loose change exactly the way it is.

Do Florida panthers have nine lives? Scientists sure hope so! The wild cats are on the brink of
During the early 1900s, hundreds of the large, light-brown cats roamed the southeastern United States. Today, panthers can be found only in southern Florida. Wildlife officials estimate that only between 80 and 100 panthers are left in the Sunshine State.
What is causing the sharp decline in the panther population? Hunting and habitat loss are mainly to blame. During the mid- to late 1900s, millions of people flocked to Florida for its warm climate and inexpensive land. As people built homes and roads, panthers were squeezed out of their habitat.
In 1967, Florida panthers were placed on the endangered species list in the United States. The list was created to protect animals that are on the edge of extinction.
Today, wildlife officials are working to keep the wild cats out of
, or danger. Workers have installed fencing along 40 miles of public roads in south-western Florida to prevent panthers from colliding with cars and other vehicles.
Officials are also making efforts to save the land where panthers live from further development. ""We have to protect what's left of their habitat,"" panther expert Bob DeGross told
A panther is about 10 times as large as a house cat. Adult males can weigh up to 150 pounds; females typically weigh about 70 pounds.
Panthers are skilled hunters. They mainly prey on white-tailed deer and wild hogs but will also eat armadillos, raccoons, and even alligators.
Panthers became Florida's official state animal in 1982.
Baby panthers stay with their mothers for about two years, learning to hunt and survive.

317,"Do you get good grades? Do you talk to your parents about what's happening at school and about things you and your friends are doing after school?
A recent study shows that how kids answer those questions tells a lot about whether they are headed for trouble. The study says kids who spend their free time aimlessly often get into trouble.
The study, called the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, was funded by the federal government. More than 90,000 kids between the ages of 12 and 18 took part in the study. Those kids attended 134 different U.S. schools. The study followed them from 1994 to 2000.
About half of the kids in the study said they were not involved in dangerous activities. But 25 percent said they had tried a cigarette, 26 percent said they had picked up a gun, and 47 percent said they had tried alcohol.
The study found that kids who spend their free time hanging out with nothing to do, who get poor grades, or who don't talk with their parents are eight times more likely to take part in unhealthful activities later on, such as smoking cigarettes or trying drugs.
Kids who hang out with friends who drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or have tried drugs are likely to do what their friends are doing, said Robert Blum. Blum is one of the doctors who conducted the study. In other words, kids tend to act like their friends, Blum said.
""How young people do at school and what they do with their free time are the most important [ways of predicting] risky behavior,"" said Blum.
Kids should get involved in interesting activities, Blum advised. Instead of hanging out with kids who are already trying what the study calls ""high-risk activities,"" Blum said that kids should play sports, read, talk with parents, or do homework.
The National Longitudinal Study finds that kids who are involved in activities usually don't get into trouble. Here's a story written by a
kid reporter about a few kids who know how to spend their time:
There are a lot of good kids. I know three of them who live in my hometown, Lockport, Illinois.
Amanda Clemmons and Heather Grein are best friends. Recently, they celebrated their birthdays together.
The two girls invited about 60 kids to a birthday party. The girls, however, asked their friends to bring pet supplies instead of presents. Their guests brought leashes, paper towels, pet food, treats, kitty litter, and toys to the party. Amanda and Heather then donated the pet supplies to the TLC Animal Shelter in Homer Township.

Many kids think playing handheld video games is a great way to spend their break time at school, but not all parents and school officials agree. Florence Rideout Elementary School in Wilton, New Hampshire, recently banned handheld electronic games, such as the PlayStation Portable and the Nintendo Dual Screen, at recess. Other schools across the country have taken the same action. Should portable video games be allowed on the playground?
Some school officials and parents argue that portable video games defeat the purpose of recessexercise. Lisa Lewis, a parent at Florence Rideout, told the school board that students should be encouraged to ""go out and play"" and not huddle around an electronic game.
In addition, portable video-game systems can stir up trouble. When students bring their gaming gear to school, fights sometimes start or the device gets stolen. Educators hope that keeping video games at home will help keep the peace at school. School officials at Florence Rideout added the video game ban to school rules to satisfy some parents' concerns.

Al Gore was born in Washington, D.C. on March 31, 1948. As a child, he spent part of his time in Washington, where his father was a U.S. senator.
During summer vacations, Al often had to live with family friends in Tennessee while his parents were in Washington. At those times, the house he stayed in didn't have indoor plumbing, he said.
When Al was in Tennessee, he worked hard on his family's farm. He baled hay, worked with farm animals, and cleared farmland of trees and rocks.
Gore said that he liked to work hard and help out even when he was supposed to be having fun. When he was 9 years old, Al went to a 4-H camp. At camp, he volunteered to work in the kitchen and do the work that was usually given to older boys. ""He was the only camper I ever had volunteer for K-P, or kitchen duty,"" said Jerry Cole, a local 4-H representative.
Although he worked hard, Al also knew how to have a good time. When his parents weren't looking, he recalled, he would sometimes move all the furniture in the living room to make a fort.
Because Al's father was a senator, he got to meet some important people. When Al was 5 years old, he met then Vice President Richard Nixon. ""He put me on his knee and was very nice to me,"" Gore remembered.
Today, as vice president, Gore is still working hard. And now his goal is to become president of the United States.

Born on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut, George moved to Texas with his family about two years later. As a child, George dreamed of becoming a baseball player.
""All George ever wanted to be was a major-league baseball player,"" said classmate Terry Throckmorton. ""That's all he ever talked about.""
He also collected baseball cards. When George was 10 years old, he began mailing baseball cards to the players pictured on them. He asked the players to sign the cards and return them to him. Many of the best players of the time autographed his cards.
George's teachers remember that he was a good student. ""He was a good, well-rounded young man, and he did his work,"" said George's third-grade teacher, Austine Crosby.
In addition to learning the usual subjects in school, Bush told
that he learned a very important lesson: ""I learned never to pretend that I know more than I know.""

Lunch trays are now filled with yogurts, sandwiches on whole-wheat bread, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Vending machines now offer nuts, bottled water, and granola bars.
In 2005, 17 states passed new nutrition laws to limit unhealthy food in schools. Texas removed deep-fried foods from school menus.

Not getting enough exercise is also to blame for kids putting on the pounds. Exercise burns calories. A

Most teachers and parents say that recess has a place in school. Nine of 10 teachers say free time spent with friends is an important part of the school day, according to a recent survey conducted by the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA).
Education experts also stress that the benefits of recess outweigh the lost class time. Recess gives students the opportunity to take a break, exercise, and socialize with their friends.
At recess, many students learn how to
or work together, with other students. Many studies also show that recess helps improve test scores.
The National PTA and Cartoon Network recently launched a program called Rescuing Recess. To kick off the campaign, children across the country are being asked to write letters to let their local and state school officials know that recess is important to them.
""We know many children enjoy recess as a welcome break from the classroom, and parents appreciate the balance that it offers between schoolwork and play,"" says Anna Weselak, National PTA president.
Exercise helps kids stay healthy. No recess? Dont worry! You can get fit on your own time. Kids should exercise for an hour each day, say experts. Here are some ideas to get you moving.

John Kerry, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, is the Democratic candidate running against Bush. His running mate for vice president is John Edwards, a U.S. senator from North Carolina.
John Kerry and John Edwards are the Democratic team.
With Election Day just weeks away, the presidential candidates are crisscrossing the country on the campaign trail to get their messages out. They are meeting voters, giving speeches, and telling people why they think they are best qualified to lead the country.
The candidates are also speaking out about important
, or problems, that our country faces. Some of those issues include rebuilding Iraq, protecting the environment, and improving schools.
Political polls predict that the 2004 presidential election will be a close race. The candidates know that every vote will count.
""I want to be your president for four more years,"" Bush said in a speech on the campaign trail. ""From creating jobs to improving our schools, from fighting terror to spreading the peace, we made much progress, and there is more to do.""
Those issues are important to Kerry too. ""You meet incredible people, and you want to make their lives better,"" said Kerry. ""They tell you about their lives--their schools, the cost of health care, or their sons and daughters serving in Iraq. It's a huge sense of responsibility and a daily reminder of why elections are so important.""
Who will be the best person for the job? The American people will decide on Election Day.
Winning the presidential election tops the list of George W. Bush and John Kerry these days, but that wasn't always the case. Both candidates dreamed of being sports stars as kids.
President Bush was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on July 6, 1946. His family moved to Texas not long after he was born.
As a child, Bush dreamed of becoming a baseball player. One of his hobbies was collecting baseball cards. When he was 10 years old, Bush used to mail cards to famous baseball players to have them autographed and returned to him.
Before being elected president in 2000, Bush was a part owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He also served as governor of Texas for six years.
Senator Kerry was born in Denver, Colorado, on December 11, 1943. His family moved to Massachusetts a few months after he was born.
As a child, Kerry wanted to become a hockey player and even thought about becoming a football player. His interest in sports continued through the years. He played hockey, soccer, and lacrosse in college.
As he grew up, Kerry began to think about public service. Before serving as a Massachusetts senator for the past 20 years, Kerry was the lieutenant governor of that state for two years.

The fourth grader swam the 1.4 miles between Alcatraz Island and San Francisco in just less than two hours. He swam to raise money for Hurricane Katrina victims.
Although Johnny trained for three months, the water was colder and wavier than he had expected. Johnny made it to the shore by telling himself, ""Im almost there. Im almost there.""
His classmates were waiting on shore, cheering ""Go, Johnny! Go, Johnny!"" When he came out of the chilly water, his father hugged him and said, ""Can you believe it? You did it!""
Johnny successfully made the trek that Alcatraz prisoners had dared to cross years ago. Alcatraz Island housed a prison from 1934 to 1963. In 1962, three prisoners escaped by swimming across the bay. They were never heard from again, so it remains a mystery whether they made it through the frigid waters to land.
Johnny didnt only raise more than $30,000 for his swim. He also reportedly became the youngest person to swim the distance from Alcatraz to San Francisco.

Millions of citizens across the country watched in horror as terrorists used hijacked airplanes to attack two of America's most famous landmarks--the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Another stolen plane crashed in Pennsylvania.
The destruction caused by the hijacked jetliners stunned eyewitnesses. ""It was like the building had been hit by an asteroid,"" Marty Singer said of the World Trade Center in New York City.
Another eyewitness compared the attack on the twin towers of the World Trade Center to a terrible storm. ""Giant balls of flame burst out of the walls,"" Hugh Smyser said. ""Glass and aluminum sheathing [outer material from the buildings] came down like a huge snowstorm.""
Although the attacks took place in New York and our nation's capital, every U.S. citizen felt the impact of the attacks. Many states and communities closed public buildings, parks, and monuments. Events, such as baseball games, were canceled. Many businesses and schools were closed, as everyone mourned the victims of the savage attacks.
The flames from the burning landmarks forged a new bond among Americans. Thousands lined up to donate blood for victims injured in the attacks. Firefighters, rescue workers, doctors, nurses, and volunteers worked tirelessly. Millions of Americans sent canned goods, snack foods, bottled water, and money to help the victims and rescue workers.
As Americans came together to help one another out during the crisis, people throughout the world knew that life would never again be the same. ""This is one of the few days in life that one can actually say will change everything,"" said one European leader.

A plane hijacked from an airport in Boston, Massachusetts, crashes into one of the 110 story towers that made up the World Trade Center in New York City. As the building burns, a second plane hijacked from Boston slams into the other World Trade Center tower 18 minutes later.
A third hijacked jet, which took off from an airport near Washington, D.C., crashes into the side Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac River from the capital. The Pentagon houses the offices of most of the branches of the U.S. military.
One of the World Trade Center towers collapses. Fifteen minutes later, a fourth hijacked place crashes in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, about 80 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. The other tower collapses almost 25 minutes later.
Ash and debris from the collapsed towers cover victims and rescue workers.
Rescue workers comb through the rubble of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon looking for survivors. At the same time, law enforcement officials look for clues to find the terrorist who staged the brutal attacks.

Muslims practice the religion of Islam. Islam was first preached by the prophet Muhammad about 1,400 years ago.
In the 600s, Muhammad had a dream in which Allah, the Arabic name for God, called him to be a prophet. Islam means ""submission, commitment, and peace"".
Islam teaches that human diversity, or difference, is a sign of the richness of Allah's mercy. In other words, according to religious experts, Islam promotes peace.

Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.
Is it important to save manatees and other endangered plants and animals? Discuss in class and let us know at

If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
The study warns that ocean life is being wiped out because of overfishing and pollution.
Global warming (a rise in Earth's temperatures) and habitat loss are also to blame for the decline in seafood.
Although the world's sea life is in serious danger, it's not too late to reverse the problem, says the study's lead author, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. The researchers have called for measures to protect current fish populations, such as reducing large-scale fishing and pollution. ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we don't change things,"" Worm told reporters.
The loss of ocean life will cause more than just a shortage of seafood. It could spell disaster for ecosystems too. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that work together as a unit to live. A declining fish population would cause a disaster up and down the food chain. Larger animals, such as seals and dolphins, depend on fish for food. Without enough fish to eat, those animals would be in trouble.

The map shows Earth's southernmost continent, Antartica. A hole in the ozone layer opens above Antartica each year.
Scientists say a hole has formed in the ozone layer above the South Pole every July for at least 15 years. Each year, the hole grows, reaching its largest size in September and October. The hole then shrinks and finally disappears in November and December.
This year, the hole was larger than ever. It covered an area of more than 11 million square miles. That's much larger than the combined areas of Antarctica and Australia!
The hole was so large that, for the first time ever, the health of thousands of people who live in southern South America was threatened.

Although the constitution has been approved, Iraqis clash over the countrys future.
Nothing was going to stand in the way of
Zeinab Sahib, a mother of three, as she voted on Iraqs constitution. She cast her ballot at a school in Baghdad, the war-torn countrys capital. ""I came to vote because I am tired of terrorists, and I want my country to be safe again,"" she says.
Sahib was one of 7 million Iraqis who voted to accept or reject the new constitution on October 15. The ballots took days to count by hand, but the constitution passed. Seventy-eight percent of Iraqis voted to make the constitution the countrys new set of laws. ""It is a landmark day in the history of Iraq,"" White House spokesperson Scott McClellan told reporters. ""The political process is continuing to move forward in Iraq, and it is an encouraging sign to see more and more people participating in the process.""
The new constitution marks a step toward establishing a

Bringing democracy to Iraq has been a challenge. Violent attacks continue throughout the country as
, or rebels, try to prevent Iraq from becoming a democracy. More than 150,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq, helping to bring peace and stability to the country. The U.S. military has also been training Iraqis to protect themselves from insurgents.
Although the constitution was approved, the country is deeply divided. Not all Iraqis agree on how Iraq should be run. Iraq is made up of three major groupsShiites (SHEE-ights), Sunnis (SOON-eez), and Kurds.
Under Saddam Hussein, who was a Sunni, Shiites and Kurds had little voice in the government. The Shiites who live in southern Iraq and the Kurds who live in northern Iraq largely voted for the new constitution. The Sunnis, a minority group, live in the middle of the country and voted against it.
U.S. troops patrol the site of a car bomb explosion in Baghdad, Iraq, in March 2004.
Many Sunnis, who were in control during Saddam Husseins rule, say the constitution favors Shiites and Kurds. The constitution allows the Shiites and Kurds to govern their own areas. Those regions have more oil than where most Sunnis live. The Sunnis worry that the Shiites and Kurds will control most of the oil and leave them weak and powerless.
Along with granting more power to local governments, the new constitution allows Iraqis to vote for leaders every four years. On December 15, Iraqis will vote on a permanent government. They will choose a
, a lawmaking body, like the U.S. Congress. The new government will have the power to revise the draft constitution. If they decide to revise it, voters will have to approve the changes.
As Iraqis begin running their own government, the United States hopes to begin withdrawing its troops. Since the war began three years ago, more than 2,000 U.S. troops have died. Recent polls show that support for the war has dropped and that many Americans want troops to come home. Others warn that the country still faces many obstacles on its path to stability.
In the meantime, President George W. Bush praised the high participation in Iraqs vote. He says, ""The Iraqis are making inspiring progress toward building a democracy.""
Why are the people of Iraq divided over their form of government?
Size: 168,754 square miles (about twice the size of Idaho)
Religion: About 95 percent of Iraqis are Muslims. They practice the religion of Islam. Shiite Muslims make up about 60 percent of Iraqs population. Sunni Muslims make up about 35 percent.

Located on Cannon Mountain, the Old Man was a popular tourist spot and a favorite among the people of New Hampshire. In fact, the jagged rock face was considered the state symbol. It appeared on state quarters, road signs, and many souvenirs.
The famous landmark stretched 40 feet high and 25 feet wide. Long concerned that it would collapse, officials made several efforts to save the mountain face. However, the heavy snow and strong winds of this past winter finally caused the cliff to collapse.

As of June, about 39 million Hispanic Americans are living in the United States. That number marks a jump from the 2000 census count. At that time, Hispanic Americans numbered about 35 million. Today, the total population of the United States is estimated at more than 288 million people.
Currently, 1 out of every 6 kids in this country is Hispanic. Officials estimate that by 2020, 1 out of 4 children will be Hispanic American.
Hispanic Americans have influenced food, music, and customs in the United States. Hispanic Heritage Month marks a time for Americans to celebrate the traditions and history of Hispanic people. It takes place from September 15 to October 15.
People in communities around the country will celebrate the month with festivals. Many students will recognize the month by learning about the important roles Hispanic people have played in our countrys history.
Ellen Ochoa, the first Hispanic American astronaut, told
that to understand the history of the United States, people should learn about the contributions of different groups, including Hispanic Americans.
People sometimes refer to the United States as a ""melting pot."" That phrase means that people from many different countries have settled here. People of Hispanic heritage, along with people from other cultures, help make the United States strong.
From science to sports, people of Hispanic heritage have contributed to the history of the United States. Take a look at some of these well-known people.
Dr. Novello was born in Puerto Rico. In 1990, she became the first Hispanic American to serve as the U.S. surgeon general. That is the doctor who leads our country on health issues. She worked to improve healthcare for Americans, especially children, women, and minorities.
Gary Soto is an award-winning Hispanic American author. He writes fiction and poetry for adults and children. His writing is based on his experiences growing up as a Mexican American in California. His books, including
Baseball in April and Other Stories and Taking Sides
, are popular with many young readers.
In 1990, Ellen Ochoa became the first Hispanic American woman astronaut when she was accepted into NASAs training program. Ochoa, whose fathers parents were from Mexico, flew her first space shuttle mission in 1993. Since then she has clocked more than 720 hours in flight.

""I started thinking of them as a family almost immediately,"" filmmaker Martyn Colbeck told
He was talking about wild elephants, not his next-door neighbors. For more than 15 years, Colbeck has filmed a family of African elephants in Amboseli National Reserve in eastern Africa.
airs April 1 on the PBS television show
The new film comes after recent studies found that elephants can recognize their reflection in a mirror. That is something only humans, chimpanzees, and dolphins were thought to be able to do. ""These animals are smart,"" Colbeck says. His documentary shows just how intelligent African elephantsthe world's largest land animalsare.
Colbeck's film follows an elephant family led by a 62-year-old female elephant named Echo. In the wild, African elephants live in herds. They roam long distances to find food. The oldest female elephant, called the

Amboseli National Reserve covers about 150 square miles in southern Kenya, near the Tanzania border. The Kenyan government protects the nature reserve's elephants from
or illegal hunting. Elephants have been hunted throughout history for the ivory in their tusks. Humans have used ivory to make jewelry and other objects. Today, elephants are an endangered species.
Since strict anti-poaching laws were put into effect in 1968, the number of elephants in Amboseli has risen from 500 to more than 1,200. When Colbeck began filming Echo's family in 1990, the family had only 14 members. Today it has 30 members.
Although the elephants still face some danger from the local Masai tribespeople, the creatures have become remarkably comfortable around human visitors. That makes Amboseli an ideal place for scientists to study elephant behavior.
""The elephants are totally relaxed about having vehicles in amongst the herd,"" says Colbeck. ""Nevertheless, it is still very important to respect the animals and not disturb them.  That respect develops into a trust, and in that way we have been able to document some extraordinary moments in their lives."" That trust has not only allowed Colbeck to film Echo's family, but it has also made him feel like one of the family.

Peanuts may seem harmless, but to some kids they mean trouble. About one and a half million Americans are allergic to peanuts. Between 50 and 100 people, mostly kids, die each year from peanut allergies.
For kids with peanut allergies, help may be on the way in the form of a new drug called TNX-901. Monthly shots of TNX-901 are not a cure, but they may save lives. Results suggest that the drug reduces the chance of a serious allergic reaction if peanuts are eaten accidentally.
Eating just the tiniest amount of peanuts can make kids with peanut allergies very sick. For some of those kids, an allergic reaction can occur from just touching or smelling peanuts. Symptoms include stomach pain, hives, and tightness in the throat.
""I get an itchy rash all over my body when I eat peanuts, so I hope the new injection will help,"" said an 11-year-old girl.
It may be years before the treatment is available to the public. More testing needs to be done before the drug is approved. Researcher Donald Leung said the new drug could ""help lift a cloud of fear that people with peanut allergies live under every time they eat."" That is something that kids with peanut allergies won't find nutty.
These eight foods are the cause of most food allergies:
tree nuts (such as walnuts and cashews)
About 7 million Americans have food allergies. People can be allergic to almost any food.

137,"Standing atop a hill this summer in the dense jungles of Guatemala, a country in Central America, scientist Arthur Demarest felt his feet sink into the jungle vines.
Demarest plunged into a deep, tangled snake hole up to his armpits. Hearing snakes slithering around him, Demarest froze. For half an hour, the scientist didn't move, waiting for the snakes to settle down so he could climb out safely. While stuck in that snaky situation, Demarest looked around and realized the pit was actually part of a jungle-covered three-story building.
As soon as he got out of the hole, Demarest and his team of scientists explored the hill. They found that it was an ancient palace built by the Maya people. The Mayan civilization covered parts of Mexico and Central America, and reached its greatest power between the years 250 and 900.
Demarest's team also discovered a city surrounding the palace. The Maya people called the city
, which means ""place of serpents."" The palace at Cancun was built more than 1,300 years ago by the Mayan king Tah ak Chaan.
So far, Demarest and his team have counted 170 rooms in the palace, which has 11 courtyards and covers an area the size of two football fields. Because of its sturdy limestone walls, the palace is in extremely good condition, Demarest said.
Demarest said Cancun is different from other Mayan cities. Unlike the other Mayan cities, Cancun doesn't have temples or evidence that there was warfare. ""The basis of power among the Mayan [kings] was religion and warfare,"" explained Demarest. ""Apparently, Cancun needed neither.""
The drawing shows an artist's idea of what the Cancun palace might have looked like.
Demarest said the city must have been very powerful. But its leaders were more focused on
, or widespread buying and selling, than on religion or warfare.
Located near the Pasin River, Cancun was a thriving trading center for the Maya. ""That river,"" Demarest said, ""was really the superhighway of the Mayan world.""
Jade, a semiprecious stone, is everywhere at the site, Demarest said. Scientists even uncovered the remains of a woman who had jade false teeth! Finely carved jade statues were found in the graves of workmen.
Demarest estimates that it will take about 10 to 15 years to
, or dig out, Cancun. In his 20 years of uncovering Mayan ruins, he said, Cancun is ""by far the most spectacular.""
The snakes must think so, too. ""A buried palace is exciting to us,"" said Demarest, ""but it's even more exciting to snakes. They love it! This place is full of snakes.""
Why might studying ancient cities be important?

Shere Khan the fierce Bengal tiger, frightened
forest animals in Rudyard Kiplings famous story The Jungle Book. When Kipling wrote his classic childrens book in 1894, more than 40,000 tigers roamed the forests of India. Today, there are only a few thousand left.
Wildlife officials recently started conducting Indias largest
or population count, of Bengal tigers. Last year, India also set up a task force to help save these animals from extinction. Three of the eight types of tigers have become extinct in the last 70 years.
""Its five minutes to midnight for the tiger,"" says Callum Rankine of the World Wildlife Fund. ""This is an issue affecting not just India but tigers worldwide.""
Although most of the worlds tigers live in India, the endangered cats also prowl other countries in Asia. These survivors, too, are under attack. The major threats to tigers include
There is a high demand for tiger body parts in Asia. In China, healers use bones, tails, and other body parts to make traditional medicine. People make clothes and rugs from the animals thick black-and-orange coats. Some people eat tiger meat. Poachers can make more than $70,000 per animal by selling its body parts.
Humans also compete with tigers for land. Millions of people now live in or near areas where tigers prowl. Developers build roads through forests, loggers clear forests for lumber, and farmers use the land for crops. All those practices destroy the tigers habitat.
As their habitat disappears, can these fierce felines be saved? ""Yes, but its not a sure thing,"" tiger expert James L. David Smith told
Some countries in Asia, such as Thailand, have good conservation policies, but others are still far behind.
is the protection of species. Wildlife officials are especially concerned about the fate of the large cats in India, where poaching is a huge problem, even in protected land areas.
Wildlife officials are using new computers, hightech cameras, and radio collars to track and count Bengal tigers in India. This state-of-the-art equipment will make sure that no cat is counted twice. The task force will also work closely with the Chinese government to help stop the illegal trading of tiger parts. It plans to educate farmers and ranchers about how to live with the tiger. Smith stresses that people who live closest to the majestic beasts need to help protect them from disappearing. He is involved with projects in several Asian countries where the endangered cats live. Smith says these projects have been successful because wildlife officials work closely with local people.
""This approach is powerful because these village rangers soon become recognized in their villages as experts,"" Smith says. He explains that it motivates people to make good decisions about the tigers future.
Sunita Narain, one of Indias top environmental officials, agrees. ""The country has no choice but to make peace with the communities that share the tigers home,"" she says. ""If not, we will lose the war of conservation, tiger by tiger.""
Do you think there is any way to stop poachers? Why or why not?
There were once eight types of tigers in the world. Today, only five are left. (
The tiger is the worlds largest cat. It can weigh up to 700 pounds and grow up to 9 feet long. Its tail is about 3 feet long.
Unlike many other big cats, tigers love to swim. The felines can often be found bathing in ponds, lakes, and rivers.
Each tigers stripe pattern is one of a kind, like a fingerprint.

""Your nose does grow when you lie,"" Dr. Alan Hirsch of the Smell & Taste Treatment and Research Foundation told
According to Hirsch, tissues of the nose expand when a person tells a fib, causing the nose to itch. That may be why many people scratch their noses when they lie. That urge to scratch has been called ""the Pinocchio effect.""
The knowledge is being applied to computer programs that detect tiny changes in facial expressions. Police can use the information to tell whether someone is lying.

658,"On August 13, after finishing basic training, more than 1,100 men and women marched into West Point, New York. They are now students at the United States Military Academy - part of the ""long gray line"" of students that stretches back 200 years.
The long gray line is what all the students who have ever attended West Point are called. The term refers to the color of the uniforms that the
, or military students, wear. It also reminds the cadets that they are part of a long tradition, which celebrates its 200th anniversary this year.
On March 16, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson founded a school to train military officers and teach engineering. The school was established at West Point, which had been used as a fort.
The school's first class of students was smaller than the one that entered this year. In 1802, only two students were enrolled at the school. The youngest was 10 years old!
When West Point was founded, the United States was much smaller than it is today. The country extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River.
Until 1817, West Point did not have a set course of study. In that year, Sylvanus Thayer was appointed the superintendent of West Point. He developed the school's curriculum and turned West Point into one of the best schools in the United States. George Woodbridge, who graduated from the school in 1826, explained Thayer's accomplishment, saying, ""His object was to make [us] gentlemen and soldiers.""
The officers who graduated from West Point helped build and defend the United States. They explored the vast areas west of the Mississippi River. They designed the roads, bridges, dams, railroads, and canals that the United States needed as it grew. They also helped design some of our greatest buildings and monuments. For example, they worked on the Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the base of the Statue of Liberty.
Many of the school's graduates have gone on to play important roles in U.S. history. They have been famous generals and U.S. presidents. Both President Ulysses S. Grant and President Dwight D. Eisenhower were generals and graduates of West Point. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, also graduated from West Point.
Even though all West Point graduates serve America in different ways, they all share important lessons learned at the academy. For example, they learn about taking responsibility for one's actions. They also share the school's motto. ""Always there echoes and reechoes in my ears [the motto]: Duty. Honor. Country,"" said General Douglas MacArthur, a West Point graduate.
George Washington Whistler graduated from West Point in 1819. He spent most of his career building railroads. He also built steam locomotives.
While building his first locomotive, Whistler also built the first American train whistle. He placed his whistle on top of the locomotive. He called his locomotive the Whistler. The sound of Whistler's whistle can still be heard on old steam locomotives.

Accepting the Nobel award for work in promoting peace will be Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank. It might seem strange that someone would receive a peace prize for founding a bank. But Yunus is no ordinary banker.
In 1983, Yunus founded Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, a country in Asia. The bank gives small loans to poor villagers, especially women. The Nobel Prize committee honored Yunus because ""peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty.""
In addition to celebrating progress toward peace, the Nobel committee gives awards for achievements in other areas, such as literature, physics, chemistry, and medicine. Each of the winners receives $1.4 million, a gold medal, and a diploma.
The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway. The other Nobel Prizes are given out in Stockholm, Sweden. Both countries are in Europe.
This year, all five of the science Nobels went to Americansthe first time that has happened since 1983. Scientist Roger Kornberg won the chemistry prize for his work on how people inherit diseases. In 1959, as a 12-year-old, Roger watched his father, Arthur Kornberg, win a Nobel Prize. The Kornbergs are the sixth father-and-son pair to have won Nobel Prizes.
Although Roger was stunned by his win, his father saw it coming. ""His work has been awesome,"" says his dad.
The Nobel Prizes were the brainchild of Alfred Bernhard Nobel (18331896) of Sweden, the inventor of dynamite. At the time of his death, Nobel left $9 million to fund the prizes that bear his name. The first annual Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901. The prizes are presented each year on December 10the anniversary of Nobels death.

His journey through the Andes Mountains in South America was not easy. Bingham hacked his way through thick forests and climbed slippery slopes. One wrong stop could have sent him plummeting off a cliff.
After crawling up a snake-infested mountain, Bingham stumbled upon one of the greatest finds of the last century. He uncovered ruins from the ""lost city"" of Machu Picchu (MAH-choo PEE-choo).
Until Bingham's discovery, the ruins remained hidden for more than 400 years. Machu Picchu, which lies high atop a peak, is an ancient city that belonged to the Incas. Its name means ""old peak.""
Thanks to a traveling museum exhibit, people in the United States can go back in time to experience Incan life in Machu Picchu. The exhibit, called ""Machu Picchu: Unveiling the Mysteries of the Incas,"" is currently on display at the Chicago Field Museum.
""It is the first exhibit of its kind,"" museum project manager Hillary Hansen told
. ""It is the largest traveling exhibit of Inca objects.""
that Bingham collected are on display--from ceramic jars to copper and bronze jewelry. Artifacts are objects that people made long ago.
Machu Picchu is an ancient city that belonged to the Incas.
The Incas were people who ruled one of the largest empires in South America. Their empire extended from present-day Colombia into western Argentina.
Their vast civilization began to spread in about 1200. It lasted through the mid-1500s.
When Bingham discovered Machu Picchu, he thought he had found the birthplace of the Inca Empire. Since that time,
have learned that the city served as a summer residence for Incan kings. (Archaeologists study artifacts to learn about the past.)
The Incas built Machu Picchu between 1450 and 1470 for the ruler Pachacuti. The royal family would relax, hunt, and entertain foreign visitors there.
Machu Picchu wasn't just a home for nobles. About 500 common people lived in the stone city and worked for the royal family as farmers, artisans, and servants.
The city was abandoned in the mid-1500s, not long after the Spanish
(conquerors) arrived. The Inca Empire collapsed under Spanish rule.
Today, Machu Picchu is a popular tourist attraction. Nearly 400,000 people visit the ancient grounds each year.
Scientists still research the area to unlock more mysteries about the Incas. ""In the scheme of things, we still know very little about Machu Picchu,"" said Hansen.
Machu Picchu, which is located in Peru, was a city of palaces, temples, farms, and small houses.
Many of the buildings at Machu Picchu are made of large stones. The stones are so tightly wedged together that a piece of paper cannot fit between them.
Machu Picchu's farmland was carved into steps because it was hard for farmers to plow up and down the mountain. That allowed farmers to plant crops on the flat parts of the land and prevented rain from washing soil downhill.
The Incas had no writing, no money system, and no knowledge of the wheel. How do you think they created such a large empire?

Is your backpack weighing you down? If so, consider lightening your load. A recent study shows that lugging around a bulky backpack that doesn't fit correctly can lead to poor
If someone tells you that good posture is important, that person is referring to the position of your body when you stand, sit, or walk. Carrying around too much weight in your backpack can force you to bend forward. Slouching over can round your shoulders and cause your upper back to curve.
Over time, the extra stress on your back can create posture problems. Some doctors think those problems may lead to neck and back pain.
Thirteen children, ages 8 and 9, participated in the backpack study. They walked about 1,130 feet. That is about the average length of a child's walk to school. The kids walked with backpacks that weighed 9 to 13 pounds. The children also walked without backpacks.
The study's researchers found that the heavier the backpack load, the more children bent down to support its weight. Afterward, some kids complained that their lower backs and shoulders hurt.
Heidi Orloff, one of the researchers, said that she could tell when the backpacks were too heavy or the kids were tired. ""The kids' chins drop to their chests,"" she told
An estimated 40 million school-age children in the United States use backpacks. Some health groups say that more than half of those students may be carrying backpacks heavy enough to affect their posture.
When worn correctly, backpacks have many benefits. They have lots of compartments that help you stay organized. Compared with shoulder bags, backpacks are a better way to carry around the items you need for school. Your body's strongest muscles-in the back and stomach-support the weight of a backpack. A shoulder bag often puts strain unevenly on your body.
However, most health experts recommend that kids carry backpacks that are no more than 15 percent of their body weight. That means a 70-pound student should wear a backpack that weighs less than 10 1/2 pounds. Orloff also said that spot checks around the country show that many children are carrying backpacks that weigh between 20 and 25 pounds. Now, that's quite a burden!
Below, you'll find some tips to help ease your load. Your back will thank you!
Choose a backpack that is the right size for your body.
Use both shoulder straps and fasten the waist strap to balance the weight evenly.
Adjust the shoulder straps so that the backpack is close to your body.
Pack only what you need and place the heaviest items closest to the center of your back.
What are other ways you can help improve your posture?
That means you should bend at the knees when you pick up your backpack.

As a result, Florida recently removed the manatee from its list of
Endangered species are animals or plants that are at risk of dying out.
The first laws protecting this slow-moving marine mammal were passed in the late 1970s. Those laws made hunting, capturing, or killing manatees illegal.
As Floridas human population grew, however, manatees faced more threats. Last year alone, 396 manatees died in Florida, according to the states Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Many manatees have been injured or killed in collisions with boats. Others have gotten tangled in fishing gear. Manatees are also threatened because of the loss of their
As builders develop along the coastline, they destroy the manatees natural homes.
Environmental factors, such as red tide, have also taken their toll on the playful creatures. Red tide occurs when millions of tiny organisms are present in an area of the water. Those tiny organisms turn the ocean red and brown. Some of them are harmful to fish and other animals.
Red tide occurs naturally in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2005, more than 80 manatees were killed in red-tide outbreaks.
Not everyone thinks it is a good idea to remove manatees from the list. Many wildlife experts worry that the unusual mammals will not receive the same protection they had in the past. ""We cant celebrate yet,"" warned manatee expert Patrick Rose in an interview with
State officials say that the manatee is not under urgent threat. Although the huge creatures are being removed from Floridas list, state scientists say that the animal will remain protected under the nations Endangered Species Act. That law offers special protection to animals and plants facing extinction.
Wildlife officials say protection of the manatees might even be strengthened. The next step calls for the writing of a plan to continue increasing the number of manatees. ""There will be no less protection,"" says Henry Cabbage of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
A manatee recently got a taste of the Big Apple. Manatees are rarely seen far from the warm coastal waters of Florida, but one adventurous sea cow swam north to waters off New York City this summer. The large marine visitor then swam to waterways about 25 miles inland. Wildlife officials say its not unusual for manatees to
or move from one place to another. However, the mammals typically dont go much farther north than Virginia.
Should manatees have been removed from Floridas endangered species list? Why or why not?

Rats have always lived in cities. The rodents live off food and waste that people throw away. Recently, however, rat populations have grown because many communities don't have the money to pay for rat-control programs, said Jerry Hershovitz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Such programs keep rat populations down.
Rats can carry diseases that can make people seriously ill, so controlling the rat population is important.

That's why scientists are working on ways to change fruit and vegetable seeds. They want to make vaccines part of the plants, explained Arntzen. If the scientists are successful, people in poor countries could use the seeds to grow food that would protect them from some diseases.

Queen Nefertiti's name means ""the beautiful one has come."" It is not surprising that she was given such a name. Queen Nefertiti has long been admired for her swanlike neck and high cheekbones.
But Nefertiti was more than just a pretty face. She is believed to have been one of the most powerful women who ever lived. She ruled Egypt more than 3,000 years ago. Egypt is a country in Africa.
Mysteriously, no one knows how Queen Nefertiti died. Her remains have never been found--until now, perhaps.
led by Joann Fletcher uncovered three mummies in a tomb in Egypt. (Archaeologists are scientists who dig up ancient objects and study them to learn about the past.) Fletcher believes that one of the mummies is Queen Nefertiti.
Modern science is helping Fletcher prove her idea and identify the face of the mummy. After X-rays of the mummy were taken, scientists put together a computerized version of what the face would have looked like.
What they discovered was amazing! The re-created face resembles a famous sculpture of Queen Nefertiti that was made during her reign.
""If the mummy is who we think it is, it would certainly help to answer a lot of unanswered questions,"" said Fletcher.
Scientists are quick to point out that the computerized version of the face does not prove that the mummy is Queen Nefertiti. The re-created face, however, isn't the only clue to the past.
There are other pieces of the puzzle that make Fletcher's team think the mummy is Nefertiti. First, the mummy's hair had been shaved off. Nefertiti preferred a shaved head so that her crown would fit tightly. A shaved head also helped her stay cool in Egypt's heat. Second, traces of a wig found next to the mummy matched the kind Nefertiti would have worn.
In addition, the mummy's left earlobe was pierced twice. Statues of Nefertiti show her having a double-pierced ear. The mummy's forehead showed the mark of a tight-fitting band--a sign of royalty. Another clue was the mummy's bent arm, which was broken off. Royalty were usually buried with their arms bent.
Not all scientists are convinced that the mummy is Nefertiti.
""If the mummy is female and if it is royal, then you still do not necessarily have Nefertiti,"" one archaeologist told
Another scientist from Egypt expressed doubts that the mummy is even a female. He said that both men and women could have double-pierced ears.
But Fletcher believes that she has found the long-lost queen and has returned Nefertiti to her rightful place in history.
The mummy which may be Nefertiti lies in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. That is an ancient burial ground for royalty. It is located in the desert, south of Cairo (the capital of Egypt) and along the west bank of the Nile River.
Scientists are starting to piece together more about the legendary queen's life. Nefertiti is now one of the most popular faces from ancient history, but that wasn't always the case.
, ruled Egypt together and had many enemies. Pharaoh is a name given to Egyptian kings.
The pharaoh and Nefertiti were disliked because they challenged the religion of the time. They began to worship one god instead of many gods. As part of their new religion, they moved from the city of Thebes and built a new capital in the heart of the desert. The new capital was called Akhetaton (ah-keh-TAHT-uhn).
(The modern name is Amarna.) They also made many changes to the style of art and architecture of the time.
Many historians think that when Nefertiti's husband died, she became pharaoh.

Justin Timberlake, Chris Kirkpatrick, Lance Bass, JC Chasez, and Joey Fatone have joined forces with the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. The drug policy office designs programs to help kids stay away from drugs.
Because 'N Sync is one of the best bands today, the White House office asked the group to bring its anti-drug message to kids. ""We think having ['N Sync] as part of our team is really going to raise the volume on our message to kids,"" said Edward H. Jurith, who is head of the White House office. Together, the White House office and 'N Sync are promoting the National Youth Anti-Drug Campaign.
As part of their summer tour, the boys talked about their ""anti-drugs,"" the things they do instead of drugs. The group also invited kids to send their anti-drugs to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
Here's what some kids said their anti-drugs are:
Grace Chen, 11, of Glen Dale, Maryland, said it's music. She plays the violin.
Rachel Acevedo, age 10, of Altamonte Springs, Florida, said it's swimming.

About 40 years ago, the number of bald eagles in the United States was declining rapidly. Today, however, the bald eagle is returning to the skies. Wildlife officials hope to remove the bird from the list of threatened species by the end of the year.
In the early 1700s, bald eagles were a common sight. There were about half a million of those birds living in the United States.
Over time, their population fell dramatically. In the early 1960s, very few bald eagles remained.
What caused the number to drop? Hunting and the use of harmful chemicals sprayed on crops were largely to blame. Those chemicals poisoned the birds and their eggs.
Pollution also contributed to the problem. Bald eagles often became sick after eating fish from polluted waters.
was being destroyed as people cut down trees to build roads and homes. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal makes its home.
Although some threats still exist, the future looks hopeful for bald eagles. Today, there are about 20,000 bald eagles living in the United States. Thanks to laws that helped protect bald eagles and banned harmful chemicals, the birds are making a comeback.
, or protection, efforts have helped their survival. ""There is no doubt that it is the single best conservation story the United States has had,"" bald eagle expert Bryan Watts told
In 1782, the bald eagle was made the national bird of the United States. The nation's founders chose the bird because it symbolized freedom, strength, and courage. At the time, some people disagreed about the choice for the national bird. Benjamin Franklin, for example, thought the turkey would make a better choice because it was ""a much more respectable bird.""

President Bush says that he has worked to reduce pollution. Earlier this year, he announced a plan to improve the country's water quality.
To help Americans breathe cleaner air, Bush started the Clear Skies program. It is designed to reduce the amount of air pollution from power plants.
President Bush has allowed companies to cut down trees in some national parks. He says that will help prevent the number of wildfires.
The president favors oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He says the new oil source will reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East and will lower the cost of gasoline. He also wants car companies to use hydrogen fuel cells, a clean energy source, to power vehicles.
Kerry wants to do more to keep our waterways free from pollution.
Senator Kerry does not think President Bush is doing a good job taking care of the environment. He says that Bush has not enforced many important pollution laws.
Kerry thinks more needs to be done to keep our waterways clean and free from pollution. He plans to make the air cleaner and launch new ways to protect the country's water supply.
If elected, Kerry proposes to give more money to national parks. He says that Bush has let companies cut down too many trees.
Kerry also opposes Bush's plan to drill for oil in Alaska. Kerry wants to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil by using new forms of energy. He also supports the making of more fuel-efficient vehicles.

What were the most important accomplishments of your presidency?
I think that one of the most important things I've accomplished was helping to strengthen our economy so that more Americans have jobs and more families can afford to buy homes and send their kids to college.
I'm particularly proud of a new program created in 1993 called AmeriCorps, which gives young people a chance to serve their communities while earning money for college.
What advice would you give the new president?
A president has tremendous responsibilities-- from keeping our economy growing to working with foreign leaders and commanding our armed forces. The president is the leader, but he or she can't do the job alone. So my advice is build a strong team, stay focused on your priorities, and make every day count.
Why should kids be proud to be Americans?
We should all be proud to be Americans because this truly is a land of opportunity. Regardless of your background, you can work hard and achieve your dreams. You may face challenges or obstacles along the way, but if you set your sights high, work hard, and stick to your priorities, you can achieve your goals.
What has been the best part of being president?
The best part of being president has been having the opportunity to make America a better place. Every day, I have the chance to make a difference in people's lives.
After being president for eight years, what will you do now?
The first lady and I recently bought a new home in Chappaqua, N.Y., and I look forward to spending more time there. I also plan to spend time in Arkansas putting together my presidential library and launching a new public policy center. I'm sure I'll be very busy, but I also hope to spend more time with my family and friends and to simply relax after what has been eight of the most incredible years of my life.
William Jefferson Blythe IV was born on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas.
In 1962, when Clinton was a senior in high school, he was chosen to go to Washington, D.C., to participate in Boys Nation, a special youth conference. There he met President Kennedy. After that, he said, he knew he wanted to make a difference in the lives of Americans by becoming a U.S. president.
Clinton went to Georgetown University, after which he studied at Oxford University in England. He then went to law school at Yale University.
In 1976, Clinton was elected attorney general of Arkansas. He later was elected governor of Arkansas.
In 1991, Clinton decided to run for president of the United States.

235,"In June, a small car pulled up outside the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad. Three men unloaded a wrapped object from the trunk, handed it to museum officials, and sped off in the mid afternoon heat. No questions asked.
Museum officials were stunned. The men had left a very important vase. Although the vase was in pieces, the good news was that it could be fixed.
""This is one of the most important pieces from the Baghdad museum, and I am delighted it has been returned,"" said a museum official. ""It is reason for people all around the world to celebrate.""
Why, exactly, would the return of a vase be cause for celebration? It was the famous Vase of Warka. The 5,000-year-old
, or man-made object, is one of the world's first sculptures. The images on the vase are important because they link the past to modern times.
Along with many valuable objects, the vase was stolen from the museum after the fall of Saddam Hussein's government in April.
At that time, mobs of thieves and rioters, or
, tore through the museum. They smashed ancient objects. Thieves ran off with prized treasures. Among the lost objects were carvings, jewelry, paintings, and statues.
One museum official referred to the looting as the ""crime of the century."" He said that it wasn't just a loss for Iraq, but that it was ""a loss for all mankind.""
. That means they could never be replaced. Some of the lost objects dated back 10,000 years, to the beginning of civilization.
Many people blamed U.S. troops for failing to protect the museum as Saddam's government fell. They pointed out that U.S. forces had managed to guard the oil reserves. U.S. government officials defended themselves, saying that American troops were focused on taking control of Baghdad.
Officials estimate that about 3,000 pieces from the museum's entire collection of 170,000 items are still missing. The losses were not as large as experts originally thought. Some valuable pieces were hidden in underground vaults. Other pieces were taken by people for safekeeping and then were returned.
Some of the stolen objects are slowly making their way back to the museum. Museum workers are trying to ensure the safe return of other objects. They began a ""don't ask; don't tell"" policy.
The policy allows thieves-like the ones who brought back the vase-to return stolen goods without punishment. Countries around the world are involved in recovery efforts. They are helping to compile a list of the stolen items. However, as one expert pointed out, ""It's going to be a long time before we know for sure what's missing.""
Modern-day Iraq is the site of ancient Mesopotamia. In Greek,
means ""the land between rivers."" There, about 5,000 years ago, the first cities sprang up between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
The area between the two rivers is often referred to as a cradle of civilization. That's because mathematics, science, and one of the first written languages developed there.
Here are some of the Iraqi National Museum's valuable artifacts and their status at the time
This 5,000-year-old stone statue of a woman praying was still missing.
This life-size marble head of a woman is one of the earliest pieces of sculpture. About 5,000 years old, it was stolen during the looting.
How did looters steal from world history when they ransacked the museum?
Originally thought to be missing, this tablet is a record of the world's earliest writing. It was found on the museum's second floor, away from the riots.

For years, Samantha Goldfeld, 11, and her family have carried their own reusable cloth bags to the grocery store. ""My family is saving almost 800 disposable bags each year,"" the sixth grader from Scottsdale, Arizona, told
""Then we got to thinking about what that number would look like if everyone carried cloth bags instead of using paper or plastic.""
More than 500 billion plastic shopping bags are used each year worldwide. Plastic bags pollute city streets, jam recycling machines, and harm animals that get caught in the bags or ingest them. Plus,
are needed to manufacture plastic bags. Nonrenewable sources cannot be replaced.
Now Samantha has the chance to teach others about the benefits of reusable cloth bags. Samantha belongs to the community service group, Roots and Shoots, which will take part in National and Global Youth Service Day. Founded in 1986, the annual project is the largest service event in the world. From April 20 to 22, millions of young people across the globe will participate in volunteer projects, ranging from recycling to tutoring young children.
To encourage more people to use reusable cloth bags, Samantha and other Roots and Shoots members will host an information session. They plan to talk about the benefits of reusable cloth bags and provide tips for reducing plastic bag use.
Samantha is looking forward to the service event. ""Doing community service makes a difference for the environment, animals, and people,"" she says. ""Together we can make a huge difference for our planet.""

Thousands of kids recently had a sneak peek at the world of tomorrow. They experienced talking robots, underwater vehicles, and lifesize video games. These inventions were among the 150 creations at this years NextFest fair. The four-day festival was held in New York City, New York.
NextFest gave inventors a chance to unveil their latest creations. Many were right out of the lab. Others were still being developed. Here are a few of the high-tech gadgets that captured our attention.
Actroid is a robot designed to look and talk like a human.
Dont let this photo fool you! Actroid may look real, but she is actually a
or humanlike, robot. She was designed to greet and entertain people. When Actroid talks, she moves her hands and makes eye contact. Other versions of this robot are programmed to reply to hundreds of questions, such as ""What time is it?"" and ""Are you a real person?""
What is it like to live like a sea creature? The Bionic Dolphin gives people the chance to find out. The vehicle can cruise across the water at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour (mph) and then dive at least 10 feet. Its inventor, Thomas Rowe, designed the vehicle with wings to enable it to ""fly"" underwater as fast as 40 mph. ""The majority of my research was on dolphins, but where I got the most help was penguins and diving birds,"" Rowe told
The Bionic Dolphin was first designed for
or play. However, it may be used in the future to save whales entangled in nets. A larger version of the vehicle has been designed to rescue people lost at sea. ""It swallows them,"" says Rowe.
What combines music, rock climbing, and video games? Its a musical climbing wall called DigiWall. This climbing wall has interactive games based on speed, cooperation, and creativity. ""We wanted to do some kind of computer game where you are very physical,"" project leader Mats Liljedahl told
""We removed the computer screen, and instead we are using the lights and the grips."" The grips light up when they are touched.
Robonaut may help astronauts in future space missions. The robot is being designed by NASA, the U.S. space agency. The robot will ""perform tasks that up until now only astronauts could do,"" NASA engineer Roger Rovekamp told
Robonaut can operate on its own or be controlled by a human operator from Earth or in space. The operator would wear a special headset that displays live video from the cameras on the robots head. By wearing a glove with sensors, that person can control the actions of Robonauts fingers, which can hold tools as small as tweezers.
""I got to see some awesome exhibits,"" says
kid reporter Michaela Ritz. The 11-year-old was on the scene at NextFest. Along with checking out the latest gadgets, Michaela caught up with some inventors to learn more about their unique designs.
What was her favorite invention? Brainball! In this game, players wear headbands that monitor their stress levels by measuring brain waves. A computer directs a ball away from the player who is calmer.

679,"This will be a very different school year for Rand Amir. The fifth grader is among millions of schoolchildren who went back to school in Iraq in early October.
On the first day of school, Rand said, her classmates ripped out pictures of Saddam Hussein from their textbooks. Saddam is the former president of Iraq. The students tossed the pages out the window, yelling ""Bye, bye, Saddam.""
That was not an unusual sight at some schools throughout this war-torn country. Saddam's government was toppled in April. At that time, U.S.-led forces took control of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.
During Saddam's rule, teachers were forced to mention him in every lesson, from history to music to gym class. Students even learned math by adding 4 + 28. That's because April 28 is Saddam's birthday. Now schools are erasing Saddam's image and teachings from their lessons.
Iraqi officials are rewriting the country's textbooks. That will give students the opportunity to learn new ideas about the world.
The new textbooks, which will arrive this month, don't include any references praising Saddam. Pictures of Saddam have been removed from classrooms. Students are no longer forced to chant ""Long live our leader, Saddam"" during their classes.
Despite the changes, U.S. soldiers report that many of Iraq's schools are in various states of
, or poor condition. Although many schools were failing before the war began, many more schools were destroyed or seriously damaged during the fighting.
Some schools have broken windows and doors and are still without electricity or running water. Some lack chalkboards, desks, and other much-needed furniture and supplies.
The good news is that help is on the way for teachers and students. U.S. soldiers and aid groups are helping rebuild many of the run-down schools, restoring water and electricity.
They are also providing children with school supplies that Americans have donated. One 9-year-old Iraqi student was all smiles as soldiers unloaded boxes of new crayons, markers, book bags, and other donated supplies.
Despite the challenges, the new school year offers a fresh start for many teachers and children. ""Memories of the war are still fresh, but we shall go past that,"" said one teacher in Iraq. ""[The students] will be safer now.""

that donating the supplies helps her students make a personal connection with children in another culture.
Why is it important to be able to think and learn freely?
The class also made a picture book and wrote a message of friendship. The message was translated into Arabic and included in each box. Arabic is the official language of Iraq. ""We hope we can reach out in friendship and make a difference,"" said Winslow.

Our classroom play celebrates Philadelphia's hometown hero. Discover how his hard work helped to improve the lives of all Americans.
Honor the 300th birthday of one of our countrys greatest thinkers, inventors, and statesmen with our classroom play.
Each morning, Benjamin Franklin asked himself, ""What good shall I do today?"" And that is how he lived his life.
His can-do attitude launched him into the history books as one of Americas most famous citizens. Ben was a printer, a writer, an inventor, a community leader, and a founder of our nation.
Ben was born in a cottage in Boston on January 17, 1706. He attended school only between the ages of 8 and 10. Bens education was cut short because his family was poor and needed him to work.
His love of learning, however, stayed with him throughout his life. Ben read all the time. He often went without food to buy books! At 12, he began his lifelong love of printing.
In honor of the 300th anniversary of Bens birth, our three-act play looks at some key events in the life of this great American. Find out how his good deeds helped shape the history of our country.
ACT 1: Ben the Young Man, Boston, 1718-1723
Bens older brother, James, owns a printing press that publishes a very popular newspaper,
In 1718, Bens father decides that 12-year-old Ben should work for James.
At that time, Ben signs a document promising he will work for his brother until he is 21, without pay. In return, his brother is to provide Ben with food and clothes.
Ben likes to read and is a good editor and proofreader. Over the next few years, he learns all about printingand even begins writing letters to the newspaper under a different name. Thanks to Bens sense of humor and clever writing in those letters,
becomes one of the most-read newspapers in Boston.
James finds out that the letters are from his brother and he becomes jealous of Ben. James is furious and vows never to publish any of Bens writing again. He also finds fault with Bens work, even though Ben rarely makes errors.
I know I am a better printer than he is.
You cant leave! You have to work for me until you are 21!
Youll never find a job in this city! Youll come crawling back to me.
But Ben never comes back to his brother. Instead, he leaves in the early morning and runs away to New York City, in hopes of finding work as a printer. After not finding a job there, he heads to New Jersey where he boards a boat to Philadelphia.
The journey is three days long, and Ben is dirty, hungry, and penniless. But Philadelphia is a lively city, and Ben loves it.
ACT 2: Ben the Community Leader, Philadelphia, 1723-1740s
After arriving in Philadelphia, Ben works to establish himself as a printer. In 1728, he opens a printing shop and begins publishing his own newspaper,
A few years later, he also publishes
The book includes weather forecasts, recipes, and jokes. It also contains some of Bens sayings, such as ""Well done is better than well said."" The almanac becomes a best seller and makes Ben wealthy.
Although Ben works to better himself,it is also important to him to help the community. He considers Philadelphia his hometown and works to make life in the city better.
Ben starts projects to pave and sweep Philadelphias streets. He redesigns the citys streetlights so that roads are safe at night.
Ben also helps set up the first public library, hospital, and volunteer fire department. At this time, most houses in Philadelphia are made of wood and stand side by side. When a fire breaks out, it can destroy an entire neighborhood.
Extra! Extra! Fire destroys row houses on Market Street!
We need to train men to fight fires so that this doesnt keep happening.
Ben persuades more than 30 men to form the Union Fire Company.
We nominate Ben as our fire chief.
Ben is appointed fire chief. He makes sure that firefighters are trained to put out fires and rescue people.
(dragging a leather bucket full of water)

The Union Fire Company meets once a month to discuss fire prevention. Ben also publishes fire prevention tips in his newspaper.
Bens ideas for Philadelphia help shape how fire departments, hospitals, libraries, and post offices work in other cities.
ACT 3: Ben the Statesman, Philadelphia, 1776
Along with his work in Philadelphia, Ben helps change the course of American history.
At the time, America is made up of 13 Colonies ruled by Britain. England has passed many laws that the Colonists think are unfair.
Ben works to mend the relationship between the Colonies and Britains ruler, King George III.
Despite his efforts, the Colonies decide to break away from Britain. They fight Britain in the Revolutionary War (1775-1783).
Ben is appointed to the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence. This document frees the Colonies from Britains rule.
We have to decide who should write the Declaration of Independence.
I wont. Many people disagree with my opinions.
I cant. I am not a writer.
I am unsure about independence from Britain.
You must write this very important document. Your writing style is perfect.
When Thomas Jefferson finishes his draft, he shows it to Ben.
Ive made small changes. For example, you wrote, sacred and undeniable, and I changed that phrase to make it stronger.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.
On July 4, a group of representatives from the 13 Colonies approve the Declaration of Independence and some people sign the document.
This for King George, so he can read it without his glasses.
On August 2, Ben and others also sign the document. They know they are risking everything for freedom from Britain.
Seven years later, in 1783, Ben negotiates the treaty that ends the Revolutionary War. In 1787, at age 81, he signs the U.S. Constitution.
Ben Franklin dies on April 17, 1790, at the age of 84. He is buried in Philadelphia. In honor of the 300th anniversary of his birth, people across the country will celebrate the life of this remarkable man.

. ""But then these kids started teasing me about them. I felt embarrassed. After that, I didn't want to take the bus anymore.""
This graph comes from a survey that asked kids and parents about some of the toughest issues facing kids today.
Scenes like that take place every day at bus stops, on school buses, on school playgrounds, and in other places. A recent survey found that 55 of every 100 kids between ages 8 and 11 said bullying and teasing are a ""big problem"" for kids their age.
The survey results also show that 74 percent of kids between ages 8 and 11 said they have seen bullying in their school. The survey was conducted by Children Now, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and Nickelodeon.
of someone that takes place over a period of time,"" said Ronald Stephens. To
means to constantly pester or threaten someone. Stephens heads the National Center for School Safety, which works to prevent violence in schools.
Bullying can take many forms, such as hitting, name-calling, threatening looks, and spoken threats, Stephens said. ""Bullying can have long-term effects,"" he said, ""including the 'vigilante effect.'"" A
is a person who takes the law into his or her own hands. So if a bullied student feels a school isn't helping, that student may act out against others, he said.
Bullying may be one of the causes behind some of the recent shootings in U.S. schools, according to Stephens. Kids at Santana High School, in Santee, California, said bullying may have a part in a recent shooting there.
Santee student Charles ""Andy"" Williams, age 15, is accused of killing two boys and wounding 13 other people at Santana High School on March 5. According to schoolmates, in addition to having other personal problems, Williams had been bullied and teased.
School safety experts say everyone in a school, as well as parents, must work together to make sure no kids are disrespected or treated cruelly.
To stop bullying, some schools have organized
. A peer mediation group allows students who have problems getting along to work the problems out with the help of peers and teachers.
Other schools have sent students and teachers forms asking questions about such problems as bullying and teasing. The answers from the forms help school leaders and parents become more aware of kids' problems and figure out ways to solve them.
Finally, Stephens suggests that there are steps a student who is bullied can take. ""Make it clear that you don't like being bullied and then walk away and tell an adult,"" Stephens said.
Ronald Stephens, of the National Center for School Safety, gives these three tips to remember if you are ever bullied:
If a person is bullying you, tell the person in a firm, loud voice that you don't like what they are doing. Then...
Find an adult (teacher, parent, coach) and tell that adult what happened.

How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.

So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.

So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
. The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
. The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
. We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.
? Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

Scientists recently announced that they had discovered ancient etchings in a cave in France, a country in Europe. The etchings are between 22,000 and 28,000 years old.
The cave etchings show prehistoric people and animals. Drawings of bison, horses, mammoths, and rhinos dot the cave walls and ceiling.
Marc Delluc discovered the cave etchings. Delluc is a cook who spends many of his weekends exploring caves in France. One day, he was exploring a tunnel in one cave when he noticed the etchings. He was the first person in thousands of years to see the amazing carvings. Delluc said the etchings are beautiful to look at. ""I just sat there gazing at the ceiling,"" he said.

Jesse Coltrane, a 15-year-old student at Camden's Promise, says that kids can help people in need through school and community projects. Like Jesse, thousands of students will be working in their schools and communities to make the world a better place during National Volunteer Week (April 27 through May 3).
This year will mark the 30th anniversary of National Volunteer Week. The theme of this year's week is ""Celebrate Volunteers-The Spirit of America."" As part of this year's week, kids across the United States will be taking part in service projects. Many kids will also participate in community events to honor volunteers.
""When you volunteer, you help America become strong. You become an instant champion!""
""Volunteers learn important skills like teamwork and responsibility,"" said Melissa Helmbrecht, founder of the volunteer organization Champions of Hope.
Champions of Hope is made up of more than 650,000 kids across the country and includes Jesse Coltrane and other students at Camden's Promise. Champions of Hope participants across the country are volunteering to collect food for the hungry, clean parks, and raise money for firefighters.
Champions of Hope started a United Day of Service on September 11, 2002, one year after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. On that day,
star Sean Astin spoke to youths gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., about the importance of civic action. Astin plays hobbit Sam Gamgee in the movie. Astin told
, ""It is our responsibility to keep making the world a better place. We can do that by helping others.""
Sixth-grade student Matthew Malon from Illinois attended the September 11, 2002, rally and has collected food for homeless shelters. Astin's speech on volunteering moved him.
Some students from Camden's Promise also attended the rally. Students Damian Johnson, Keith Bennett, and Tashay Moody agree that it's important for kids to volunteer.As 16-year-old Damian Johnson puts it: ""[Volunteering] makes me feel like I have made an impact on people who don't have as much as I have.""
""How can I make a difference in the world if I'm just an ordinary kid?"" Thirteen-year-old author Sondra Clark answers that question in her fourth book,

The action doesn't stop for actor Sean Astin when the cameras stop rolling. Astin, one of the stars of The Lord of the Rings movies and the father of two young children, is inspiring kids to make the world a better place.
In January, Astin was appointed to the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation. President George W. Bush created the council to encourage volunteerism. He has urged Americans to make a lifetime commitment to volunteering.
Astin tells kids that it's easy to make a difference. As a teenager in Santa Monica, California, he volunteered his time helping preschool students cross the street. He told Weekly Reader, ""I remember feeling that because I was helping someone, I had an incredible responsibility, and it felt great. It made me a better person.""

Scientists working in Argentina are finding larger and larger dinosaurs. About a dozen years ago, they discovered
, a plant eater that was longer than three school buses placed end to end. Now, a scientist says he has uncovered an even larger plant eater.
Jorge Calvo is leading the team of
, scientists who study fossils, who found the giant plant eater. Calvo says the newly discovered dinosaur lived 87 million years ago, stood 52 feet tall, was 130 feet long, and weighed 100 tons. ""It would be safe to say, this is the biggest [dinosaur],"" said Calvo.
The giant plant eater is not the only dinosaur fossil that scientists have recently found in Argentina. Scientists have discovered an area that stretches for hundreds of miles and is loaded with dinosaur fossils. So far, they have found four previously unknown dinosaur species in the area.
The Age of the Dinosaurs began about 225 million years ago and ended 65 million years ago. Scientists divide that huge period of time into three shorter periods, called the Triassic Period, the Jurassic Period, and the Cretaceous Period. The first dinosaurs probably developed about halfway through the Triassic Period. Different dinosaurs lived in each of those three periods.
The dinosaurs discovered in Argentina date from the Jurassic Period. Paleontologists don't yet know much about the dinosaurs that lived during the Jurassic Period. ""Jurassic Period fossils are very, very rare,"" said scientist Gerardo Cladera.
During the Jurassic Period, Earth's temperature was warmer than it is today. The warmer temperature caused glaciers to melt and the sea level to rise. The oceans flooded much of the land, leaving little land area where dinosaur fossils could be preserved.
Calvo's newly discovered dinosaur stood taller than a three-story-high tree. Despite its size, the towering plant eater was preyed on by
, the largest known meat eater. It stood 12 feet tall, had large, serrated teeth, and hunted in packs.
The giant plant eater would have been no match for a pack of hungry giganotosaurs. ""By working as a team, these predators would be able to eat even a giant plant eater,"" explained paleontologist Thomas Holtz.

One of the most historic regions in the United States is in trouble. The 175-mile-long area of land stretches through Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
The area is home to more American history than any other slice of land in the country, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. George Washington built his estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison also built their homes in that state. The region at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains includes many battlefields from the Civil War (18611865).
As people construct new houses, roads, and buildings, they are destroying acres of history. Officials say the region has lost more than 150,000 acres of farmland in the past 20 years. That is an area slightly smaller than New York City.

Since its discovery in 1930, astronomers suspected that Pluto was an oddball when compared with the other planets. New technology has shown that its orbit is oval-shaped. Pluto is also smaller than the other planets. Even Earths moon is larger.
Orbit and size werent the only problems. Pluto is made up of material that is different from that of the other planets. While the others are made up of rocks or gases, Pluto consists mostly of ice.
Pluto appears to be similar to other objects in the Kuiper belt. Its status as a planet began to look bleak when 2003 UB313 was discovered three years ago.

State and wildlife officials blame the increase in manatee injuries and deaths on the number of boaters. ""There are more boats [on the water] now, so that's causing more [manatee] deaths,"" said Nancy Sadusky, an official of the Save the Manatee Club.

364,"Should schools report a student's health to parents?
As if grades weren't enough to worry about, some students now have weight on their minds too. The number of overweight children in the United States has more than doubled in the past 20 years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Being
or severely overweight, can lead to health problems later in life.
As a result, schools in several states, from California to Pennsylvania, have started sending home ""BMI report cards."" Those schools send home a report of a student's
BMI is a calculation of weight and height that tells whether a person is overweight for his or her age.
Should schools send home BMI reports? People on both sides of the debate are weighing in.
Some lawmakers say BMI reports alert parents to their children's health and help combat obesity. In 2003, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee helped launch the first program to report students' BMIs. Obesity rates in that state have since stopped increasing. Pediatrician Joe Thompson helped plan the BMI program for Arkansas schools. He explains that the reports in Arkansas are sent home separately from report cards. ""The misconception is students are being graded on their weight,"" he told
""Just like a school screens for vision or hearing, this is a health approach to raise awareness about a risk.""
Not everyone thinks that reporting students' BMIs is a good idea. Parents have complained that the reports damage their children's self-esteem. Some parents say kids also worry that they are being ""graded"" on their weight. Opponents of BMI reports argue that schools that label students overweight are acting unfairly. The critics point out that many school cafeterias serve fatty foods. Parent Brett Levy from Chicago, Illinois, believes that schools should teach kids to lead healthy lifestyles instead of reporting their BMIs. ""Telling a boy or girl [a] BMI is not education,"" he told
Schools should issue BMI reports for students.
Schools should not issue BMI reports for students.

Mei Xiang (MAY SHONG) is a 2-year-old female panda. Her name means ""beautiful fragrance."" Tian Tian (tee-YEN tee-YEN) is a 3-year-old male panda. His name means ""more and more.""
The map shows China, the most populated country in the world. More than 1.2 billion people live within China's 3.7 million square miles.
The two pandas arrived from China aboard a plane called
. From the airport, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian were taken to the National Zoo, where they will live for the next ten years.
Officials at the National Zoo agreed to give China $10 million in exchange for lending the United States the two pandas. That money will be used to protect pandas from becoming extinct in central China.
About 1,000 pandas live in the mountain forests of central China, where they eat mainly bamboo shoots. The pandas need the forests to survive.
The land where pandas are found, however, is being cleared and used for farmland. The trees are being used for firewood to heat people's homes.
There are now seven pandas living in the United States. Two are in Washington, D.C.; two are in Atlanta, Georgia; and three are in San Diego, California.
One of those seven pandas is a baby. The baby panda, Hua Mei, was born at the San Diego Zoo on August 21, 1999.
Hua Mei is the first baby panda born in the Western Hemisphere since 1990. When he was born, he weighed less than 5 ounces and looked more like a rat than a panda.
Fa Mingzhi is one of more than 4 million people who live near the area where the pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian come from. Most of the people who live in that area are farmers who need the forest to survive.
Like many people, Fa Mingzhi wants to protect the animals. But, she says, people want to eat, too. ""It's good to protect the panda, but it's harder now on the people who live here,"" she said.
As pandas and the people of China compete for the same resources, both face an uncertain future.

610,"History in the Making: Japan Invades Hong Kong
War broke out between China and Japan in 1937. An undeclared war was fought until 1941, when China, as well as the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, declared war on Japan, Germany, and Italy. In 1941, Japan invaded the British colony of Hong Kong, which is part of present-day China. Connie interviewed her grandfather, Locksley Siu, who was in Hong Kong during the Japanese invasion.
How old were you when World War II began?
World War II in Hong Kong was from 1941 to 1945. The Japanese army occupied the former British colony when I was 11 years old.
Where did you live, and did you have a car?
Altogether, eight people lived in [an] apartment of 500 square feet. Our apartment was in Wan Chai, on Hong Kong Island. Most people did not have cars. My dad had an old bicycle.
Did you still go to school during the Japanese occupation?
Yes, I continued to go to school for the first year. Later the school was closed because the school ran out of money. During the occupation, students were required to learn Japanese. Japanese teachers taught us Japanese.
Did you have enough food to eat every day?
No, we did not have enough food. We only ate vegetables, beans, and potatoes, but no rice at all. Meat was very costly and in short supply. When we were really hungry, we drank water. Sometimes we had to pick up grass and leaves from trees to eat.
How did the Japanese soldiers treat the Chinese people?
They were rude, and they hated Chinese people. We had to salute the Japanese soldiers when they passed by. Otherwise they would kick [us] in the back.
How was life affected by the occupation?
There was little freedom. The Japanese forbade people to go out after 11 at night. There was no traffic during the curfew. There was a lack of electricity for lighting; instead, we used candles. The only entertainment at night was the radio. The Japanese government took all Hong Kong dollars away. The Japanese government forced us to use Japanese yen. Roads such as Queen's Road and King's Road were changed to Japanese names.
Do you have any comments about the occupation?
More than 60 years after [the end of] World War II, there are still many people  who live in fear, hunger, and poverty because of wars. I hope that you will think more of those less fortunate.
I learned that there was little freedom under the occupation. I should be grateful that I live in a country where I am not forced to do things that I don't want to do. I'm going to do something for the less fortunate, just as my grandpa told me.

A saber-toothed cat leaps from behind a bush. It moves toward the side of a stream. It's a hot day, and the cat is thirsty. What the cat doesn't see is the shallow pool of liquid asphalt that is covered by a thin layer of sand. As the cat nears the stream, it steps into the sticky black asphalt.
The bones from about 2,000 saber-toothed cats have been pulled from La Brea.
Soon, all four paws are stuck in the muck, and the cat is trapped. Struggling to get free, the cat becomes covered in the asphalt. Several days pass, and the cat, still stuck in the asphalt, dies of starvation.
Now, 35,000 years later, that sandy streamside spot is known as the La Brea (BRAY-ah) tar pits in Los Angeles, California. Last month, scientists finished their annual dig at La Brea's Pit 91.
The scientists unearthed nearly 1,000 fossils and spent time studying those fossils. ""The information we captured will tell us more about what life was like in this area 35,000 years ago than we've ever known before,"" said scientist Chris Shaw. By studying the fossils pulled from the tar pits, scientists are learning more about how Earth's environment has changed through time.
Shaw has been working at the La Brea site for nearly 30 years. ""My favorite part of the job is when I'm actually in the pit digging,"" Shaw told
. He added that he has become used to being covered in dirt and asphalt. ""It's like working in a big sandbox.""
Shaw spends much of his time at the George C. Page Museum in Los Angeles overseeing the huge collection of fossils pulled from La Brea. The museum holds thousands of fossils of prehistoric animals that died in the tar pit.
Some of the animals that fell into La Brea include woolly mammoths, bison, horses, ground sloths, western camels, and llamas. Many of the fossils that have been collected are from about 25,000 to 35,000 years ago.
During that time, Earth was cooler and was just coming out of one of many ice ages.
During ice ages, when Earth's temperature cooled, great sheets of ice, called
, formed at Earth's poles and over huge areas of land.
Digging at Pit 91 has stopped until May 2001. In the meantime, Shaw and other scientists will study the many fossils they have pulled from La Brea.
After 30 years, Shaw still loves his work. ""The coolest thing about doing fieldwork,"" Shaw said, ""is realizing that the fossil you're touching has not seen the light of day for about 30,000 years.""

Recently, several African-American leaders were appointed to help manage the project. They include talk-show host Oprah Winfrey and Robert Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television (BET).
The museum will be part of the Smithsonian Institution. Although its exact location has not yet been determined, officials hope that it may find a home on the National Mall. The U.S. government is paying for about half the museum's $400 million cost. The museum's leaders will help raise the rest of the money.
President George W. Bush authorizes the creation of a Smithsonian museum dedicated to African-American history and culture.
The museum will celebrate the contributions of African Americans in the United States. It will highlight African-American history and culture from the Civil War (1860-1865) to the present.
""I look forward to the day the National Museum [of African-American history] opens and I can take my children and grandchildren to not only see history but be part of it,"" said one of the committee members. The museum is expected to open in 2013.

Pocket bikes, also called pocket rockets, have found their way onto city streets. Pocket bikes are the most recent craze sweeping the country. Yet this pint-size fun is causing big trouble.

""The minibikes are extremely dangerous,"" Los Angeles police officer Ron Fisher told
. ""They are so low to the ground that it makes the rider invisible from a drivers viewpoint.""
The mini motorcycles, which are powered by lawn mower engines, are also noisy. They typically reach speeds between 25 and 40 miles an hour. That is about the same speed a car travels on local streets.
Although it is legal to buy the bikes, it is against the law to ride them on public streets in many states. Police have been giving tickets to illegal riders. In some cases, officers
This has some kids and parents upset. They argue that the companies selling the mini motorcycles dont inform buyers that they cant be ridden on public streets.
Fisher says the majority of pocket bike riders on the street are 9 and 10 years old. Officials in some states are working to pass laws to limit who can ride the bikes. The officials say that kids should have to wait until they have a drivers license.
Pocket bike racing has been a popular sport in Europe. It has caught on in some communities in the United States during the past few years.
Josh and other pocket bike racers agree that the mini motorcycles are not meant to be ridden on city streets. He told us that if people are interested in riding pocket bikes, they should find ""an organized race track.""

This week Grade 4 looks at where the two major candidates for president stand on
. Both candidates recognize that the world has changed since the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Each candidate has his own plan to make the United States more secure and keep its citizens safe.
President Bush's antiterrorism program has included removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and restoring freedom to the country. He has also worked to stop terrorist groups in Afghanistan.
In October 2001, shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush signed the Patriot Act. The law gives the government more power to investigate suspected terrorists. President Bush believes that the law should be renewed when it comes up for review in 2005.
Bush also created the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 to keep our airports, borders, and ports safe from attacks. He says that he has worked to improve national security at airports through increased screening and advanced equipment.
Senator Kerry promises to continue to track and stop potential terrorists. He voted for both the Patriot Act and the Department of Homeland Security.
Kerry supports the Patriot Act's renewal in 2005 if some changes are made to it. He argues that certain sections of the Patriot Act violate citizens' rights. Some of those parts include allowing the government to wiretap phone conversations and search business and library records.
If elected, Kerry has a plan to protect the country's borders, ports, and airports. He also says that he will work to give police officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel the information and equipment they need to perform their jobs safely and effectively.

Everyone loves pizza, but should it be used as a reward for reading?
Should kids be reading for pizza? A nationwide reading program is drawing criticism for putting pizza front and center. Since 1985, the restaurant chain Pizza Hut has been running the Book It program, which rewards students for reading with personal pan pizzas. Now some people are taking a slice at Book It. They say the program promotes poor eating habits and gives Pizza Hut free advertising in public schools.
""It's clear that Pizza Hut's Book It has no place in public schools. ... It promotes junk food,"" says Susan Linn, a cofounder of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. The group has called for schools to stop participating in the Book It program.
Nearly 22 million children in 50,000 U.S. schools take part in Book It. Since the program began, more than 200 million pizzas have been given away. Each year, from October 1 through March 31, students read books to meet monthly reading goals set by teachers. When students meet their goal for the month, they get a certificate for a personal pan pizza.

Venice is sinking at a rate of 1.57 inches per year, according to scientists. The Italian government has proposed the building of floodgates to control the flow of the sea.
Scientists hope to turn the tide in favor of Venice. They want to pump huge amounts of water into the ground through sturdy pipes. Scientists expect the water will expand the sand underneath and prop up the city. They hope to test the project on a small area over the next few months.
In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads.
Scientists behind the plan say that the pipes will work along with the floodgates to help save the city. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnt carried out in a careful way.
Everyone, however, agrees that saving the sinking city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose tremendous part of [history],"" Melissa Conn of Save Venice, an organization dedicated to helping preserve the city, told reporters.
Venice in Italian means ""city of canals.""
About 1.6 million people live in Venice.

Weekly Reader sat down with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice the day after Iraq announced its draft constitution. Weeks later, Iraqis voted to approve the constitution. Earlier this year, Rice became the first African American woman secretary of state. She is the highest-ranking member of President George W. Bushs Cabinet, or group of close advisers. As secretary of state, Rice advises the president on foreign affairs and works with world leaders on important issues. WR talked to her about Iraq and her job as head of the State Department.
WR: When Iraq announced its draft constitution yesterday, what role did the State Department play?
We were following the Iraqi constitution very closely. It started with a phone call to our ambassador in Baghdad, and then I talked to [President Bush] about what was going on. I probably was on the phone to Baghdad yesterday six or seven times just following what was going on and seeing if there was anything that we could do back here.
WR: Some people say its a mistake to try to build a democracy in Iraq. How do you respond to critics?

WR: Youve traveled more than any other secretary of state in your first six months in office. Did a particular experience stand out for you?
I went to Phuket in Thailand, where the tsunami had taken place. And there were all of these American college students there helping out in the schools. And it reminded me whats really great about Americans.

International politics is a 24-hour schedule, because while were asleep, the rest of the world is awake. ... My day [may include] meeting with foreign ministers. I go over to the White House for meetings at least three or four times a week. I talk to the president pretty much every day.

Now Farid Dadashev, age 11, is doing something to stop the fighting.
A few years ago, Farid said, ""I don't want to be a soldier when I grow up. I want to be a teacher."" Because of that desire for a peaceful life, Farid started the Child Peace Network. He sent out a petition to kids calling for peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia. So far, 10,000 kids from three countries have signed that petition.
In January, Farid traveled to the United Nations (U.N.) in New York City to talk about how the kids in his country are suffering from the war.
Azerbaijan and Armenia have been fighting over a region called Nagorno-Karabakh. Both countries claim the region belongs to them. Most of the people who live in that region are Armenian, and in 1988, the people of Nagorno-Karabakh began asking for independence or to join Armenia.
In 1991, that request turned into a bloody conflict between the two countries. The fighting lasted until 1994, when a cease-fire was declared. Although the cease-fire continues, the two sides have not settled their differences, and fighting still breaks out.
""The war affects everyone in Azerbaijan,"" Elmira Suleymanova, Farid's grandmother, told
from her home in Baku, Azerbaijan. ""No one can feel safe. One night, an entire community was burned to the ground.""
According to the U.N., the years of fighting have left 1 million people homeless. About 30 percent of those refugees are kids under age 15, said Farid.
No one knows if Farid's petition has had an impact on the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But last month, the leaders of the two countries met to discuss peace.

Even though cell phones are a hot fad, some scientists are ringing an alarm about them. The scientists say that cell phones might pose a health threat.
In the United States, more than 90 million people use cell phones. Many of those people are kids. For kids, cell phones are about more than phone calls, says Anne Charlton of the University of Manchester in England. ""It's all about the cool factor,"" Charlton said. She added that a cell phone is not just about making calls, it's also a fashion statement.
Most cell phone users don't think about the health risks the phones might pose. Some scientists warn that cell phones give off radiation that might be harmful to users. One recent study shows that cell phone radiation might increase a person's chance of getting some kinds of cancer.
Other medical experts say cell phones don't pose a health threat. They point to studies that have not found any link between phone use and cancer.
Scientists say that people can protect themselves from cell phone radiation. One way is to use a headset instead of talking directly into a cell phone. Or, for an even simpler solution, people can make shorter calls.
When the first cell phones were sold, they all had the same ring. Today, most cell phones can be made to ring one of several different tones. But at least one cell phone manufacturer plans to change that.
Nokia plans to start making phones that play pop tunes when they ring. Users could choose tunes by the Spice Girls, Enrique Iglesias, Lenny Kravitz, and many other artists.
By choosing pop tunes instead of the standard ringing sound, cell phone users can program their phones to match their personalities and moods, explained a company spokesperson.

According to the study, which was paid for by the U.S. government, more than 5 million kids, ages 6 to 19, have suffered some hearing loss. That's more than one out of every ten kids. Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss.
Amanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. ""It was assumed in the past that children wouldn't have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage,"" Niskar said.
Niskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a ""problem for children,"" she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems.
Hearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems.
For example, hearing loss ""can influence [a] child's ability to learn in the classroom,"" Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions.
Niskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead.

was made out of a ton of trash, including false teeth, license plates, and tires.
That is exactly the point. ""The museum shows what happens to our trash, how we can reduce our trash, and what we can do instead of throwing our trash away,"" said museum director Sotoria Montanari.
Today, Americans create more garbage than ever before. In the early 1900s, most items were packed in containers that could be used again. Now, most of the food we buy, from cereal to milk, comes in boxes and cartons that can be thrown away.
So what happens to trash after it is tossed out? Some trash ends up in

Plastic bottles can be recycled at centers like this one.
Garbage is a form of solid waste. The Garbage Museum and its recycling plant, which are run by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, provide visitors with ideas to cut down on solid waste. One way is to

Making aluminum cans from recycled cans uses 95 percent less energy and protects Earth's natural resources. In fact, the energy saved each year from recycled cans could light Washington, D.C., for nearly four years!
What are some other ways you can protect natural resources?

The bales are sold to companies that turn the recycled cans into something usable. From recycled aluminum cans, more cans are made. When you buy recycled products, you ""close the loop.""
Each American throws away about 5 pounds of garbage each day. Earth Day, April 22, reminds people how important it is to reduce waste. Here are some ways:

472,"Experts hope 2006 will be the year the world is polio-free.
Will polio be declared a disease of the past?
World health groups are fighting a war
with a crippling and sometimes deadly diseasepolio. Their efforts are paying off. Polio has been wiped out in 10 African countries, according to a recent report.
Since mid-2003, nearly 200 children in those 10 western and central African countries were
for life, but no new cases have been reported since last June. When people are paralyzed, they are unable to move different parts of their bodies and may be unable to walk.
The disease raced across Africa and into Asia after people in Nigeria refused the polio
mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think well get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told
She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria.""
Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly
disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havent been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims.
With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world. On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government approved the use of a vaccine that stopped people from getting the disease. Jonas Salk was the doctor who invented the first polio vaccine.
A boy in Africa receives an oral polio vaccine from a WHO (World Health Organization) worker.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world thanks to Salk, it still threatens children in Africa and Asia. Major efforts were recently under way to
or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been
Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door.
To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November.
After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Its uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives.""
Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization.
Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why?
Jonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.
From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Roosevelts death, Salks vaccine was declared officially safe.
In October 2005for the first time in 26 years in the United Statesfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnt at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.

179,"""May I stay up just a little longer?"" That's the cry heard from kids every night in many U.S. households. That's because most kids don't want to go to bed.
Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks.
The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8? hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said.
Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said.
In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should.
Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school.
Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep.
Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' ""
If a kid loses one hour of sleep a night, how many hours of sleep does he or she lose in a week? A month? A year?

Many cats and dogs have turned into couch potatoes in need of more exercise and less food. Scientists report it's not just people gaining weight. Their pets are putting on the pounds too!
According to the National Research Council, one out of every four cats and dogs in the United States weighs too much. How did these animals get so plump? Many of their owners overfeed them.
Like people, overweight cats and dogs have a greater risk of developing heart disease and other health conditions. The clue for determining whether a pet is overweight is in the ribs. ""If you can feel the ribs under your pet's skin but not see them, your pet is a perfect weight,"" animal expert Karen Volkerts told
Owners can help their plump pups and fat cats shed some extra pounds. Animal experts recommend feeding pudgy pets smaller portions, reducing their number of feedings, and using diet pet food. Regular exercise will also help pets trim down and stay healthy.
Many owners reward their pets or show them affection by giving them table scraps and other treats. Volkerts says that dogs and cats have their own food for a reason.

Kids really can make a difference. Just ask 15-year-old Ryan Hreljac (HURL-jak) of Kemptville, Canada. When he was 6, he learned about the shortage of safe drinking water in some parts of the world. Today, Ryans Well Foundation has raised more than $1.5 million to build more than 200 wells in 11 countries, most in Africa.
During his mission to raise money, Ryan became pen pals with Akana Jimmy, an orphan who lived in Africa. In Jimmys tiny village of Agweo, Uganda, there was no clean water until Ryan raised enough money to buy the village its first well. A new book tells the story of their life-changing friendship
Ryan and Jimmy and the Well in Africa That Brought Them Together.
Jimmy used to wake up before midnight and walk 3 miles to the nearest pond. There, he would fill a large plastic container with
or polluted, water. Jimmy made that trip three times every day before heading to school. ""Because you dont have any choice, you drink it,"" he told
In 1998, Ryans first-grade teacher told the class that polluted water was causing thousands of children to become sick and even die. For Ryan, a lack of clean water was unimaginable. His teacher said the cost of building a well in Africa was just $70. Determined to help, Ryan spent months doing household chores to earn enough money to pay for a well.
Later that year, Ryan proudly took his savings to WaterCan, a Canadian organization that helps provide safe drinking water to impoverished countries. To his disappointment, Ryan was told that the cost of building a well was much higher: $2,000.
or promised, to continue raising money. Word of his mission spread, and soon the media picked up his story. To Ryans astonishment, people started sending him donations. By 2000, Ryan, then 9, had raised enough money to build his first well. With help from Canadian Physicians for Aid and Relief, Ryan chose Jimmys village as the site for the well.
Ryans well changed the lives of the people in Agweo and especially affected Jimmys life. Thats when the two boys became pen pals. They became friends when Ryan traveled to Uganda in 2000 to help complete the well.
In 2003, Ryans family arranged to bring Jimmy to their home in Canada. ""We used to live as friends,"" Jimmy, now 17, says, ""but now we live as brothers.""
The two teenagers hope their book will raise awareness about unsafe drinking water and prompt people to take action to help. ""The situation is difficult, but you have to start somewhere,"" Ryan says. ""We need to work harder to make the world a better place.""
To find out how you can help Ryan and Jimmy bring safe drinking water to countries in need, go to
More than two-thirds of Earths surface is covered in water, so you might think there is enough to go around. You may be surprised to learn that only a scarce, or limited, amount of the water is drinkable. Salty seawater makes up about 97 percent of the worlds water. Another 2 percent is frozen at the North and South poles.
More than 1 billion people around the world dont have access to safe drinking water, according to the United Nations. Why isnt all the freshwater available to people safe for drinking? Chemicals from factories, fertilizers from farms, and untreated sewage pollute the water supply. ""One of our goals is to educate people about the importance of clean water,"" says Ryan.

Instead of using soap and water, the doctors use a special gel. The gel kills germs and saves time. Doctors often take more than a minute to wash their hands with soap and water. The gel speeds things up.
What's more, constant washing and drying with soap and water dries out hands. The gel causes fewer problems, so doctors who use it are less likely to skip a cleaning.
Killing hospital germs is important. About 2 million hospital patients are infected by viruses each year. About 90,000 die from viruses they got in the hospital.
If you're not working in a hospital, using soap and water is good enough. All of us need to keep hands clean to keep germs away. Washing hands is important, especially before eating and before leaving a bathroom, where many germs live. It is important to keep your hands clean at school, too!

Over the next four years, that tour will include studying Saturn, its rings, and its 33 known moons. Scientists say that Saturn holds clues to how the solar system formed. They think that Saturn and its moons are like a miniature version of our solar system.

Saturn, the sixth planet from the sun, lies between Jupiter and Uranus. Of the nine planets in the solar system, Saturn is the second largest, after Jupiter. In fact, more than nine Earths would fit across Saturn.
The planets rings are not solid. They are made up of particles of rock, ice, and dust. Some of the particles are as tiny as grains of sand. Others are as large as skyscrapers. Although the rings are wide, they are also very thin. The planets rings are only about half a mile thick.
In addition to learning about the rings, scientists are studying Saturns moons. The scientists primary focus is Saturns largest moon, Titan. Titan is larger than the planets Mercury and Pluto.
(HOY-ginz). The probe will parachute through the murky atmosphere of Titan and land on its surface. That will be the most far-reaching landing that a spacecraft has ever made from our planet.
Scientists are interested in Titan because they think it might teach them about Earth. Experts used to think that Titan resembled Earth as it was billions of years ago. They are starting to question that idea.
What do scientists expect to find? ""In many ways, the most exciting part of the journey is about to begin because we dont know what lies ahead,"" said NASA scientist Julie Webster.
Earth and the other planets in our solar system travel around the sun. Saturn is so far from the sun that it receives less sunlight than we get on Earth. The sun also looks much smaller from Saturn.

Until recently, scientists didn't know what happened to the Maya. Now they may have found the answer hidden in an ancient staircase. They found the staircase in Dos Pilas, Guatemala. Dos Pilas was an ancient Maya city. Winds from a hurricane uncovered the staircase.
Scientists studied carvings on the steps. The carvings are called

Scientists translated the hieroglyphs. The writing shows that the Maya disappeared after a brutal war.
During the long war, the people living in two Maya cities fought one another. The people of Tikal, in Guatemala, battled the people of Calakmul, in Mexico. The rulers of each city wanted to control the entire area.
Dos Pilas was located south of both cities. Dos Pilas had been founded by the ruler of Tikal as a military outpost. The brother of Tikal's ruler ran the outpost.
At one point in the war, Calakmul took control of Dos Pilas. Calakmul's warriors spared the life of the ruler of Dos Pilas, so he changed sides. He attacked and defeated his brother in Tikal.
""This was not part of a struggle between two brothers, but part of a world war,"" said historian Arthur A. Demarest.
After Dos Pilas defeated Tikal, the brutal war between Tikal and Calakmul got worse. Eventually Tikal regained its former strength and ""roared back and crushed Calakmul,"" Demarest said.
The fighting between the two cities continued for years. The constant warfare weakened both cities.
The war also weakened the Maya civilization, which began to crumble. Today, only ruins of ancient buildings remain as evidence that the Maya once ruled the area.

Daytona Beach, Florida--As millions of racing fans watched the closing lap of the Daytona 500 car race last month, they saw a familiar sight. Dale Earnhardt, nicknamed ""the Intimidator,"" was near the front of the pack.
In an instant, however, Earnhardt's car swerved and slammed into the track's concrete wall. That crash instantly killed the legendary driver, who was considered the Michael Jordan of NASCAR racing. (
stands for National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing.)
When Earnhardt's car, painted with the driver's well-known number 3, slammed into the wall, he was traveling at 180 miles per hour. According to doctors who examined Earnhardt, the racing legend died of a head injury caused by the crash.
Many safety experts say that if Earnhardt had been wearing a HANS device, he might have survived the crash.
The device is a rigid collar that slips over a driver's uniform and rests on his or her shoulders. Two straps connect the helmet to the collar, locking the helmet in place. The device is designed to prevent a driver's head from whipping forward or side to side in an accident.
NASCAR driver Robby Gordon ordered a HANS device immediately after the race in which Earnhardt was killed. ""As a direct result of what happened at the [Daytona] 500, I have ordered the support system,"" said Gordon.
NASCAR officials say they will look more closely at the device and may require drivers to wear it in the future. Until then, drivers, who are well aware of the risks in their sport, will continue to get behind the wheel.

413,"Assur was once one of the greatest cities in the world. About 30,000 people lived there. A huge temple tower, or ziggurat, stood about 200 feet above the city streets. Assur (or Ashur) was one of the leading cities of Assyria, the center of a great empire.
Today, ancient Assur is in ruins. Desert sand has covered over much of the 3,500-year-old city. Now Assur faces a new threat: water.
Assur is located in what is now Iraq, a country in the Middle East. Many parts of Iraq are covered by desert. Water is hard to find in the desert areas. To increase the amount of water, Iraqi officials are building a dam on the river Tigris.
The dam will trap the river's water. As the water rises, it might flood Assur and many other nearby ancient ruins.
Scientists worry that floodwaters will destroy artifacts hidden beneath the desert sand. Assur has already been the site of some amazing discoveries.
Scientists recently discovered four hidden tombs at Assur. They found ancient coffins, gold, jewelry, and gems. They also dug up the remains of two ancient Assurian queens.
Scientists used modern medical equipment to study the queens' bodies. They learned about some of the medical problems the ancient queens suffered from. The bodies showed evidence of dental cavities, sinus infections, and poor nutrition.
Michael Mller-Karpe, a scientist who studies ancient Assyria, said, ""The Assyrian queens have just begun to speak to us, and we are looking forward to more answers.""
Mller-Karpe and other scientists worry that the new dam may keep them from getting more answers. Even if the new dam doesn't flood Assur, the rising water could damage the ancient city. Moisture could cause the artifacts to crumble.
""You can't save Assur if it's [near] a dam,"" said scientist Peter Miglus. The soil beneath the ancient city would soak up water like a sponge. The water in the soil would destroy what's left of ancient Assur.
For now, scientists are scrambling to uncover the secrets hidden for centuries in Assur and other nearby communities. Meanwhile, some people are looking for ways to save the ancient cities. ""We don't want the slightest damage to Assur,"" one Iraqi official said.

He scrambles up high ladders, walks down the sides of buildings, and rides in a fire engine. He is learning to be a firefighter at the New Haven Fire Academy.
Woolfolk and 28 other students are currently learning what it takes to become a firefighter. Classes at the fire academy, which is in Connecticut, last for about 22 weeks. On most days, the students go to school from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. However, once a week, school lasts until 10 p.m.
For two days each week, the students sit in a classroom to learn science, math, and emergency medicine. They learn the science of fires, how to calculate water pressure, and how to treat medical emergencies.
During the other three days, the students go outside and learn how to hook hoses to fire hydrants, climb buildings, rescue people trapped in burning buildings, and many other things.
""Firefighters have to know lots of different things,"" said Pablo Menendez, an instructor at the school. ""We have to treat medical emergencies, know how to handle dangerous chemicals, and rescue people who have fallen from cliffs.""
Teamwork is one of the most important lessons students learn at the school. ""Working together saves lives,"" said Capt. William Seward, the director of the academy. ""Students need to learn that they are part of a team.""
Fighting fires is not easy. The suits and equipment a firefighter wears weigh about 40 pounds.
Firefighters are very busy. In New Haven, they respond to 32,000 emergency calls a year. Each time firefighters go out, they know they might not come back. Across the United States, about 100 firefighters die each year.
""That's why the lessons learned here at the academy are so important,"" said Seward. ""What they learn here can save their lives.""
Firefighters know how dangerous their jobs are. Their training helps them overcome their fear of heights and fires. ""When you're up there on the ladder looking down, it's scary,"" said one student. ""To do this job, you've got to wipe out the fear.""
Firefighters overcome their fear for one reason. ""I wanted to help other people,"" said Leah Harwin. ""I think it is important to help other people whenever you can.""

555,"Dodging Danger: Should Dodgeball Be Tossed Out of School?
For many kids, dodgeball is a harmless game. But gym teacher Neil Williams does not see anything ""harmless"" about the game.
Recently, Williams recalled an accident that happened during his first year teaching. His students were playing dodgeball. Suddenly, the ball slammed into one girl's face, smashing her nose. The girl had to be taken to the hospital.
Soon after that, Williams started a campaign to ban dodgeball from schools. Some schools in several states have already banned the game.
The object of dodgeball is to get other players out by hitting them with a ball. Critics of the game say that it teaches violence. ""The game allows the stronger kids to pick on and target the weaker kids,"" Williams told
Judith Young is the executive director of the National Association for Sport and Physical Education. She told
the game doesn't belong in school. ""I don't have a problem with the game at backyard picnics and parties,"" she said. ""I just don't think it should be used in phys-ed classes.""
Rick Hanetho strongly disagrees. He likes dodgeball so much that he started the National Amateur Dodgeball Association.
Hanetho says dodgeball teaches kids important skills. ""It teaches eye-hand coordination, decision making, concentration, and agility,"" he said.
Hanetho also says that dodgeball does not encourage bullying. ""I don't buy the idea that dodgeball allows some kids to pick on the smaller and weaker kids,"" he said. ""In fact, it's the littler kids who are usually the best players. They are faster and can avoid being hit.""
Here's what some kids have to say about dodgeball:
Isabela, age 11: A dodgeball isn't hard and it can't hurt anyone.
Paloma, age 9: I like dodgeball. You get to run around a lot and that's a lot of fun.
Liliam, age 9: Dodgeball is great because you get to throw the ball at other kids.
Mara: age 10: Some kids don't like dodgeball because they get hit at the beginning of the game. But I like it.

Scientists trained the rats to search for the scent of people. They attached tiny electronic devices to the brain of each rat. Signals from the rat's brain are sent to a radio that is strapped to the animal's back. Rescue teams will be able to track the signals and follow the rat's path. That will help them figure out where to start digging. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next six months.

The gorilla is one of the endangered animals living in the Congo Basin.
Scientists warn that more than half of the forest could disappear within 50 years. Some people illegally cut down trees and hunt wildlife to sell as meat. Many rain forest animals, like the lowland gorilla, are endangered because of illegal hunting.
Gorillas are plant eaters. They also like to eat insects, such as termites and ants. An adult male eats about 40 pounds of food each day!
Young gorillas love to play. They learn new skills by imitating adult gorillas.

This year, there were not enough flu shots for everyone. The people at highest risk received a flu shot first.
Hang in there! The flu strikes the United States for only part of the year. Flu season usually runs from November to March.
Despite the short supply of flu shots, there are ways to stay flu-free. To keep the virus away, practice healthful habits.
Wash your hands often with soap and water.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Germs can easily enter your body there.
Don't share your drinks or eating utensils.

However, some people ignore the laws and still hunt elephants. The huge animals are also endangered because people build homes and farms in areas where elephants live.
African elephants are the largest living land animals. The average male weighs more than four cars!
An African elephant never sweats. Heat escapes through its large ears to keep the animal cool.
African elephants like to take baths every day. Then, they cover themselves in dirt to keep insects away.
The work scientists are doing at Animal Kingdom may help African elephants in the wild. ""If we can tell individual voices apart, we can keep track of each elephant over time,"" says Savage. ""We can tell when elephants are feeling nervous by the voices they are using. In the wild, that would help us know if they are in danger, so we can help them.""

Oil can make animals sick if they swallow it. When oil covers an animal's fur or feathers, it can't swim, fly, or stay warm. If the oil is not cleaned off the animal, it could die.

Since 1984, many more people have moved to areas around Mauna Loa. They have built homes on the volcano's slopes. If the volcano erupts now, hot lava could destroy those homes.
For now, people should not worry too much about an eruption, experts say. ""We're at a stage where it's months to years, rather than days to weeks"" before the next eruption, said scientist Peter Cervelli. Until then, scientists will continue to keep track of changes in the volcano. They hope to give people lots of warning about future eruptions.
Mauna Loa is a shield volcano. Shield volcanoes form from lava flows. When lava cools, it hardens. The lava builds up and forms a low mountain.
Why is it important for scientists to study volcanoes?

Most wild cheetahs live in Africa. Animal experts are worried that cheetahs are in danger of disappearing from parts of Africa. One wildlife group in South Africa is trying to protect these big cats.
The group is working to find out how many cheetahs are left in South Africa and where they roam. To track the animals, they use radio collars, cameras, and aircraft. Experts will use what they learn to find ways to save cheetahs.
The biggest threat to cheetahs comes from people. They have built farms on land where the animals live. As farming areas spread, cheetahs often have trouble finding food. In addition, farmers who want to protect their animals sometimes kill cheetahs.
The good news is that there still is hope for cheetahs. The group is helping to move cheetahs away from the farms to other areas in the wild.
""Cheetahs are very, very special,"" said the group's director. ""It would be a great shame if a time came when our children and our children's children were not able to see the cheetah.""
Cheetahs can run 65 miles per hour. That is about as fast as a car driving on a highway!
In one second, cheetahs can run about 92 feet.

Lincoln served as president during the Civil War (18611865). During that war, Southern states tried to break away from the country. They fought for their right to own slaves. Northern states were against owning slaves. Lincoln was also against slavery. In 1863, he signed the Emancipation Proclamation. It helped free most U.S. slaves.

In 1842, Lincoln married Mary Todd. Together they had four sons.
Lincoln became the 16th U.S. president in 1861. The Civil War started a few weeks later. Lincoln won reelection in 1864.
The war was coming to an end in April 1865. Lincoln was shot on April 14, while watching a play in Washington, D.C. He died the next day. Lincoln is buried in Springfield, Ill.

The old well is located where the Jamestown fort used to be. On April 26, 1607, a group of settlers from England landed in Virginia. After exploring the area, they built a fort. They called the fort Jamestown. Jamestown was the first permanent English town in North America.

The Great Pyramid is made of more than 2 million blocks of stone. Each stone weighs an average of nearly 3 tons. Some experts say it took 100,000 people 20 years to build the Great Pyramid.
Many pharaohs were buried with treasures. To keep thieves out, builders designed the pyramids with hidden rooms. No one knows what happened to Khufu's body or if he was buried with treasures. Perhaps the answer is behind a mysterious door inside the Great Pyramid.
The passage that leads to the door is too small for a person to fit through. On September 16, scientists sent a small robot into the narrow passage. From inside the pyramid, scientists controlled the robot's movements.
The robot drilled a hole through the thick stone door. The robot's camera showed a room on the other side of the door. The room looked empty, except for another door.
The scientists were disappointed they did not find something in the room. Now they want to know what is hidden behind the second door. Some experts say something amazing may be behind the door. Others say there is nothing.
Why do scientists want to find out what is behind the second door?
Scientists hope to return to solve the mystery. Until then, people will have to wonder what is hidden behind door number two.

Overfishing is partly to blame for the problem. Penguins eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called
Fishing boats are catching large amounts of krill. That leaves less food for penguins to eat.
Another reason for the decline in the number of penguins is global warming. Global warming is the slow increase in average temperature around the world. It is causing sea ice to melt. Penguins need the floating sea ice as a place to rest while they search for krill.
Scientists say people contribute to global warming when they drive cars or use electricity. That burns

A celebration is under way for Ben Franklin's 300th birthday. Way is he considered one of the greatest Americans of all time?
Put on your party hat! January 17 is the 300th anniversary of Ben Franklins birth. People across the United States will celebrate the ways this great American helped our country. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, events are taking place all year.
The main event is an exhibit called
Benjamin Franklin: In Search of a Better World.
It began in Philadelphia and will travel to four other states during the yearMissouri,Texas, Colorado, and Georgia.
""In his 300th year, we want people to understand why Ben Franklin is still so important,"" spokesperson Nicola Twilley told
""We want to bring him and his
to life."" A legacy is something passed on to future generations.
Why is Philadelphia making such a big fuss about Franklins birthday? In 1723,when he was 17 years old, Franklin made his home there. He worked to make life in that city better. In Philadelphia, he helped set up the countrys first hospital, public library, and volunteer fire department.
During the 1700s, Philadelphia was the center of American government. When Franklin was young, America was made up of 13 colonies ruled by England. Franklin helped America gain independence. He also helped write the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.
""Hes very inspirational,"" says Twilley. ""He came from a poor background. He had only two years of school. He made himself into one of the greatest Americans of all time.""
If you could interview Ben Franklin, what would you ask him? Why?
Ben Franklin only attended school from the ages of 8 to 10. But his love of learning lasted a lifetime.
Even at a young age, Franklin was a scientist and an inventor. At the age of 10, Franklin invented wooden swim fins to help him swim faster.
When he was 12 years old, Franklin worked in his brothers printing shop. Later, he opened his own shop.

Batman, have you heard? A new kind of ""batmobile"" is in the works!
Scientists in Rhode Island are studying how bats fly. The United States Air Force is funding the $6 million project. It hopes the mammals will offer clues about how to design better-flying aircraft. Mammals are warm-blooded animals that feed their babies milk.
Bats can fly in ways that birds and airplanes can't. The animals' wings have more than 24 joints. The joints allow them to
, or control, their wings while flying. Bats can stretch and bend their wings. This helps them fly higher and faster.

, or move, in tight spaces. They could also fly in more dangerous conditions. The Air Force also hopes to learn how weight affects bat flight. Bats can carry up to 50 percent of their weight while flying. If aircraft designers knew bats' secrets, they could design airplanes that could carry more weight.
Swartz says there is still a lot more to learn about the animals. ""We expect to be studying bats long into the future,"" she says.

This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place.

How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Keep reading to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A

A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the

It's As Easy As One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart (below).
So what's the result? Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

South Korean workers have begun rebuilding railroad tracks that will connect South Korea's capital with North Korea's capital. When complete, the tracks will connect the cities for the first time in 50 years.
The two countries fought a war against each other from 1950 to 1953. The United States, China, and other countries also fought in the war. The war ended when North Korea and South Korea agreed to stop fighting. However, neither country signed a peace treaty. Since then, they have been enemies.

Experts think kites were first made in China more than 2,000 years ago. Legend has it that a Chinese farmer invented the kite. On a very windy day, he tied a string to his hat. He held the string to keep his hat from blowing away.
Traders from China spread kite flying to other parts of the world. ""Kites come in all different shapes and sizes,"" said Van Meers. ""Every culture is unique, and every culture has a different style.""
The kite gets its name from a bird of the same name. Kites are graceful, soaring birds with long, narrow wings. These birds were once common in England. In the 1600s, kids in England made toys that sailed through the sky when pulled with a string. When the toys moved, they looked like the gliding birds.

My family gathers for a big meal. We say a few words in our native language of Abenaki around the table to express our thanks.
What does Thanksgiving mean to Native Americans?
Native people give thanks for all things. Different groups have many thanksgiving festivals during the year.
Native Americans were one of the first to have a fall harvest festival. Squanto and other Native Americans taught the Pilgrims how to survive in a new land. The Pilgrims shared their first harvest with the Native Americans.
In 1620, the Pilgrims landed in what is now Massachusetts. Squanto showed the Pilgrims which crops to grow, such as corn, beans, and squash. He showed them which animals to hunt and where to fish.
A harvest is a gathering of food that has been grown. They shared their food at a feast with Squanto and other Native Americans.

Amelia Earhart loved to fly. She was a famous American pilot.
Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, in 1897. As a child, she liked adventure. She dared to play games that some people thought were just for boys. She climbed trees and played sports. She liked to hunt for rats.
Amelia Earhart sits at the controls of her airplane.
In 1920, Earhart was given her first ride on an airplane. That is when she decided to learn how to fly. She had her first flying lesson the next year. Soon after, she bought her first airplane. It was painted yellow. She called it the Canary. A

Earhart set many flight records and won awards. She made the news often and gained fame. In 1932, she became the first woman to fly
A crowd cheers for Amelia Earhart after she flies solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
At that time, many people believed that flying airplanes was a mans activity. Earhart tried to change that belief. She gave speeches and wrote books. She encouraged other women to learn how to fly.
In 1937, Earhart attempted to set another record. She wanted to become the first woman to fly around the world. During that trip, she disappeared and was never seen again. Experts say that her airplane might have run out of fuel.
Amelia Earhart wore a helmet and goggles when she flew.
Over the years, many people have tried to find Earharts airplane. To this day, the Amelia Earhart story remains a mystery.
A giant balloon of Amelia Earhart is touring the country. The balloon is 45 feet long. It shows Earhart in a red airplane she once flew.
Most balloon characters are male. No one has ever made a balloon of a historical woman before, says Lynette Long. She is the president of Equal Visibility Everywhere (EVE). The group wants more women to be shown in symbols across the country.
An Amelia Earhart balloon takes its first flight in a parade in Indiana.
Why did the group choose Amelia Earhart? She is a great role model for young girls, says Long. She was fearless. We want young girls to say, Hey, I can do anything!
The Amelia Earhart balloon is just the start. EVE hopes to make more balloons of famous American women. Our hope is to make one each year, Long says.

The next time you stick on a Band-Aid, you can thank Earle Dickson. He invented the ready-made bandage in 1920. He wanted to help his wife who often cut her fingers while cooking.
At the time, people had to cut pieces of gauze and tape to make bandages. They were hard to use. Dicksons simple idea was a big success. Today, ready-made bandages come in many shapes, sizes, and colors.

Before the 1920s, people often got into traffic accidents. One day, Garrett Morgan saw a bad accident between a car and a horse-drawn carriage.

Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division (reproduction number LC-USZ62-1784)
In late October 1492, Columbus landed on an island near the United States.
Many of the sailors were scared and tired. They knew they were lost. Columbus told his crew that they would turn around if they didn't see land soon. Thankfully, one of the ctrew members spotted land the next day!
Columbus did not find a shortcut to Asia. Instead, he landed on an island near what is now the United States. Columbus called it San Salvador. People called the Taino (TIGH-noh) lived there. The Taino lived in straw huts and fished from canoes.
Why might some people call Columbus a brave sailor?

A coral reef is home sweet home to many creatures. It is a safe place to live and a great place to find food.
Green sea turtles can weigh more than 300 pounds and grow to about 3 feet long. They can live for a long timeup to100 years! Most green sea turtles eat plants.
Clown fish have trouble hiding because they are so bright. To stay safe, clown fish live near poisonous sea animals. Those animals look like plants.
Dugongs are plant-eating sea animals. They live near some coral reefs. Dugongs have whiskers and round faces. They are sometimes called sea cows.
Moray eels are ocean fish that have long, slim, snakelike bodies. They hide in tiny holes throughout coral reefs. Moray eels eat small fish and octopuses.
Hammerhead sharks have wide, flat heads. They grow to more than 10 feet long. Hammerheads have triangle-shaped teeth with sharp bumps for chewing food.
Regal angelfish live near safe caves of coral reefs. They are brightly striped fish. Angelfish usually swim in pairs. They eat sea sponges or tiny coral reef animals.
Coral reefs are formed by tiny ocean animals called
(PAH-lips). When polyps die, their shells are left behind. More polyps grow on top of the shells. In time, the reef gets bigger. Corals come in many shapes, colors, and sizes.
Why might it be important to protect coral reefs?

Most tornadoes begin as thunderstorms. Air rises from the ground to the storm clouds. Sometimes that rising air starts to spin. A funnel-shaped cloud can form. When the bottom of the cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.
Most tornadoes last fewer than 15 minutes. During that time, they can travel across large areas of land. Winds can reach speeds of 300 miles per hour. The storms can destroy everything in their paths.

In a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear.
Scientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help.
Scientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled.
Scientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest.

A program called Ice Hockey in Harlem teachers kids how to play hockey. They learn the rules of the game and about hockey equipment. Then, one night per week, kids practice hockey at a local skating rink.
To play hockey, the kids have to go to tutoring sessions. The sessions use hockey information as learning tools. For example, the kids practice math skills by comparing hockey teams' scores. If the kids keep their grades up, they can play on hockey teams. Some travel across the country playing other teams.

This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
. That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's as Easy as One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.
Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

Playing outside gives you a chance to breathe fresh air, but it also exposes you to harmful sun rays. Harmful sun rays can cause sunburns. You can get a sunburn even if you are outside for a short amount of time. So when you are in the sun, always wear sunscreen. Use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher, and be sure to rub it evenly into your skin. You should also wear a hat and try to play in the shade.
Whether you ride a bike, ride a scooter, or use in-line skates, be wheel safe. The most serious way kids get hurt while on wheels is by hitting their heads. So always wear a helmet when you are playing on wheels. When you ride scooters and use in-line skates, always wear wrist guards, kneepads, and elbow pads.
What's the Right Way to Wear a Helmet?
A helmet should be straight on the head, just above the eyebrows.
The chin strap should be snug but not too tight.
The rear straps go behind the ears; the front straps should run up and down.
One way to beat the summer heat is by swimming in a cool pool. To stay safe when you swim, you need to follow water-safety rules. Be water safe by swimming only when a grown-up is nearby. You should always swim with a buddy.

Workers put a special device on a few penguins. The device sent information to a computer. The computer showed exactly where each penguin was on its 560-mile swim home.
Did you know that there are 17 kinds of penguins? Here are just a few:
The emperor penguin is the largest of all penguins. It stands about 4 feet tall and can weigh up to 100 pounds.
The little blue penguin is the smallest penguin. It is only a foot high and weighs less than 2 pounds.
The rockhopper penguin has yellow feathers on its head.

Goats are doing their part to help prevent forest fires. Goats eat tall grass, weeds, and small branches. Those plants often spread forest fires in places such as California and Florida.
Many states are using goats to eat plants on mountains and in fields close to people's houses. By eating plants in those areas, the goats leave a clear patch of land. That way, if a fire starts in the forest, it will not be able to spread to where people live.
In 1999, there were about 94,000 forest fires in the United States.
Forest fires in 1999 burned nearly 9,500 square miles of land in the United States.
Most forest fires are started by people. People are sometimes careless with cigarettes and campfires.
Lightning is another cause of forest fires. When the forest is very dry and lightning strikes it, a fire can start.
