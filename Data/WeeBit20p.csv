One of the things he enjoys about living in England is the wide range of people he meets: 'The diversity of cultures here is very exciting'.
However, one of the things he doesn't like is the view of racial origins, which is implied in the word 'half-caste', still used by many people to describe people of mixed race. The term now is considered rude and insulting. Find out more about the word 'caste' at the end of this section.

of the title. He makes his money from trading costly goods on his ships. He appears to be rich and successful.
At the start of the play he is
The reason for this is never made clear. He says the world is
""A stage where every man must play a part, / And mine a sad one.""
Why do you think he is so sad?
He is happy to lend him money, even though Bassanio is in his debt already and Antonio has to borrow money to do so.
Solanio, describing Bassanio's departure to Belmont, says of Antonio and Bassanio's friendship,
""I think he only loves the world for him.""
When news comes of his lost ships, Antonio asks Bassanio to come home, but does not force him. He writes,
When he believes he is going to die, he tells Bassanio,
and seems glad to be paying Bassanio's debt with his life.
Antonio promises surety for Bassanio again in Act V, when Portia is questioning Bassanio about the loss of his ring, saying
""I once did lend my body for his wealth, ...I dare be bound again, / My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord / Will nevermore break faith advisedly.""
Some directors have suggested a homosexual relationship between Antonio and Bassanio. (Antonio certainly never makes any mention of wanting a wife.) What do you think of this idea?
He is apparently generous to other people too, as he never lends money for profit.
to Shylock over a long period of time, even though he is a Christian. (He obviously does not love his enemies, as Christians are taught to do!)
""many a time and oft / In the Rialto have you rated me / About my money and my usances.""
Whilst in prison, he recognises that Shylock hates him because he lent money to people to help them pay their debts to Shylock - yet makes no mention of other reasons why Shylock would hate him, such as all the verbal abuse he has given him!
When his own life has been spared, Antonio forces Shylock to become a Christian, which he must know is the worst penalty of all for the Jew. Do you think he does this because he is passionate about converting people to Christianity, or to gain revenge?
He believes that the laws of Venice should be upheld - even if it means losing his life.
""The Duke cannot deny the course of law.""
He seems to enjoy life! We know right from the start that he has a sense of humour, since his first words are
""Good signors both, when shall we laugh?""
He has already spent his own fortune having a good time.
When he first talks of marrying Portia, we wonder about his motives - he seems more interested in her money than anything else when he describes her to Antonio:
""In Belmont is a lady richly left, / And she is fair""
However, when he has to choose between the caskets, he says that he is tortured -
- not knowing whether he can marry her or not.
When he sees her portrait inside the lead casket, he praises her highly and calls her a
(Do you think he goes over the top here?)
He leaves Portia immediately to return to Venice to help Antonio in prison, but says he won't sleep until he meets her again.
Yet, during the trial, he tells Antonio he would sacrifice
""life itself, my wife and all the world to save him.""
He does not recognise Portia in disguise.
He is very reluctant to give 'Balthazar' the ring that Portia gave him, yet does so when Antonio asks him to.
He gives an honest account of why he gave the ring away and swears heartfelt and lifelong devotion to Portia -
- at the end of the play.
Like Antonio, he is prejudiced against Shylock.
He is anxious about the deal that Antonio makes with Shylock, calling Shylock
He helps in the elopement of Jessica with Lorenzo by inviting Shylock to dinner on the night they escape.
During the trial, he tries to persuade Balthazar to change the law in favour of Antonio, calling Shylock
who earns his living by charging interest on money he loans (like modern banks). He often speaks prose in the play, which marks him out as an outsider.
""suff'rance is the badge of all our tribe.""
He is verbally abused and bullied by most characters in the play and is called cruel names including
""villain with a smiling cheek, cut-throat dog, bloody creditor, damned inexecrable dog""
He is very astute and is aware of other people's concerns - he knows all about Antonio's business ventures.
""I hate him for he is a Christian; / But more, for that in low simplicity / He lends out money gratis.""
So, why does he make such a strange agreement with Antonio, asking for a pound of Antonio's flesh instead of interest if the loan is not repaid within the arranged time? Does he genuinely want to be friends with Antonio when he says
""I would be friends with you, and have your love?""
His daughter hates him and calls him a
We see him being impatient with her and ordering her around. When she runs away, he seems as upset about the loss of his money as her:
""My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter! ... My ducats and my daughter!""
It would seem that Shylock cares for money more than anything else. Yet in an often forgotten moment When Shylock finds out his daughter traded his wife's ring for monkey he cares only for its sentimental value.
""Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my turquoise; / I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor: / I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.""
Perhaps it is the loss of Jessica as well as all the harsh treatment he has suffered from Antonio - and others - over the years that makes him bitter enough to ask for Antonio's pound of flesh.
He cleverly argues in Act III, scene 1 that he is as much a man as a Christian is and so will follow the example the Christians set by seeking revenge.
""The villainy you teach me I will execute.""
He is thrilled to hear that another of Antonio's ships is lost, making Antonio more vulnerable.
""I thank God, I thank God. Is it true, is it true?""
that he will win, telling Antonio while he is in prison,
""Thou call'dst me dog ... But since I am a dog, beware my fangs.""
He knows that the Venetian justice system will have to support him and so relishes beating Antonio at his own game.
refuses to listen to all the pleas for mercy
during the trial scene (from the Duke, Bassanio and Balthazar), insisting all the time on justice and his pound of flesh. Do you think this is this a sign of strength or foolishness? He could have pardoned Antonio and shown himself to be morally superior - but would this have done him any good in the long run?
Caught out by Portia, by the end of the trial he has lost all his money and has to suffer the humiliation of being forced to become a Christian. Shakespeare doesn't give Shylock any lines to tell us how he feels. How should he react? We never find out what happens to him.
Weighing up all you know about Shylock, do you consider him to be more a

very quickly, when Portia marries Bassanio. (Their marriage is dependent on Bassanio choosing the right casket too! Is this rash?)
He is vicious in his abuse of Shylock:
""thy desires / Are wolfish, bloody, starved and ravenous.""

who falls in love with Shylock's daughter Jessica and elopes with her. We hear of them travelling through Italy, rashly spending huge amounts of money.

Does this reflect on his own love for Jessica?

- but does not seem to do much that is practical to help her.
He is the most important man in Venice
We see him in the trial scene (Act 4, scene 1) only, although we have heard both of him and the importance of the Venetian law before. He has a reputation for upholding the law, so Shylock is confident: he tells the imprisoned Antonio,
The Duke is sympathetic towards Antonio and is obviously biased against Shylock, calling Shylock an
""'tis thought / Thou'lt show thy mercy""
- is he giving Shylock an opportunity to give in gracefully?
He does not want to see Antonio killed, yet he will not bend the laws to save him, as that would undermine the rule of law. He is happy for Balthazar to deal with the case.
He shows some mercy to Shylock, as he does not condemn him to death for plotting against the life of a Venetian - but he does allow Antonio to force Shylock to become a Christian.
We first hear of her when described by Bassanio as
and full of wondrous virtues. The Prince of Morocco calls her
She is bound by her father's will to marry the man who chooses correctly between a gold, silver and lead casket - one contains her portrait. She resents this:
""I may neither choose who I would, nor refuse who I dislike.""
Our first impressions of Portia, as she describes her suitors to Nerissa, show that she is

She is nervous when as he chooses a casket, fearing to lose him. She tells him
. (Is she joking, or is this another way of showing her love for Bassanio?)
She is delighted when he chooses the right casket and appears worried that she will not come up to Bassanio's expectations:
""I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends, / Exceed account.""
""Myself and what is mine, to you and yours / Is now converted.""
Why does she now not seem as independent as she was before?
She gives him a ring as a token of her love. (Do you think that she is already planning to test him?)
She immediately offers to pay Antonio's debt twice over, just because he is a friend of Bassanio's.
, a lawyer, and arranges to go to Venice to help Antonio. This shows
""It is twice blessed; / It blesses him that gives, and him that takes.""
She allows Shylock to believe he will have his pound of flesh (and Antonio to know that he will die) right until the last moment, when she outwits him. Is this cruel? (She must have known about the loophole all along.) Or does Shylock get what he deserves?
She goes on to show no mercy to Shylock when she tells him that he must not draw blood. She is
: she first forbids Shylock to retract the bond and then goes on to enact an ancient Venetian law against him for having threatened Antonio's life, that could result in Shylock's death.
She is similarly ruthless to Bassanio, making him give her - still dressed as Balthazar - her ring as a thank you gift for saving Antonio. The fact that she can plan this trick immediately after Shylock's humiliation suggests she has a clear conscience over what has happened.
As she returns to Belmont, she is accompanied by a
and spends a lot of time praying. Is this an extra stratagem to bolster her deceptions (as, after all, she had pretended to Lorenzo that she and Nerissa were going to a convent while their husbands were away), or genuine Christian feeling?
She enjoys mocking Bassanio about his loss of the ring, going as far to say she will sleep with the lawyer Balthazar (which of course she will!), before she reveals the trick. She is very much in control!
at the end: herself and Bassanio, Nerissa and Gratiano, Jessica and Lorenzo (by telling them that they will inherit Shylock's fortune) and Antonio - she tells him that three of his ships are safe. There is mystery surrounding this news: she tells him,
""You shall not know by what strange accident / I chanced upon this letter.""
How did she get hold of the letter and when? (If she knew of the letter before the trial, the trial need not have happened, since Antonio would have been able to pay Shylock - so did she deliberately engineer the trial for some reason? If so, why?)
Portia confides in her and she is confidant enough to take Portia to task when we first see them together. She obviously knows all about Portia's taste in men! She describes Bassanio as
She becomes engaged to Gratiano very quickly, soon after they met. (Will they be happy?)
She joins Portia in the deception at the trial, by disguising herself as a lawyer's clerk.

If the data wasnt backed up then the consequences could be disastrous depending on what data was lost. If a business lost details of all the payments it had yet to receive the business could go bankrupt as they wouldnt know what was owed to them or by who.
Businesses typically use magnetic tape to backup important data. Your average home user is unlikely to backup their data but those who do will most likely use an external hard disk.
Some data is more valuable than other data and some data is changed more frequently than other data. These are the kind of issues that must be taken into account when deciding how often to backup data.
The value of the data should determine how frequently it is backed up.
If the data doesnt change often then it doesnt need to be backed up as often, maybe just after each change. If the data changes frequently then it should be backed up frequently (maybe every evening).
Some data may not be being used very often but it may still be useful or needed in the future. In this case data can be archived. Archived data is copied to a suitable storage medium (perhaps
used to store data, eg a movie
or magnetic tape) then it is stored safely and securely. The original data is then deleted from the computer system. This is done to free up storage space for new data.

Nearly a year later, an elderly gentleman is brutally clubbed to death in the street by Hyde. The murder is witnessed by a maid who recognises Hyde.
A letter addressed to Utterson is found on the body and the police contact him. He recognises the murder weapon as the broken half of a walking cane he gave to Jekyll years earlier. When he hears that the murderer is Hyde, he offers to lead the police to his house.
They are told that Hyde has not been at home for two months. But when they search the house they find the other half of the murder weapon and signs of a hasty exit.

But the use of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides may damage the environment. This may have a bad effect on the lives of some people, particularly those who live in the countryside.
Some people believe that organically produced food is healthier for people to eat. They think that people will benefit from eating food produced using

Sustainable development involves using the Earths resources in a way that can continue in the future. It meets the needs of people today, without preventing the needs of people in the future being met.
The methods used in organic farming depend on naturally produced materials such as manure and natural
chemicals used to kill insects, weeds and micro-organisms that might damage crops
. These can be used indefinitely without any fear of their supply running out. Intensive farming uses synthetic fertilisers and pesticides. These are made from chemicals obtained from crude oil, which is a finite resource. One day the supply of crude oil will run out.

Some people believe that food from crops that have been produced by genetic modification may be harmful to us. They also suggest environmental problems that could be caused by the growing of these crops. They say that genetically modified crops should not be grown. This is a judgement of values.
Different courses of action may be taken in different social and economic situations.
In developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, farmers can easily buy and use synthetic
nutrients applied to crops to speed up growth
. Using intensive farming methods results in high yields of crops.
In many developing countries farmers cannot obtain or cannot afford to pay for synthetic fertilisers. They use other methods of agriculture to provide nutrients for their crops. This may include the use of manure, crop rotation or slash and burn agriculture. In slash and burn farming, areas of forest are burned and the ground used to grow crops for a few years until nutrients run out. Generally these methods lead to lower yields of crops.

include cutting and creasing, varnishing, laminating, embossing and foil applications.
Graphic products with moving parts, such as models and pop-ups, may require pulleys, levers and other mechanisms in their manufacture.
Printing 1: screen printing, block printing and photocopying
There are many different printing techniques used in graphics production. Some of these can only be done using expensive industrial machines, but others - such as screen printing, block printing and photocopying - can easily be done in school.
This is a way of making multiple copies of a 2D design on a wide range of materials including fabrics, plastics, paper and card. The screen is made from a fine mesh material fixed to a wooden frame. A

is laid on the mesh and ink forced through the cut-out shapes onto the paper below.
Screen printing is not very good for fine detail, and normally only one colour is used. It is suitable for small print runs (less than a few hundred copies) and is ideal for printing posters, T-shirts, display boards, fabric, wallpaper and control panels of electronic products.
This technique is appropriate for small- and medium-sized runs, and printing on paper or card. Blocks can be made from wood, metal or linoleum. A shape is cut into the block and ink applied. The block is then pressed onto the paper to make the print.
Block prints can be quite detailed if the block is well made, but are normally in only one colour. The process is good for making positive and negative images and repeating patterns. Block printing is popular for designs on greetings cards, wallpaper, paper tablecloths and similar products.
A photocopier is a useful graphic design tool. Colour photocopiers are now common and give good results, but the copies are more expensive.
Most copiers can enlarge and reduce and process a range of different paper sizes (A5 to A3), as well as card and clear
. They can also do back-to-back copying and collate multiple copies.
Photocopiers can assist with the following graphic design tasks:
arranging multiple small drawings on a page
making multiple versions of the same drawing to make a pattern, or explore different treatments (eg different colours or textures)
enlarging or reducing drawings to fit a space
gives the creator of an original piece of work control over its publication, distribution and adaptation
copying artwork sheets to maintain a consistent style in a project folder
These printing techniques require more expensive equipment, but will be found in commercial graphics manufacturing.
This method was originally done with moveable type. It is a form of
- where the parts to be printed, both type and illustrations, are raised up from the base plate. It is commonly used for small printing jobs such as business cards and stationery. Illustrations for letterpress printing are made by a photographic process. Types of letterpress printing machines are:
The paper is pressed against the printing plate by a flat piece of metal called a platen. The plate is inked by rollers as the platen is opened.
These have a curved printing surface and can print single sheets at a high speed.
are fed between the plate and a pressure roller.
The printing plate is flat and paper is passed over it by a rotary pressure roller.
Letterpress printing is not often used now, as it is time-consuming to set up the loose type and make the plates, and there is only a limited range of fonts and styles.
Letterpress printing of newspapers. Nowadays flexography or offset-litho presses are used.
This is similar to letterpress printing. It uses a

image and thin, flexible printing plates made of rubber or photopolymer. The image on the plates is produced by a photographic process, and the inks are quick-drying thin liquids. Flexography can be used to print on materials such as cellophane, polythene and metallic films, so the technique is used for printing plastic shopping bags and packaging for food products. It is also used to print newspapers and paperback books.
This is the most widely used method of printing today, and is equally good for colour work as for black and white printing. The process works on the principle that oil and greasy substances do not mix with water. The plate to be printed is coated with a type of grease, then rinsed, dampened with water and coated with ink. The ink only sticks to the parts of the plate that are not wet with water. The plate is fixed to a cylinder, paper is fed through and the image is transferred onto the paper.
work using the same principle, but the paper does not come into direct contact with the printing plate, as the image is first transferred to a rubber roller. The printing plates for lithography are made by a photographic process. Lithography is used for medium and long printing runs of products such as magazines, posters, packaging and books.
For this process, the image to be printed is made up of small holes sunk into the surface of the printing plate. The cells are filled with ink and the excess is scraped off the surface, then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing plates are usually made from copper and may be produced by engraving or etching. Gravure printing is used for long, high-quality print runs such as magazines, mail-order catalogues, packaging, and printing onto fabric and wallpaper. It is also used for printing postage stamps and decorative plastic laminates, such as kitchen worktops.
Some printed materials will need to be cut after printing, and, if necessary, creased so that they can be folded. This particularly applies to packaging, but also to pop-up cards and books, and press-out shapes for model making.

supports the material being cut and has a hole or a recess into which a punch made of cutting blades fits exactly. The punch and die are fitted into a punching machine, or sometimes a converted letterpress machine. The work to be cut is fitted into the machine and the punch lowered down to cut. For creasing, the same technique is used, but with blunt blades that will crease the product. Cutting can also be done with a

Mechanisms in graphics production are used to provide movement in models, pop-up cards and other products with moving parts.
A lever is a rigid piece of material that turns about a
. An input force (the effort) applied to one end of a lever is transmitted to the other end of the lever to move the output force (the load).
The fulcrum of a lever does not have to be in the middle. If the fulcrum is nearer to the load, then a large load can be moved with a small effort (travelling a longer distance). If the fulcrum is nearer to the effort, then a small load requires a larger effort (but travelling a shorter distance).
Pulleys are used to transmit rotary movement from one place to another - for example in a display model.
A pulley is a wheel with a groove round the outside to hold a driving belt. Two pulley wheels arranged some way apart can transmit motion over considerable distances.
If the two wheels are in the same plane, the transferred motion will be in the same direction. If the direction of movement needs to change, the wheels can be set at an angle to each other, with the drive belt turned through the same angle. A crossed drive belt will cause the two wheels to turn in opposite directions.

The poem is a true story, or ""as true as I and my memory can make it"". (Clarke was a young girl when the main event happened, perhaps the same age as the child in the poem.) It is about a girl who nearly drowned in a lake and was given the kiss of life by Clarke's mother. When the child was taken back to her

Perhaps Clarke chose this structure because, in a way, it reflects what the poem suggests about memory - the main points are fixed but the details are looser.
Think about how the language the poet uses helps to convey her ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is the scene of the near-tragedy, Cold Knap Lake, an artificial lake in a park in Glamorgan. It is haunting that the name of the lake includes the word Cold - it is a word we associate with fear and death, ideas that are explored in the poem.

Either way, the beating troubled Clarke so much that she wonders whether it actually happened -

The fourth stanza contains one very long, sprawling sentence, broken over several line-ends: it's hard to grasp exactly what is being said, beyond the impressions of shadowy willows, murky water, and low-flying swans. This lends an obscure, dream-like feeling to the description.

A good way to decide on the
The mood or manner of a text or part of a text. The author's 'tone of voice' or way in which they expect to be understood. The emotional load carried by a text.
of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. How would you read this poem?
in a matter-of-fact, straightforward tone, reporting an event?
in a wistful tone, as if dwelling on the many years that have passed between the events described and the present, and other lost things?
in a matter-of-fact tone, as if simply recounting what happened.
in a dreamy, romantic tone, as if telling a fairy story?
In fact you might use all three of these tones of voice, at least in part. The first two lines are straightforward reporting, so matter of fact would be fine here. From then on, however the poem veers away from this tone, becoming dreamy, wistful, romantic - almost mystical. So the other two tones of voice would be more appropriate here.
This poem seems to be about the nature of memory, especially of child-hood memories. The speaker's recollection of the event is apparently quite clear at the start of the poem - yet it gradually becomes clear that she is not really sure whether all of it really happened, and the description gradually comes to seem more and more suggestive of a fairy tale or dream.
Look at these quotations, and our suggestions about how to 'read' them.
.. a heroine, her red head bowed .. my mother ..
Clarke's mother is a heroine in both senses. She saves a child's life through her prompt action; but she is also - working her miracle of resuscitation - like fairy-story heroine of saintly goodness and magical powers.
My father took her home to a poor house ..
Clarke seems to sympathise with the girl and her family for their poverty. Poor is used twice (lines 13 and 22); it reminds us of fairy tales where the heroine is poor, like Rumplestilkskin. Being poor of course does not excuse the thrashing inflicted on the child for almost drowning!
Although Clarke has narrated the events in some detail, she then checks herself - 'Was I there?' The events seem very real to her but she is aware that her memory could have been influenced by other things she'd seen and heard of.
.. satiny mud blooms in cloudiness / after the treading, heavy webs of swans ..
By the fourth stanza, the memory has become as murky and misty as the cloudy blooms of mud in the lake. Then there are the swans - another magical ingredient, since young maidens often turn into swans in fairy stories!
In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems explore the more dangerous aspects of water, Clarke focusing on its power to suck us in and drown us, Heaney on its potential for violent destructiveness during a storm. Clarke's poem uses the lake to symbolise the shifting quality of memory, while Heaney's poem is more purely descriptive.

The way a text is built and shaped. Chapters, plot, acts and scenes, stanzas, narrative, verse-form, rhyme and rhythm - all these (and many more) are aspects of structure.
In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other.
The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas and attitudes and tone.
Compare Cold Knap Lake with one other post-1914 poem and two pre-1914 poems of your choice that involve water. What is each poet's attitude to the water they describe?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Seamus Heaney's Storm on the Island, Walt Whitman's Patrolling Barnegat, and John Clare's Sonnet.
What would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing Cold Knap Lake with each of these three poems.
Compare your answer with the hints below:
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Both poems are about water when it is dangerous. Clarke describes a near-drowning while Heaney describes the savage sea in a storm.
In Clarke's poem the water seems to subtly hide its dangers (e.g. satiny mud blooms in cloudiness) but Heaney recognises its force and violence - the flung spray hits the very windows.
Clarke uses the image of water to question our powers of memory, whereas Heaney uses it to show the power of nature.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Like Heaney, Whitman describes a violent storm at sea.
Like Clarke, however, Whitman hints at the supernatural. His references to demoniac laughter and the savage trinity seem on the surface more threatening than the fairytale references in Clarke's poem.
We question the endings of both poems. We wonder about the dim weird forms that Whitman sees and about the lost things that Clarke imagines drowned in the lake.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Yet for Clare, the water is innocent. It is part of the beauty of summer as it supports the wildlife: marsh marigolds and water lilies, moor hens and insects. Clarke also suggests the beauty of the water (e.g. long green silk), but for her it could be hiding something potentially sinister, while for Clare it is simply the clear lake.
The sonnet form suggests Clare's love of the water, while Clarke's use of alternating stanzas and half rhyme suggests an uncertainty. She cannot be sure what is under the water; she cannot be sure of her memory.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

William Butler Yeats was born in Ireland in 1865. His father and brother were famous painters, but Yeats chose to concentrate on literature, composing poetry, editing the poems of others (including William Blake) and writing plays.
He was fascinated by the history and culture of Ireland, particularly its folklore, and went on to become involved in Irish politics - he was a nationalist and wanted Ireland to be self-governing.
This poem was written in 1899, so is one of his earlier poems. It reflects his interest in the Irish peasantry.

Smooth the material to the lines marked out
Shaping by wasting simply means cutting away material to leave the desired shape. It gets its name because the material which is removed, such as shavings or sawdust, is usually thrown away. Shaping by wasting can be done on any type of material.

Deforming is a method of shaping materials by either bending in a straight line or by creating a bowl or dish shape. The key methods for deforming materials in a straight line or in two dimensions are described below:
. Thin metal may be bent whilst cold, while thicker metal may need heating or
heating a metal to toughen it, so it will not break when bent. Some metals like copper will go red when hot. With those that don't glow like aluminium, put soap on them first, it will be hot enough when the soap goes black.
. Larger pieces of metal may also need to be heated first.
The material is marked where it is to be bent, and clamped to the line in the vice or folding bars. To prevent damaging the material as you hit it with the mallet, place a piece of wood next to it and hit that instead.
. This is done by cutting thin strips of wood, putting glue on the strips and clamping them into a
a hollow form into which a softened material is placed. The material hardens and the mould is then removed to produce a product of the desired shape

A mould is made in two halves - top and bottom. Sheet plastic is placed between the two halves, which are then heated and pressure applied. The heat from the mould causes a chemical reaction in the plastic which enables it to assume the new shape. Press moulding is used to make electrical fittings, handles, and many other products. It can only be used with

Most metals can be cast, but in school usually only aluminium is used.
Create the required shape in a soft material - usually wood. This is called a pattern.
Make a mould by placing the pattern in special casting sand inside a moulding box or flask. The sand is made to stick together using water or oil.
The pattern is removed and metal poured into the cavity.
Die casting uses a metal mould which can be very detailed. The mould is made in two parts to allow the casting to be removed. Die casting is a very important industrial process used for many different types of products.
Die-cast aluminium engine parts  Injection-moulded plastic hardhat.
Extrusion is used to produce long, but fairly thin products such as pipes or curtain tracks. Both plastics and metal can be extruded. The material is forced through a die, which contains a hole which is the same shape as the required product.
Injection moulding is a similar process to die casting. A metal mould is used and softened or molten plastic is forced into the mould by pressure from a screw thread or pneumatic plunger. The mould is made in two parts to allow the moulding to be removed. Polythene, polystyrene, polypropylene and nylon are the plastics most often used in injection moulding, which is used extensively in industry.

Once the body has made an antibody that recognises a particular micro-organism, it is able to make it again very quickly. This means that if the micro-organism infects the body again, more antibodies are made rapidly. This protects the body against that micro-organism, which means that you are immune to it.
through vaccination. Different vaccines are needed for different pathogens.
Vaccination involves putting a small amount of an inactive form of a pathogen into the body. Vaccines can contain:
live pathogens treated to make them harmless
a type of natural poison produced by an organism, often as a form of protection
Foreign organisms that get into the body, and trigger an immune response.
. When injected into the body, they stimulate white blood cells to produce antibodies to fight the pathogen.

Vaccinations in early childhood can offer protection against many serious diseases. Sometimes more than one vaccine is given at a time, like the MMR triple vaccine against mumps, measles and rubella.
Sometimes vaccine boosters are required because the immune response memory weakens over time. Anti-tetanus injections may need to be repeated every ten years, for example.
There is often a conflict between a persons right to decide what is best for themselves and their family, and what is best for society as a whole. For example, some people used to think the MMR vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella could cause autism in children. They decided not to risk letting their child have the vaccine and just hope they would not catch measles, mumps or rubella. But this meant that, as less and less children were vaccinated, the three diseases began to spread more easily and the number of cases began to increase. Therefore, a decision originally taken by a single individual had big implications for society as a whole.
Vaccinations can never be completely safe because side-effect levels vary. So, when making a decision, these are some of the factors that should be considered:
When fewer people are vaccinated, the number of cases of the disease increases.
The chance of falling seriously ill or dying from the disease may be far greater than the chance of experiencing a serious side-effect.
Using a vaccine may be much cheaper than treating a very ill person.

against them. A new flu vaccine has to be developed every year, after the strain has been analysed.

from 2006 about the recommendation that pregnant women should be offered the flu vaccine in winter.
The government has policies on vaccination. It advises on when people should be vaccinated against different diseases. The policies and advice are updated as and when new scientific information becomes available.
Ideas about science - weighing up arguments
With respect to vaccination policies, you need to be able to:
Say clearly what the issue is. For example, is the risk of suffering side-effects from the vaccination greater or less than the risk of catching the disease?
Summarise different views that might be held. For example, some people used to think there was a risk of children developing autism when they had the MMR vaccine. Other people thought the MMR vaccine was safe and there was no risk of developing autism.
Identify and develop arguments based on the idea that the right decision is the one that leads to the best outcome for the majority of people. For example, even though there may be a slight risk from being vaccinated, society as a whole will benefit because it will help to reduce the risk of the disease being passed on to other people.
Identify and develop arguments based on the idea that certain actions are never justified, because they are unnatural or wrong. For example, most people think the government should not pass a law making vaccination compulsory, because it would take away our human right to freedom of choice.
HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. It is particularly difficult to develop a vaccine against HIV. This is because the virus not only mutates very quickly but it damages the infected persons
the body's defence system against diseases and infections
During an epidemic, an infectious disease spreads very quickly. Epidemics can be prevented if a high proportion of the population has been vaccinated. This reduces the number of people who are able to catch the disease and pass it on to others. The more infectious the disease, the higher the proportion of the population that must be vaccinated to prevent the epidemic.
With respect to vaccination policies, you need to be able to distinguish what can be done, ie what is technically feasible, from what should be done. For example, smallpox is the only disease that has been eradicated from the planet by vaccination. This was possible because smallpox is spread by direct contact, and not through the air.
This made it possible to vaccinate enough people in the world to completely stop the disease from spreading.
Some other diseases are more infectious. But if we could vaccinate a sufficient number of the worlds population we could, in theory, eliminate the disease. However, at the moment this is not technically feasible because we do not have enough vaccine, some areas of the world are at war and inaccessible, and some people would refuse to be vaccinated.

5266,"A lot of everyday items are made from polymers. Many of these polymers are not biodegradable - microbes cannot digest them and they take a long time to break down. Polymers are usually disposed of by burying them in landfill sites or burning them in incinerators. These methods of disposal cause environmental problems, and waste valuable resources.
The properties of polymers depend on the structure and bonding found in their molecules. Smart materials such as Gore-Tex have more useful properties than other polymers.
Polymers are large molecules formed from many identical smaller molecules (monomers).
. Addition polymers are formed from alkenes. For example:
ethene can polymerise to form polyethene, which is also called polythene
a typical use of polythene is for a plastic shopping bag or plastic bottle
a typical use of polystyrene is for insulation and protective packaging
Some polymers are not made from alkene monomers. These are called condensation polymers. Nylon and polyesters are like this. They can be drawn into very fine fibres and woven into cloth for clothing. Often, natural fibres such as cotton are mixed with nylon or polyester fibres to make a soft but hard-wearing cloth.
One of the useful properties of polymers is that they are unreactive, so they are suitable for storing food and chemicals safely. Unfortunately, this property makes it difficult to dispose of polymers. They are often buried in landfill sites or incinerated - burned.
Waste polymers are disposed of in landfill sites. This uses up valuable land, and suitable sites often fill up quickly.
Polymers release a lot of heat energy when they burn. This energy can be used to heat homes or generate electricity. But there are problems with incineration. Carbon dioxide is produced, which adds to global warming. Toxic gases are also produced, unless the polymers are incinerated at high temperatures.
Polymers have recycling symbols like this one for PVC to show what they are
Many polymers can be recycled. This reduces disposal problems and the amount of crude oil used. But first the different polymers must be separated from each other. This can be difficult and expensive.
Most polymers, including poly(ethene) and poly(propene), are not biodegradable. This means microorganisms cannot break them down, so they may last for many years in rubbish dumps. However, it is possible to include chemicals that cause the polymer to break down more quickly. Carrier bags and refuse bags made from degradable polymers are already available.
Nylon has some desirable properties. It does not let ultraviolet light pass through it, and it is:
Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.
Gore-Tex has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.
Teflon is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.
Gore-Tex fabric is a sandwich of materials
Structure and properties of polymers - higher
Strong covalent bonds join atoms to each other in individual polymer molecules. Weak intermolecular forces attract polymer molecules towards each other. The properties of solid materials like polymers depend on:
the strength of the forces between these molecules
A polymer will melt when the intermolecular forces are overcome. The stronger the forces, the more energy is needed to break them, and the higher the materials melting point.
Many polymers, such as poly(ethene), contain long molecules that lie side by side. These can uncoil and slide past each other, making the material flexible. Long polymer chains have stronger forces of attraction than shorter ones: they make stronger materials.
Cross-linking is where the polymer chains are chemically joined together in places, by covalent bonds. The polymer molecules cannot slide over each other so easily. This makes materials tougher and less flexible, and they cannot be easily stretched. Cross-linking also gives materials high melting points.
Vulcanised rubber has cross-links. Its polymer molecules are cross-linked by sulfur atoms. It is tough but flexible, and used for making tyres.

ozone layer as they attack and destroy ozone molecules.
The ozone layer is a high level layer of gas in the stratosphere. The ozone helps to keep out harmful ultra-violet rays, which cause sunburn on human skin and damage plants.
The resulting ozone holes let harmful ultra-violet radiation in and add to the greenhouse effect.
CFCs can be used in aerosols, such as hairspray cans, fridges and in making foam plastics.
CFCs were banned in many countries in the mid-1990s after it was found that they were breaking up the Earth's ozone.

Aerosol sprays contain pressurised liquids which are released as a fine spray by the use of gas. Before 1989 they used chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which were found to damage the Earth's ozone layer.
There is also debate over how quickly the earth is warming up. Some scientists estimate that atmospheric temperatures could rise by 1.4 - 5.8C in the next 100 years. Others believe that they will rise more slowly.
The map above shows which countries are responsible for the most emissions. LEDCs want to develop and to catch up with MEDCs and this normally means using more energy and burning more fuel. So global warming could threaten development.
Global warming could melt the world's ice caps and glaciers, leading to an increase in sea levels. Some scientists estimate that over the next hundred years sea levels could rise by between 10cm and 90cm - making many coastal areas around the world uninhabitable.

Sustainable means using something or doing something in a way that minimises damage to the environment and which avoids using up natural resources, eg by using renewable rather than scarce resources.
Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.

The main greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. They are naturally occurring in atmosphere, but are believed to have increased through burning more oil, petrol, and coal, while forests have been removed.
With energy consumption rising, it is important that industry, transportation and consumers in their homes use energy more efficiently, so that less is wasted. This will also save money on fuel bills. We can all help by making changes to our lifestyles and our houses - for example by:
Walking, cycling, or using public transport rather than fossil-fuel powered cars.
Reducing the number of aircraft journeys taken (especially short-haul flights).
Switching off lights, power sockets, phone chargers and TVs when not in use.

Many scientists, governments and international bodies (but not all) accept the greenhouse effect and global warming theories. Some argue that the greenhouse effect, and the extent to which greenhouse gases contribute to it, have both been exaggerated. Some argue that the predicted rises in atmospheric temperatures and sea levels are overestimated.
Environmental campaigners argue that oil companies have contributed to environmental problems. Some activists even claim that wars in the Middle East were influenced by Western governments and oil companies' plans to get access to oil reserves.
On the other hand, many representatives of oil companies and industries that use a lot of energy argue that environmentalists have exaggerated the extent to which fossil fuels pollute the atmosphere, and the impact this will have on the environment.
Most governments have promised to reduce greenhouse gasses by signing up to the
At the United Nations conference in Kyoto, Japan in 1997, MEDC governments pledged to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The treaty has not been ratified by the United States, the largest producer of CO2.

Some groups - environmentalists included - campaign against certain types of alternative energy generation. For example, dams built to produce hydroelectric power flood large areas - impacting on local people, wildlife, vegetation and hydrology. Tidal barrages could alter the look, behaviour and ecology of estuaries, such as the Severn, and might cause pollution problems. Some people oppose wind farms on the grounds that they are ugly and noisy and a hazard to wild birds.

Walton chooses to isolate himself in this frozen wasteland, yet soon regrets the absence of a true companion on his expedition.
Victor also chooses to isolate himself, firstly at university in Ingolstadt, when he avoids contact with his family to work on the Monster. Later, he neglects Elizabeth (his most loving, unfailing companion) out of fear she will discover his secret. He then chooses the remote Orkney Islands on which to embark on the construction of the second creature, and seems most comfortable when surrounded by the wilderness of vast lakes, towering mountains or wild heathland.
It is no surprise that when Victor meets the Monster for the first time since its creation the setting is high up in the Swiss Alps. Both are drawn to it as a place where they can attempt to escape reminders of what they have done and become. Also,
landscapes such as these overwhelming remind the reader of the characters' insignificance compared with the awesome power of nature.
The Monster is another victim of isolation. Unlike Walton and Victor, it does not bring this upon itself. Indeed, it tries early on to make contact with humans and connect with them, but is always abused, leading to self-imposed isolation in the hovel next to the De Laceys' cottage.
The torment it feels at being excluded from society in general, and loving companionship in particular, is what makes it ask Victor for a mate. When it later witnesses Victor tearing this mate to pieces, it sees a lifetime of isolation ahead and only then commits its most terrible crimes. Shelley's point here is that isolation, whether self-imposed or not, can only bring about unhappiness, a breakdown in civilisation and, ultimately, tragic consequences.

Nuclear power stations and coal-fired power stations usually provide base load electricity - they are run all of the time because they take the longest time to start up. Oil-fired and gas-fired power stations are often used to provide extra electricity at peak times, because they take the least time to start up.
The fuel for nuclear power stations is relatively cheap, but the power stations themselves are expensive to build. It is also very expensive to dismantle old nuclear power stations, and to store their radioactive waste, which is a dangerous health hazard.

And if you shake the two together then leave them to stand, tiny droplets of oil float upwards. They join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again. To stop the two liquids separating, we need a substance called an emulsifier.
Emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends:
a hydrophilic end - water-loving - that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils
a hydrophobic end - water-hating - that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water
Lecithin is an emulsifier commonly used in foods. It is obtained from oil seeds and is a mixture of different substances. A molecular model of one of these substances is seen in the diagram.
The hydrophilic 'head' dissolves in the water and the hydrophobic 'tail' dissolves in the oil. In this way, the water and oil droplets become unable to separate out. The mixture formed is called an emulsion.

You have learnt how to find the area of a rectangle and a triangle. We are now going to look at finding the area of a more complex shape.
What is the area of this shape?
To find the area, you need to divide the shape into a rectangle and a triangle:
The area of the rectangle is 5  4 = 20cm
The base of the triangle is calculated by subtracting the base of the rectangle (4cm) from the total length of the shape (10cm). So 10cm - 4cm = 6cm.

5889,"Successful product design involves learning from other designs which have features similar to the ones you want in your product.
You also need to be able to evaluate the quality of your product and to understand how to maintain quality throughout the design and manufacturing stage.
It is important that you, the designer, are able to identify the features of a product that make it either a success or failure.
The first stage of design of a new product involves studying other products with similar or desirable features, through
the investigation of a product to discover a) the price range, b) the intended user, and c) its function and features
The examination of a problem and breaking it down into parts.
making judgements on the effectiveness of the product and its 'fitness for purpose'.
This process helps the designer in a number of ways:
It avoids copying other designers' work (this is called plagiarism).
It identifies features or aspects of existing products which could be improved - such as by reducing the cost, adding extra features, making it easier or more comfortable to use or making it look more attractive to certain groups.
It can identify technologies or ideas which could be transferred or applied to a new function or area.
Sucessful designs: Apple iPod and Dyson vacuum cleaner
What makes a design successful? How do you judge a design? There are a wide range of
for analysing and evaluating designs. The two methods that follow are easy-to-remember acronyms:
unction - What does it do and how does it work?
esthetics - Is it attractive, why and what makes it so?
onstruction - What is it made from, how and why?
conomics - How much does it cost and is this good value for money?
ost - How much does it cost and is it good value for money?
esthetics - Is it attractive, why and what makes it so?
unction - What does it do and how does it work?
rgonomics - How easy or comfortable is it to use?
uality - How well is it built, what materials are used?
ser - Who is it for and is it appropriate?
nvironment - What effect do the product's manufacture, use and disposal have?
A product's unique characteristics and features are called the product
a statement that tells the designer exactly what the product has to do and what the design requirements are.
. You need to be able to identify these and compare them with the specification of other similar products. This will help you to evaluate how successful a product's design has been.
Quality control or QC is a way of controlling a manufacturing system. It is accomplished by a series of checks and inspections throughout the design and making of the product to ensure it is being made to specification and to the required standard. The results of the quality control checks are then fedback into the system to rectify any shortcomings. Quality control is also sometimes known as

3164,"Obviously designers have to think about what people want from a product. But consumer demand is a complex matter. Consumers are influenced by fashion, by public perceptions, by moral attitudes, and by changing lifestyles.
Product designers need to consider all these factors, as well as making sure the product conforms to current laws and standards.
Design is influenced by what people want, and what people want is affected by
. These influences come in the shape of current lifestyles and fashions, and the influence of design from other times and other cultures.
Market influences are partly caused by the fact that people want to have the same products as their friends. You and your friends will have similar interests, which designers have to understand if their products are to fit in with your lifestyle and sell well. Designers of mobile phones know that they have to design phones which will not only meet you and your friends' needs, but also make the right kind of 'design statement' about you the users.
At the same time, however, people want to be individuals, to stand out from the crowd, and express themselves by, for example, wearing clothes that look and feel unique. Designers need to understand this desire, otherwise their products will not sell.
Consumer choice is the idea that consumers should have a wide range of products to choose from, because different consumers will want different styles, different performance, and different prices when considering a purchase. Consumer choice is an influence on design, because designers need to know what their potential customers are looking for if they are going to design and make successful products.
Car manufacturers, for example, will design and make the same model of car in many slightly different versions, to suit individual drivers' different tastes.
Companies use market research to find out what people want. Interviews or questionnaires are used to gather people's views on the products they like, the functions and features they require, and the amount they would be prepared to pay. Sometimes the research is carefully focused on a particular group of people - eg women, people of a certain age-range or salary level - who have been identified as key potential consumers.
The results of the research are then passed on to the designer, whose job it is to design products which meet these consumer expectations. When designing your own products, you also need to do some basic market research to find out your potential users' requirements.

Euthanasia is illegal in the United Kingdom but it was legalised in certain circumstances in the Netherlands in 2002 and assisted suicide was legalised in the State of Oregon (USA) in 1997.
- the person concerned asks someone to help them die, perhaps by asking for help to take an overdose of painkillers
- euthanasia is carried out without the patients consent, for example, if they are in a persistent vegetative state and no longer able to live without a lifesupport machine, which is then switched off
Remember that a person's decision to take their own life is known as 'suicide'.
Christianity teaches that all life comes from God:
Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.' So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.'
The bible also teaches that life is sacred:
Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit.
For this reason Christians believe that it would be wrong to take life:
Elsewhere in the Bible it's clear that human beings are not meant to choose when they die:
For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted.
, Pope John Paul II said that to cause death in this way was 'a grave violation of the law of God'.
However, if large doses of painkillers are used to help ease a persons suffering, and as a result of these the person ultimately dies, this is understood as double effect. The intention was not to kill the person, but to allieviate suffering. In the same way the Church does not believe that doctors should use any extraordinary treatment to keep people alive against the odds.
The Church of England holds similar views saying that
""there are very strong arguments that people should not be kept alive at all costs when they are suffering intolerable pain""
One response from Christianity to the question of euthanasia has been the creation of hospices. These are special places where terminally ill people are cared for and allowed to die with dignity without resorting to euthanasia.

The noble experiment of Prohibition was introduced by the 18th Amendment, which became effective in January 1920.
Here are four reasons why Prohibition was introduced:
- when America entered the war in 1917 the national mood also turned against drinking alcohol. The Anti-Saloon League argued that drinking alcohol was damaging American society.
- a ban on alcohol would boost supplies of important grains such as barley.
- the consumption of alcohol went against God's will.
- many agreed that it was wrong for some Americans to enjoy alcohol while the country's young men were at war.
In 1929, however, the Wickersham Commission reported that Prohibition was not working. In February 1933, Congress passed the 21st Amendment, which repealed Prohibition.
Prohibition had failed. Here are six reasons why:

We cannot see or feel ultraviolet radiation, but our skin responds to it by turning darker. This happens in an attempt to reduce the amount of ultraviolet radiation that reaches deeper skin tissues.
Darker skins absorb more ultraviolet light, so less ultraviolet radiation reaches the deeper tissues. This is important because ultraviolet radiation can cause normal cells to become cancerous.
Sunblocks can reduce the damage caused by ultraviolet radiation. They contain chemicals that absorb a lot of the radiation and prevent it from reaching our skin. They may also contain chemicals that reflect some of the radiation away from the skin.
Manufacturers of sunblocks make products with different sun protection
the higher the factor, the longer you can stay out in the sun without burning
high factor sunblocks reduce the risks from ultraviolet radiation more than low factor sunblocks
If, for example, you would get sunburnt after ten minutes in the sun, with Factor 5 applied you could stay in the sun for 50 minutes - or for 1500 minutes with Factor 150 applied. But the real time is usually lower, because some of the sunblock gets absorbed by the skin, and some gets rubbed off.

3617,"Jem is Scout's older, brother, nearly 10 years old at the start of the novel and nearly 13 at the end, just entering puberty.
He is close to Scout: he is her constant companion at home. Although as he gets older he becomes positively allergic to Scout in public and spends more time with a football team than Scout, he always looks out for her and protects her.
He loves and admires his father, which is one of the reasons why he was so furious with Mrs Dubose and beheaded all her camellias.
He sees himself as brave and casts himself in the hero role in their games. Although, like other children, he is scared of passing the Radleys' house, he proves genuine bravery when he goes back to the Radley's place for his trousers after having been shot at, and when he and Scout are attacked by Mr Ewell on Halloween.
He is intelligent and quick-thinking: he is the first to spot the mad dog and tell Calpurnia, who raised the alarm; he creates a snowman out of earth covered in snow; he knows that the ground is cooler under a tree as he leads Scout to and from the school pageant.
Scout describes him as having ""a naturally tranquil disposition and a slow fuse"".
He is more mature than Scout and so has a better grasp of the trial. He is convinced of victory and so his faith in the justice system and in human nature is shaken when Tom is pronounced guilty. Scout says ""his shoulders jerked as if each 'guilty' was a separate stab between them"".
Jem's broken arm is the first thing that we hear about in the novel. This creates suspense - we want to find out how it happened, but we are not told until almost the end.

Decimals - Place value and ordering decimals
We use a decimal point to separate units from parts of a whole (like tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc).
0.1 is a tenth, 1/10 of a unit
0.01 is a hundredth, 1/100 of a unit
0.001 is a thousandth. 1/1000 of a unit
In 52.13, the value of the figure 1 is 1/10 , and the value of the figure 3 is 3/100.
When ordering numbers, always compare the left digits first.
Eg Which is greater, 2.301 or 2.32?
Both numbers have two units and three tenths, but 2.301 has no hundredths, whereas 2.32 has two hundredths. Therefore, 2.32 is greater than 2.301.
Another way to look at it is to add a zero to the end of 2.32 (this doesn't change its value as it's after the decimal point).
The two numbers are now 2.320 and 2.301 and it is quite easy to see that 2.320 is bigger (just as 2 320 is bigger than 2 301).
Q1. In the number 3.546, what is the value of the figure 4?
Q2. Place the following numbers in order, smallest first: 3.2, 3.197, 3.02, 3.19
A1. The value of the figure 4 is 4/100.
A2. Did you get 3.02, 3.19, 3.197, 3.2?
All the numbers have three units, so start by comparing the tenths. 3.02 has no tenths, 3.197 and 3.19 have one tenth, and 3.2 has two tenths. Therefore, 3.02 is the smallest and 3.2 is the largest.
You could also write the numbers as 3.020, 3.190, 3.197 and 3.200 and compare them.

A swimming pool at 30C is at a lower temperature than a cup of tea at 80C. But the swimming pool contains more water, so it stores more thermal energy than the cup of tea.
To boil water we must increase its temperature to 100C. It takes longer to boil a large beaker of water than a small beaker because the large beaker contains more water and needs more thermal energy to reach 100C.

In a scale drawing, all dimensions have been reduced by the same proportion.
A model boat is made to a scale of 1:20 (1 to 20). This scale can be applied to any units, so 1mm measured on the model is 20mm on the actual boat, 1cm measured on the model is 20cm on the actual boat, and so on.
a) If the 1:20 model boat is 15cm wide, how wide is the actual boat?
b) If the boat has a mast of height 4m, how high is the mast on the model?
The scale is 1:20. This means that every cm on the model is equivalent to 20cm on the boat.
a) 1cm on the model = 20cm on the boat, so:
b) 20cm on the boat = 1cm on the model
so mast height on real boat  20 = mast height on model
400cm (4m) on the boat = 400cm  20 =
Maps scales can be written in ratios and tell you how many units of land, sea etc are equal to one unit on the map.
If you are travelling from Manchester to Newcastle, for example, and need to know how far it is, it would be very difficult to work this out if the map does not have a scale.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. A distance is measured as 3cm on the map.
How many cm, m and km is this equivalent to in real life?
1 cm on the map represents 50 000cm. Therefore, 3cm on the map represents 150 000cm.
To convert from cm to m, divide by 100.
To convert from m to km divide by 1000.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. What distance on the map will represent 5km?
5km = 5000m = 5000  100 cm = 500 000cm
We want to know what distance on the map represents 500 000cm in real life.
The map scale is 1:50 000, so we divide by 50 000

Some god o'the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the King my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air. Thence I have followed it

Analyse, review and comment - Writing to analyse
This is one version of the speech. You will find comments beneath each paragraph, explaining what the writer has done well.
I'm sure you've all heard the saying ""we are what we eat"". Have you been into the school canteen recently? The selection is similar to that in many schools: a main meal which is usually meat-based, a variety of burgers and pizzas, a dessert and, for the health-conscious, jacket potatoes with one or two cold fillings. The question we are here to consider today is whether this is a reasonable selection, or whether changes could be made in Grange High School's canteen.
The speech begins dealing with the problem straight away. It starts with a short, familiar phrase and a rhetorical question, to involve the audience and make them listen to the speech. The current selection of food is outlined to set the scene, followed by the main question to be tackled. The opening is very friendly and easy to follow. This is a great start.
A survey conducted recently by Year 9 students suggested that many students are happy with the food on offer. They stated that the burgers and pizzas were their favourite food and that they were ""tasty, filling, cheap and quick"". These choices, sometimes called ""junk food"", are the best sellers and the canteen staff say the profit from these makes it possible to offer some of the less popular options.
The writer now looks at the evidence for keeping junk food. They've imagined a survey and comments from the canteen staff - this is fine as it's relevant and makes sense.
Some students admit that the junk food in the canteen is the only reason they stay in school at lunchtimes. Although we are not allowed off site during school times, it is well known that some students do sneak out to local chip shops and other takeaways. A substantial number of students who took part in the canteen's survey said they would be more likely to do this if the canteen offered more healthy food.
The final argument for junk food is explained. The writer introduces a rather controversial point, but softens it with the phrase 'it is well known...' so that no one is blamed. Again this keeps things formal and balanced.
So far, the writing looks really good, but it seems like the conclusion will be in favour of junk food. Is there any way of balancing the argument? Go to the next page to see how this is done.

It is possible to balance the see-saw again if someone else gets onto the other end and sits in the correct place. This is because the turning forces are balanced. We say the moments are equal and opposite.
, we need to know two things:
the distance from the pivot that the force is applied.
This is the equation for working out a moment:
Imagine that a force of 10 N acted on a see-saw 2 m from the pivot. This is how we would work out the moment:
Notice that the unit of moment is
(newton metre). Don't get confused with a 'newton meter', which is another name for a forcemeter.
Here is an example of balanced moments. 10N at 2m from the pivot is balancing 20N at 1m from the pivot. The objects create moments of 20Nm that are equal and opposite, so the see-saw is balanced.
A see-saw will balance if the moments on each side of the pivot are equal. This is why you might have to adjust your position on a see-saw if you are a different weight from the person on the other end.
If a nut is difficult to undo with a short spanner, a longer spanner will help. This is because there will be a bigger moment on the nut, when the same force is applied further from the pivot.
Using the same principle you can increase the moment applied by a lever or a crowbar, and this can help you move heavy objects more easily.

Your aim is to get all the unknown x terms on one of the equation side only, so start by adding 2x to both sides: 7x - 2 = 12

This makes sense, so the value x = 2 is correct.
Add x to both sides to give 5x = 10.

Q1. The number of children in a school is 800, correct to the nearest 100. What is the largest possible, and smallest possible number of children in the school?
Q2. Amelia spends 80 in the local supermarket, correct to the nearest 10. What is the greatest and least amount that Amelia could have spent?
The number of children in the school has been rounded to the nearest 100 to give 800.
The smallest number that rounds to 800 is 750.
The largest number that rounds to 800 is 849.
So, the smallest possible number of children in the school is 750, and the largest possible number of children is 849.
Note: 850 is exactly halfway between 800 and 900, but 850 rounds up to give 900, so we use 849.
The smallest number that rounds to 80 is 75.
The largest number that rounds to 80 is 84.99.
Remember that 85 is halfway between 80 and 90, but 85 rounds up to 90, so we must go for the smallest possible unit less than 85 (in this case a penny less), which is 84.99.

In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
Before this scene, Prospero and his slave, Caliban have exchanged cross words.
The First Key Extract begins with Ferdinand hearing Ariel's song.
Ariel's song calms the stormy waters. In 'The Tempest', music is linked closely to magic and illusion.
He wonders where the sounds are coming from.
Illusion - Ferdinand does not know where the sound is coming from. He assumes that it is magic and tells us that the music not only calmed the storm, but also made him feel better.
He follows the sound, and when the song begins again, it suggests to Ferdinand that his father has drowned.
When Miranda sees Ferdinand approaching, she can't believe her eyes. She doesn't think that Ferdinand is real.
Illusion - Ferdinand is a living human being, but Miranda is convinced that he is a magical creature. In 'The Tempest', things are never quite as they at first seem.
Prospero explains that he is a man, not a spirit and that he is looking for other survivors of the shipwreck. Prospero feels excited that Miranda and Ferdinand seem to like each other: it was his plan all along
Power - Prospero claims that he has used magic to make Miranda and Ferdinand fall in love. Prospero likes to control and manipulate people through his magic.
, and he promises to reward Ariel with his freedom for helping to get them together.
Ferdinand asks Miranda if she is an ordinary girl or a goddess.
Miranda can't believe that Ferdinand is an ordinary mortal. She thinks he's a 'spirit'. She calls him 'divine' and 'noble'. Ferdinand refers to her as a 'goddess'. The language they use suggests that they worship one another.
He is shocked when she speaks his language. When he hints that he is the King of Naples, Prospero challenges him.
Prospero likes to be in control. As soon as Ferdinand suggests that he has any sort of power, Prospero tries to undermine him. Prospero's questions are sarcastic and mocking in his attempt to show Ferdinand who is boss.
Ferdinand sadly explains that he believes that his father, the King of Naples, has drowned in the shipwreck along with the Duke of Milan and his son. Prospero watches Ferdinand and thinks to himself that he will be able to manipulate him easily now that Ferdinand is in love with his daughter.
Think carefully about what kind of man Prospero is. Is he a caring father who will do anything to get the best for his daughter? Is he manipulative and controlling? Love is a powerful emotion. Should people use love to control others?
Miranda can't understand why her father is being so abrupt with Ferdinand. She has fallen in love at first sight with Ferdinand.
Love - Miranda admits that she has feelings for Ferdinand. It is the first time she has ever felt this way. Do you think that she would have fallen in love with Ferdinand even without Prospero's magic?
She wishes that her father could see things from her point of view.
When Ferdinand offers to make Miranda his queen, Prospero steps in. He is worried that his plan won't work if Ferdinand wins Miranda's heart too easily.
Prospero says: 'But this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning/Make the prize light'. He means that he can't let Ferdinand think that it was too easy to get Miranda to be his girlfriend, because he might not treat her well if it's really easy to make her love him.
He says that Ferdinand is lying about being a king and accuses him of being a spy.
Power/ Illusion - Prospero wants to manipulate Ferdinand. He will make him suffer and work hard for Miranda's love. When Ferdinand claims to have some power of his own as the heir to the throne, Prospero takes this power away by accusing him of being a spy and taking him prisoner. Prospero knows that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne. 'The Tempest' is all about the confusion between what is true and real, and what is illusion.
Miranda tries to speak up for him
You might think that Miranda is brave to speak up for Ferdinand. Apart from being a powerful magician, Prospero has quite a temper! Her speech also shows us how innocent she is. She can't believe that anyone who looks so lovely on the outside can be anything other than lovely on the inside. In 'The Tempest', Shakespeare shows us that things are not always as they first seem.
but Prospero tells her off and threatens to imprison Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Ferdinand a 'traitor'. He threatens to 'manacle' his neck and give him sea water to drink and acorn shells to eat. Prospero doesn't mean any of these threats, but in making them he shows that he has power over Ferdinand and could make him a slave just as he made Caliban his slave. Throughout the extract, Prospero uses words like 'usurp', 'traitor' and 'impostor' which all seem a bit strong when referring to Ferdinand. When Antonio took Prospero's place as Duke of Milan, he did 'usurp' him, and in doing so, he was a 'traitor' and in calling himself the Duke of Milan, Antonio is an 'imposter'.
When Ferdinand draws his sword, Prospero uses magic to make it impossible for Ferdinand to move.
Miranda tries desperately to stop her father but he won't listen. Ferdinand comes to the conclusion that all his problems - his father's death, the shipwreck, Prospero's threats - mean nothing, as long as he can see Miranda once a day, even if he is in prison.
Love/ Illusion - Ferdinand suddenly doesn't mind being Prospero's prisoner, as long as he has Miranda to love. He says it's all like a 'dream'. Does love have that kind of dream-like power to overcome difficulties? Or is it another one of Prospero's spells?
Prospero is pleased that his plan to make Ferdinand fall in love with Miranda has worked. He praises Ariel
Love/ Illusion - When Prospero tells Ariel that he has done well, this suggests that Miranda and Ferdinand's attraction towards one another is not true love, but a magic trick, an illusion, that Ariel has conjured.
Prospero promises Ariel that he will be free
Freedom and Slavery - Just as Prospero has made Caliban a slave and threatened to imprison Ferdinand, he has the power to set Ariel free. When Prospero arrived on the island, Ariel was trapped in a pine tree and Prospero set him free, so he has a debt of gratitude towards him. Also, Ariel is gentle whereas Prospero has a temper.

Here are two very different styles of writing:
I suppose I could tell you all about where I was born, what it was like when Mum was still around, what happened when I was a little kid, all that kind of stuff, but it's not really relevant.

Atmosphere and setting - PEE and useful phrases
As well as having lots of ideas, you need to explain them clearly. An effective way of doing this is to PEE. PEE stands for:
Read through the following extract. How does the writer create an atmosphere of cold and loneliness?
Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness - a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.
The extract describes a cold, empty landscape.
The text states that the trees have been ""stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost"".
The land is described as ""desolate"" and it contains ""a laughter more terrible than any sadness"".
This suggests that the place is completely isolated.
The fact that it seems to be full of terrible laughter suggests it is a very cruel area, which would be hard to explore.
If you are going to use quotations from the extract in your answer, remember to set them out properly. Here are some points to remember:
Quotes of three words or less can be used in the sentence you're writing - for example ...when the writer talks about the ""futility of life"" he means...
Longer quotations need to be included on a line of their own and with a space before it (known as an indent) - for example ...the writer describes the landscape as a ""desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold"" he creates a picture that...
Short, well-chosen quotations are better than long, vague ones.
Also remember that certain words and phrases are especially helpful when you're explaining an idea in detail. They can be particularly helpful if you are commenting on implicit meaning. The following wordbank shows you some of those phrases, and you might be able to add some more:

473,"Writing the speech is only half the task - the next part is presenting it.
The idea of presenting a speech might make you nervous but some people make speeches every day as part of their jobs. Think about your teachers - they regularly stand up before you and present to the class.
You might notice that some teachers are more interesting to listen to than others. It is not necessarily what they say that keeps you interested, but often how they say it. What do your teachers do to keep your attention? Make a list then compare it with the tips below.
Your listeners will switch off if they can't hear you. Use a loud and clear voice, and if you're unsure if your audience can hear you at the back - just ask ""Can you hear me at the back?""
If you speak too quickly, you won't be clear. If you speak too slowly, your audience is likely to go to sleep. Vary your pace for effect and use dramatic pauses where appropriate.
If you speak like a robot, in the same boring tone, your audience will quickly drift off. Speak naturally and use the pitch of your voice to show your emotions.
You don't have to gurn at your audience! But if you don't look like you're interested in what you have to say, your audience won't be either.
Again, keep it natural, but if you stand like a statue, you won't be very interesting to watch or listen to. On the other hand, too much arm flapping and leg hopping will distract your audience from the point you're trying to make.
Use them, but use them effectively. They need to be big enough to see, interesting to look at and relevant to what you are talking about. Don't be tempted to make a big poster to hide behind!
Choose words that are interesting, descriptive and appropriate to your audience. Don't baffle your audience with jargon or slang or lots of big words that are too difficult for anyone else to understand.
If it's appropriate to your audience and task, try to use Standard English. You don't have to be too formal or put on a silly accent, just speak in a way that is easy for everyone to understand.
Most people feel nervous about speaking formally in front of other people. Here are some tips to help you conquer your nerves:
Write your speech out in full and read it several times - this will help you gain confidence in the content.
Prepare small cards with key points of your speech. By now you should be familiar with your speech so these points will help you keep to your structure. Avoid the temptation to read your speech in full - the idea is to test your speaking skills, not your reading skills!
Practice your performance before the real thing. Try practicing at home on your own, and then in front of family or friends. If you have visual aids, be sure to practice using them.
On the day, take a deep breath, smile and try to enjoy it.
Improve your public speaking and maybe you'll be TV Presenter one day. But it's not all bad!

You begin to recover when enough antibodies have been produced. After the microbes have been killed, the amount of antibodies goes down again. But some of the white blood cells that produce the correct antibody remain in your blood.

Immunisation is a process that doctors use to make people immune from certain illnesses, even before they have been infected. It involves you receiving an injection containing a
Vaccines contain a dead or weak form of the disease-causing microbe, or some of its antigens. In response to the vaccine your immune system produces white blood cells with the correct antibody to kill the microbe, so you become immune without falling ill.
You are likely to have been immunised against several microbes, viruses and bacteria, including the ones that cause diphtheria, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, meningitis, measles, mumps and tuberculosis. Girls are also immunised against rubella.
Vaccination works against diseases caused by both bacteria and viruses.

Take a look at the final paragraph of the article about boxing.
In conclusion, both sides of the debate have solid foundations. As has been shown, the arguments for and against have been put forward since boxing began. And, it would seem, the argument will continue for at least the foreseeable future, as compromise seems unlikely. Both sides do agree, however, that the debate is better held whilst boxing is licensed and controlled rather than unlicensed and uncontrolled. The latter would make it, in my opinion, neither sport nor spectacle.
As you can see, the writer clearly signals that the end is approaching by using the connecting phrase ""In conclusion"". It maintains the impersonal approach it set out with by stating that the argument will continue and that ""compromise seems unlikely"". The last sentence is a statement of the writer's own opinion, but this doesn't alter the fact that it is, or has been, a discursive text.
So, when answering how effective the beginning or ending of a text is, here's a quick checklist you might find helpful:

The example below is about the language of love. Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on Romeo's descriptions of love.
Love is an excellent subject for poets. Romeo enjoys using lots of different poetic devices to explore the idea of love.
The idea of love seems to be making Romeo's brain ache. He comes up with a list of oxymorons (pairs of opposite words eg 'loving hate') to try and find the right definition of love. He makes up some vivid metaphors for love, but comes closer with his descriptions to lust. He thinks love is a kind of madness or even a poison. He thinks that he loves Rosaline. He compares her to a Roman goddess and complains that Cupid keeps missing her heart with his arrows. He focuses on her beauty and talks about his problems getting her to love him back as though it is a kind of battle.
At this point in the play, Romeo doesn't seem to understand what true love is. It is possible that he has got some of his romantic ideas from stories. He likes talking about love, but some of his opinions don't sound very loving. We never meet Rosaline in the play, but you may think to yourself that she is wise not to encourage Romeo's advances. They don't sound respectful or honourable. In fact, it could be argued that Romeo's ideas about love are funny or silly, and show him up to be immature and shallow.

Here is the word equation for aerobic respiration. Energy is put in brackets because it not a substance:
Notice that the word equation for respiration is the reverse of the word equation for photosynthesis. Check back if you are not sure of this.
Plant cells respire, just as animal cells do. If they stop respiring, they will die. Remember that respiration is not the same as breathing, so take care - plants do not breathe.
As we can see from the word equations respiration and photosynthesis are opposites. Respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and produces oxygen.
So what happens to a plant overall? This depends on whether it is in the dark or the light, and how bright the light is.
Plants respire all the time, whether it is dark or light. They photosynthesise only when they are in the light.
Neither gas is taken in or given out, as each cancels the other out
Photosynthesis usually results in a net food gain (net glucose gain), once respiration has been accounted for. This means that there is an increase in the biomass of the plant.
Plants that lose their leaves in winter store food produced during the summer by photosynthesis. They store enough food to last them over winter, and to provide energy reserves for new growth in the spring.

People often confuse mass and weight. Remember that weight is a force, and is measured in newtons. Mass is measured in kilograms (kg).

A 100 kg object has a greater mass than a 5 kg object. Remember an object's mass stays the same wherever it is.
All objects have a force that attracts them towards each other. This is called
. Even you attract other objects to you because of gravity, but you have too little mass for the force to be very strong.
Gravity only becomes noticeable when there is a really massive object like a moon, planet or star. We are pulled down towards the ground because of gravity. The gravitational force pulls in the direction towards the centre of the Earth.
""Down"" is towards the centre of the Earth, wherever you are on the planet
Weight is a force caused by gravity. The weight of an object is the
between the object and the Earth. The more mass the object has the greater its weight will be.
Weight is a force, so it's measured in
. On the surface of the Earth an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 10 N.
The mass of an object stays the same wherever it is, but its weight can change. This happens if the object goes somewhere where gravity is stronger, or weaker, such as the Moon.
The Moon has less mass than the Earth, so its gravity is less than the Earth's gravity. This means that objects weigh less on the Moon than they do on the Earth.

Suppose you were in the middle of nowhere, and there were no signs or landmarks to help you find your way. Would you know how to find your way home? Someone might tell you via phone or radio to 'walk to your left', or 'turn through 60 and then start walking', but how would they know which way you were pointing in the first place?
One way of describing direction from a point is to use
A compass always points north. Bearings are measured from the
So when someone tells you to walk on a bearing of 120, you should face north, turn clockwise through 120 and start walking.
The angle between the north line and the flight path of the aeroplane is 30. We say that the aeroplane is flying on a bearing of 030 from Heathrow Airport.

Food chains - Toxic materials in the food chain
Toxic materials are poisonous. Some quickly break down into harmless substances in the environment. Others are
and do not break down. Instead, they accumulate in the food chain and damage the organisms in it, especially the top predators.
Mercury compounds were used until quite recently to make
(chemicals that kill the insects that damage crops) and special
that stop barnacles growing on the hulls of ships.
Unfortunately, when it gets into the food chain mercury damages the
of mammals, including humans. The diagram shows how mercury can accumulate in the food chain.
Tiny plankton in the sea absorb the mercury compounds. When the plankton are eaten by small fish, the mercury they contain stays in the fish. As the fish need to eat a lot of plankton, the concentration of mercury in them becomes higher than its concentration in the plankton.
The small fish are eaten by larger fish, and these are eaten by still larger ones, such as tuna fish. This creates a high concentration of mercury in the tuna. People eating contaminated tuna may get mercury poisoning. Mercury is now banned from many chemical products and mercury use in industry is carefully regulated.
DDT is an insecticide that can pass up the food chain from insects to small birds, and then from the small birds to birds of prey, like hawks. It can accumulate in the birds of prey, giving them a large amount of DDT. Concentrations of DDT in birds causes weakness in their eggs, and reduces their population. DDT is now banned because of this.

Juliet's mother tells her to cheer up because her father has arranged for her to marry Paris. Juliet loses her temper and refuses. Her father comes in and can't believe how ungrateful she is being. He threatens to throw her out and disown her. He says he wants to hit her. She asks her mother to stand up for her, but she refuses.
The Nurse tells Juliet to forget Romeo and marry Paris
When Juliet's mother and father have left, Juliet asks the Nurse what she should do. The Nurse says to forget Romeo and just marry Paris without owning up. In those days, that would have been a sin, and to marry two people at once would mean that she would be sent to hell. Juliet says that she will do what the Nurse suggests, but when she leaves the room, Juliet says to herself that the Nurse is two-faced. She decides to see if Friar Lawrence will help her. If not, she thinks she will have to commit suicide.
Paris goes to visit Friar Lawrence to arrange his wedding to Juliet. The Friar tries to stall for more time. When Juliet arrives, she gives Paris 'the cold shoulder' until he leaves. She begs the Friar to help her, threatening to kill herself. The Friar has a plan if Juliet has the guts to carry it through. He knows of a drug that will make her seem as though she is dead for forty-two hours. This will mean that she will be put in the family tomb along with Tybalt. Then the Friar will let Romeo know the truth, so that he can come and take her away when she wakes up and they can go off together to Mantua. Juliet isn't scared. She takes the drug home with her.
Everyone is busy with wedding preparations at the Capulets' house. Capulet is in a good mood. Juliet tells her father that she has been to see the Friar to confess her sins and asks for her dad's forgiveness. Even the Nurse believes her.
Juliet says good night to her mum then starts to panic about what she is about to do. She might die. She might go mad when she wakes up in a tomb full of dead people. There might be ghosts. She imagines that she sees Tybalt's ghost. She takes the poison and falls unconscious on her bed.

Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
Miranda comes to see him. Neither of them realise that Prospero is watching them from a distance.

but he says he has too much to do, so she offers to carry some logs for him.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
He says he would rather break his back than see her work. Miranda insists again that she should help him.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Looking on, Prospero sees how much Miranda is in love with Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.

He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
However, Miranda, he says, is perfect. Miranda, on the other hand, hasn't met any men except for her father, or any women, except for herself. Even so, she says that she can't imagine liking anyone more than she likes Ferdinand.
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand tells her that he is a prince, possibly a king (although he hopes his father isn't dead). He wouldn't usually put up with having to carry logs like a slave

but he knew as soon as he saw Miranda that he'd do anything for her. When Miranda asks him if he loves her, Ferdinand says he loves, prizes and honours her more than anything else in the world. This makes Miranda so happy that she cries. As Prospero watches them together, he is moved.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Ferdinand asks Miranda why she is crying. She says she thinks she isn't good enough for him
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!
but realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else. Ferdinand happily agrees to marry her. They say goodbye and part.
Prospero is happy for them, but he claims that their engagement is no surprise to him as it was all part of his plan. He goes to get his magic book because he has lots of work to do before supper time.

From the table below, you will see there are elements of the two Key Extracts that are quite similar. But whereas there is a lot of conflict in the first extract, the second one is full of romance. This needs to be brought out in the performance.
Prospero is in control of the action. He even slows the pace down at one point to suit his own ends. He could be compared to Shakespeare, moving the plot forward and molding events.
Prospero watches from a distance and comments occasionally but does not interfere. It is as though he is part of the audience.

A moving and romantic extract that contrasts with the scene before it which is full of Mercutio's rude jokes.
Ariel is present at the beginning. Prospero uses magic to prevent Ferdinand from using his sword. Ferdinand seems to submit very quickly at the end of this extract, as though magic may have had some part to play.
There is no sign of magic in this extract. The setting is very ordinary as Ferdinand carries logs to Prospero's cave. Any ""magic"" that exists is in the form of the power of love.
Both Ferdinand and Miranda seem bewildered by their feelings.
Ferdinand and Miranda are bursting to reveal their true feelings to each other.

Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.
For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.
By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.
You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:
Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:
In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:
To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:
Divide both sides by 2, to give:
a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7

One of the most historic regions in the United States is in trouble. The 175-mile-long area of land stretches through Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
The area is home to more American history than any other slice of land in the country, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. George Washington built his estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison also built their homes in that state. The region at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains includes many battlefields from the Civil War (18611865).
As people construct new houses, roads, and buildings, they are destroying acres of history. Officials say the region has lost more than 150,000 acres of farmland in the past 20 years. That is an area slightly smaller than New York City.

The following places are in the region between Pennsylvania and Virginia that was added to this year's list of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in the United States.

The documents are on their way to the new Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library. The library is located in Springfield--the capital of Illinois. It is scheduled to open this fall.
The library will be the new home of the Illinois State Historical Library. Although the new library is only blocks away from the old one, the move hasn't been easy.
The six-week move involved several trucks and an army of people to help pack and transport nearly 12 million items. Of those items, about 47,000 books, maps, prints, documents, and other items are related to Lincoln.
Abraham Lincoln was president during the Civil War (1861-1865). The U.S. Civil War was fought between the Northern states and Southern states. One of the main issues of the war was that the South wanted the right to own slaves. The North wanted to

239,"Students in Piscataway, New Jersey, have something many kids only dream of-- a rule that limits the amount of homework they are assigned.
Last October, the Piscataway Board of Education voted to limit the amount of homework kids get. For kids in elementary school, homework is limited to 30 minutes a weeknight. For kids in high school, the amount of homework is limited to two hours a weeknight.
In recent years, many U.S. parents have called for limits on the amount of assigned homework.
Those parents have argued that heavy loads of homework leave kids little time for other activities. In addition, some parents say that homework assignments are so tough that they have to hire tutors to help their kids with homework.
Before the school board in Piscataway acted, parents there had been concerned about the amount of homework assigned by teachers. ""[Kids] are in school for six-and-a-half hours a day,"" said parent Cheryl Weaver. ""They don't need to come home and do another two or three hours of homework. That's more than a full-time job.""
Many educators worry about cutting down on homework. They say that limiting homework could mean limiting learning.
Some educators say that even a light load of homework helps kids learn and do well in school. The Educational Resources Information Center the of U.S. Department of Education has released a report about homework and its impact on students.
Many companies across the United States have developed Web sites aimed at helping kids with their homework. Many of those Web companies hire teachers to help kids come up with the answers to questions. Here are two such sites.
According to the department's report, homework helps students in many ways. For example, homework helps students become interested in different subjects, teaches them responsibility, and improves their classroom work. In short, homework helps students do better in school and get better grades.
Some students agree with the experts. New York resident Kaitlin Ofman, 12, notes that although she sometimes has a lot of homework, she still feels that there is a benefit to doing it.
""I understand that homework is important,"" Kaitlin said. ""After we learn something in school, we might forget it if we [didn't] have any practice in it,"" she said.

The size of an elephant should make it easy to spot, right? That is not the case for some elephants in India.
Several elephants in New Delhi--the capital of that Asian country--have been hit by cars and killed. So a wildlife group has begun fitting the elephants with safety reflectors.

In New Delhi, about 30 elephants work at night to help clear fallen trees. Many elephants are also forced to walk in the dark, after working at weddings and other religious festivals late at night. The elephants' dark skin makes it difficult for drivers to see them in the evening.

The Arctic is the icy, cold region located around the North Pole. In November, scientists from eight countries released a report saying that the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of Earth.
In the report, scientists predict that at least half of the summer sea ice in the Arctic will melt by the end of this century. The scientists blame
for the Arctic thaw. That is the gradual rise in Earth's temperature.
Arctic ice is melting at an alarming rate. Winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen between 4 and 7 degrees Fahrenheit. During the past 30 years, polar bears have lost more than 386,000 square miles of ice--an area larger than the states of Texas and Arizona combined.
More than 20,000 polar bears live in the Arctic regions. Disappearing sea ice threatens polar bears and other cold-weather animals. Polar bears use the ice as a bridge to hunt seals, their primary source of food.
As the sea ice disappears, the mighty
, or hunters, catch fewer seals and risk starvation. Seals also depend on the ice to rest and give birth. Scientists fear that polar bears, seals, and other animals that rely on the ice could be wiped out by the end of the century if the warm-up continues.
Some of the 4 million people who live in the Arctic have also found themselves on shaky ground. As the frozen land thaws, buildings and roads have weakened.
Inuits (IH-nyoo-wets), a group of native people in the region, fish and hunt Arctic animals, including polar bears. They depend on those animals as their main source of food. Inuit hunters are also falling through thinning ice.
Rising sea levels have forced some people in the Arctic to move their coastal villages inland. The report warns that melting ice could cause sea levels to continue to rise--up to 3 feet by the end of this century. Towns and cities along coastlines around the world could flood as a result.
The warm-up also affects other parts of the planet. Arctic ice and snow reflect heat from the sun into space. Without the ice and snow, the planet would be much warmer. ""The polar regions are essentially the Earth's air conditioner,"" said scientist Michael McCracken.
Who cranked up the thermostat on the Arctic? Scientists say human activity is to blame for global warming. People use
, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to power cars, heat homes, and create electricity.
Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Burning those fuels gives off gases that trap heat from the sun and add to the overheating of the Earth.
To protect life in the Arctic, scientists say people need to limit their use of fossil fuels. ""Climate change is not just about the future,"" said scientist Pal Prestud, who worked on the report. ""It is happening now.""
The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Those gases collect in a layer and trap heat from the sun. The layer of gases is like the windows in a greenhouse. The process is called the
Too much of those gases in the air causes temperatures to rise. That is known as

258,"The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle's grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles.
The disease attacks an infected bird's brain and spinal cord.
At first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird.
In recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year.
Although the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased.
By the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild.
Wildlife experts are especially concerned because they don't know much about the disease, including what causes it. ""We have some ideas, but we don't have any answers,"" John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said.
Experts also don't know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. ""This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn't noticed,"" Fischer said.
While wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Scientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America's bird--the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn't true in 1782.
Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol.
""I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country"", Franklin wrote. ""He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird"".

807,"Polar Bears on Thin Ice: Rising Arctic Temperature Spells Trouble for Polar Bears
A polar bear waits patiently at the edge of a sheet of ice. Suddenly, the bear jumps forward and grabs a seal from the frigid water. But there is danger underfoot. The Arctic ice-the polar bear's main habitat-is melting.
The Arctic is the region around the North Pole. It is one of the coldest areas in the world. Polar bears rely on the Arctic ice for survival. In the Arctic, there is a lot of ice floating on top of the water. Polar bears use it as a bridge. The bears walk over the ice to get to seals, their main source of food. If the ice continues to melt, polar bears face starvation.
Some scientists fear that polar bears may disappear within the next 100 years. ""You don't have to be a polar scientist to see that if you take away all the sea ice, you don't have polar bears anymore,"" said scientist Andrew Derocher.

Mei Xiang (MAY SHONG) is a 2-year-old female panda. Her name means ""beautiful fragrance."" Tian Tian (tee-YEN tee-YEN) is a 3-year-old male panda. His name means ""more and more.""

The two pandas arrived from China aboard a plane called
. From the airport, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian were taken to the National Zoo, where they will live for the next ten years.
Officials at the National Zoo agreed to give China $10 million in exchange for lending the United States the two pandas. That money will be used to protect pandas from becoming extinct in central China.
About 1,000 pandas live in the mountain forests of central China, where they eat mainly bamboo shoots. The pandas need the forests to survive.
The land where pandas are found, however, is being cleared and used for farmland. The trees are being used for firewood to heat people's homes.
There are now seven pandas living in the United States. Two are in Washington, D.C.; two are in Atlanta, Georgia; and three are in San Diego, California.
One of those seven pandas is a baby. The baby panda, Hua Mei, was born at the San Diego Zoo on August 21, 1999.
Hua Mei is the first baby panda born in the Western Hemisphere since 1990. When he was born, he weighed less than 5 ounces and looked more like a rat than a panda.
Fa Mingzhi is one of more than 4 million people who live near the area where the pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian come from. Most of the people who live in that area are farmers who need the forest to survive.
Like many people, Fa Mingzhi wants to protect the animals. But, she says, people want to eat, too. ""It's good to protect the panda, but it's harder now on the people who live here,"" she said.

472,"Experts hope 2006 will be the year the world is polio-free.
Will polio be declared a disease of the past?
World health groups are fighting a war
with a crippling and sometimes deadly diseasepolio. Their efforts are paying off. Polio has been wiped out in 10 African countries, according to a recent report.
Since mid-2003, nearly 200 children in those 10 western and central African countries were
for life, but no new cases have been reported since last June. When people are paralyzed, they are unable to move different parts of their bodies and may be unable to walk.
The disease raced across Africa and into Asia after people in Nigeria refused the polio
mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think well get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told
She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria.""
Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly
disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havent been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims.
With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world. On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government approved the use of a vaccine that stopped people from getting the disease. Jonas Salk was the doctor who invented the first polio vaccine.
A boy in Africa receives an oral polio vaccine from a WHO (World Health Organization) worker.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world thanks to Salk, it still threatens children in Africa and Asia. Major efforts were recently under way to
or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been
Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door.
To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November.
After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Its uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives.""
Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization.
Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why?
Jonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.
From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Roosevelts death, Salks vaccine was declared officially safe.
In October 2005for the first time in 26 years in the United Statesfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnt at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.

Carl Mehling knows that isn't true. A paleontologist studies dinosaurs.

to learn about dinosaurs. Fossils are the remains of plants and animals from long ago. When a plant or an animal dies, it usually rots away. However, if it is buried quickly by mud or sand, parts of it may be preserved. Over millions of years the remains can turn into a fossil. Fossils can be bones, teeth, footprints, or nests of eggs.
When a dinosaur fossil is found, scientists carefully dig around it and study it. They photograph, measure, and record each bone's position. Then the bones are dug up and often taken to a museum where the fossil is rebuilt.

What caused dinosaurs to become extinct? Scientists don't know for sure, but they have different
or possible explanations. One theory is that a huge asteroid or comet struck Earth. The collision likely filled the air with a huge cloud of dust and blocked out most of the sun's light and heat. As a result, many plants and animals would have died out.
In addition to using computers to study dinosaurs, scientists also use special X-ray machines to look inside fossils. They hope that new technology may one day answer ancient mysteries like what color dinosaurs might have been.

Roberta Capole, the editor of Tiger magazine, says many kids just want to look like pop stars. ""I don't think it's about trying to look older,"" she said. ""I think kids are just trying to dress like stars they think are fantastic.""
Store officials and clothing designers hope to make lots of money selling the new fashions. Stores say that each U.S. kid spent about $500 on school clothes this fall.
Some store clerks don't understand what the fuss is about. They think the new fashions are OK. ""We make sure all our clothes are age appropriate,"" said one clerk. She went on to describe the hipster pants she sells. ""They are an inch below the waist.""
Clothing designers say they have to make the new fashions. ""If I don't make it, someone else will,"" one designer said.
Parents are upset about the new fashions. ""When I take [my kids] shopping, they pick out things that... aren't appropriate for school,"" said one mother.
Teacher Dana Zeman says the new fashions don't belong in school. ""In my class, I'd like to set [a dress code],"" she said.

At 5:40 pm, after a two hour hike down El Capitan, Scott will begin another two hour trek to Half Dome's base.
At 7:30 pm, Scott will begin climbing the Northwest Face. He will reach Half Dome's summit at 2:30am.
Scott has been climbing mountains since he was 7 years old. He first fell in love with the sport during a family vacation.
Why does Scott like the challenge of the sport so much? He sums it up this way: ""Climbing is fun for me.""
He also points out that climbing has taught him valuable lessons. ""You learn about trying over and over and not giving up.""

Rats have always lived in cities. The rodents live off food and waste that people throw away. Recently, however, rat populations have grown because many communities don't have the money to pay for rat-control programs, said Jerry Hershovitz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Such programs keep rat populations down.
Rats can carry diseases that can make people seriously ill, so controlling the rat population is important.
The solution to the rat problem is to limit their food supply, say experts. For example, people in cities should use garbage cans that rats cannot get into.

What dirt are the presidential candidates digging up about each other? Some people think election campaigning is a messy business. In one cartoon, Markstein draws attention to negative campaigning and

The unpiloted X-43A jet flew nearly 5,000 miles per hour. That is equal to seven times the speed of sound. The aircraft made a 10-second powered flight and then glided for six minutes before plunging into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.
Before taking off on its own, the jet launched from the wing of a plane in midair.
A rocket, which was later released, helped boost the jet's speed.

NASA attempted to fly a similar unmanned jet three years earlier. However, a failure in the launch system caused the flight to explode.

The NBA has brought back its old ball after trying out a new ball covered in synthetic material.
For the past few months, players had to use a ball covered with a synthetic, or human-made, material. Many players, including O'Neal, complained the plasticcoated basketball was a bad decision. They said the new ball didn't bounce as well as the leather ball. The new ball also cut their hands. ""The new ball is terrible,"" O'Neal, the Miami Heat center, says.
Scientists at the University of Texas at Arlington ran experiments comparing the synthetic and leather balls. The biggest difference they found was in the way the new ball absorbs moisture.
The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture than the leather ball does. That means the synthetic ball doesn't become heavier when it comes in contact with players' sweat. It also means the synthetic ball can become slippery because moisture stays on its surface, scientist Kaushik De, who helped conduct the study, told
The return of the leather ball has many NBA players jumping for joy. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us.""

On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a seamstress, boarded the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, on her way home from work. Refusing to give up her seat to a white man, Rosa Parks was arrested and sent to jail.
Her arrest sparked the beginning of the Montgomery bus boycott. A boycott is a protest in which people refuse to
buy, sell, or use something. As part of the boycott, African Americans refused to ride buses in Montgomery if they couldn't sit in the front.
The Montgomery bus boycott lasted for over a year. In December 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to segregate, or separate, whites from African Americans on buses.
An ordinary woman who made an extraordinary difference, Rosa Parks is often referred to as ""the Mother of the Civil Rights Movement."" She inspired a new era of civil rights in the United States.

Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on armor and talk to tour guides. This year, more than 2.4 million people from across the country are expected to attend Jamestown events.
Stepping into Jamestown Settlement museum in Virginia is like stepping into the past. And that's just what thousands of people are planning to do this spring. May marks the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America. Organizers are expecting nearly 90,000 visitors on the weekend of May 11 to 13, when many major events are planned.
Jamestown is a tourist destination for people who want a frontrow seat to American history. ""The whole idea is to give people an idea of Jamestown and the world in 1607,"" historian Tom Davidson told
Davidson helped put together exhibits at the Jamestown museum for the anniversary.
Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on English armor and watch experts demonstrate how to fire muskets. Tourists can also go aboard and explore
or models, of the three ships that brought the first settlers to present-day Virginia.
The story of Jamestown began on May 14, 1607, when about 100 English men and boys arrived in present-day Virginia. They came seeking gold and other treasures. The settlers, called

or businesspeople, of the Virginia Company to make money in North America. But the settlers faced many problems, including disease, starvation, and conflict with the area's Powhatan people (see ""
At first, settlers stayed close together for protection. ""There were hundreds of people living inside a wooden-walled fort,"" explains Davidson. Living in the fort helped the settlers defend themselves from attack, but it also made hunting for food or growing crops difficult.
Captain John Smith was one of Jamestown's original leaders. He took command of the colony in 1608. When the colony was in danger of running out of food, Smith gave an order: ""He who does not work, will not eat.""
spent five months crossing the Atlantic. The original Godspeed carried 39 passengers from England to Virginia, making two stops along the way. The new Godspeed traveled from Maine to Virginia, stopping along the way to let visitors see the ship.
By 1613, Jamestown had expanded into a successful colony. At about that time, the settlers began to grow tobacco. Tobacco was a
meaning that it could be sold in large amounts to England. In the following years, the settlers pushed the Powhatan off the land and built tobacco
or large farms. Later, the Jamestown colonists bought slaves from Africa to work on the plantations.
Over time, Jamestown grew to become the colony of Virginia. Virginia was one of the 13 colonies that joined in 1776 to rebel against England, starting the American Revolution (17751783).
Much is known about Jamestown, yet more details are being discovered. For more than a hundred years, experts thought the site of the original settlement had been destroyed by the James River. In 1994, archaeologists, or scientists who study the remains left behind by past cultures, discovered what may be Jamestown's original location.
""Visitors can see things being excavated that haven't seen the light of day in 400 years,"" Jamestown spokesperson Mike Litterst told
Scientists are currently looking for the foundation of the first church that the Jamestown settlers built. If found, it will be the oldest English church ever discovered in the United States.
The skeletons of two settlers have already been uncovered at the site. They are on display beneath a glass case, exactly as they were found. Historians believe that one of the skeletons is that of Captain Bartholomew Gosnoll, a member of Jamestown's original ruling council. Gosnoll and Jamestown Settlement will have a lot of visitors in the coming weeks for the 400th anniversary. ""It's the biggest event we've had since 1957, when the [Jamestown] museum first opened,"" says Litterst.
When the English colonists first settled in what is now Virginia, a powerful Native American group had lived on the land for hundreds of years. ""There were about 20,000 Powhatan people there when the English arrived in Jamestown,"" Virginia Indian culture expert Karenne Wood told
She hopes that the 400th anniversary of Jamestown will help shed light on the Powhatan's story.
When Jamestown began, the English and the Powhatan tried to trade with each other peacefully, but soon fighting broke out over land and resources. Beginning in 1614, the fighting stopped for eight years when Pocahontas, a daughter of the Powhatan chief, married Englishman John Rolfe. However, the fighting quickly resumed as Jamestown expanded.
Over time, the Powhatan people lost their land to the English settlers. However, Virginia is home to many Native American descendants today. ""We have changed a lot,"" says Wood, ""but we are still here.""
Organizers at Jamestown are not calling the 400th anniversary a celebration. Why might that be?

Hispanic Americans are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. Those parts of the world include Spain, Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and most countries in Central America and South America. In the United States, many Hispanic Americans are also called Latinos.
As of June, about 39 million Hispanic Americans are living in the United States. That number marks a jump from the 2000 census count. At that time, Hispanic Americans numbered about 35 million. Today, the total population of the United States is estimated at more than 288 million people.
Currently, 1 out of every 6 kids in this country is Hispanic. Officials estimate that by 2020, 1 out of 4 children will be Hispanic American.
Hispanic Americans have influenced food, music, and customs in the United States. Hispanic Heritage Month marks a time for Americans to celebrate the traditions and history of Hispanic people. It takes place from September 15 to October 15.
People in communities around the country will celebrate the month with festivals. Many students will recognize the month by learning about the important roles Hispanic people have played in our countrys history.
Ellen Ochoa, the first Hispanic American astronaut, told
that to understand the history of the United States, people should learn about the contributions of different groups, including Hispanic Americans.
People sometimes refer to the United States as a ""melting pot."" That phrase means that people from many different countries have settled here. People of Hispanic heritage, along with people from other cultures, help make the United States strong.
From science to sports, people of Hispanic heritage have contributed to the history of the United States. Take a look at some of these well-known people.
Dr. Novello was born in Puerto Rico. In 1990, she became the first Hispanic American to serve as the U.S. surgeon general. That is the doctor who leads our country on health issues. She worked to improve healthcare for Americans, especially children, women, and minorities.
Gary Soto is an award-winning Hispanic American author. He writes fiction and poetry for adults and children. His writing is based on his experiences growing up as a Mexican American in California. His books, including
Baseball in April and Other Stories and Taking Sides
, are popular with many young readers.
In 1990, Ellen Ochoa became the first Hispanic American woman astronaut when she was accepted into NASAs training program. Ochoa, whose fathers parents were from Mexico, flew her first space shuttle mission in 1993. Since then she has clocked more than 720 hours in flight.

: What does a production designer do?
Douglas Chiang: I get to play with the visual design of the movie. I read the script, come up with ideas, [draw] them on paper, and show the director.
: Do you have advice for kids who want a job like yours?
DC: Study the basics. You need to learn how to draw properly, then worry about techniques.

This latest technology helped filmmakers to get the movie to resemble the beautiful paintings in the children's book. How does performance capture work? Tiny sensors, which look like mini jewels, captured the actors' movements.
Actor Tom Hanks performed with 150 sensors attached to his face. He also wore special body gear with more sensors. Hanks acted on a stage that resembled the inside of a black box.
While Hanks acted inside the black box, special cameras picked up light reflected from the sensors. The cameras then sent the information to computers.
Finally, Hanks's performance was placed into a computerized setting of the book. What the audience will see on the screen is part real and part computer animation.

Adkins and Heller have built a new robot that is so small, it can sit on a dime. The tiny robot weighs less than 1 ounce, has tracks like those on a tank, and carries a camera. For power, it uses three button cells (the batteries in watches).
So far, the robot cannot do many tasks. Recently, the robot steered itself through a small maze, but it moved at only 20 inches per minute. ""It can't zip along as fast as a spider or ant yet,"" said Heller.
In the near future, however, Heller plans to make faster and smaller robots. He foresees swarms of miniature robots doing all kinds of tasks. Police officers could send the small robots after crooks, and the bad guys would never know they were being tailed. Repair workers could send worker robots into tight spaces.
Perhaps in the future, swarms of minirobots will do many of the tasks, such as housecleaning, that people do today.

The poll found that at least 65 percent of Florida's voters favor new steps that would help protect the endangered manatees. Some of those steps include lowering the speed limit for boats in manatee zones, increasing fines for people who speed in manatee zones, limiting the amount of building along waterways where manatees are found, and creating additional protected areas for manatees.
""We are struck by [how far] Florida voters are willing to go to protect manatees,"" said Kate Stewart, who conducted the poll. She said the results also showed that ""boaters and non-boaters alike not just support but strongly support increased protection measures.""
Florida manatees live in the state's warm coastal and inland waters. The Save the Manatee Club says that the Florida manatee population has been shrinking since 1974, when scientists started keeping track.
Collisions with boats cause many manatee deaths. Since manatees swim slowly, they cannot get out of the way of a fast-moving boat. According to the Save the Manatee Club, 78 manatees were killed in collisions with boats in Florida waters last year. So far this year, at least 23 manatees have been killed in collisions.

Scientists say a hole has formed in the ozone layer above the South Pole every July for at least 15 years. Each year, the hole grows, reaching its largest size in September and October. The hole then shrinks and finally disappears in November and December.
This year, the hole was larger than ever. It covered an area of more than 11 million square miles. That's much larger than the combined areas of Antarctica and Australia!

Why are honeybees so important? Farmers depend on honeybees to

Experts estimate that nearly one-third of the food that humans eatfrom apples to zucchiniis pollinated by bees. ""Crops that are pollinated are the tasty things that people like to eat, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts,"" says Hackett.
Farmers are feeling the effects as mites destroy the

The bee shortage has driven up prices, making it expensive for farmers to rent honeybees. Each year, bees typically pollinate crops worth about $15 billion. Crop loss due to the bee shortage is costing farmers billions.
Farmers in California are particularly hurting because about 80 percent of the worlds almonds are grown there. Almond tree blossoms need honeybees to pollinate them.

What does it feel like to walk on the moon?
Aldrin: You knew that you were there, but it was unreal at the same time. It's so different and unusual that it's almost dreamlike.
What was the most memorable part of walking on the moon?
Aldrin: There are two moments that are not recorded on film. They're recorded in my mind. One was just the second or two after we shut the engine down and we realized that the spacecraft was on the moon. That really was the major achievement. When I was outside seeing the Earth, my other thought was that there were only three human beings who were not on Earth. [The third was Michael Collins, who was orbiting the moon in a craft that would take the astronauts back to Earth.]
Your children's book is about following your dreams. Did you dream of being an astronaut?
Aldrin: Well, there wasn't any such thing as an astronaut until about 1958 or 1959.
[the Soviet space satellite] didn't go up until 1957, so thinking of human beings in space was not at all common.
Will returning to the moon have the same impact as it did when you and Mr. Armstrong first set foot on the moon?
Aldrin: No, I don't think there is any way you can replace that competitiveness [to reach the moon first] that existed, that pioneering spirit. The moon is a proving ground in our backyard. We've been there before, but it's preparing us to visit another planet.
You've been a supporter of a piloted mission to Mars. Why do you think it's so important that we send humans to Mars?
Aldrin: Now we can send robots to Mars, but that just wouldn't satisfy the human desire to want to expand our horizons. We've always done that. I can't answer by saying that there is going to be something profitable that will be returned from Mars, other than perhaps storytelling or making movies en route.
Your sister gave you the name ""Buzzer"" when you were youngand then it got shortened to Buzz. And that stuck?

Students aren't just spending the extra time with their heads in a book, though. Harris explains that her students get longer recesses and more snack time. Parent Dawn Oliver says her 11-year-old daughter, Brittany, is an advice columnist for a magazine at her school in Fall River, Massachusetts. ""The kids get so involved in these things because it's not all book work,"" says Oliver.
Critics argue that extended school days could be too long for today's busy kids. And extra school time might prevent students from exploring other interests. Some students have complained about having to stay later. They are concerned that they wouldn't be able to concentrate during the last classes of the day.
Other people point out that longer school days
with, or get in the way of, after-school sports and clubs. ""The day is long enough already,"" student Cameron Villers from Ansonia, Connecticut, told
""After-school activities would be affected. Nobody wants to be at school from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m."" If schools have different schedules, planning athletic games could prove difficult.

659,"History in the Making: Mercury 3 Rescue Mission
The Mercury missions were the first attempts by NASA, the U.S. space agency, to send a human into space. The rocket missions took place from 1961 to 1963. During the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union competed to build the best space program. That period was called the space race. Tia interviewed her grandfather, Clark Presler, about his role in the 1961 Mercury 3 mission, during which astronaut Alan B. Shepard Jr. became the first American in space.
What do you remember from your experiences in the Navy?
I remember being part of the pickup crew [aboard the U.S.S.
] when the first manned space capsule returned to Earth. It was May 5, 1961. The name of the [rocket] was the Mercury-Redstone 3.
What was the purpose of this mission?
NASA wanted to send a man into orbit and back safely. His name was Alan B. Shepard Jr.
The capsule reached [an altitude of] about 187.45 kilometers, which is 114.61 miles.
The orbit flight lasted only 15 minutes.
In the Atlantic Ocean, near Cape Canaveral, Florida.
How did you pick up Mr. Shepard?
Well, we lifted the capsule up on the chain. Alan was standing up on it, hanging on to the chain. He came out without a single scratch on his body.
At first, I thought this project would be easy, but after the interview I knew I had to learn what this was all about. So later that day I asked Grandpa to explain this to me. After that, it sounded a lot clearer, and it's fun having a member of your family actually do something, well, famous.

Christopher Columbus may be going on one more journey. Scientists have opened a tomb in Spain that they believe contains his bones. The bones are traveling to a laboratory in Spain for testing.
Scientists are trying to solve a mystery: Where is Christopher Columbus buried? The Dominican Republic-an island in Central America-also claims to have the remains of this famous explorer.
In 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain and arrived in North America. He made four trips altogether. Before he died in 1506, he asked to be buried on the island that is today the Dominican Republic. It is part of the area he explored on his third and fourth trips.
When Spain lost control of the island, his body was moved. Spanish officials think it was taken to the island of Cuba before possibly being moved back to Spain. However, the Dominican Republic says the Spanish travelers took the wrong remains. By testing the bones, Spanish scientists hope to get to the truth of the matter.

Last month, workers in Oklahoma loaded about a dozen pieces of historic Route 66 onto trucks. Each of the 3,000-pound pieces then made a 1,400-mile trip to Washington, D.C., where they will become part of an exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
Route 66 has been called the ""Main Street of America."" It once stretched 2,400 miles, from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California. The road connected eight states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
In the 1920s, engineer Cyrus Stevens Avery of Tulsa, Oklahoma, envisioned a road connecting the Midwest and the Pacific Ocean. During the 1930s, Route 66 was completed and was soon lined with hundreds of businesses.
The road became so popular that it inspired a 1960s TV show,

In the past few decades, however, Route 66 has fallen into disrepair, and parts of the old route have been dug up. Today, drivers use faster superhighways to get where they were going.
Even though fewer people drive on Route 66 now, many people still think of the road as the Main Street of America. That's why the National Museum of American History wants to include the road in its new exhibit, ""America on the Move."" The exhibit is scheduled to open in 2003.

After 60 years, the candy bar, which weighs about 4 ounces, probably doesn't taste very good. In fact, it was never meant to. The U.S. Army had asked Hershey to make special candy bars, called Field Ration Bars, as a test. The bars were made to give soldiers lots of energy and not melt easily.

732,"Now you can take a trip to Mars without ever leaving Earth.
A kid reporter journeyed to Mars aboard Disney's new space ride. Find out how close her ride was to the real thing.
kid reporter Sonia Mia Diaz blasted into space on August 22. This 10-year-old from Florida was on a journey to Mars.
Sonia Mia rocketed to Mars aboard a new ride called Mission: SPACE. She experienced the ride during its opening week at Walt Disney World's Epcot Center in Orlando, Florida.
After her mission, Sonia Mia interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the ride's creators. Sonia Mia learned that Disney worked closely with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to develop the new space attraction. The ride lets people experience what a trip to Mars might be like in the future.
On her journey, Sonia Mia never actually left the ground. The ride gives people the feeling of blasting off and traveling through space. ""We really wanted people to feel as close as they could to what it's like to be an astronaut,"" said Bryan.
Sonia Mia read quotes about space exploration as she waited in line. Information about space history fills the attraction. There is even a moon car called a lunar rover on loan from a museum.
Before boarding the shuttle, Sonia Mia and three other riders were given different roles for the mission. Those roles included commander, pilot, navigator, and engineer.
Sonia Mia was assigned to be the engineer. In real life, Sally Ride, the first U.S. woman in space, performed the same role.
After Sonia Mia strapped herself in, the shuttle moved into launch position. The countdown began, and the shuttle blasted off! During the mission, Sonia Mia and her team used buttons and joysticks to perform the tasks associated with their roles. The ride lasted about 4 minutes.
The mission was as intense as Sonia Mia had hoped. What was her favorite part? The liftoff! ""I liked the intensity of the blastoff and the air pressure on my face,"" she said.
So how did the ride live up to a real space shuttle mission? Weekly Reader caught up with NASA astronaut Winston Scott to ask him that question.
Scott launched into space on two shuttle flights. He tested out Mission: SPACE and gave it a big thumbs up. ""It's a thrill a minute,"" he said.
Although no astronauts have been to Mars yet, Scott said the ride's liftoff was realistic. The feeling of moving up the launch pad and being forced back into your seat were similar to those felt on a shuttle.
However, he points out, there are differences. In an actual launch, astronauts feel about three times the force of
. Gravity is the force that pulls things toward Earth.
The blastoff on the ride was also shorter than an actual liftoff. And, he said, riders don't experience weightlessness. On a real space shuttle, astronauts become weightless because there is no gravity.
For many people, the ride brings to mind the courage of space explorers. As Sonia Mia pointed out, ""Going on the ride made me think about how brave astronauts are.""
Sonia Mia Diaz interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the forces behind Mission: SPACE. Here's what Sonia Mia learned.
Imagineers are people who work for Disney.
In general, Imagineering is about storytelling. We build attractions that put people who visit our parks into different worlds and stories. We also use technology to tell stories.
What was your role in creating the ride?
I'm the senior show producer, which is like being a movie director. A movie director guides people and directs the show, including the lighting, music, artists, and motion you experience on the ride.
Where did your team get the inspiration for Mission: SPACE?
People have always had an interest in space. The time and technology were right to create this new space attraction. We worked closely with NASA to develop the science and technology behind the attraction. No one has ever put people into a ride system like this before.
Before the ride, I was warned not to move my head or close my eyes because of motion sickness. I didn't feel sick, but might a person if he or she does those things?
That could happen if you move your head, because of the technology used to create the ride. We give those recommendations because we want people to feel most comfortable. Some people can move their heads, and it doesn't bother them at all.
How many times have you been on Mission: SPACE?
At last count, I've ridden it more than 400 times!

In an attempt to solve the mystery, scientists are X-raying the mummy of the
A pharaoh refers to an ancient Egyptian king.
""The question of whether [King Tut] was murdered or not will be completely answered,"" said Egypt's top archaeologist.
King Tut lived in Egypt more than 3,300 years ago. Despite suffering from a spine disease that made it difficult for him to turn his head, Tut probably spent his childhood swimming in the Nile River, hunting ducks, and learning how to read and write.
After his father died, the young boy was thrown into the royal spotlight. Tut was crowned king at about the age of 10! His reign, however, did not last very long. By 18 years old, he was dead.
Howard Carter, a British archaeologist, discovered King Tut's tomb in 1922.
The mystery of how King Tut died has fascinated people since Howard Carter, a British archaeologist, found his secret
in 1922. A tomb is a burial place.
Ancient Egyptians buried King Tut in an area of hidden caves called the Valley of the Kings. It is located near the Nile River. Tut's mummy was discovered with an elaborate gold mask covering its head and shoulders.
The tomb was filled with royal treasures, including jewelry, statues, furniture, and even some of Tut's childhood toys. Ancient Egyptians believed in life after death. They buried their dead with favorite items they believed could be used in the afterlife.
murdered, crime experts believe the culprit was likely someone close to him. Scientists have narrowed the list to four suspects: his wife, his treasurer, his prime minister, and his military chief.
They suspect those four people because they would have known about Tut's spine disease. His weak condition would have made him an easy target. They also might have had
, or reasons, to murder Tut. (See ""
Why do scientists think Tut was killed? They say the tomb's small size and its rushed state hint that he might have died unexpectedly.
At the time of the tomb's discovery in 1922, experts had ruled out foul play. Yet X-rays taken in 1968 revealed a different story. They showed a hole in Tut's skull, suggesting he might have suffered a severe blow to the head.
Tut's mummy was flown to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo for new X-rays. X-ray technology today is more sophisticated than it was in 1968. Thanks to modern
, or crime-solving techniques, scientists hope the question of whether Tut was murdered will soon be answered.
Was a crime committed? Clues point to four main suspects.
Although paintings in Tut's tomb depict a loving wife, experts say she could still have had a motive. Shortly after Tut died, his wife wrote a letter to the leader of another nation. She requested help in finding a new husband. In ancient Egypt, it was possible for women to become pharaohs. Did she murder her husband to become pharaoh herself?
Tut's treasurer, Maya, had easy access to him during his reign. Evidence, however, shows that Maya liked the boy king. He rebuilt Tut's burial chamber after it was robbed. A gift in Tut's tomb also bears Maya's name. Although Maya was the least likely to ascend to the throne after Tut's death, could the treasurer have been so jealous of the boy king that he murdered him?
Ay was Tut's adviser and grandfather. He became pharaoh upon Tut's death. After Tut died, Ay pressured Tut's wife to marry him. Marrying her made him king of Egypt. Shortly after their wedding, the new bride mysteriously disappeared. Some people think a painting of a hunting scene in Ay's tomb proves his crime. The painting was an odd choice for a royal tomb. Was Ay confessing his crime through the killing in the painting?
War threatened Egypt during Tut's rule. His military chief might have thought the boy king was too young to protect Egypt from its enemies. Because the chief drove Tut's chariot, some experts suspect that he pushed the young pharaoh to his death. After the prime minister's death, the military chief became king of Egypt. At that time, he attempted to erase records of Tut's life. Could that have been to cover up a crime?

The babies are receiving constant care at the nature center. They are covered with white hair and weigh 4 to 6 ounces. That's about the size of a hot dog.
As the pandas grow, they will develop black hair on their ears and around their eyes. Black hair will also grow across their shoulders and on their legs.

The next step is to see how well the satellite can count animals in the wild. Scientists plan to start testing the technology in the wild within the year.

Fred and Ginger Gall and their three sons--ages 13, 11, and 6--wrapped up their adventure in early August. Their final stop was at their home state's capitol building in St. Louis.

No person was behind the camera's lens. The camera was triggered by motion and heat from the passing cat.

When 13-year-old Katie recently went online, she couldn't believe that some classmates were making fun of her. The seventh grader from New Jersey discovered mean and hurtful comments written about her in an online Web journal.
""It was really offensive and upsetting to me because I knew everyone could see it online,"" Katie told
. ""There was nothing I could do to take it down.""
Katie's story is not unusual. She is one of the many victims of
. ""Cyberbullying is when a child torments, humiliates, or tries to frighten another child using interactive technology,"" online safety expert Parry Aftab told
Instead of teasing or picking on kids in the school yard, bullies have new territorycyberspace. The explosion in technology, such as computers, cell phones, and interactive games, gives bullies more places to do their dirty work.
Cyberbullies use e-mail, instant messages, text messages, and online journals to spread nasty rumors, post embarrassing photos, and tease other kids. Breaking into others' e-mail accounts and sending out mean messages to their buddy lists is a common practice for cyberbullies. Cyberbullies also run up other kids' cell phone bills with text messages. Some kids have even conducted online votes for the ugliest person in class.
For many kids like Katie, online bullying has become part of everyday life. Most cyberbullies are between the ages of 9 and 14. Studies show that about 55 percent of kids in grades 4 through 8 have had mean or hurtful remarks made to them online. ""Cyberbullying is a huge problem in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades,"" said Aftab.
Why is cyberbullying such a growing problem? For starters, kids spend a lot of time online at both home and at school. Nearly two-thirds of American kids have computers in their homes, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Online experts say being mean online is easier because computers give kids a sense of being
, or not being known. Kids say things on the Internet that they would never say face-to-face.
Some kids also don't realize that they're cyberbullies because they don't see the consequences of their actions. ""In face-to-face communication, we see when we've gone too far,"" she says. ""We lose all those visual cues online.""
To address the problem, more schools and communities are educating kids about online etiquette and are holding anti-bullying seminars. Aftab trains groups, called TweenAngels and TeenAngels, to become safe and responsible cybercitizens who share their knowledge with others.
TeenAngel Kendall, 12, experienced cyberbullying when kids at school blocked him out of gaming sites. His advice for dealing with a cyberbully: ""Don't be afraid to tell your parents, teachers, or whomever you trust the most.""
, or fight, cyberbullying, is to take a stand against it. ""The only way cyberbullying will stop is if kids protect each other,"" says Aftab. ""If you stand by and let someone else hurt someone, you're part of the problem. You need to be part of the solution.""
Online safety experts offer the following tips to protect yourself from cyberbullying:
Don't give out your passwords or any private information to anyone, even close friends.
Don't post any information online that you don't want others to read.
Don't answer a mean or threatening e-mail, block the person who sent you the offensive message, and tell a trusted adult. That person can help you take action.
Don't react to a mean message. Walk away from the computer and do something else that you enjoy for a few minutes.
Run your name through search engines, such as Google, to check whether there is information that you don't want on the Internet. Some search engines let you set up alerts that send you an e-mail if a new posting includes your name.
How is face-to-face communication similar to or different from sending a message by e-mail or IM?

Can you guess how this spider got its name? It may not live in the ocean, but it looks like a crab. The crab spider lives on flowers. It can match its body color to the flower's color. That allows it to sneak up on insects.
What a leap! The jumping spider can jump between 10 and 40 inches. To catch an insect, this hunting spider sneaks up on its prey and pounces.
The trap-door spider lives in a tunnel. The spider, common in the southwestern United States, lines the tunnel with silk and fashions a door made of silk and dirt. It peeks out of the slightly open door and grabs passing insects.
The tarantula is a large, hairy spider found mainly in warm regions, including the southwestern United States. Although the tarantula's bite is painful, it is not very poisonous to humans. Tarantulas hunt insects, lizards, mice, toads, and frogs.

(BEE-dees), come in colorful boxes and in different flavors, such as chocolate, grape, and strawberry. Michael Eriksen, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said bidis ""are candy-flavored and cost less [than other cigarettes], so they appeal to some kids.""
Bidis are not candy. They actually contain even more deadly poisons than other kinds of cigarettes. The American Lung Association says bidis contain five times more
than other cigarettes. Tar is a chemical that causes disease. Nicotine is a drug that makes people crave cigarettes.
Health experts also say people who smoke bidis have to puff longer and harder than they do with other cigarettes. That means smokers breathe in more poisons.
In every state, it is illegal for kids to buy cigarettes, including bidis. The U.S. government has also banned the importing of bidis because child laborers often make them.
The laws, however, are being broken. Recently, a group of kids in Oregon went undercover to help the police. The kids, ages 8 to 15, were able to buy bidis in some stores.
Health experts say the best way to stop kids from using cigarettes is to give kids the facts about how deadly cigarettes are. Another way to keep kids from smoking ""is to get adults to quit, because they are the biggest role model for kids,"" said health expert Greg Conley.
Smoking kills parts of the lungs that allow a person to breathe. It causes illnesses, such as bronchitis and emphysema.
Smoking blocks vessels carrying blood to and from the heart. It can also lead to heart attacks.

The koalas were once widespread on the east coast. However, farmers cut down many of the forests where koalas lived. Hunters also killed the animals for their fur.
I recently joined Bill Ellis and his team in a forest on St. Bees Island. Ellis is a scientist who studies koalas. He and other scientists hope that studying koalas on the island will teach them how to protect koalas elsewhere in Australia.
We spotted a koala named Abby in a blue gum tree. The blue gum is a
or type, of eucalyptus (yoo-kuh-LIP-tuhss) tree. The leaves of eucalyptus trees are the main food source for koalas.
Whenever we find a koala, we collect information about the trees in the area. We measure how tall and how fat the trees are. Then we put tags on their trunks, so we know theyve been recorded.
We also capture and tag the koalas. Before releasing them back into the wild, we give them a health checkup.
Ellis wonders if the St. Bees koalas are headed for hard times. The island is filled with wild goats, which may be eating small blue gum trees. Ellis hopes more research will help him understand how to protect the blue gumsand the koalas that depend on them.

New roller coasters are getting bigger, faster, and scarier. Millions of kids and adults take these thrill rides each year. Some experts worry that the rides' sudden twists and turns are unsafe.
High-speed coasters whip riders' heads back and forth. One report blamed coasters for 13 brain injuries from 1995 to 2000. Another report says some people have nearly died from coaster-related brain injuries.
Recently, two scientists set out to learn if coasters really do cause brain injuries. They studied the effects of riding three of the fastest coasters in the United States. The scientists say the coasters' twists and turns are not fast enough to cause brain injuries.
""People take more than 1 billion rides on roller coasters each year. The reports on brain injury are few and not proven,"" said Douglas Smith. He is one of the scientists who did the new study.
Some experts do not think the new study proves coasters are safe-especially for kids. They say the scientists only studied how coasters affect adults, not kids. They want a new study.
Edward Markey is a government official. Recently, he asked a group of experts to include children in their next study about roller coaster safety. Results from that study will be reported next year. Roller coasters have to be studied to make sure that ""riders of all ages"" are safe, Markey said.

To migrate is to move from one area to another. Leatherback turtles spend most of their lives in the sea. They lay their eggs on land. Then they migrate back to the ocean.

A Look Back at a Leader: Martin Luther King Jr.
Delivered the ""I Have a Dream"" speech in Washington, D.C.
Martin Luther King Jr. Day first observed as a national holiday
King was an African American leader who devoted his life to improving the lives of others. He once said, ""Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve.""
When King was growing up in the South, African Americans did not have the same rights as white people. African Americans had to live in separate neighborhoods and send their kids to separate schools. Some African Americans were not allowed to vote.
Many Americans felt that such laws were unfair. When King was older, he gave speeches and led peaceful marches to try to change those laws. As a result of King's work,
were passed. Those laws protect the rights of all Americans.

""We'll be able to perform operations with these robots that have never been imagined,"" said Dr. Randolph Chitwood of North Carolina. Dr. Chitwood is working to see whether robots can be used safely in operations to replace people's heart valves.
During the new heart operation, a robot with three arms works at the operating table. A few feet away, a doctor controls the robot's arms with a computer. Three tiny holes are made in the patient's chest. The robot's arms fit through the small holes.
One of the robot's arms holds a tiny camera. The camera allows the doctors to see inside the patient's body. The other two arms hold small tools, such as scissors and needles.
Robots may help lower the risks of heart operations. A doctor's hand can sometimes shake slightly. Or sometimes, a doctor's hand can be too large to reach some areas of the heart.
But a robot's arms do not shake and can fit into tiny places. Because the robot can work through small holes, the patient's chest heals faster after the operation.

Why is Philadelphia making such a big fuss about Franklins birthday? In 1723,when he was 17 years old, Franklin made his home there. He worked to make life in that city better. In Philadelphia, he helped set up the countrys first hospital, public library, and volunteer fire department.
During the 1700s, Philadelphia was the center of American government. When Franklin was young, America was made up of 13 colonies ruled by England. Franklin helped America gain independence. He also helped write the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.

Ben Franklin only attended school from the ages of 8 to 10. But his love of learning lasted a lifetime.
Even at a young age, Franklin was a scientist and an inventor. At the age of 10, Franklin invented wooden swim fins to help him swim faster.
When he was 12 years old, Franklin worked in his brothers printing shop. Later, he opened his own shop.

The Junior Iditarod takes place on the weekend before the start of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. That is the longest sled dog race in the world. It is open to mushers ages 18 and up.
During the Iditarod, teams are required to stop for at least one 24-hour break and two 8-hour rests.
At the halfway point of the Junior Iditarod, all teams must stop for a 10-hour rest.

This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
. That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's as Easy as One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.
Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

Nocturnal animals can see clearly in the dark. They often have a good sense of hearing too. Bats, owls, and flying squirrels are nocturnal.
Most bats eat insects. How does a bat find an insect in the dark? The bat makes sounds. The sounds bounce off an insect in the bats path. The sounds return to the bat. That lets the bat know where to find the insect and how big it is.
Flying squirrels live in trees. Can the squirrels really fly? No! They glide in the air. The squirrel leaps up and opens its arms and legs. Folds of skin connect its wrists to its ankles. That skin acts like wings.
Owls have large eyes. How does that help? They can see better at night than most animals. An owls eyes dont move. They always face forward. An owl has to turn its head to see in any other direction. Its head can turn almost all the way around!

Most tornadoes begin as thunderstorms. Air rises from the ground to the storm clouds. Sometimes that rising air starts to spin. A funnel-shaped cloud can form. When the bottom of the cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.
Most tornadoes last fewer than 15 minutes. During that time, they can travel across large areas of land. Winds can reach speeds of 300 miles per hour. The storms can destroy everything in their paths.
