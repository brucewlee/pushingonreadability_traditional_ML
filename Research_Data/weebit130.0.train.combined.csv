6,236,"Our world is filled with wild and weird creatures. Scientists say that there are millions of creepy crawlers for each person on Earth. Take a look at some of those creatures.
Arachnids and insects are two types of creepy, crawling creatures.
(ah-RAK-nidz) have eight legs. Scorpions and spiders are arachnids.
have fangs and stingers. Some scorpions' skin can glow in certain types of light. Many scorpions live in deserts around the world.
are yellow. That helps them stay hidden. The spiders wait on the inside of flowers. They hide there to catch insects for food.
have six legs. Goliath beetles and katydids are two kinds of insects.
can grow to be 6 inches long. The beetles are so large that some people say they sound like helicopters when they fly.
are covered in spikes and horns. They may look scary but are harmless. Their look is meant to scare other insects away.
Both arachnids and insects are invertebrates (in-VEHR-teh-brayts). They are animals with no backbone! Here are two more invertebrates that squirm and wiggle.
have a body part that makes a slimy liquid. As the slugs wiggle, the slime helps them slide and squirm along.
have about 230 legs and many body sections. Together, the legs and body sections help millipedes wiggle around.

7,381,"Stay safe while having a super summer.
Grab your beach towel and sunglasses! Summer is just around the corner. It starts on June 21. For most kids, that means more time to play outside. Experts say that more injuries occur during summer. Follow these tips to make sure you have a safe summer.
Many kids will spend hours playing outside in the summer sun. Be careful, though. The suns rays can be harmful. They can cause damage to your skin and eyes.
If you are out in the sun, be sure to wear sunscreen. Experts say it should have a
(SPF) of 30 or higher. The SPF number lets you know how much the sunscreen protects your skin from the sun. Make sure you rub it in everywhere your skin is showing.
You should also wear a hat and sunglasses. They protect against the suns harmful rays. Better yet, play in the shade!
What is one way to beat the heat? Splash in a pool! Just be sure to follow water-safety rules. Always swim with a grown-up watching you. You should also swim with a buddy. A buddy can tell others if someone needs help. If you dont know how to swim, stay in the
end. Something that is shallow is not deep.
Biking and in-line skating are great ways to get exercise. To stay wheel safe, always wear a helmet. It protects your head and brain if you fall. If you are in-line skating, also wear wrist guards, elbow pads, and kneepads.
What other ways can you stay safe this summer?

18,69,"How can you be ready in case of a fire at home? Learn safety tips and practice! Here are four safety tips you should know.
Smoke alarms save lives. Have an alarm inside and outside each bedroom. You should also have a smoke alarm on every level of the home. Push the test button at least once a month. That will let you know whether the alarm is working.
Fire can spread quickly. Every family needs to be prepared. How? Have a home fire escape plan. Draw the plan and talk about it. The drawing should show two ways out of each room. Those may be doors or windows. Then practice the plan twice a year. Practice during the day and at night.
Choose a safe place outside where everyone will meet. Get out and stay out! Never go back inside a burning building.
Once you are outside, dial 9-1-1 or the number for your fire department.
Why is it important to have a home fire escape plan? How might practicing it help you?

They are active at night. They sleep during the day.
Many owls, bats, and snakes are nocturnal. They have special ways to find
in the dark. Prey is an animal that is hunted by another animal for food.
Owls can see well at night. They also have great hearing. The feathers on the edge of their wings are soft. That lets owls fly quietly. They can sneak up on their prey. Owls hunt mice and other small animals.
Bat: Delpho M/Photolibrary; Moth: Michael Durham/Minden Pictures
Most bats eat insects. Bats have a special way of finding food. They make high-pitched sounds. The sounds bounce off insects and return to the bats. That lets the bats know where to find the insects.
Pit vipers are snakes. They sense the heat of other animals. Their heat sensors are inside holes on their faces. The holes are called pits. They help the snakes find their prey in the dark. Pit vipers eat frogs and other small animals.
How might being nocturnal help animals survive?

21,510,"Goats are helping to prevent forest fires.
Goats are doing their part to help prevent forest fires. Goats eat tall grass, weeds, and small branches. Those plants often spread forest fires in places such as California and Florida.
Many states are using goats to eat plants on mountains and in fields close to people's houses. By eating plants in those areas, the goats leave a clear patch of land. That way, if a fire starts in the forest, it will not be able to spread to where people live.
In 1999, there were about 94,000 forest fires in the United States.
Forest fires in 1999 burned nearly 9,500 square miles of land in the United States.
Most forest fires are started by people. People are sometimes careless with cigarettes and campfires.
Lightning is another cause of forest fires. When the forest is very dry and lightning strikes it, a fire can start.

22,142,"The U.S. Mint will release the last five state quarters this year!
Many kids are checking their coins for new state quarters. This year, they can complete their collections. The
will release the last five of the 50 state quarters starting this month. The U.S. Mint is the place that makes coins.
The 50 State Quarters Program began in 1999. Since then, the U.S. Mint has made five new state quarters each year. The coins are released to the public in the order in which each state became part of the United States.
The front, or heads side, of each state quarter is the same. They all have a picture of George Washington. He was the first president of the United States. He became president in 1789.
The back, or tails side, of each state quarter is
(yoo-NEEK). That means one of a kind. The design shows something special about that state. ""The program teaches people about the rich history of the states,"" says Michael White. He is a spokesperson for the U.S. Mint.
Many kids and adults started collecting coins in 1999 because of the new state quarters. ""It is, by far, the most popular and successful program in U.S. Mint history,"" says White. ""More than 140 million Americans collect them.""
Until 1965, quarters were made of silver. Today, quarters are made of copper and nickel.
New Jersey's quarter has a picture of George Washington on each side.
Coins last for about 30 years. Paper money lasts only about 18 months.
The main office of the U.S. Mint is in Washington, D.C. Offices are also located in five other cities across the United States. Study the map to learn more.
The U.S. Mint in Philadelphia is the largest mint in the world!
If you could design your own state quarter, what would it look like? Why?

23,536,"A Grand View of the Grand Canyon
Soon visitors to the Grand Canyon in Arizona will be able to step out onto a glass walkway to get a better view of one of the world's most beautiful canyons.
is a deep, narrow valley with steep sides. The Grand Canyon was cut into Earth over millions of years by the waters of the Colorado River.
The new walkway, called the Skywalk, is on the west
or edge, of the canyon. It juts out 70 feet. When it officially opens, visitors will be able to look down at deep rock formations.
The walkway was built on land owned by a Native American tribe called the Hualapai (WAH-luh-pigh). They want to attract more people to the west rim. ""It's a whole new way to experience the Grand Canyon,"" says spokesperson Sheri Yellowhawk.

28,148,"Scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates can be a lot of fun. But without safety gear, kids who use these toys are in danger. Play it safe!
In 1999, about 3? million kids were hurt while playing sports and using outdoor toys. Almost half of those kids got hurt while playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates.
The injured kids were probably not wearing safety gear. Without safety gear, playing with some toys can be very dangerous. Pads and guards protect parts of your body that could be hurt if you fall.
Most kids know that they should wear a helmet when they ride a bike. But kids should also wear helmets when they play with scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates. Kids can cut the chances of getting hurt in half by wearing protective gear.
Follow these safety tips when playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates:
Learn how to use the toy the correct way.
If a move seems dangerous, do not try it!
Do not play with the toy outside at night.

30,164,"What do takeout pizza and toys have in common? Justin Lewis and Matthew Balick invented toys they call Flip-Its out of
. A pizza saver is the white piece of plastic used to keep cheese off the takeout box.
Balick and Lewis, both from Illinois, found that if they pressed down on a pizza saver, it went flying. So they created 24 colorful, three-legged Flip-Itz characters.

31,190,"Many African penguins live on Robben Island. A ship carrying oil sank near the island. The oil spilled into the water and covered thousands of penguins. Oil can make penguins sick, so wildlife workers tried to help them.
In July, wildlife workers rescued African penguins from Robben Island. Robben Island is in the Atlantic Ocean near South Africa. Workers took 14,500 oily penguins to a wildlife center. Each penguin was carefully washed. It took two people about an hour to clean the oil from each of the birds!
Workers took the cleaned penguins to the east coast of South Africa. The penguins were set free in the ocean and swam back to Robben Island. While the penguins were swimming home, workers had time to clean up the spilled oil.
Workers put a special device on a few penguins. The device sent information to a computer. The computer showed exactly where each penguin was on its 560-mile swim home.
Did you know that there are 17 kinds of penguins? Here are just a few:
The emperor penguin is the largest of all penguins. It stands about 4 feet tall and can weigh up to 100 pounds.
The little blue penguin is the smallest penguin. It is only a foot high and weighs less than 2 pounds.

Did you know that Popsicles were once called Epsicles? They were named after Frank Epperson. He invented them by accident in 1905 at the age of 11. One night, he left a drink outside in the cold. The drink had a stirring stick in it. The next day, he saw that the drink had frozen around the stick. Epperson began selling his Epsicles in 1923. At that time, they came in seven flavors.
 What name did Frank Epperson give his invention?
 What happened when he left his drink outside?
 When did he start selling his frozen treats?

Both the United States and Russia are worried about polar bears. Russia is a large country in Europe and Asia. Many polar bears are hunted each year. Some people eat polar bear meat.

39,189,"You probably know that cigarette smoking makes people sick. But did you know that smoking hurts the environment?
Sometimes people drop cigarette butts on the ground. Many beaches in the United States are littered with cigarette butts. When beach cleanups are held, cigarette butts are picked up more often than any other kind of trash.
Cigarette butts can be dangerous. Cigarettes have hundreds of poisons in them. Scientists worry that the poisons could pollute the ocean water.
Cigarette butts can also harm animals. Seabirds will try to eat cigarette butts. The birds think the butts are food. The butts get stuck in the birds' stomachs and make them sick.
Every day, about 3,000 kids start smoking.
The average age a kid starts smoking is 13.
About 46 million adults in the United States smoke.
Smoking-related illnesses kill about 500,000 people each year.
Smoking one cigarette takes about seven minutes off the smoker's life.
On November 16, kids across the United States will scream their lungs out. That's when the Great American SmokeScream will happen. The kids will tell people not to smoke.

41,393,"Casey Martin is a professional golfer. But Martin has a disease that makes walking painful for him. So he would like to ride in a golf cart between shots during golf games.
Members of the Professional Golf Association (PGA) think it would be unfair to let Martin ride in a cart. They say that part of the competition in a golf match is walking the golf course. Some matches last four days, and players walk about 25 miles.
Now the U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether Martin can use a golf cart. The Supreme Court is the most important court in the United States. In January, the justices of the Court listened to what Martin and the PGA had to say about using the golf cart. The Court plans to make a decision by July.

47,399,"For kids in parts of Africa, it is also a way to get clean water to their communities. How? The merry-go-rounds pump water out of the ground. They are called PlayPump water systems.
Kids in Africa play on a PlayPump merry-go-round. It pumps clean water out of the ground.
People need clean water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, and bathing. Many people around the world do not have clean water. In some parts of Africa, women and girls have to walk miles to get clean water.
People are raising money now for more PlayPump systems. By 2010, they hope to have 4,000 PlayPumps in Africa.

50,462,"The sound of drums fills the air. People start to sing and dance. A
has begun. A powwow is a festival. It celebrates Native American life.
People sing songs in Native American languages. Some of the songs are old. Other songs are new. People sing to the beat of a drum. Dancers move to the beat. The drum is an important part of the powwow.
Dancers wear special clothes at a powwow. The clothes are made by hand. As the dancers get older, they add pieces to the clothes. Some of the pieces are gifts from family and friends.
People sell arts and crafts at some powwows. The artists make each item by hand. The arts and crafts often include beadwork, baskets, and pottery.
Fry bread is often found at powwows. The bread is sometimes used to make special tacos. People put meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and hot peppers on top of the bread. Then they roll it up and eat it.
Is it important to learn about Native American life? Why or why not?

52,260,"Cockroaches are not social insects, but they do live in groups. Scientists wanted to learn more about how cockroaches make group decisions. To do that, they created tiny robots that smelled like real roaches.
Cockroaches like to rest together in dark places. The scientists put the robots with a group of roaches. Soon, the robots and roaches were all resting together in a dark place.
Then the robots were placed in a light area. When the roaches saw the robots, they ended up resting in the light area too.
What did scientists learn from the study? A few cockroaches can change how the whole group behaves.
The robotic cockroaches did not look like real insects. However, the real roaches did not notice. That is because scientists made sure that the robots smelled like roaches.

53,545,"Tagging horseshoe crabs increases our understanding of their migration, survival, and abundance.
The horseshoe crab population in the United States is going down. Scientists say that too many horseshoe crabs are being caught by fishermen. Fishermen use horseshoe crabs to catch fish.
Scientists fear that many animals will be endangered if there are too few horseshoe crabs. Many animals eat horseshoe crabs.
To help the horseshoe crab, the government has made a rule saying how many crabs each state can catch. States must not catch more than that number. Scientists say the rule may mean there will be more horseshoe crabs soon.

58,225,"Workers at a museum in Kansas recently found an old letter. It was dated January 27, 1793. The letter was written by Martha Washington. She was the wife of President George Washington. She sent the letter to her niece.
The letter was donated to the museum in 1959. Then it was misplaced. Workers soon forgot about the letter. Nobody here knew about it. It slipped out of its folder. It ended up on the bottom of a drawer, says Aline Luecke. She is a spokesperson for the museum. We were really excited to get it again, says Luecke.
Bettman/Corbis; letter: Cloud County Historical Society Museum
Martha Washington wrote her letter with a quill. The letter was found at the Cloud County Historical Society Museum.

60,300,"More than 100 spiders are crawling around a museum in California. The Natural History Museum created a world just for those spiders in its greenhouse. A
Visitors can see many different kinds of spiders, such as the golden silk spider. That is one of the largest spiders in North and South America. Golden silk spiders build strong webs.
""Their web is so tough, people can make fishing nets out of them,"" says scientist Brent Karner, also known as the Bug Guy at the museum.

61,468,"An American Leader: The Story of Martin Luther King Jr.
Martin Luther King Jr. lived from 1929 to 1968. He worked to help all people be treated fairly. Each January, we honor his work with a holiday.
During the 1950s and 1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. worked to stop the unfair treatment of African American people. Some of those people were treated differently than white people were. African Americans had to use separate bathrooms and sit in the backseats of buses.
King lived in Montgomery, Alabama, when he started working for fairness. Recently, his house was fixed up to look exactly the way it did when he lived there. Visitors learn about King when they tour the house.
Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech in Washington, D.C. in 1963.
In 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. gave his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. He spoke in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. He told people that he dreamed that everyone would have
. Equal rights make sure that everyone is treated fairly and equally.
Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a national holiday in the United States. On this day, people honor Martin Luther King Jr. Children around the country learn about his work. They remember King in different ways, including making signs for parades and treating others nicely.
Rosa Parks seated on a Montgomery bus.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of an important event in history. In 1955, an African American woman named Rosa Parks was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama, for not giving up her bus seat to a white man. Rosa Parks's courage inspired many people, including King, to change that law and work for equal rights.
Today, people can visit the bus that Rosa Parks made famous. It looks like it did in the 1950s. Now it is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan.

62,113,"Many people visit Hawaii each year. They admire the coral reefs that surround the islands. But those beautiful reefs have been damaged by people and ships. Recently the United States government made a law to protect the reefs around Hawaii.
is a large strip of hard sea animal skeletons that is close to the ocean's surface. More than half of the United States' coral reefs are located in the waters around Hawaii.
Coral reefs provide homes for sea animals. Reefs also protect coastlines from dangerous, pounding waves. When waves pass over reefs, they slow down and get smaller.
Hawaii's reefs are being hurt. People have polluted the water around the reefs and have taken too many fish.
Before he left office, President Bill Clinton created the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Reserve. A
is an area protected by the government. This reserve is underwater and covers 84 million acres. That is almost as big as the states of Florida and Georgia combined.
Special rules make sure the reef reserve will be protected. People are not allowed to remove coral from the reefs. The number of fish taken from the reserve area cannot go up. Hawaii's reefs are now protected from further damage.
A coral reef is built by tiny sea creatures called coral
Coral polyps have hard outer skeletons that protect them. When the polyps die, their skeletons stay. After a long time, the coral skeletons build up, forming a reef.
More than 2/3 of the world's coral reefs have been damaged by pollution and too much fishing.
Coral can be tan, orange, yellow, purple, or green.
The Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef in the world. It is about 1,250 miles long and is located off the northeast coast of Australia.

63,253,"The Life of Martin Luther King Jr
A memorial for Martin Luther King Jr. is being built in our nation's capital.
Martin Luther King Jr. was a leader. He lived from 1929 to 1968. Americans honor him in January with a national holiday. This year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is January 21.
King grew up in the southern part of the United States. At that time, laws treated African American people differently from white people. African Americans were forced to sit in the back of buses. They also had to use separate bathrooms and water fountains.
When King was older, he worked to change those laws. As a result, equal rights laws were passed. Those laws provide the same rights to all Americans.

66,472,"Scientists from the United States are studying elephants in Africa. They say elephants make sounds that cannot be heard by humans. Now those scientists have found a way to study the sounds and what the sounds mean.
In a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear.
Scientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help.
Scientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled.
Scientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest.
The African elephant is the largest animal that lives on land. African elephants can weigh up to 16,000 pounds.
An elephant's trunk contains more than 40,000 muscles. The trunk is used to smell, breathe, touch, eat, drink, and bathe.
An angry or frightened elephant can run about 25 miles per hour.
Move over Backstreet Boys, something bigger is now on music store shelves. The Thai Elephant Orchestra released its first album last December. The orchestra is made up of six Asian elephants from the Thai Elephant Conservation Center. The center is located in Lampang, Thailand. Thailand is a country in Southeast Asia.
The elephants play many instruments, including drums and a xylophone. The money raised from album sales will be used to care for baby elephants. Workers will buy milk to feed elephants that have lost their mothers.

70,555,"How do bees and other insects fly so well? Scientists in England may have found the answer. Their research is part of a plan to build tiny aircraft.
The scientists learned that bees' wings are stiff at the front and
(able to bend easily) at the back. That allows the insects to lift off the ground and move in the air.
""Our work will make the goal of tiny aircraft, perhaps eventually the size of bees, a step closer,"" says one of the scientists.
The aircraft would have tiny cameras attached to them. In the future, these machines may be used for keeping an eye on traffic or even for spying.

71,354,"The United States is having money trouble. It now costs more than a penny to make a penny. A nickel costs nearly 8 cents to make.
Why are those coins so costly? Copper, nickel, and zinc are metals that are going up in price. Copper and zinc are used to make pennies. Nickel and copper are used in nickels.
Some lawmakers want the U.S Mint to use a cheaper metal: steel. It was used in pennies made in 1943, when there wasnt enough copper. You wont see new steel coins just yet. Other lawmakers first have to agree to the plan.
Some lawmakers want to bring back the steel penny.
The Lincoln penny turns 100 this year. Abraham Lincoln was our countrys 16th president. His picture has been on the penny since 1909.

72,620,"The United States government recently said it will clean up the Everglades. The Everglades are
in southern Florida. A wetland is an area of wet and spongy soil. Both pollution and construction have hurt the Everglades. A new law will now clean up and protect the Everglades. Over the next 36 years, the government will spend $8 billion to clean up pollution in the Everglades.
 The Everglades take up about 2,344 square miles. That's about the size of Delaware.
 The Everglades are the only place in the world where both crocodiles and alligators live.

73,460,"Scientists are hopping with joy. They recently found a new
, or type, of frog. It lives in Colombia. That is a country in South America.
The frog is very small. It is less than an inch long. Its skin is a golden color.
Scientists say the frog is part of a group called poison dart frogs. The frog's poison may injure or kill an animal that eats it. That is why poison dart frogs are so colorful. Their bright colors warn
to keep away. A predator is an animal that eats another animal for food.

74,87,"Rain forests are in trouble. They are disappearing. For many years, people have been cutting down trees to make room for farms and roads.
Many groups are working to save rain forests. The forests are home to half the worlds plant and animal
, or types. Many of those species are in danger of dying out.
We have lost almost all of our worlds tropical rain forests, says Ashley Schaeffer. She is a spokesperson for the Rainforest Action Network. That group is working to protect rain forests. Unless we take action now, they will all be gone, she says. We are working with large companies to get them to stop cutting down trees.
Farmers have destroyed a large area of this tropical rain forest.

75,79,"School has changed in some ways over time. Lets learn about those ways.
Schools did not always have computers. How is school today different from school many years ago?
Then: Many schoolhouses had only one classroom. Students of all ages learned together.
Now: Most school buildings have many classrooms. Students in each class are about the same age.
Students listened carefully to a phonograph. That is a machine that plays recordings.
Students use computers during lessons. They wear headphones to listen and learn.
Then: Students raised their hands to answer questions. The teacher called on students to respond.
Now: Students still raise their hands to answer questions. That is one way school has not changed.

79,166,"Did you know that the sun can power a car? Students from Canada set a world record last summer with a car powered by the sun. The students drove 4,350 miles in the solar-powered car. It is the longest distance a solar car has ever traveled.
Because the car uses the sun for power, it does not pollute the air. Special cells are on top of the car. The cells collect sunlight and turn it into electricity. The electricity powers the car's motor.
Each day, the car used the same amount of electricity needed to run a toaster. The team hopes that someday more people will drive solar cars.

85,474,"Sue has small holes in her jaw. For years, people have tried to find out why.
Now scientists think they have found the answer. They say a
may have caused the holes. A parasite is a tiny creature that lives on another living thing.
How did scientists find the answer? They studied bird bones. They found a bird jaw that had holes in it. They knew that when the bird was alive, it had a parasite.
Scientists say a parasite could have made the dinosaur sick. That is what may have killed Sue.

88,432,"How does food get from the farm to you?
time! A harvest is the gathering of food. Many fruits and vegetables are
in the fall. They are fully grown. They are ready to be picked and eaten.
Miller Farms is busy with its fall harvest. The farm is in Platteville, Colorado. It grows many vegetables. Carrots, beets, and onions are just a few of them. David Patterson works on the farm. He told
Kids can visit the farm and pick their own vegetables.
 We pick the vegetables by hand each day. Carrots are kind of tough to pick. You have to loosen them with a shovel first.
 We bring the food in from the field with trucks. We put the food into crates.
 The crates get loaded onto a truck. We take the food to farmers markets to sell it. Its all fresh and good.
Why might fruits and vegetables need to be picked when they are ripe?

92,12,"Smile! New studies show that people who have healthy teeth and gums also have healthy hearts. Thats why brushing and flossing your teeth is so important. It removes the bacteria that can cause problems in other places in your body, says Dr. Sally Cram. She is a spokesperson for the American Dental Association.
Here are some ways you can keep your teeth and gums healthy:
 Brush your teeth twice a day with toothpaste. Replace your toothbrush every three to four months.
 Floss gently once a day. Dental floss is thread that cleans between your teeth.
 Visit a dentist twice a year. Your dentist will clean your teeth and make sure they are healthy.
 Eat foods that are good for you. Those foods include fresh fruits and vegetables.

94,622,"Our national anthem is ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Did you know that the song is about a 200-year-old flag? Workers from a museum in Washington, D.C., are trying to make the flag look new again.
Fixing the flag is a big job. The flag is 42 feet long and 30 feet wide! Workers lie on their stomachs on a platform above the flag.
The workers have removed material that covered the back of the flag. The workers had to cut 1.7 million stitches!

95,500,"is a place that has two names. Some geography experts call it
They want to use that different name to include Australia plus the tiny nearby islands. Australia also is the only natural home to some of the world's most unusual animals. Kangaroos, koalas, and duck-billed platypuses live there.

96,356,"Winter is a baby bottlenose dolphin who lost her tail in an accident. Scientists want to help her by giving her a
(prahs-THEE-suss). That is a human-made part to replace a missing body part.
In spite of her injury, Winter behaves like a can-do dolphin. She has learned to swim without her tail, by moving from side to side. If the new tail works, she will be able to move up and down in the water, the way other dolphins swim.

97,348,"Thanksgiving is a time for people to give thanks. Many people eat turkey on Thanksgiving. Long ago, the Pilgrims and Native Americans gave thanks.
How might Native Americans give thanks today?
Thanksgiving is about more than the food.
Joseph Bruchac (JB) is a Native American writer and storyteller.
asked him to share his thoughts about Thanksgiving.
My family gathers for a big meal. We say a few words in our native language of Abenaki around the table to express our thanks.
What does Thanksgiving mean to Native Americans?
Native people give thanks for all things. Different groups have many thanksgiving festivals during the year.
Native Americans were one of the first to have a fall harvest festival. Squanto and other Native Americans taught the Pilgrims how to survive in a new land. The Pilgrims shared their first harvest with the Native Americans.
In 1620, the Pilgrims landed in what is now Massachusetts. Squanto showed the Pilgrims which crops to grow, such as corn, beans, and squash. He showed them which animals to hunt and where to fish.
A harvest is a gathering of food that has been grown. They shared their food at a feast with Squanto and other Native Americans.

102,214,"2008 is the Chinese Year of the Rat.
February 7 is Chinese New Year! The celebration lasts 15 days. Each Chinese year is named after one of 12 animals. This is the Year of the Rat.
People prepare for the holiday before the actual day. They clean their homes and decorate them with flowers and poems. The poems are happy messages of good luck. People also put out bowls of tangerines, oranges, dried fruits, and candy to wish visitors a sweet new year.
On the first night of the celebration, families and friends gather for a special meal. Many people wear new red clothing. They eat foods such as dumplings, fish, and long noodles. Sweet, sticky rice cakes are a favorite treat.
The Chinese New Year celebration ends with the Lantern Festival. It includes music, dancing, and fireworks. Kids carry lanterns in a parade under the light of a full moon. The highlight of the parade is the dragon dance. Dancers carry a long dragon made of silk, paper, and bamboo through the streets. The dragon may stretch more than 100 feet!

104,82,"Whiskers's class went to the museum for a field trip. But, oops, the story of their trip is in the wrong order. Use the clues to put the story in order.
Fourth, Whiskers and his class went to see the train display. They saw an old locomotive--a train's engine. The first locomotives used steam to move. This steam locomotive could pull many train cars, or parts of a train.
First, the students went to see the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs lived long ago. Dinosaurs are now extinct, or all gone. Scientists use dinosaur fossils, old bones or marks made by body parts or plants, to learn about dinosaurs.
Fifth, Whiskers saw real moon rocks and pictures of astronauts, the people trained to visit space. Astronaut Neil Armstrong was the first man to step onto the moon. He put an American flag up on the moon. He brought moon rocks back to Earth.
Second, Whiskers's class went to see an Egyptian mummy, or a dead body that has been kept in a special way. Egyptians buried their pharaohs, or kings, as mummies. The bodies were wrapped and put in fancy boxes. The boxes were decorated with paintings and writing.
Sixth, Whiskers's class met by the main door. They looked at a statue,or form of something or somebody. The statue is a copy of one called The Thinker. Whiskers was thinking, too. He was thinking about his day. He was glad he had visited the museum!

107,202,"Hi! My Name is Pam Pollster. This is my pet parakeet, Polly. We live in Polling Place. Polly is a smart bird. In fact, she's so smart, she can count very high numbers. This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
. That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's as Easy as One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.
Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

108,566,"April 22 is Earth Day. That is a day for people to take action and help Earth. This year, Earth Day is 40 years old. To celebrate, 40 events will take place in cities around the world. The events were the idea of Earth Day Network. That group is trying to get more people to take care of Earth.
The main event is going to be held in Washington, D.C. People can go there to learn more about ways to help Earth, says Sean Miller. He is the education director at Earth Day Network.

115,546,"About 47 million American kids went back to school in September. Some live in cities that do not have big enough schools for all the kids. Some of those cities do not have space or money to build new schools.
That is why some cities are turning empty shopping malls into schools. Stores become classrooms, and restaurants become lunchrooms. Making a mall into a school is faster and costs less than building a new school.

season is here. A hurricane is a storm that forms over warm ocean water. It brings strong winds and heavy rains. The season lasts from June to November.

It happens when a hurricane travels over water. The strong winds push against the water. The water gets higher and higher. As the hurricane passes over land, the water pushes onto the shore. The rising water can cause flooding.
Hurricane Hunters are ready. They are a part of the U.S. Air Force Reserve. Their job is to fly airplanes into the
of a hurricane! The eye is the calm center.
Inside the storm, the hunters measure the amount of rain and the speed of the wind. Their work helps weather experts predict where the hurricane will go and how strong it will become.
The three pictures show how a hurricane forms.
 First, small storms begin over an ocean.
 Then strong winds make the storms spin around and come together.
 Soon, a hurricane forms. It spins around and around. Sometimes it moves over land and brings heavy rains and strong winds.

119,123,"May is Bike Safety Month. During this month, many communities will have activities to teach kids about bike safety. Events often include safety classes and helmet fittings.
Why is it important that your helmet fit well? If it does not fit, it wont protect your head. To work properly, a helmet should be straight on your head and fit snugly. If a helmet is too loose, it can slip to one side.
Riding a bike is a lot of fun, but remember that safety comes first, says Dr. Jamie Freishtat. She is a childrens doctor and a spokesperson for Safe Kids. The group works to prevent childhood injuries. Wear an approved bike helmet that fits properly every single time you get on your bike. Remember this rule: No helmet, no bike.

120,160,"What can you do with some paper, markers, and kind words? Show a veteran that you care. That is how some students will honor our veterans. They will make thank-you cards.
Veterans have made great sacrifices to serve our country. They deserve our respect and gratitude, says Laurie Tranter. She is a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Receiving a thank-you card can put a smile on a veterans face. It lets that person know he or she is appreciated.

A program called Ice Hockey in Harlem teachers kids how to play hockey. They learn the rules of the game and about hockey equipment. Then, one night per week, kids practice hockey at a local skating rink.
To play hockey, the kids have to go to tutoring sessions. The sessions use hockey information as learning tools. For example, the kids practice math skills by comparing hockey teams' scores.

are buildings or places that are well-known. They are symbols of our country. Lets explore some of them!
The Statue of Liberty is in New York, New York. It is located on Liberty Island. People can visit the statue by taking a
to the island. A ferry is a boat used to carry passengers.
The statue was a gift of friendship from the people of France. It was shipped to the United States in 350 pieces. The statue was rebuilt. It was completed in 1886.
The Gateway Arch is in St. Louis, Missouri. It was completed in 1965. The arch is 630 feet tall. Visitors can ride a
to the top. A tram is a car that travels on overhead cables.
The arch was built to look like a
or entrance, to the West. It honors American
who traveled west across the United States long ago. Pioneers are people who are among the first to settle in new places.
The Golden Gate Bridge is in San Francisco, California. It opened in 1937. It is a suspension bridge. That means the roadway hangs from cables. The cables are connected to towers. People can cross the bridge by car, by bicycle, or on foot.
The bridge is almost 9,000 feet long It crosses the Golden Gate Strait. A
is a narrow channel of water that connects two large bodies of water.
The Liberty Bell is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was made in 1753. The bell weighs about 2,000 pounds. It was rung to call people together for special events and announcements.
Soon after the bell was made, it cracked. People tried to fix the bell, but it cracked again. The bell has not been rung since then. It now hangs in a museum. Many people visit the bell to see the crack that made it famous.
If you were asked to create a new landmark for our country, what would it be? Why?

130,596,"The Galpagos Islands are a group of islands located in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of South America. The islands are home to some of the world's
or most unusual, animals and plants. In January, those islands had a brush with disaster.
On January 16, a ship carrying oil got stuck on a
is a chain of rocks or coral near the surface of the water.) The islands are located in the Pacific Ocean about 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador. Scientists say the oil spill put many of the islands' animals in danger.
The oil spill happened near San Cristbal and Santa Fe islands, in the eastern area of the Galpagos. Cleanup workers said the oil killed two pelicans and dirtied 40 others. Workers said some sea lions, birds, and tortoises also needed to be cleaned.
Oil can make animals sick if they swallow it. When oil covers an animal's fur or feathers, it can't swim, fly, or stay warm. If the oil is not cleaned off the animal, it could die.
The oil spill also harmed life in the water. Many sea plants, such as algae (AL-jee), were also damaged by the oil spill. Sea plants are an important food source for many Galpagos animals.
Days after the accident, however, the islands were spared further damage. Ocean currents took the oil out to sea, away from the islands.
What could be done to prevent such oil spills?

133,130,"Chew on this! Your school cafeteria may be getting a makeover. Members of the U.S. government are trying to pass a new law. It would make school foods healthier. Under the plan, school cafeterias would serve meals with ingredients that are better for you. Vending machines, such as the one below, would also sell healthy snacks.
The idea is part of First Lady Michelle Obamas plan. She hopes to end childhood
That is the condition of being very overweight. About one-third of kids in the United States are too heavy, according to a study. Kids who are overweight are at a higher risk of having health problems.
If the law passes, schools would make kids foods healthier. Pizza, for example, might be made with low-fat cheese. [This bill] will help us [give] healthier school meals to children across America, says Obama.

135,141,"Scientists in Canada are playing Go Fish. They recently counted sharks that swim in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Canada.
Why? To find out how many sharks there are, of course! Some, such as the porbeagle shark, were once in danger of becoming extinct. The porbeagle shark is a species, or type, of shark. People hunted them for their meat and fins. Now, laws protect porbeagle sharks in the Atlantic Ocean.
Scientists want to make sure porbeagles are still safe. Traveling in boats, scientists caught about 1,000 sharks. Most were porbeagles. The scientists put tags on the female sharks and released them back into the ocean. The tags will allow the scientists to
or watch, the sharks in the coming months.

Car owners in Pennsylvania recently showed their American spirit. Their cars helped form an American flag.
The 140 cars were parked in rows to create the red and white stripes and blue square. To make the flag complete, people held up 50 stars.
As part of the celebration, the car owners sang our national anthem. A
is the official song of a country. The event was part of the National Anthem Project. The goal of the project is to teach Americans the words to the country's national anthem""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Two out of three Americans don't know the words to the song.
Francis Scott Key wrote the words to ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" as a poem in 1814. It became the official national anthem of our country in 1931. Do you know the words? To learn the anthem, go to

139,22,"NASA sets its sights on the moon, then Mars.
Astronauts are aiming for the moon again. This time, though, they plan to stay there. Astronauts hope to live and work on the moon by 2020, according to NASA. The U.S. space agency recently announced plans to build a base there.
At first, four-person crews will stay for a week. By 2024, they will be able to live there for as long as six months.
The base will most likely be built near the moon's north or south pole. The poles get the most sunlight. At those locations, the moon base would be able to use solar power. That is energy from the sun that can be used to create electricity.
The moon is the only place beyond Earth that humans have visited. At a distance of about 238,900 miles, the moon is Earth's closest space neighbor. So far, only 12 people have walked on the moon's dusty surface. Those astronauts traveled there on Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972.
NASA hopes the moon mission will kick off a new
or time period, of space exploration. Scientists say that living on the moon is the first step in preparing astronauts to travel to Mars. ""By demonstrating we can survive on another world for a long time, we build confidence that we can venture much farther from Earth and stay for longer periods of time,"" NASA official Michael Braukus told

147,19,"Beep! Beep! A small bus on the road is getting a lot of attention. It is a pollution-free bus that uses
vegetable oil as fuel. (When something is recycled, an old item is turned into something new.)
The veggie bus is meant to inspire people to vote on Election Day. A group of musicians from California came up with the idea. They are driving the bus from coast to coast to spread their message.

148,700,"California has the bluesblue butterflies, that is! Scientists in the state recently released 80 Palos Verdes blue butterflies into the wild.
The experts raised the fliers because the insects are endangered. They can live only in a small area of California. That area is called the Palos Verdes
A peninsula is a stretch of land that is bordered by water on three sides.
The butterflies lay their eggs on two types of plants found on the peninsula. However, those plants have been harmed by people moving into the area.
To save the butterflies, scientists grow the insects favorite plants in parks around the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Then they release the insects into those areas each spring.
Scientist Jana Johnson hopes her work helps the blue butterflies bounce back with flying colors. We are undoing the wrongs of the past and trying to save this planet, one species at a time, she told

150,118,"Companies are pulling the plug on unhealthy food ads for kids.
No more cookies or candy for SpongeBob SquarePants. Dora the Explorer is also going on a diet. Recently, some companies decided to stop using cartoon characters to advertise unhealthy foods and drinks to children. This includes television commercials.
Nickelodeon will stop showing characters on junk-food packages by 2009. Starting next year, Kellogg's, McDonald's, and Kraft Foods will not advertise unhealthy products to children under 12.
According to doctors, kids see 40,000 television ads per year. About half of them are food ads. Many of them are for sugary cereals and unhealthy snacks. Health experts and parents say these ads make kids want to eat junk food more often.
""It's putting our children at risk,"" says scientist Ellen Wartella.
Obesity is the condition of being very overweight. Experts say one-third of American children are obese or at risk for becoming obese.
Currently, there are no laws that control how food companies advertise to children. This means it's up to the companies to decide how to advertise.
Josephine Thomas is a parent. She is glad that some companies are changing their use of cartoon characters in advertisements. ""As soon as [my kids] see a Shrek or Mickey Mouse [food product], they automatically look at that and they don't see what they really need,"" she says.
Yes, according to scientists at the University of Liverpool in Europe. Recently, they studied 60 children of various weights. The kids, ages 9 to 11, were shown several food and toy ads on television. Children at a healthy weight ate 84 percent more food after watching the food commercials than after watching the toy commercials. Obese kids ate 134 percent more food.
In what ways can advertisements affect people?

152,179,"Scientists fear that monarchs may become endangered.
Catching monarch butterflies is no easy task. ""You have to sneak up behind them and then slip your net on them,"" said 8-year-old Evan Shauer from Wisconsin.
Before freeing the butterflies, Evan had a job to do. He placed a tiny numbered sticker on each monarch. Those black-and-orange butterflies were among thousands that kids across the country tagged.
Monarch butterflies do something very unusual for an insect: They
, or travel to a new location when the season changes. Each fall, millions of monarchs from North America head south. Most fly more than 2,000 miles to forests in Mexico.
Volunteers in Mexico look for the monarchs wearing tags. The tags help scientists figure out which butterflies reached Mexico and how far they flew.
, or at risk of dying out. People are cutting down trees in Mexico where the butterflies spend the winter.
""Our goal is to save the monarch migration,"" said butterfly expert Chip Taylor. ""To do this, we have to learn as much as we can about how the number of monarchs changes from year to year."" Kids like Evan are helping scientists do just that!
Why might it be important to save monarchs from dying out?

153,487,"NASA wants to build an even better telescope than Hubble! It will be called the James Webb Space Telescope. James Webb was one of the people in charge of NASA.
In 2010, NASA is planning on sending the new telescope into space. A rocket will launch the telescope. It will take the rocket about three months to complete its journey.
The new telescope will be much farther from Earth than Hubble. Webb will take photos from 940,000 miles above Earth. That is about 700,000 miles farther than the moon! Scientists will use the new telescope to learn even more about the universe.

A hurricane is a large, powerful storm that forms over an ocean. A hurricane has strong winds and a lot of rain. When a hurricane moves over land, it can cause a lot of damage.
Between August and late September, four hurricanes hit Florida. The storms left many people without electricity. Some families even lost their homes.
Students at Mintz Elementary wanted to help those families. They donated hundreds of items and more than $2,000 to the Red Cross! That is an organization that helps people in need.
""I like to help people,"" said 7-year-old Garrett Surber, a student at Mintz. ""It makes me feel happy that they will be OK.""

155,155,"February is the month in which millions of Americans celebrate African American history. Many important events in African American history took place in February.
For example, Rosa Parks was born during this month. In 1955, Parks was arrested when she refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery, Alabama, city bus. In some places at that time, it was illegal for a black person to sit in the front of a bus.
of, or refusal to use, the bus company. Many blacks refused to ride the city buses for more than a year, until those unfair laws were changed.
In 1926, the historian Carter G. Woodson declared a week honoring black history. He chose the February week with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass.

158,111,"A new report shows pythons are spreading.
Whats 23 feet long, as thick as a telephone pole, and slithering into a state near you? A Burmese python!
Pythons and other giant snakes are worming their way into Florida and other states. That is the finding of a new report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The species are not
to, or originally from, the area. They might have started out as pets that were set free. Many pythons are native to Asia.
Today, there are tens of thousands of pythons in Florida. They may one day creep into almost one-third of the United States, scientists say.
They [can move] long distances in a short period of time, scientist Gordon Rodda told
. He worked on the study. We had a python in Florida that in a few weeks ... traveled 30 miles.
. Those are groups of plants and animals that live in the same area. The snakes eat everything from birds to bobcats. They lie still until an animal comes near. Then the
strike. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals that often have scales.
U.S. officials are coming up with ways to stop the snakes. One idea is to
people from bringing pythons into the country. To ban is to prevent.
People in Florida move an 18-foot-long python to a safer home.
People who own pet snakes can help too, Rodda says. If you have a snake that gets too big for your home, take it to a zoo. We dont want to create a problem by [setting free] an animal we no longer want to take care of, says Rodda.
What makes giant snakes special? Wrap your head around these python facts to find out.
, or squeeze, prey? They loop their bodies around the prey and tighten their muscles to kill the animals. Then they swallow them.
Only alligators are tough enough to eat adult giant snakes. Dont feel bad for the snakes, though. They eat alligators!
Female pythons can lay up to 100 eggs at a time. The snakes stay on the eggs for two to three months to keep them warm until they hatch.
What are other ways U.S. officials could stop the snakes?

160,516,"Theres a new croc on the block! Researchers recently announced finding an ancient crocodile in South America. They dug up the creatures remains in Colombia.
(ack-your-ON-tih-soo-cuss gwa-hee-RAH-en-siss). The croc lived about 60 million years ago.
The giant crocodile lived in a river. That surprised researchers because other types of ancient crocodiles lived mainly in the ocean.
This drawing shows how the snapper may have looked.
The finding may help explain how some crocodiles
when dinosaurs died off. To survive is to live. One of the ways they [survived] was [by] living in lots of different places, Alex Hastings told
. He wrote a study about the new croc.
Life wasnt a snap for the creature, though. It most likely had to battle with the worlds largest snake for food. It was not an easy life even for a 20-foot crocodile, Hastings says.

161,698,"Who likes zoos? The Tavianos sure do! The family from Columbus, Ohio, (above) visited 52 zoos in one year!
Parents Marla and Gabe and their daughters, Olivia, Ava, and Nina, recently traveled across the country checking out animal
Their adventure began in August 2008. They visited a zoo in Kentucky first. The tour ended one year later. Their last trip was to the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium.
The Tavianos saw just about every animal imaginable. They fed pelicans, rode camels, and petted stingrays. They even got kisses from a giraffe! Olivia, 8, Ava, 7, and Nina, 3, say their favorite is the Saint Louis Zoo in Missouri. They have the coolest penguin and puffin exhibit, Ava told

164,591,"Look, Mano hands! A van recently traveled from Europe to Asia without a driver. It used
to get around. Sensors are instruments that can notice heat, light, and sound. The vehicle also used electricity instead of gas.
The driverless van takes a passenger for a spin.
The van journeyed 8,077 miles. It made the trip in three months. Two scientists stayed in the van in case anything went wrong. One time, they had to take control when the vehicle was stopped by a police officer. The officer almost gave the experts a ticket because there was no driver! Once they explained that the drive was an experiment, he let them go.
We are happy we made it to the finishing line without any real problems, says Alberto Broggi. He works for the company that created the van. The company hopes that one day, robotic cars will make driving safer. Now if only they could make a robot to clean your room!

165,778,"So long, mystery meat! School lunches are about to get a lot more
U.S. President Barack Obama recently signed a new law. It requires schools to provide more nutritious food. The law is called the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Its purpose is to help kids be healthier.
This act is about doing whats right for our children, Obama said before signing the law.
So, what will the new law serve up? School officials have to remove sugary drinks and junk food from vending machines. They have to make meals healthier, as well. For example, instead of hot dogs, cafeterias might dish out whole-wheat spaghetti with meat sauce. There will also be more fruits and vegetables on the menu.

167,676,"Elena Kagan is a new Supreme Court judge.
All rise! Theres a new judge in town. On October 4, Elena Kagan will start her first day as a U.S. Supreme Court
A justice is a judge. The Supreme Court is the countrys highest court.
She is only the fourth female Supreme Court justice in history. This is the first time the Court will have three women justices at the same time.
Steve Petteway/Collection of the Supreme Court of the U.S.
Elena Kagan is sworn in as a justice in Washington, D.C.
Kagan grew up in New York City. She dreamed of being a judge. Her dream started to come true in May. Thats when U.S. President Barack Obama picked her to become a justice.
Before she could join the Court, she had to meet with U.S. senators. They asked her questions. Then they voted on whether she should become a justice. A
or most, of the senators agreed she should.
In her new role, Kagan will work with eight other Supreme Court justices. They
or explain, the U.S. Constitution. That document says how the nation should be run. The justices must decide whether laws follow the Constitutions rules.
Kagan is studying cases that the Court will hear next month. She is excited about her job. I will work my hardest and try my best ... to serve this country I love as well as I am able,she says.
The U.S. government isnt a tree, but it does have branches! Each branch does a different job.
The U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives make up this branch. Their job is to create laws.
The president and vice president are in this branch. The president carries out laws and leads the U.S. military.
The U.S. Supreme Court runs this branch. Its duty is to make sure laws follow the U.S. Constitution.
Supreme Court justices can serve as long as they want. Why might that be?

Colleen and her friends arent the only ones mastering machines. Hundreds of thousands of kids around the world are learning how to build robots. About 213,000 students are expected to enter the
robot competitions this year, according to experts. Thats about 20,000 more kids than the robot contests had last year.
At Colleens school, kids have a kit to build their machines. Then they use a computer to
their robots. To program something is to give it instructions on how to work.
Colleens robot looks like a car. I didnt know how to program anything before, and I learned how to program a robot! she told

The rabbit may have roamed the island, but it probably didnt hop!
had a short, stiff backbone. That would have made jumping difficult, explains scientist Josep Quintana. He helped find the fossil.
The giant discovery reminds Quintana of another wacky wabbit. He told
was similar to Bugs Bunny [because] he was so big and so different compared with other rabbits.

171,64,"Twelve-year-old Sydney Davis knows how popular wristbands have become as a way of raising money. She thought,
Sydney Davis has had diabetes since she was 5 years old. She is one of 18 million people in the United States with this illness. In a person with diabetes, the body makes little or no
. Insulin helps the body use the sugar in food for energy.
Sydney came up with the idea to put the slogan ""Cure Diabetes Today"" on blue wristbands. She and her friend Daniel Rosen, 13, who also has diabetes, sold the wristbands in their New Jersey community. After only a month, they had sold 10,000!
Soon after, the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center in New York began selling the wristbands on its Web site. The bands became an even bigger hit! ""We made over $100,000 already,"" Sydney told
. ""I didn't think we'd make this much money, so I'm very happy."" The money will pay for research to find a cure for diabetes.

172,359,"Look out, Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys! Here comes the next hot musical act: the animals!
Scientists recently announced that the music made by several kinds of birds and humpback whales shares some of the notes, rhythms, and harmonies found in music created by people. Scientists say that these animals may also pass songs along to one another, which means animals may be able to learn music.
Roger Payne, one of the scientists studying animal music, says his study ""proves that musical sounds can be enjoyed by all living things.""
Because animals cannot sing in a human language, however, Britney Spears and other pop stars have nothing to worry about!

173,633,"Many kids say good-bye to a favorite part of the school day.
Imagine if recess were no longer part of your school day. If you are like most kids, you are probably thinking, ""No recess? No way!"" However, some students have no choice. For them, recess is over.
Clark County School District in Nevada recently put an end to recess. It is one of many school districts across the country to get rid of recess time. Why? School officials say they want students to have more time to learn. They also hope that more time in class will help students perform better on tests.
Should schools stop having recess? Why or why not?
Many teachers, parents, and students do not agree with the decision to
, or take away, recess. ""Recess is important so kids get a break from sitting at their desks,"" said one principal from Virginia. ""They get up and move. They can visit with their friends and have social time.""
Many experts say that having recess is worth the lost class time. Recess gives kids the chance to exercise. At recess, many students also learn how to play and work together with other students. Some studies even show a recess break can help improve test scores.
""If we had a longer school day, we would love to have recess,"" said one school official. ""But we have more math to teach and more reading to do, and something had to go.""
Exercise helps kids stay healthy. No recess break? Don't worry! You can get fit on your own time. Kids should exercise for an hour each day, say experts. Here are some ideas to get you moving:

, or dug up, fossils of the worlds largest snake. Colombia is a country in South America.
(ty-ta-noh-BOH-uh sai-rah-HOH-nen-siss). It weighed 2,500 pounds and measured about 42 feet long. Its
, or huge, body was at least 3 feet wide.
This thing ... [was] longer than a city bus, says Jack Conrad, a snake expert.
lived between 58 million and 60 million years ago, experts believe. So far, a team of scientists has found about 180 fossils from more than 20
snakes. The fossils include backbones and ribs. The scientists plan to return to Colombia to look for more bones.
Experts also hope to learn whatand how much
ate. They think it may have hunted several types of animals, including crocodiles, large fish, and turtles.

175,765,"The 2006 Olympic Winter Games are almost here! Who will bring home the gold?
Olympic spirit is in the air! From February 10 to 26, athletes from around the world will compete at the 2006 Olympic Winter Games. Like the Summer Games, the Winter Games take place every four years. This year, they will be held in Turin, or Torino, Italy.
The first Winter Games were held in 1924. That year, athletes competed for medals in five sports. Over the years, more sports were added. This years games will include 15 sports. Some of the most popular are figure skating, snowboarding, skiing, and ice hockey.
Making it to the Winter Olympics has been Hannah Teters goal. The 19-year-old from Vermont began snowboarding at the age of 8. She is considered one of the best female snowboarders in the world.
Snowboarding is one of the newest sports at the Winter Games. It was added in 1998. Snowboarding is similar to skateboarding or surfingbut its done on snow. Riders slide down a steep slope on a snowboard and perform tricks in the air.
Teter isnt the only U.S. athlete dreaming of Olympic gold. Some other U.S. athletes with their eyes on the prize are speed skater Apolo Anton Ohno, alpine skier Bode Miller, and figure skater Michelle Kwan. They are among the 2,500 athletes representing 85 countries.
The people in Turin are busy preparing for the arrival of the athletes. The city is also getting ready for more than a million
""The opening ceremony for Torino 2006 is now only a moment away,"" says Olympic official Jean-Claude Killy. ""With the winter sports season well under way, all eyes are turning to Torino and to Italy.""
Athletes are often thought of as heroes. What makes a hero?

178,727,"As Ellen MacArthur crossed the finish line of the Vendee Globe race, she sailed right into the history books. MacArthur, aboard her sailboat called
set two world's records in the around-the-world race.
The Vendee Globe is one of the world's toughest sailing races. Sailors must race nonstop around the world. And if that were not hard enough, all sailors must sail
Ellen MacArthur, a 24-year-old Englishwoman, finished second in the 2000 Vendee Globe. She sailed about 31,000 miles in 94 days, 4 hours, 25 minutes, 40 seconds. MacArthur finished only one day after the winner, Frenchman Michel Desjoyeaux.
Despite finishing in second place, MacArthur made good enough time to win two titles--the fastest woman and the youngest person ever to finish a solo around-the-world race.
During the Vendee Globe voyage, MacArthur had to make repairs to her boat without losing time. She averaged ten naps a day, sleeping a total of just six hours a day. Once she awoke just in time to steer away from a giant iceberg looming 50 feet in front of her!
Those difficulties were nothing compared to the one MacArthur said she faced at the finish line. ""My life is here, home is on board
I just adore being at sea, and to suddenly stop this will not be easy at all,"" she said.

179,1,"People who live in poverty do not have enough money, food, and medical care for a healthy life.
Fifteen-year-old Matthew Hector called on a crowd of20,000 people to fight world poverty. He was one of many people who spoke out at a recent
, or a large meeting, in London, England. ""We believe the world should be fair so that everyone has the same opportunity to ... have a good life,"" he said.
The rally launched a worldwide campaign called ""Make Poverty History."" The goal is to challenge world leaders to end poverty.
do not have enough money, food, and medical care for a healthy life. More than a billion people around the world are poor. About half of those people are children. Many of the poorest countries are in Africa.
One of the most famous speakers at the rally was Nelson Mandela. He is the former president of South Africa. Mandela urged people to help those in need. He said, ""While [there is poverty], there is no true freedom.""
Many of the world's poorest countries are in Africa.
If you wanted to inspire others to help poor countries, what would you say?
In his speech, Mandela challenged world leaders not to ""look the other way"" from the problem of poverty. In July, leaders of the eight wealthiest countries, including the United States, will meet in Scotland. They have promised to take action to end poverty. Mandela and other supporters of ""Make Poverty History"" hope that world leaders keep their promise.

180,459,"Do your pets fight like cats and dogs? You may be surprised to learn that these animals are often furry friends.
A team of researchers determined that cats and dogs living under the same roof get along most of the time.
170 households. To survey is to collect information. All of the households had a dog and a cat as pets. More than half of the pet owners reported that their pets seem to get along.
Experts say the animals are more likely to get along if they meet when they are young. This is good news for people who would like to keep both a cat and a dog, researcher Joseph Terkel told

185,623,"Theres a bookworm in the White House. Its U.S. President Barack Obama. He wrote a new book for kids. The book is called
Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.
The picture book goes on sale November 16. It tells the stories of 13 important Americans, including baseball player Jackie Robinson. He was the first African American to play major-league baseball since the late 1800s.
Obama was excited to pen the book. Its a great
for me to speak to young people, he said in an interview on Sirius XM Radio. An opportunity is a chance.
The inspiring tales already have two young fansObamas daughters, Malia and Sasha. There is a drawing of them walking their dog on the cover. The girls were among the first people to review the book. I asked them to read it, [to] see what they thought, Obama says. They approved!
President Barack Obama and his daughters walk the family dog.

186,635,"The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center is located in Cincinnati, Ohio.
One at a time, visitors take turns crawling into a wooden box at a new museum in Cincinnati, Ohio. The museum is the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. The box is like the one in which a slave hid in the 1840s so he could be shipped to freedom.
The museum teaches visitors about the Underground Railroad. It was not actually a real railroad. It was a secret system of routes used to help slaves in the South escape to freedom in the North.
Most runaway slaves traveled hundreds of miles. They hid during the day and fled at night. Along the way, they stopped at safe homes called
. People at the stations provided slaves with food, clothing, and a place to rest.
""The Underground Railroad wouldn't have existed if it weren't for brave people who took a risk to stand up for freedom,"" museum official Stephen DeVillez told

Wade Robson lent his fancy footwork to the film, which hits theaters November 18. A choreographer creates the steps in a dance.
student reporter Bella Fletcher recently spoke with the man behind Mumbles moves.
Bella Fletcher: How do you create dances for animated characters?
You actually get to work with human dancers. ... The movements that the humans are doing are [used to create the movements of] the animated characters.
BF: What was the hardest part of making the dances?
There are always hundreds and hundreds of penguins [in a scene], but we only have 15 dancers. ... So I would have to imagine how a scene [would] look with hundreds and hundreds of penguins, but just create it with 15 [people].
[I like] Atticus, whos ... a chubby little rapper penguin. ... I actually played Atticus in the [first dance scene].

191,376,"Hair, beware! Youre sitting at your desk, when suddenly your head feels itchy. Its under attack from tiny insects that cause big troublehead lice!
Each year, 6 million to 12 million Americans get lice. In fact, that is the number-one reason that kids miss school. Now the National Parent Teacher Association is fighting back against the little pests. The group has started a national program called Keeping Our Kids Lice Free.
Lice can spread very quickly from one person to another. The bugs cant jump or fly, but they can crawl. Follow these tips from health experts to keep lice from bugging you:
Avoid touching your head to someone elses head.
Dont share personal items such as hats, combs, and headphones.
Use your own sleeping bag and pillow on sleepovers.
Normally, sharing with your friends is nicebut not if you are sharing lice!

192,3,"A Look Back at a Leader: Martin Luther King Jr. 
On January 17, Americans will celebrate the life and work of Martin Luther King Jr.
""A day on, not a day off!"" Since 1994, that has been the slogan for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Many students have the holiday off from school. Kids at Greene Street Friends School in Pennsylvania, however, will make it ""a day on.""
The kids will sew quilts for needy infants and pack meals for elderly people. ""I like that I'm helping people,"" 10-year-old Justine Baird told
The students at Greene Street Friends School are among the thousands of kids across the country who will take part in community service projects. The projects honor King's memory.
A Look Back at a Leader: Martin Luther King Jr.
Delivered the ""I Have a Dream"" speech in Washington, D.C.
Martin Luther King Jr. Day first observed as a national holiday
King was an African American leader who devoted his life to improving the lives of others. He once said, ""Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve.""
When King was growing up in the South, African Americans did not have the same rights as white people. African Americans had to live in separate neighborhoods and send their kids to separate schools. Some African Americans were not allowed to vote.
Many Americans felt that such laws were unfair. When King was older, he gave speeches and led peaceful marches to try to change those laws. As a result of King's work,

193,503,"Do you spend a lot of time watching television or surfing the Internet? While you may be having fun, you may also be missing out on something else-staying fit!
The American Heart Association (AHA) recently reported that many U.S. kids are not getting enough exercise. The AHA recommends kids get at least 30 minutes of exercise three to four times each week.
The AHA report says that about 15 out of every 100 kids ages 6 to 11 are overweight. Being overweight can lead to health problems like heart disease and diabetes later in life.
To help kids stay fit and have fun, some schools are adding a new twist to gym class. In some elementary schools, students are really climbing the walls-indoor rock-climbing walls! Other schools are offering activities such as dancing, in-line skating, and kite flying.
Teachers want kids to develop good fitness habits that will last a lifetime. ""We're hoping that students find activities that they enjoy doing and that they'll continue doing for the rest of their lives,"" said gym teacher Reid Chase.
Many schools are teaching kids the importance of exercise both inside and out of school. So, what are you waiting for? Dance. Run. Jump rope. Join a sports team. Find the activities that you enjoy most and get moving!

196,492,"You turn on the TV and see your favorite cartoon character. But wait a minutethats not a show; it is a commercial for junk food!
Cartoon characters are being used to sell junk foods on TV. How does that affect you?
Thats wrong, says the Institute of Medicine, which advises the nation on health issues. The group says that kid-friendly characters should promote only foods that are good for you.
The group recently reported that food ads on TV have astrong influence on what kids under the age of 12 eat. ""Our eating habits and preferences form early in our lives,"" the groups spokesperson, Christine Stencel, told
Advertisers know kids have spending power. ""American kids spend about $200 billion each year. Foods high in sugar and fat are among the top 10 items,"" says Stencel. ""Kids also influence what their parents buy.""

A calorie is a measure of the amount of energy a food can provide. The body needs food as fuel. However, people gain weight when they take in more calories than they use up through activity.
Millions of people in the United States are
or severely overweight. Being overweight can lead to serious health problems.
""The committee thinks it is time people should take steps to reduce the problem of obesity,"" says Stencel. ""That includes making changes in what foods are marketed to kids and how they are promoted.""
Foods that are high in nutrition help people stay healthy. Good choices:
foods with whole grains, such as whole-wheat breads and pastas
a variety of fruits and vegetables in a rainbow of colors
calcium-rich, nonfat or low-fat foods, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt
What are some other ways advertisers get kids to buy their products?

197,99,"Aibo is a robot. It is a dog that can bark and wag its tail!
Imagine it is the year 2014. After dinner, your robot clears the table and loads the dishwasher. Another robot tells jokes to make you laugh.
Does that sound like a scene out of a movie? It's not! Scientists predict robots will be very common in homes across the country in the near future.
Many robots are already being sold today. Sony's QRIO and iRobot's Roomba are two of these robots. QRIO is a humanlike robot that can talk, walk, jump, and dance. Roomba is a robotic vacuum cleaner.
Many companies are working to create even more-advanced robots. Their goal is to make life easier for people in the future. Until then, you will just have to clean your own room!

Pennies are not small change to Sylvester Neal. The Washington man is on his way to collecting a million of them. ""Sometimes I walk with my head down looking for pennies"" Neal, 62, told

202,186,"Should Native American names and mascots be allowed in college sports?
Football fans cheer as a student rides a horse down the field. The student is dressed as Chief Osceola, a famous leader of the Seminole tribe. In one hand, the student holds a flaming spear. As he throws it into the ground, the crowd goes wild.
Some find Florida State University's mascot doesn't respect the real Chief Osceola.
That tradition takes place before every football game at Florida State University (FSU). The NCAA recently tried to end the tradition. The NCAA is the group that oversees college sports. It made a rule that sports teams can't use Native American names or
after the regular season. A mascot is a symbol that represents a sports team.
Some members of the Seminole tribe think the rule is unfair. They believe that FSU honors their traditions. Tribe members designed the mascot's costume, they say. They add that the student chosen as the mascot has to study the tribe's culture to earn that honor.
The NCAA decided to let FSU keep its tradition. However, the rule remains for at least 17 other schools.
Native Americans are the people who first settled in North and South America. Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today. Each tribe has its own history and culture.
Other Native Americans say that teams that use Native American mascots do not honor their culture. They think using those mascots supports
A stereotype is an idea that a group of people is alike in a certain way. It may be untrue or only partly true.
""It is not respectful to parade around in war paint and feathers,"" John Sanchez told
. Sanchez is a member of the Yaqui/Apache tribe. ""This is not honoring; it is making fun of.""

204,14,"Afraid of heights? Stay away from the Burj Khalifa (BERJ kuh-LEE-fuh)! It is now the tallest building in the world.
The tall tower opened with a big show of fireworks on January 4. It is located in the United Arab Emirates. That is in the Middle East.
Rising 2,716 feet above the ground, Burj Khalifa is more than half a mile high. Thats almost 18 times taller than the Statue of Liberty! The tower has about 160 floors. Fifty-seven elevators
or carry, visitors up. The building includes a hotel and four swimming pools.
The giant skyscraper towers above the rest. Until recently, Taipei 101 in Asia was the worlds tallest building. Taipei 101 is 1,667 feet tall. Thats about 1,000 feet shorter than the Burj Khalifa.
American Bill Baker works for the company that designed the Burj Khalifa. Even he is amazed by its final height. We werent sure how high we could go, he says.

205,165,"Astronauts are adding rooms to a lab in space.
Life in space is about to get a little spacier! The
is getting a makeover. The station is a lab in space where astronauts live and work.
Astronauts are adding two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a mini kitchen. The new parts were delivered by the space shuttle
. Before this, the space station had only three bedrooms and one bathroom. Astronauts have been building the space station since 1998.
delivered new parts to the International Space Station.
The new rooms will allow more astronauts to live at the space station at the same time. Having more astronauts in space could help scientists gather new information about space more quickly.
, or right now, only three astronauts can stay on the space station. Officials hope six astronauts will be able to live there at the same time by May or June.
also brought technology to the space station. A new system will turn the astronauts urine into drinking water. That might sound gross, but
, or reusing, the liquid will make sure the space station has water. Right now, water is rocketed to the space station from Earth.
Astronaut Christopher Ferguson says the same technology could be used on Earth one day. Were going to need to have these technologies in place, and this is a great way to get started.
Why do astronauts float in space? There is no
. That is a force that pulls your body toward Earth. Heres how astronauts eat, sleep, and exercise on the space station.
Astronauts put their feet in special holders to help them stay seated at the table. Food containers stick to trays with Velcro.
Astronauts can sleep standing up! Their sleeping bags are attached to the space stations walls. They strap themselves in for naps.
Astronauts stay in shape by exercising for up to two hours every day. They strap themselves to exercise bikes and treadmills.

207,239,"You were fine a moment ago. Now you're tired and achy. The school nurse takes your temperature. You have a fever. Bad news-those are all symptoms of the flu, or
Hang in there; you are not alone. This flu season started early, and the virus spread quickly. The good news is that flu season appears to have slowed down.
Some health experts say this flu season was most harmful to kids. Doctors' offices and hospitals have been flooded with sick kids.
Schools in several states have closed for ""sick days"" because so many kids had the flu. To keep the virus from spreading, many teachers have asked students to wash their hands often. School officials want to make sure healthy students don't get sick.
Along with washing your hands, what else can you do to stay healthy?
The best way to stay flu-free is to get a flu
(vak-SEEN), or shot, say experts. ""If you get the flu, don't panic. Most kids will recover just fine,"" Dr. Carol Baker of Houston, Texas, told
. ""Taking medicine to lower the fever and drinking lots of liquids will help. Plenty of rest will also help fight the nasty flu virus.""

209,10,"Railroad tracks connecting Seoul and Pyongyang should be completed in September 2001. Seoul is South Korea's capital. Pyongyang is North Korea's capital.
North Korea and South Korea are two countries in Asia. They have been officially at war for 47 years. Now, however, the countries seem to be making tracks toward peace.
South Korean workers have begun rebuilding railroad tracks that will connect South Korea's capital with North Korea's capital. When complete, the tracks will connect the cities for the first time in 50 years.
The two countries fought a war against each other from 1950 to 1953. The United States, China, and other countries also fought in the war. The war ended when North Korea and South Korea agreed to stop fighting. However, neither country signed a peace treaty. Since then, they have been enemies. Today, 2 million soldiers protect the border between North and South Korea.

211,442,"What would you get if you crossed a dinosaur, a bird, and Bugs Bunny? You might get a bucktoothed dinosaur. Scientists recently found the remains of such a dinosaur in China. The dino has birdlike wings and two large buckteeth!
Scientists say the bucktoothed dinosaur's teeth were not sharp. That is why they think the creature was most likely a plant eater. The dinosaur is related to the T. Rex. Until now, scientists thought all dinosaurs related to T. Rex were meat eaters!

212,695,"Get ready to sing Happy Birthday! On July 9, a new nation will be born.
That country may be called the Republic of South Sudan. It is in Africa. Earlier this year, southern Sudans people voted to become an
or free, country. They recently announced the results of the election.
The future nation is currently part of Sudan. That is the largest country in Africa. More than 2 million people in southern Sudan voted to
from northern Sudan. To separate is to pull apart.
The north and the south had been at war on and off for more than 50 years. Most people in the north follow a religion called Islam (iss-LAHM). People in the south practice Christianity and other religions. Some of the fighting happened because Sudans government tried to make people in the south follow Islams rules.
Soon, southern Sudans people will govern themselves. It wont be easy, world leaders say. The area is very poor. More than half of southern Sudans population lives on less than $1 a day. Many people do not have access to clean water.
A man works on an oil rig in southern Sudan.
The young nation will be rich in one thing, thoughoil. Southern Sudan produces about 375,000 barrels of oil a day. The south used to share its oil money with the north. Now it will keep the money and pay the north to help move the oil.
Southern Sudans leaders are hopeful about the future. We are a ... nation that has just been born, says official Pagan Amum. And like a human baby, we are
[or weak] but have the [chance] to become great.
247,105 square miles (slightly smaller than Texas)
7.5 million to 9.7 million people (about the same size as New Jersey)
What challenges might southern Sudan face? Why?

214,661,"Yuck! A health and safety group recently tested school surfaces for germs and found millions! Drinking fountains had the most germs. A cafeteria tray had more germs than a toilet seat! The testers also found germs lurking on desks and computer keyboards.
Health experts say drinking fountains would have fewer germs if they were cleaned more often.
Kids miss 22 million days of school each year because of colds caught from germs. That number would be much lower if kids would just wash their hands, say health experts.
Not all germs are harmful, but some can make kids sick. ""When you share things in a classroom, you increase the chance that you might get sick,"" the health and safety groups spokesperson, Jerry Bowman, told
""Since we are right in the middle of cold and flu season, we have to be extra careful to wash our hands and cover up [our] coughs.""

215,26,"Two whale sharks named Ralph and Norton are quickly becoming friends. They live in a huge tank at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta.
is a building where sea creatures are kept so the public can view them. The Georgia Aquarium opened in November and is the largest in the world. It holds 8 million gallons of water and more than 100,000 sea creatures!
The whale sharks live in the largest tank at the aquarium. That is because whale sharks are the biggest fish in the world. They can grow up to 40 feet long! The aquarium also has hands-on exhibits.

is a spring that shoots water into the air.
An illustration of a geyser on Saturn's moon Enceladus.
Scientists are excited by the news. Water is a key ingredient for life. Life may exist in water beneath the icy surface of Enceladus, say scientists. However, dont expect to hear about the discovery of little green aliens. The forms of life most likely to be found are
A microbe is a simple life-form that can be seen only under a microscope.
The findings are based on images from the spacecraft
which has been studying Saturn and its moons since 2004. The images show geysers shooting water hundreds of miles above the surface of Enceladus.
For now, scientists will have to be patient.
wont get another close-up view of Enceladus until 2008.

217,462,"Dig this! Archaeologists are preparing to dig up an
, or very old, wooden boat in Egypt. An archaeologist is a scientist who digs up old objects and studies them to learn about the past. Egypt is a country in Africa.
Scientists plan to dig up another Egyptian boat like this one.
The boat is 4,500 years old. It is buried next to the Great Pyramid. That is the largest pyramid in Egypt. Egyptians built the Pyramids thousands of years ago. They are burial places for
The boat is the second one found near the Great Pyramid. Archaeologists dug up the first boat in 1954. It is on display in a museum near the Pyramids.
Experts will begin removing the buried boat this fall to study it. They hope to learn how the Egyptians used the boats.

218,615,"Are green schools a key to smarter, healthier students?
The Willow School in Gladstone, N.J., is made of more than just bricks. The insides of the walls include denim from blue jeans! Other parts of the building are made of wood from an old toothpick factory.
. That is a school built in a special way to save energy and resources. Green schools also provide a healthy environment for students. Some green schools have rooftop gardens to grow foods for their cafeterias. Others use special window shades to keep the buildings cool on hot days.
Across the United States, more schools are going green. The U.S. Green Building Council is an organization that decides whether schools are green. Representatives for the organization say they have approved about 85 green schools. About 650 more schools are waiting to be considered for green school status.
, or help, students. Some experts say that students who attend green schools are smarter and healthier. One study found that students in classrooms with natural daylight scored 25 percent higher in reading and math than students whose rooms did not have as much natural light.
Another study found that students in schools that have natural light stayed home sick three to four fewer days than kids who study in
Willow School students get plenty of natural light. Each classroom is built with a
, or a window in the roof. ""Sunlight has an impact,"" Kate Burke Walsh, head of the school, told
. ""[The students] have great energy. They're ready to learn.""
How can your school help the environment? Keep reading for some ideas.
Start a recycling program at your school. Everything in your classroom from old papers to art supplies can be recycled.
Ask your teacher if your class can plant an herb garden. The cafeteria can use the fresh herbs in school lunches.
Instead of using paper or plastic bags, pack your lunch in a container you can reuse each day. You'll throw away less trash!
In what ways might green schools help the environment?

219,739,"Two eyes peer through the thick leaves and branches of a tree. The eyes belong to a 400-pound lowland gorilla that lives in Africa's Congo Basin. That is home to the second-largest rain forest in the world.
The world's entire population of lowland gorillas live in the Congo Basin. Those creatures are among many species of endangered animals living in the rain forest.
The gorilla is one of the endangered animals living in the Congo Basin.
Scientists warn that more than half of the forest could disappear within 50 years. Some people illegally cut down trees and hunt wildlife to sell as meat. Many rain forest animals, like the lowland gorilla, are endangered because of illegal hunting.
Gorillas are plant eaters. They also like to eat insects, such as termites and ants. An adult male eats about 40 pounds of food each day!
Young gorillas love to play. They learn new skills by imitating adult gorillas.
Each gorilla has a unique nose print. Scientists can identify a gorilla by the shape of its nose.
Help is on the way for the rain forest and the animals that live there. The presidents of 10 African countries recently signed a
, or agreement, to protect the rain forest.
""The treaty is important because it shows that the governments are committed to protecting the Congo Basin,"" World Wildlife Fund (WWF) scientist Richard Carroll told
The WWF is a group that protects endangered animals and habitats. The WWF is helping Africa's governments stop illegal hunting and set up parks and protected areas for animals. ""This gives us a great opportunity to save the forest,"" said Carroll.
Do you think people should be responsible for protecting animals and habitats? Why?

220,373,"Artist Cynthia Vose believes that hats tell a story. Women have worn different hats throughout history. In honor of Womens History Month, Vose organized an art exhibit about hats. The exhibit is taking place this month at a library in Billerica, Massachusetts.
""Beyond fashion, hats represent the changing roles of women in society.""
In the 1800s, many American women wore bonnets. As women gained rights, they no longer wore hats just for fashion. Women began to wear hats for jobs that were once held by men.

221,202,"A filmmaker spies on polar bears in the Arctic.
A huge polar bear walks across the ice. Everything around it is quiet. Suddenly, a smaller bear approaches. It swings at the larger creatures chest. The two animals fall to the ground in a playful wrestling match.
Little do they know, theres a camera hidden in the snow nearby. It is capturing the bears every move. The recorder was placed there by John Downer (above). He filmed polar bears in the Arctic. That is the snowy place at the northernmost part of the world.
Downer is giving people a chance to see polar bears as they never have before. He recently shared his footage with the public. [This film helps] you ... understand what it is like to be an animal, Downer told
A polar bear trails behind a camera.
how bears act. To reveal is to show. The cameras recorded rare images, such as newborn cubs leaving a

as ice and snow. To disguise something is to make it look like something else. One recorder is called the snowball cam. It looks like a giant snowball.
Downers cameras did more than just take super shots. They also showed the dangers polar bears face. The sea ice that polar bears stand on to hunt is melting. That makes it harder for the animals to catch food in the water, scientist Geoff York told
York and other wildlife experts hope Downers film will make people want to help the creatures. We [need to act now] so polar bears still have a place to live, York says.
The United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden have land in the Arctic.
Temperatures in the Arctic can range from -76 degrees to 86 degrees Fahrenheit.
Many people who live in the Arctic are Inuit. They are
, or local, to the area. About 150,000 Inuit live there.
How can people protect polar bears and other threatened animals in the Arctic?

222,464,"Scientists find great surprises in the Great Barrier Reef.
Brightly colored fish dart in and out of the Great Barrier Reef. That is a
a continent. A coral reef is a large underwater structure full of plants and animals. Coral is made of tiny sea animals called
. When polyps die, their hard shells become part of the reef.
Scientists recently explored the worlds largest coral reef. They also looked at another reef near Australia. Their search turned up hundreds of animal species. Some of the species may have never been seen before.
Scientists used netted bags to search the reef. They spied big-clawed shrimp and worms shaped like pine trees. They also found about 130 new types of soft coral.
The researchers left behind 36 plastic houses on the ocean floor. The scientists hope the creatures will move into the houses. That will make it easier to study them.
Learning about the creatures may help people protect them. One-third of the worlds coral reefs are threatened by pollution and fishing. Its important to find out whats in the Great Barrier Reef, says scientist Patricia Hendriks. She took part in the
, or trip with a specific goal. If we dont know what is present in the first place, how are we ever going to protect it properly?
What species did scientists spy in the Great Barrier Reef? Here are a few that made a splash.
This green-banded snapping shrimp has a large claw on one side. It looks like a tiny lobster.
This Christmas tree worm rests on a coral reef. It uses its branches to breathe and eat.
The cuttlefish is a boneless animal related to squid. It has eight arms that it uses to catch food.
This gorgonian fan won the hearts of researchers. The soft coral fan stretches more than 3 feet tall.
In what ways can people help protect the Great Barrier Reef?

223,315,"Imagine that you had to play video games for homework. Does that sound too good to be true? At Prairie View Elementary in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that is exactly what is happening. Prairie View is not alone. More than 4,000 schools across the country are assigning video-game homework!
These are not ordinary video games, however. They are special educational games made for schools. At Prairie View, students borrow the games to take home. The school lends video-game systems to any student who does not already own one.
The games teach students reading, language arts, and math skills. ""[The video games] are about having fun and learning,"" said third grader Hannah Stevens. ""I'm learning to do more math than I used to and more language arts.""
Laurene Lanich, the principal at Prairie View, says students enjoy playing the video games. ""It's high interest for kids. It's very similar to typical children's video games. They can get to different levels,"" she said.
Video-game homework also helps the home-school connection, says Lanich. ""It's an opportunity for children and parents to do something together that focuses on learning.""
Mark Ganzeveld, a third-grade teacher at Prairie View, says the best thing about the games is simple: ""It helps [students] see that learning can be fun.""
Educational video games are just one way to help kids learn.
Read often! Choose a variety of reading materials.
Get organized. Use assignment pads and calendars.
Talk to your parents about your schoolwork.
What are some ways you can improve your reading and math skills?

224,779,"Each year, 17 million people try to stop smoking. However, only 1 million quit. That's why the American Cancer Society has organized The Great American Smokeout and SmokeScream.
Mark next Thursday, November 16, on your calendars and get ready to scream. That is the day of the SmokeScream. It is a day when kids across the country can scream about the dangers of smoking.
November 16 is also the day of the Great American Smokeout. The goal of the Smokeout is to get people to stop smoking for the day--and maybe forever.
The SmokeScream and the Great American Smokeout is run by the American Cancer Society. The group helps fight
by teaching people about the illness and raising money for medical research. Cancer is an illness that can cause death. Doctors say that smoking can cause cancer and other illnesses that can kill.
The lungs are parts of the body that allow a person to breathe. There is no cure for lung cancer.
About 430,000 people die each year from illnesses caused by smoking. That is more than the total number of deaths each year resulting from AIDS, drug abuse, car accidents, murders, and fires.

225,307,"Last June, photographs taken of Mars by the
spacecraft showed ditches on Mars. Scientists believe the ditches could have been made by flowing water.
Scientists think the ditches were made when water seeped from underground. There is no water on the surface now. Scientists say it probably froze or turned to a mist. No one is sure when the ditches were created. They could be as old as a million years or as young as one week.

226,241,"What did Casey Sokolovic decide to do when she learned that sea turtles were in trouble? A lot!
The student from Winterville, N.C., founded a program called Help Them LAST. That stands for Love a Sea Turtle. Casey, 11, raises money for the ocean swimmers. She does everything from selling turtle-shaped cookies to organizing fund-raising events at her school. So far, Caseys program has raised about $2,500 for a local center that cares for sea turtles.
The reptiles are at risk of losing their
or home. People overcrowd the beaches where sea turtles lay their eggs. Some of the animals are killed or
by boats. To be injured is to be hurt.
Casey is always coming up with new ways to help sea turtles. Recently, she teamed up with a coffee company to raise money for the animals. She also hopes to create a sea turtle Web site.

229,292,"Have you ever listened to the sounds that paper makes? To composer Tan Dun, paper is music. He invented instruments made of paper and wrote music to play on them.
This October, a group of fifth graders were among the first to hear musicians perform Dun's piece. The big event was held at the newly opened Walt Disney Concert Hall in California.
Dun wrote the musical piece to celebrate the art of making paper. About 2,000 years ago, the world's first fine paper was invented in China. China is the country in Asia where Dun was born.
""Using your imagination, you can find music around you, even in paper! Music is everywhere if you just look for it,"" Dun told
During the concert, musicians made sounds with the instruments in different ways. They tore, shook, hit, and even sang through the paper. Bet you didn't know paper could be so musical!

230,771,"How much weight do you carry in your backpack? In October, we asked kids to answer that question. The good news is this: Most of you are not overloaded. The average backpack weighed 7 pounds. But some weighed more than 15 pounds! Ouch!

231,653,"Sure, you've heard of horseshoes, but what about dog shoes? This spring, some hounds will be sporting new doggy footwear, but it's not a fashion statement.
About 20 police dogs in Dsseldorf, Germany, will wear blue plastic-fiber shoes when working. Germany is a country in Europe. The shoes
, or stop, the animals from being injured. Police say the dogs cut their paws on broken glass during missions. The Dsseldorf unit includes German and Belgian shepherds.
""I'm not sure they like [wearing the shoes], but they'll have to get used to it,"" says police spokesperson Andre Hartwich.
Police will train the pooches to wear the shoes so the animals are protected. ""Now we just have to teach the dogs how to tie their shoes,"" jokes Hartwich.

232,143,"Scientists are teaching whooping cranes to fly south.
Dressed in a white costume, scientist Joe Duff pretends to be a whooping crane. He may look silly, but he has an important job to do. Duff is training a flock of whooping crane chicks in Wisconsin to think he is their mother. ""It's like becoming a bird yourself,"" he told
Joe Duff is the team leader of a group called Operation Migration. Members have been teaching ""whoopers"" to
to Florida since 2001. When animals migrate, they move from one place to another.
Operation Migration workers train the young whoopers to follow very light aircraft called
. Each aircraft is flown by a pilot in a whooping crane costume. In six months, the birds will be ready to follow the aircraft and migrate to Florida for the winter.
The whooping crane is an endangered bird. Only one flock of whooping cranes lives naturally in the wild. Those birds migrate between Canada and Texas. Scientists decided that having more than one flock would keep these birds from dying out.
Whooping cranes trained by Operation Migration in the past have remembered the route. They return to Wisconsin each spring and fly back to Florida in the fall.
""We want our birds to pay attention to us for the first year, until we get them down to Florida,"" said Duff. ""After that, we hope they communicate with wild birds and become wild birds themselves.""
In October, pilots will lead the new flock of whoopers south for the winter. The migration route will take them over seven states: Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and finally Florida.
Joe Duff spends a lot of time pretending to be a whooping crane. If you could be any animal, what would you be? Why?

233,11,"A purple octopus is making a splash! It is one of 11
or types, of sea creatures scientists recently found near Canada. That is a country north of the United States. Experts say the animals may be new to science.
Researchers discovered the creatures in the Atlantic Ocean. In addition to the purple octopus, scientists found a sea star and many types of coral and sea sponges.
We found all kinds of beautiful creatures, Ellen Kenchington told
She is one of the scientists who helped find the animals.
Researchers didnt explore the ocean alone, however. An underwater robot gave them a hand. The robot can search areas of the sea that are too deep for people to visit, explains Kenchington.
She and her team are studying their findings. They want to learn more about the oceans plants and animals. Every time we discover a new species, we learn something new about our planet, she says.

234,453,"A United States vice president is a heartbeat away from the most powerful position in the world. A vice president must be ready to become president if the current president dies or cannot finish his or her term in office.

238,504,"You are playing outside when it begins to rain. The rain gets heavier. You run for cover. Thunder roars overhead. Giant streaks of lightning flash across the sky.
When people think of lightning, they generally picture it as a single bolt. However, scientists have recently reported that one flash of lightning often strikes in more than one place. It is common for lightning to fork, or split, and strike in two or more places, scientists say.
Lightning is a flow of electricity. A flash of lightning can heat the air around it to up to 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun!
When lightning heats the air around it, the air expands and makes a loud crashing sound-thunder. If you hear thunder, you are within striking distance of lightning. ""Anytime you hear thunder, you should immediately move to a safe area,"" said scientist E. Philip Krider. Safe places include a school, house, or car.
While it is unusual for people to be struck by lightning, it does happen. According to the National Weather Service, lightning causes nearly 300 injuries and 100 deaths in the United States each year.
Watching a lightning storm may be exciting, but it can also be dangerous. Just keep in mind the power of nature and watch from a safe place indoors.
Whether you are outdoors or indoors during a thunderstorm, it is important to stay safe.
Try to find shelter in a car or building.
Avoid water, high places, and open spaces.
Do not use a corded telephone. Lightning can strike phone lines.
Avoid using the sink or shower. Lightning can travel through water pipes.

239,777,"Scientists discover hundreds of plants and animals in Asia.
Talk about hide-and-seek! Scientists in Asia recently discovered more than 350 plant and animal species. The species were found in the Himalayas (hi-muh-LAY-uhss). Those are mountains in southern Asia.
One of the species has researchers hopping for joy. It is a flying frog. The bright green animal was found in India. It uses its long, webbed feet to
Another discovery is the leaf deer. It is the worlds smallest deer. Its only about 25 to 30 inches tall. Researchers found the animal in the nearby country of Myanmar.

of three other countries. A region is an area. Those countries are Bhutan, China, and Nepal.
The researchers uncovered flowers and a snake. They also found a monkey. It is the first new type of monkey to be discovered in more than 100 years.
Experts are excited about the discoveries, but they are also worried. The species
, or home, is in trouble. Loggers are cutting down trees in the Himalayas. To protect the mountains, nature groups are asking countries to guard the land from people trying to destroy it.
In the meantime, scientists are continuing to search the Himalayas for more plants and animals. There will be close to 3,000 to 5,000 species that [could] be discovered ... over the next five years, says wildlife expert Bittu Sahgal.
Heres a look at some of the plants and animals that caught scientists attention while they were studying the Himalayas.
is less than 3 feet tall. At about 25 pounds, the deer weighs as much as a medium-sized dog.

240,212,"Its the 200th anniversary of Lincolns birth.
For elementary school students in Idaho, it made cents to collect more than 300,000 pennies. Why? Abraham Lincoln appears on the coin, and the kids needed the money for a big birthday celebration in the 16th U.S. presidents honor.
Kids collect pennies and take part in class projects to remember Lincoln.
Lincoln was born 200 years ago, on Feb. 12, 1809. This month marks the
of his birth. A bicentennial is a 200th anniversary.
The students in Idaho raised money to help
, or move, a statue of Lincoln to a park near the Idaho Capitol. The project is one of hundreds of events across the country being held to celebrate Lincolns birthday.
In Washington, D.C., officials will honor Lincoln with a ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial. That is a special statue of the president. In other states, people will attend speeches and plays about the leader.
There are events being planned in all 50 states, David Early told
. He is a spokesperson for the group that has been planning the celebrations. [Lincoln] believed everyone should be treated the same.
Lincoln served as president during the Civil War (18611865). During that war, Southern states tried to break away from the country. They fought for their right to own slaves. Northern states were against owning slaves. Lincoln was also against slavery. In 1863, he signed the Emancipation Proclamation. It helped free most U.S. slaves.
Thats why third grader Morgan Squires, of Gooding, Idaho, was happy to collect pennies for the president.
[Lincoln] was a great leader, Morgan told
State Capitol, White House: Northwind; Cabin: Corbis
Abraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin in Kentucky. He moved to Illinois when he was a young man. There, he worked as a shop owner and a lawyer. Lincoln also served as a lawmaker for Illinois and the country.
In 1842, Lincoln married Mary Todd. Together they had four sons.
Lincoln became the 16th U.S. president in 1861. The Civil War started a few weeks later. Lincoln won reelection in 1864.
The war was coming to an end in April 1865. Lincoln was shot on April 14, while watching a play in Washington, D.C. He died the next day. Lincoln is buried in Springfield, Ill.
Why is it important to remember U.S. leaders of the past?

Students at the school have done yoga for more than two years. Teachers say it helps improve students' concentration and confidence. Teacher Janet Watson says yoga also helps her students deal with stress during tests. ""In between the different sections [of tests], we have them get up and do the [yoga] stretches,"" she told
Joshua, a third grader, likes the flamingo pose best. The move involves bending forward while extending one leg straight back. ""I love yoga because it is a very nice thing to do after working hard at school,"" Joshua told

. The flying robot was the first spacecraft to travel near the planet in more than 30 years.
flew within 125 miles of Mercury's surface. The spacecraft took more than 1,200 photographs of the planet. Before, scientists had pictures of less than half of Mercury's surface.
will pass the planet in October 2008 and again in September 2009. Then the robot will spend a year
the planet. To orbit is to travel in a path around an object.
Scientists hope studying Mercury will show how the planets formed. ""We really need better information on Mercury to make sure that our ideas on how the Earth and sister planets formed [are correct],"" says researcher Sean Solomon.

246,407,"This year marks the 50th anniversary of a famous decision that changed American history. It all started with a court case called
In 1951, Linda Brown from Topeka, Kansas, was in third grade. She was one of many African American kids who were forced to attend schools separate from those for white students. Linda's school was miles away from her home. She was not allowed to attend a whites-only school that was just a few blocks away.
Linda's parents and 12 other families sued the Kansas school system. The case was taken all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
On May 17, 1954, the Court ruled that it was unfair to have separate schools for black and white students.

249,742,"It has been a not-so-great pumpkin season across the United States. High temperatures and lack of rain have decreased farmers' pumpkin crops.
Tennessee is one of the top pumpkin-producing states. The temperature there often reached more than 100 degrees during the summer. The dry, hot weather also damaged pumpkin patches in other states including Maryland and Kentucky.
Pumpkin plants must produce flowers, or blooms, so pumpkins can grow. ""The lack of rainfall makes it hard for plants such as pumpkins to produce blooms,"" George Killgore of the University of Tennessee told
There is no need to cancel your Halloween plans, though. Some states will
pumpkins from other states. To import means to bring in from other places.
After all, the Great Pumpkin never lets us down. Just ask Linus!

251,31,"Chew on this! In his new movie, Dwayne Johnson plays a tooth fairy.
student reporter Isabella Pea talked with Johnson about
What will it be like to watch yourself as the tooth fairy?
Ive already seen the movie, and its awesome. Never in my wildest dreams ... did I ever think I would be flying around in a powder blue outfit with fairy wings.
What was one of the most challenging scenes?
In the movie, I take this shrinking paste. ... Everything on the movie set was 100 feet high [to make] me look like I was 6 inches [tall]. ... I had to ... climb up onto the bed and get underneath a big pillow and take out a tooth.
What advice would you give a young actor?
[or cheer on] all young people ... to get their education. Finish school, go to college ... and find something that youre passionate about, and go after it.

252,652,"Say good-bye to French fries and hello to fresh fruit. The U.S. Congress is considering new rules to make school lunches healthier.
, or lawmakers, plan to discuss the Child Nutrition Act this fall. That law, passed in 1966, requires schools to make sure lunches have enough healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables.
Health experts say Congress may chew on changes to the law. For example, legislators may ask schools to serve only low-fat milk and to use less salt in lunches.
Some schools are already on the right track. Many have traded in hot dogs for baked chicken tenders. Others serve whole-wheat bread.

253,137,"This is my pet parakeet, Polly. We live in Polling Place. Polly is a smart bird. In fact, she's so smart, she can count very high numbers. This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Keep reading to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's As Easy As One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart (below).
So what's the result? Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

. That is a sickness in which white mold-like patches grow on the bats noses, wings, and tails. It was first spotted on bats in New York in 2007. White-nose syndrome has since spread to bats in four other states.

, or strange, things. Bats like to fly at night. However, some of the sick bats have been seen taking wing in daylight.
Scientists are not sure whats killing the bats. They are on a mission to learn more. This fall they will journey into some of the bats caves. They will attach radio transmitters to many of the creatures. That will allow scientists to study their movements and body temperatures. They might learn why bats are dying.
Something is killing the bats, and we dont know what it is, scientist Susi von Oettingen told

256,392,"Scientists are developing a sticky tape based on the hairs on a gecko's foot.
Move over, Spider-Man! Now you don't have to be a comic-book superhero to creep up walls. Scientists have recently invented a powerful tape. Someday, people may be able to use it to climb walls.
To make the tape, scientists studied gecko lizards. The little lizards are great climbers. They can cling to smooth walls and hang from glass ceilings.
What is the secret to the gecko's power? A gecko has millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of its feet. The hairs create a natural force between the gecko's feet and the wall.
Scientists modeled the new tape after the feet of geckos. The tape is covered with billions of tiny plastic hairs. ""It's like Velcro,"" said one scientist.
It will be a long time before the sticky tape is ready for people to use. One scientist believes it may be ready in five years. Until then, the little lizards are still the climbing champions!

257,723,"Fifty years ago this month, four African American college students took a stand by sitting down. They tried to order food at a store lunch counter that served only white people. Workers at the store in Greensboro, North Carolina, wouldnt take the students orders. At that time, many restaurants in the South refused to serve black people.
Students sit for their rights at a lunch counter in North Carolina.
The students decided to keep coming back to the store until people of any color could eat there. Their
caught on. A protest is a public stand against something that people disagree with. Thousands of people started similar protests in other states.
The students actions worked. A few months later on July 26, 1960, the stores lunch counter opened to all people. The protest also helped pave the way for a new law in 1964. That law said businesses had to serve people of all races.
Skip Alston says its important to remember what the students achieved. He is the cofounder of the International Civil Rights Center & Museum in Greensboro. They proved that you can do whatever you set your mind to do, he says.

260,341,"For climber Erik Weihenmayer, one of the hardest parts of climbing Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world, was leaping over
. A crevasse is a deep crack in a
, a huge sheet of moving ice.
""I never got used to these 4- or 5-foot crevasses that are hundreds of feet deep,"" said Weihenmayer. ""You had to jump across them. You have to be very careful when you land.""
For most climbers, jumping over a crevasse is hard enough. But for Weihenmayer, jumping over the cracks was particularly hard because he is blind.
Last spring, Erik Weihenmayer became the first blind climber to reach the peak of Mount Everest. He was part of a team of climbers that was sponsored by the National Federation of the Blind.
Mount Everest is 29,035 feet tall and sits on the border between Nepal and China, two countries in Asia. According to many climbers, Mount Everest is one of the hardest and deadliest mountains in the world to climb because of the mountain's height.
""There are a lot of things that can happen up there. You're not ever really sure that you're going to make it,"" Weihenmayer told
. Climbers can suffer from illnesses caused by many things, including the altitude.
sickness occurs when a climber does not get enough oxygen.
The team took more than two months to complete the climb. Weihenmayer spent much of his time moving the team's supplies up the mountain to a base camp, which was located at 17,600 feet. The time spent moving gear helped Erik Weihenmayer get used to the altitude. ""You're letting your body get used to the elevation, the air, the temperature,"" Weihenmayer said.
Weihenmayer, who had already climbed several of the world's highest peaks, had help getting up Mount Everest. ""[People] would walk ahead of me with a bell,"" he said. ""I tried to stay in their footsteps. I tried to stay [close] behind them so I could hear their steps, and I stepped into those places.""
For Weihenmayer, climbing Mount Everest was the toughest but most rewarding experience of his life. When he got to the top, Weihenmayer stopped to think about what he had done.
""I thought about the ground underneath me. I felt these cool flags [at the peak] that were up there in the breeze,"" Weihenmayer said. ""I thought about my family, friends, and about where I was.""
Mount Everest is located in Asia on the border between Nepal and China
May 29, 1953: Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay of Nepal are first to reach to the peak.
May 1, 1963: James Whittaker is the first American to reach the top.
May 16, 1975: Junko Tabei of Japan is the first woman to reach the peak.
Aug. 20, 1980: Reinhold Messner of Italy is the first solo climber to reach the peak.
May 23, 2001: Temba Tsheri of Nepal is the youngest person to reach the summit.

261,735,"Kids say things on the Internet that they would never say face-to-face
When 13-year-old Katie recently went online, she couldn't believe that some classmates were making fun of her. The seventh grader from New Jersey discovered mean and hurtful comments written about her in an online Web journal.
""It was really offensive and upsetting to me because I knew everyone could see it online,"" Katie told
. ""There was nothing I could do to take it down.""
Katie's story is not unusual. She is one of the many victims of
. ""Cyberbullying is when a child torments, humiliates, or tries to frighten another child using interactive technology,"" online safety expert Parry Aftab told
Instead of teasing or picking on kids in the school yard, bullies have new territorycyberspace. The explosion in technology, such as computers, cell phones, and interactive games, gives bullies more places to do their dirty work.
Cyberbullies use e-mail, instant messages, text messages, and online journals to spread nasty rumors, post embarrassing photos, and tease other kids. Breaking into others' e-mail accounts and sending out mean messages to their buddy lists is a common practice for cyberbullies. Cyberbullies also run up other kids' cell phone bills with text messages. Some kids have even conducted online votes for the ugliest person in class.
For many kids like Katie, online bullying has become part of everyday life. Most cyberbullies are between the ages of 9 and 14. Studies show that about 55 percent of kids in grades 4 through 8 have had mean or hurtful remarks made to them online. ""Cyberbullying is a huge problem in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades,"" said Aftab.
Why is cyberbullying such a growing problem? For starters, kids spend a lot of time online at both home and at school. Nearly two-thirds of American kids have computers in their homes, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Online experts say being mean online is easier because computers give kids a sense of being
, or not being known. Kids say things on the Internet that they would never say face-to-face.
Some kids also don't realize that they're cyberbullies because they don't see the consequences of their actions. ""In face-to-face communication, we see when we've gone too far,"" she says. ""We lose all those visual cues online.""
To address the problem, more schools and communities are educating kids about online etiquette and are holding anti-bullying seminars. Aftab trains groups, called TweenAngels and TeenAngels, to become safe and responsible cybercitizens who share their knowledge with others.
TeenAngel Kendall, 12, experienced cyberbullying when kids at school blocked him out of gaming sites. His advice for dealing with a cyberbully: ""Don't be afraid to tell your parents, teachers, or whomever you trust the most.""
, or fight, cyberbullying, is to take a stand against it. ""The only way cyberbullying will stop is if kids protect each other,"" says Aftab. ""If you stand by and let someone else hurt someone, you're part of the problem. You need to be part of the solution.""
Online safety experts offer the following tips to protect yourself from cyberbullying:
Don't give out your passwords or any private information to anyone, even close friends.
Don't post any information online that you don't want others to read.
Don't answer a mean or threatening e-mail, block the person who sent you the offensive message, and tell a trusted adult. That person can help you take action.
Don't react to a mean message. Walk away from the computer and do something else that you enjoy for a few minutes.
Run your name through search engines, such as Google, to check whether there is information that you don't want on the Internet. Some search engines let you set up alerts that send you an e-mail if a new posting includes your name.
How is face-to-face communication similar to or different from sending a message by e-mail or IM?

262,699,"The star-nosed mole has earned the nickname ""motormouth"" for a good reason. Researchers discovered that it can scarf down a meal in one-quarter of a second! They believe the mole is the world's fastest-eating mammal. The strange-looking creature is found in wetlands from southeastern Canada to Georgia. The 22 fleshy rays that make up its nose help the mole feel around in the dark for its favorite mealearthworms!

263,385,"Rosa's paws are big, her nose is wet, and her coat is fluffy. But she doesn't live a dog's life. The 9-year-old shepherd is a land mine-detection dog.Rosa's nose has sniffed out some of the world's 50 million
. Land mines are explosive devices left in the ground from wars.A land mine can explode if someone touches it, killing or injuring the person. Children often mistake the land mines for toys.
Now Rosa's job is to teach U.S. children about the dangers of land mines so they can help fight the problem. I recently caught up with the clever canine at Paradise Valley Elementary School, located in Casper, Wyoming.I watched as Rosa did her job sniffing out some fake land mines. ""She's cool,"" gushed fifth grader Josh Yelton.
Rosa's visit kicked off the Children Against Land Mines Program, also known as CHAMPS. The goal of the program is to raise money to buy, train, and transport mine-sniffing dogs.Wyoming students raised $5,000 in quarters in just a few short weeks, and adults chipped in an additional $8,000. The money will help sponsor a new dog.
A dog's sense of smell and smarts make it the best land-mine locator. In fact, a team of six humans can search about 120 square feet of land in a day. A team of six dogs can search up to 3,000 square feet in a day's time.
The pooch paid for by the Wyoming students will be named Wyoming. That dog will help find buried land mines in Sri Lanka, a country off the southern coast of India.
Land mines not only injure and kill many people, but they also
, or stop, people from moving around freely. For example, the lush fields of Sri Lanka should be filled with crops. Instead, many fields lie unplanted. Farmers are afraid that mines litter their fields. Wyoming's job will be to help get rid of those land mines.
A Sri Lanka government official told me what a huge effect Wyoming and other mine-sniffing dogs will make in his country.
He said, ""The best part of the CHAMPS program will be when all the land mines have been removed.""
In what other ways do dogs help humans?

264,421,"Shaquille O'Neal is happy, and it's not because he made a free throw. The basketball star is thrilled that the National Basketball Association (NBA) brought back the leather ball on January 1.
The NBA has brought back its old ball after trying out a new ball covered in synthetic material.
For the past few months, players had to use a ball covered with a synthetic, or human-made, material. Many players, including O'Neal, complained the plasticcoated basketball was a bad decision. They said the new ball didn't bounce as well as the leather ball. The new ball also cut their hands. ""The new ball is terrible,"" O'Neal, the Miami Heat center, says.
Scientists at the University of Texas at Arlington ran experiments comparing the synthetic and leather balls. The biggest difference they found was in the way the new ball absorbs moisture.
The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture than the leather ball does. That means the synthetic ball doesn't become heavier when it comes in contact with players' sweat. It also means the synthetic ball can become slippery because moisture stays on its surface, scientist Kaushik De, who helped conduct the study, told
The return of the leather ball has many NBA players jumping for joy. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us.""

265,175,"Firefighters usually use water and chemicals to fight wildfires. But this summer, firefighter battling a wildfire near Jackson, Wyoming, fought the fire with a new weapon a chemical used in disposable diapers.
The firefighter sprayed homes that were in the fire's path with a special gel nicknamed ""green slime"". The slime, which doesn't burn, is made from the same absorbent chemicals that are used in disposable diapers.
The firefighter sprayed the gel on nearly 200 houses. Because the green slime doesn't burn, it protects the houses from the fire.
After the danger from the wildfire passed, firefighters used water to wash the slime away.

267,321,"Some people might think Geraldine Griswold is a little batty, but she doesnt mind. Griswold loves bats. In fact, she currently has about 20 of them in her home.
Griswold, who is a radio traffic reporter by day, runs a ""bat hospital"" in her Connecticut home. While you wont find these little creatures stretched out on hospital beds, you might find one or two of them snuggling up to Griswold.
At her home, Griswold cares for bats that are sick, injured, or orphaned. She has taken care of bats with injuries, such as a broken wing, as well as babies that have lost their mothers.
She has also cared for bats that were stranded in the winter because they had forgotten to travel south during the colder months. With the help of a
, or animal doctor, Griswold helps nurse the winged mammals back to health. Then she sets them free.
But Griswold is no stranger to bats. She grew up on a farm where they were a common sight. So it was no surprise how quickly she took to an orphaned baby bat she found squeaking on the ground outside her house ten years ago. She took the bat in and fed it milk from a goat on her farm.
To her delight, the little creature survived the night. Today, the bat--which she named Poppy--still lives with her. She did not release Poppy back into the wild because it identifies more with humans than with bats.
This bat lady, however, doesnt keep Poppy all to herself. Poppy is one of the winged creatures that Griswold brings with her on school visits. In fact, this Halloween she is speaking at a Connecticut school. Griswold, who teaches kids about bats, is on a mission to change their reputation.
. Many people, she says, are afraid of bats, but theyre actually gentle, shy creatures that are important to the environment.
Bats pollinate plants, spread seeds, and, most important, eat insects. ""There is no animal worldwide that eats more bugs at night than bats do,"" said Griswold, who is full of bat trivia.
However, the number of bats worldwide is in serious decline. They often lose their homes when people cut down trees.
But Griswolds message seems to be spreading. After she spoke to a Brownie troop, the members built bat houses in their town. The project turned into a community effort. ""The kids are making such a huge difference,"" she said.
There are almost a thousand species of bats worldwide. Bats come in different colors, shapes, and sizes. Some have huge ears and unusual faces. In fact, a bats face can teach you about its habits. Read on about some of these creatures.
Vampire bats can be found in Mexico, Central America, and South America. They drink blood, but its usually from cattle and horses--not people. A heat sensor on its nose helps it find blood close to the surface of its victims skin.
Egyptian fruit bats live mainly in Asia and Africa. They eat fruit and nectar. Their long noses help them locate ripe fruit. Fruit bats use their sharp teeth to chew fruit.
This bats ears are almost as long as its head and body. It uses its ears to detect insects. This bat, which is found in parts of North America, feeds mainly on moths.
(EHK-oh-loh-kay-shun) to navigate in the dark and to find insects. The bats make sounds that cant be heard by humans. A bat knows where an insect is because the bats sounds echo, or bounce off, an insect and return to the bats ears. A bat can actually hear the footsteps of a tiny mosquito!

268,462,"Where does famous TV puppet Howdy Doody belong? That was the question that a court in Hartford, Connecticut, had to answer. The court recently decided that Howdy belongs to a museum in Detroit, Michigan.
, the first children's TV show seen across the country. The show was aired between 1947 and 1960. It featured host Buffalo Bob and his sidekick puppet, Howdy Doody.
When watching the show, kids saw Howdy on their TV screens, but they never saw the man who controlled the puppet--Rufus Rose. When the show ended, Rose kept Howdy. After Rose died, his children held on to Howdy.
However, officials at the Detroit Institute of Arts said that Rose had promised to donate the puppet to the museum. Rose's family didn't want to give up the puppet, and the two sides asked a court to decide Howdy's fate.
The court decided that Rose promised to donate Howdy to the museum. Soon, adults can be kids again when they visit with their old friend Howdy Doody.

269,615,"About 66 years ago, Walt Disney was working on a new movie,
. To make the movie, he had to name all seven dwarfs. The Disney Company now says Sleepy, Dopey, and Bashful almost had different names.
Today, the names of the seven tiny miners seem perfect, but Disney had a hard time coming up with them. He thought of 50 names before he settled on the seven we know.
Some of the names Disney came up with included Scrappy, Crabby, Biggy-Wiggy, Dumpy, Gaspy, Tearful, Snappy, Helpful, Busy, Dirty, Awful, Dizzy, Shifty, and Gloomy.
It's hard to imagine Snow White or the dwarfs whistling while they worked with Dirty or Dumpy. Can you picture a dwarf named Awful or Crabby being much fun? In the end, neither could Disney, and he came up with the names you know today.

270,577,"Scientists recently confirmed that large, mysterious bones found near a river in San Jose, California, weren't those of any ordinary animal. They belonged to a Columbian mammoth, an elephant-like creature that roamed the area's grasslands between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago. Those ancient animals weighed 10 tons and stood 13 feet tall.
Columbian mammoths were found throughout the southern half of North America 2 million years ago. They lived during the mild weather between
. An ice age was a period of time when large sheets of ice covered Earth.
Similar to elephants today, Columbian mammoths are believed to have had short gray hair. They are thought to be related to woolly mammothslarge animals with shaggy coats that lived during the Ice Age. Scientists don't know why either mammoth vanished.
This find marks the most complete mammoth skeleton ever discovered in California. Scientists will study the bones to learn more about these creatures. ""This is important because it creates a record of the animals that wandered the area,"" scientist Mark Goodwin told
. ""They are an important part of California history.""

271,400,"The Nobel Prizes are presented this week in Sweden and Norway.
There are prizes, and then there are really big prizes! On December 10, winners of the Nobel Prizes will receive their
Accepting the Nobel award for work in promoting peace will be Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank. It might seem strange that someone would receive a peace prize for founding a bank. But Yunus is no ordinary banker.
In 1983, Yunus founded Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, a country in Asia. The bank gives small loans to poor villagers, especially women. The Nobel Prize committee honored Yunus because ""peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty.""
In addition to celebrating progress toward peace, the Nobel committee gives awards for achievements in other areas, such as literature, physics, chemistry, and medicine. Each of the winners receives $1.4 million, a gold medal, and a diploma.
The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway. The other Nobel Prizes are given out in Stockholm, Sweden. Both countries are in Europe.
This year, all five of the science Nobels went to Americansthe first time that has happened since 1983. Scientist Roger Kornberg won the chemistry prize for his work on how people inherit diseases. In 1959, as a 12-year-old, Roger watched his father, Arthur Kornberg, win a Nobel Prize. The Kornbergs are the sixth father-and-son pair to have won Nobel Prizes.
Although Roger was stunned by his win, his father saw it coming. ""His work has been awesome,"" says his dad.
The Nobel Prizes were the brainchild of Alfred Bernhard Nobel (18331896) of Sweden, the inventor of dynamite. At the time of his death, Nobel left $9 million to fund the prizes that bear his name. The first annual Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901. The prizes are presented each year on December 10the anniversary of Nobels death.

273,253,"Saturn is known for its rings. But scientists now say the planet has another claim to fame. It has more moons than any other planet in our solar system.
, scientists who study space, have been studying the space near Saturn. They recently discovered a dozen moons that had never been seen before, increasing the number of known moons orbiting Saturn to 30. The newly discovered moons range in size from 4 to 19 miles across.
At one time, the tiny moons were probably large rocks traveling through space. When they passed by Saturn, the planet's gravity pulled them in and captured them. The rocks have been orbiting the planet ever since. Over time, the large moons broke apart to form the smaller moons.
""We think that most of [the tiny moons] are the shattered remnants of captured moons,"" explained astronomer Brett Gladman.
Some astronomers wonder whether Saturn will hold on to its title as the moon king. Jupiter has 28 known moons. Some astronomers think they will find more undiscovered moons orbiting Jupiter, making Jupiter the moon king.
Earth's moon has a rocky surface dotted with craters
Mimas looks like the Death Star from the movie Star Wars
Dione's surface is completely covered with ice and craters

274,294,"A sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
Wildlife officials in Florida have set up speed traps. The new speed traps, however, are not along highways. They are in the state's waterways.
The officials want to stop boaters from speeding in areas where manatees, or sea cows, live. Manatees are endangered mammals that live in water. Speedboats often collide with the slow-moving sea cows. Officials hope the new speed traps will slow down boaters.
Last year, boats injured or killed 78 manatees. During the first six months of this year, 48 manatees were injured or killed by boats.
State and wildlife officials blame the increase in manatee injuries and deaths on the number of boaters. ""There are more boats [on the water] now, so that's causing more [manatee] deaths,"" said Nancy Sadusky, an official of the Save the Manatee Club.

275,182,"Should the Pledge of Allegiance be banned from public schools?
If you're like most schoolkids, you've recited the Pledge of Allegiance more times than you can remember. But now students in three public school districts in California are no longer allowed to say those historic words.
A federal judge in California ruled that the Pledge of Allegiance is
because it contains the phrase ""under God."" If something does not uphold the rules of the U.S. Constitution, it is considered unconstitutional.
For years, Michael Newdow of California has fought to have the phrase removed from the pledge. He continually argues that because of the pledge's reference to God, his elementary school daughter should not have to listen to it recited daily.
Last year, the case did not make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Given the recent lower court's ruling, it is unclear whether the Supreme Court will now hear the controversial case.
Should the Pledge of Allegiance be banned from public schools because of the phrase ""under God""? Discuss in class. Then cast your vote at
According to the federal court, the phrase ""under God"" suggests that the government supports religion. That violates the First Amendment to the Constitution. That amendment guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and press. People often refer to part of this amendment as the separation of church and state.
Newdow provides the reverse argument for removing the reference to God from the pledge. He says, ""Imagine you send your kids to school every day, and the teachers [make] them stand up and say, ""We are one nation that denies God exists.""
The pledge represents a way for many Americans to express their
, or loyalty to the country. ""Our school board has long supported [the pledge] as an appropriate patriotic exercise for willing students,"" says Steven Ladd, the superintendent from one of the California school districts affected by the ruling.
Others point out that the Declaration of Independence and the national anthem contain religious references. Critics of the ruling argue that saying the pledge is
. Kids don't have to say the pledge if they don't want to participate.

276,771,"A new study shows that the amount of time you sleep affects how well you do in school.
tell when you stay up late? Think again.
During a recent sleep study, teachers noticed that kids had more difficulty learning when they stayed up an hour or two past their bedtime. ""Getting [to sleep] on time is as important as getting [to school] on time,"" says Gahan Fallone, who helped conduct the research.
Scientists followed 74 students ages 6 to 12 from Rhode Island and Massachusetts for the three-week study. During that time, the researchers tracked the sleeping habits of students. Teachers, who werent told how long the kids slept or which week they stayed up late, rated the students performance in school.
The teachers could tell when students didnt get enough sleep. Students who slept eight hours or less a night were more forgetful, had more trouble paying attention, and had difficulty learning new lessons.
How much sleep do kids need? Health experts from the National Sleep Foundation recommend that students ages 7 to 10 get at least 10 hours of sleep a night.
Teachers and principals have long been aware that students who get enough sleep generally perform better in school, which leads to better grades. At Potter- Burns Elementary in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, school officials send notes home to parents asking them to make sure kids get enough shut-eye before the yearlyachievement tests. ""Definitely there is impact on students performances if they come to school tired,"" says the schools principal, John Haidemenos.

277,198,"""May I stay up just a little longer?"" That's the cry heard from kids every night in many U.S. households. That's because most kids don't want to go to bed.
Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks.
The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8? hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said.
Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said.
In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should.
Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school.
Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep.
Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' ""
If a kid loses one hour of sleep a night, how many hours of sleep does he or she lose in a week? A month? A year?

278,101,"Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two major candidates for president stand on important issues. This week's issue is the
Bush wants to reduce the amount of air pollution from power plants.
President Bush says that he has worked to reduce pollution. Earlier this year, he announced a plan to improve the country's water quality.
To help Americans breathe cleaner air, Bush started the Clear Skies program. It is designed to reduce the amount of air pollution from power plants.

An expedition to the Arctic has uncovered a giant sea reptile.
Scientists have discovered the skeleton of a sea monster near the North Pole. Researchers from Oslo, Norway, recently announced that they have found a complete
skeleton. A plesiosaur is a prehistoric marine reptile about the size of a bus. The recent discovery is believed to be the first complete plesiosaur skeleton ever found.
during an expedition to the Svalbard islands, 300 miles off the coast of Norway, in August. Fossils are the remains of plants or animals from millions of years ago preserved in rock.
The meat-eating reptile lived more than 150 million years ago, during the Jurassic Period. Some scientists call it the
of the sea. ""We think it is [a 26-foot] skeleton from snout to tail,"" team leader Jorn Hurum told
He described the plesiosaurs long teeth as being ""the size of bananas.""
The expedition also uncovered fossils from 27 other marine reptiles on the islands. ""We hope to find lots more in the years to come,"" says Hurum. ""We have just scratched the surface.""

280,778,"A new tennis star has arrived. Andy Roddick claimed his championship trophy in early September. He won his first major tennis tournament at the U.S. Open in New York, defeating Spain's Juan Carlos Ferrero.
""It hasn't sunk in,"" said an emotional Roddick after the match. ""I came to this tournament so many times as a little kid and watched from way up there [in the stands].
Along with his trophy, Roddick accepted a $1 million winning prize. Because of this championship win, Roddick has risen to number two in the tennis rankings, which is a career record for him. However, Ferrero, who won the French Open, still holds the top slot.
The four Grand Slam tournament in tennis are the Australian Open, Wimbledon the French Open, and the U.S. Open.
With Roddick's win, the torch has been passed to a new American tennis generation. Just days before Roddick's victory, American tennis star Pete Sampras announced his retirement from the sport. Sampras won the U.S. Open in 2002. He was just few years younger than the 21-year-old Roddick when he took home his first U.S. Open title in 1990.
Last year, Roddick lost the U.S. Open to Sampras. For any who questioned his ability, Roddick proved that he is the new U.S. Open champion.

281,347,"With a dino-like head, this fierce ancient crocodile might have looked like the computer image (above the skull), scientists say.
Scientists have reported the discovery of a terrifying ancient sea creature. The 13-foot-long monster appears to be part crocodile and part T. rex. The creature likely roamed the Pacific Ocean about 135 million years ago, during the Age of the Dinosaurs. Scientists nicknamed the crocodile ""Godzilla,"" after the film monster.
of the skull, scientists created a computer image of Godzilla. Fossils are ancient remains of plants and animal preserved in rock. The crocs fossil was discovered in 1996 in Argentina, a country in South America. After studying the fossil for 10 years, scientists recently published their research.
Unlike other ocean crocs of the time, Godzilla had a short, high snout and a mouthful of large, jagged teeth for devouring other animals. Other crocodiles had long, thin snouts and smaller teeth. Scientists say Godzilla was a top ocean
an animal that feeds on other animals. It most likely dined on other large creatures rather than small fish. ""We are calling him the chico malobad boy of the ocean,"" says one of the researchers.

282,248,"Weekend meals for thousands of hungry U.S. children
Each Friday, 8-year-old Cody Lozano and his older sister, Cherokee, 9, carry heavy backpacks home from school. Their backpacks are not stuffed with books and supplies. Instead, they are loaded with nutritious food.
The two siblings are members of the BackPack club at Douglas Elementary School in Tyler, Texas. Before they head home on Fridays, students in the club are given backpacks stuffed with donated food for the weekend. The goal of the program is to help kids who face hunger. ""This BackPack club is great for Cherokee and Cody,"" their mother, Karen Lozano, told
""The kids dont have to go hungry.""
Cody and Cherokee are among the nearly 14 million children in the United States whose families dont have enough money to buy food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Free school meal programs help some of those kids during the week, but they still need to eat on the weekends.
Thats where the BackPack program lends a hand. ""We purchase the backpacks and the food, and volunteers [stuff] the backpacks and distribute them,"" says Robert Bush, the executive director of the East Texas Food Bank in Tyler. BackPack programs operate in 39 states to help thousands of hungry children.
Although the BackPack program is one way to help, people are looking for solutions to end
(Poverty is the state of being poor.) About 38 million Americans go hungry each year, and many of those are children. With Thanksgiving around the corner, many people will be thinking about what they can do to help.
of U.S. families cant afford enough food to eat.
children in the United States lives in poverty.

283,360,"If you listen to music, you are probably like millions of other kids--you turn up the volume when you hear your favorite song. Listening to loud music may be fun, but a government study shows it may also be dangerous.
According to the study, which was paid for by the U.S. government, more than 5 million kids, ages 6 to 19, have suffered some hearing loss. That's more than one out of every ten kids. Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss.
Amanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. ""It was assumed in the past that children wouldn't have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage,"" Niskar said.
Niskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a ""problem for children,"" she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems.
Hearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems.
For example, hearing loss ""can influence [a] child's ability to learn in the classroom,"" Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions.
Niskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead.

284,179,"""May I stay up just a little longer?"" That's the cry heard from kids every night in many U.S. households. That's because most kids don't want to go to bed.
Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks.
The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8? hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said.
Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said.
In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should.
Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school.
Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep.
Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' ""
If a kid loses one hour of sleep a night, how many hours of sleep does he or she lose in a week? A month? A year?

285,260,"A new U.S. law requires that schools provide healthier choices for students.
Public schools across the country are going on a health kick. Thanks to a new federal law, students are saying farewell to fatty foods and hello to better eating habits in school. They are also exercising more during the school day.
Its up to schools to decide how they will comply with the law. Many districts are
or requiring, that schools provide healthier choices for lunch. In Tennessee, most schools have removed sugary snacks and soft drinks from vending machines. In their place are more nutritious choices, such as granola bars, nuts, water, and juices.
In Florida, Missouri, and Texas, some schools have new rules that restrict desserts such as cupcakes and lollipops from parties. Instead, school officials are encouraging teachers and parents to provide more nutritious treats.
To get kids to exercise more, the northwestern Minnesota district of Perham Dent has added more physical activity to the school day. Many school districts are also making sure that kids have recess every day.
The goals of the new law are to promote good health and to combat
Obesity is the condition of being very overweight. Experts say the percentage of young people who are overweight has tripled since 1980. Being obese can lead to serious health problems later in life.
""We know that adults who are very overweight get sick more often and lose time at work,"" Julia Lear, the director of the Center for Health and Health Care in Schools, told
""The best thing to do is get kids in the habit of getting lots of exercise and eating healthy meals.""
The food pyramid helps people make good food choices. A rainbow of stripes represents the five food groups. The thin yellow stripe stands for fats and oil. A healthy diet consists of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and calcium-rich foods, such as milk and cheese. The climber is a reminder to be active for at least 60 minutes each day.

""The people were waving flags... and giving soldiers the thumbs-up sign,"" Krouser told

287,710,"Alhaji Babah Sawane was only 10 years old when a rebel group kidnapped him in his African country of Sierra Leone. Taken from his family, he was forced to learn how to fire a rifle. He fought in an army for the next two and a half years.
Peacekeepers from the United Nations (U.N.) helped to free Alhaji. In 2001, he addressed the U.N., asking that organization to help children around the world who are forced to fight in war zones.
""We ask this body on behalf of Sierra Leone to do all they can to bring our sad story to an end,"" he said. ""We want to be able to move about freely in all parts of the country.""
Sierra Leone is just one of an estimated 41 countries around the world that use child soldiers. While the most offenses occur in Africa and Asia, the problem also exists in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East.
Most children who become soldiers come from very poor countries. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers estimates that 300,000 children are fighting as soldiers. In some countries, boys and girls as young as 8 years old are being recruited, or called upon, to fight.
Protecting children in war and conflict zones has become a top job for the United Nations. And the U.N. has made significant progress. In a report issued in December 2002, the U.N. named 28 governments and armed groups that use children to fight their battles.
International law prohibits countries from using children who are younger than 15 years old in combat. However, several U.N. conventions condemn, or do not approve of, having anyone under 18 serve as a soldier. If a country recruits child soldiers, it is violating, or breaking the rule of, international agreements.
Why us it important for governments around the world to protect children?
The U.N. wants to save children like Alhaji Babah Sawane from suffering. The report sends a strong message to governments everywhere: They will be held accountable for their actions.

How exactly does a new word make its way into the dictionary? It takes about 10 to 20 years for a new word to become a common term used by a lot of people.
Deciding which words make the cut is the job of editors. They spend a lot of their day reading newspapers and magazines to find out what new words and phrases are popular. They also get ideas from the movies and the Internet-and even from slang usage. They enter new words into a computer system.
Noah Webster, America's first dictionary editor, began a similar system. He started putting files of words on cards in Springfield, Massachusetts. There are now millions of words on file. Talk about wordy!

289,665,"In San Francisco, baseball last season went to the dogs-- Portuguese water dogs, that is.
A team of six Portuguese water dogs helped the San Francisco Giants every time the baseball team played at home at Pacific Bell Park. The dogs are members of the Baseball Aquatic Retrieval Korps (BARK). They retrieved home run baseballs hit into nearby McCovey Cove.
BARK uses Portuguese water dogs because they are excellent swimmers. The dogs have webbed feet and use their tails as rudders. Portuguese fishermen use these swimming hounds to herd schools of fish into nets and deliver messages between ships.

290,418,"These fourth graders are switching classes like middle schoolers!
Some fourth and fifth graders are on the move. The students at Ottawa Elementary School in Buchanan, Michigan, are getting a sneak preview of middle school life. Theyre switching classesand teachersfour times a day.
So far, the program has been a big hit. ""The kids really like that theyre going to get up and move every 40 minutes,"" science teacher Sue Borr told
""They dont like sitting in the same place all day.""
Borr suggested the program, which is called team teaching. Instead of staying with one teacher all day, students go to four different classrooms, where they learn four different subjects. Those subjects are math, social studies, science, and language arts. The students begin and end the day with a homeroom teacher.
""I like it better because the teachers like what theyre teaching,"" says Ottawa fifth grader Michael Meersman. ""They have fun, and theyre not as grouchy.""
Unlike many elementary school students, these fourth and fifth graders dont leave their papers and supplies in a desk. They carry their work with them from class to class in three-ring binders and colored folders. ""Theyre really organized,"" adds Borr.
Fourth graders at Ottawa have another reason to like the program: They wont have to get used to a new teacher when school starts next September, because they will learn the same subjects from the same teachers.

291,521,"Hawaii is famous for its fiery volcanoes and rivers of lava. According to legend, those volcanoes were created by the goddess Pele, who made the fiery mountains by driving her digging stick into the ground.
Such legends are important to native Hawaiians. Today, however, ancient gods are a part of a fiery debate in this land of spirits.
Mauna Kea is an extinct, or dead, volcano on the island of Hawaii. According to an ancient Hawaiian saying, Mauna Kea ""is the astonishing mountain that stands in the calm."" These days the 13,700-foot-high peak is anything but calm.
, scientists who study space, say the mountain peak is a perfect spot to place telescopes.
Currently, scientists use 13 telescopes in a special 11,000-acre area called the Science Reserve on Mauna Kea. Using those telescopes, scientists have made several important astronomical discoveries. The scientists who use the telescopes pay a fee to the University of Hawaii, which built the observatories.
The use of the mountain for scientific research, however, is the source of a debate between scientists and some native Hawaiians. Some Hawaiians believe that the top of Mauna Kea is sacred, or an important place to their religion. They believe that the peak is the home of the snow goddess Poli'ahu.
According to officials at the Center for Hawaiian Studies, the university is making money from the site without sharing much of the money with native Hawaiians.
""We don't get a penny from Mauna Kea, and it's our land,"" said Jon Osorio, of the Center for Hawaiian Studies.
University officials say that a master plan, completed in June, addresses native Hawaiian concerns. The goals of the plan include educating people about Mauna Kea. It also states how many telescopes the university can build in the future.
According to observers, the debate will not end soon. A 1968 agreement gives the university control of the area until 2033. Until then, native Hawaiians will fight for what is theirs while scientists keep studying the skies.

293,514,"Does your puppy groove to the song ""Who Let the Dogs Out?"" Does your cat purr when you pump up the volume? Does your bunny thump to the hip-hop beat? Thanks to DogCatRadio.com, pets can rock out to a new online radio station devoted just to them.
The radio station is the pet project of record producer Adrian Martinez of Los Angeles, California. He started the station so dogs, cats, birds, and other animals can be entertained while theyre home alone. The owner of six dogs and two cats, Martinez got the idea from his cat Snickers. He noticed that Snickers was calmer when music was playing. Pets can be less lonely while they rock out to tunes from artists such as Snoop Dogg, Bow Wow, the Stray Cats, and Pet Shop Boys.

294,752,"The National Museum of the American Indian opened on September 21, 2004.
Drumbeats echoed. Songs and cheers filled the air. Spirits soared. More than 20,000 Native Americans in traditional feather headdresses and clothing gathered in Washington, D.C., in late September.
They were there to celebrate the grand opening of the National Museum of the American Indian. The new museum is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It is located on the National Mall, near the U.S. Capitol.
""[The new museum] is a living tribute to the first Americans,"" museum director W. Richard West Jr. told the crowd. West is a member of the Southern Cheyenne tribe.
Native Americans from Alaska to South America
, or came together, for the museum's opening. A six-day festival followed the opening ceremony. The festival featured Native American dancing, music, foods, and storytelling.
The museum is dedicated to the life, culture, and traditions of Native Americans. It tells the stories and struggles of tribes throughout North, South, and Central America.
Ten-year-old Jessica Lovato, from the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe in New Mexico, joined the celebration. To her, visiting the museum was ""a great learning experience!""

Native American artifacts, such as these baskets, will be on display at the National Museum of the American Indian.
A wealthy New Yorker named George Gustav Heye collected most of the new museum's items throughout the early 1900s. He was interested in Native American culture and traditions.
There are about 800,000 Native American objects included in the museum's collection. The museum plans to display about 8,000 artifacts at a time.
The 4 million people who are expected to visit each year won't just find ancient objects--although there are plenty of them to see. Officials say the new museum also teaches people about Native Americans in modern times. Along with ancient pieces, such as beadwork, pottery, and carvings, visitors will also find newer ones, such as modern art and beaded sneakers.
The museum has been a work in progress for 16 years. Twenty-four Native American tribes helped build and plan the museum. They even reviewed the traditional dishes served in the museum's caf.
Symbolism abounds in the five-story building, which is made of limestone from Minnesota. The building's curved exterior resembles rocks shaped by wind and water over thousands of years.
In honor of many types of Native American dwellings, the museum's entrance faces east, in the direction of the rising sun. Inside, an electronic welcome sign greets visitors in 150 Native American languages.
Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today, each with its own culture. Native Americans have lived in North, South, and Central America for more than 20,000 years. When European explorers first arrived in North America, they thought they had landed in the East Indies. Those are islands located near Asia. That is why the explorers called the people living in the Americas ""Indians.""
To many Native Americans, the new museum has been a long time coming. ""[It is] long overdue,"" said Lawrence Small, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
Now that it is officially open, Native Americans hope the new museum keeps their culture alive. ""This will be a good education tool for everyone that wants to learn about the Indian people,"" a Cherokee woman told
. ""Our languages are still here. Our culture is still here.""

297,219,"Have you ever closed your eyes and tried to walk from one end of a room to the other? It's hard. Now, imagine running a race with your eyes closed. That's similar to what running is like for Maria Runyan.
Runyan, age 31, is legally blind. She is the first legally blind athlete to qualify for a U.S. Olympic team. She is competing in the 1,500-meter running race in Sydney.
Runyan has had Stargardt's disease since she was 9 years old. As a result of that disease, Runyan can't see much of anything in the center of her vision.
""I never said I wanted to be the first legally blind runner to make the Olympics,"" Runyan said after making the team. ""I just wanted to be an Olympian. I don't ever see my vision as a barrier.""

298,193,"Children find open arms in new schools after Hurricane Katrina.
as she watched heavy rains and high winds rip through her hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana. The 9-year-old had been getting ready to start fourth grade. Her brother, Terren, had arranged his school supplies in his backpack to prepare for his first day of second grade. But Hurricane Katrina prevented schools in New Orleans from opening.
When New Orleans flooded, Tenisha and her family headed 350 miles west to Houston, Texas. They spent five days in a Houston hotel until a local family provided them with shelter. Now Tenisha and her brother are getting used to a new school in Houston. ""I've started making new friends already,"" Tenisha told
Tenisha and Terren are not alone. An estimated 372,000 children from Louisiana and Mississippi have found themselves in new schools, since the hurricane caused damage and flooding in those states. Schools from Maine to California have embraced students like Tenisha and Terren with hugs, smiles, and welcome signs.
Schools in Texas expect to enroll as many as 60,000 new kids. Houston schools alone enrolled almost 2,000 students in the few days following the devastating hurricane.
Two schools in Houston that had closed last spring have reopened. The two schools are now devoted entirely to
children. An evacuee is a person forced to move from a place of danger. School principals are also hiring hundreds of new teachersmany are evacuees from Louisiana and Mississippi.
Being the new kid at school is never easy. Experts say that it's even harder for children
because of the hurricane. Displaced people have been forced to flee from their homes.
Students who have left their homes have to
or get used to, new schools, teachers, and friends, say officials. Schools also play an important role in helping kids from the stricken areas cope with the disaster of Katrina.
Tenisha and Terren are adjusting well to their new schoolMacGregor Music and Science Magnet School in Houston. So far, MacGregor has accepted more than 12 displaced students. ""We want each one of the new children to feel this is home for them,"" the school's principal, Patsy Brown, told
Students at MacGregor have welcomed the new faces. ""We want to make our new classmates feel good because we know they've gone through so much,"" fourth grader James McKethen told
James's sister, third grader Tiye McKethen, agrees. ""It's cool to have new friends. And they get to have fun in a new school and stay in a safe place.""
After just two days, Tenisha and Terren were settling in at MacGregor. ""Our new school is great!"" Tenisha told
But the siblings know that life has changed. Despite the warm welcome, Terren misses playing basketball with his friends in New Orleans. Tenisha, too, misses her old teachers. What's next for the family? They will likely settle down in Texas. Tenisha says, ""I want to stay in Houston.""
I live in Desoto, a town outside Dallas, Texas. My school district has taken in roughly 188 students from New Orleans. I must hand it to the kids; they are adapting pretty fast. It is cool because our school is doing everything to make the new students feel at home. We call it ""Southern hospitality.""
I have seen many acts of kindnesswhether it's letting a kid from New Orleans go to the front of the lunch line or giving a new student a personal tour of the school.
I wonder if I could be as strong if my city went through a disaster such as Katrina. What happens to New Orleans from here, we don't know. But what we do know is that we need to appreciate our family and friends. We need to be thankful for the things that we have because we do not know what tomorrow will bring.
Christopher Ray Clark is a sixth grader from the DallasFort Worth area. He and his family have been volunteering to help Katrina evacuees.

299,582,"Tourists Put Pressure on World's Monuments and Parks
Some of the World's most important monuments and parks are being loved to death. Many sites around the world are in bad shape because of a recent sharp increase in the number of tourists worldwide. The causes of damage range from everyday wear and tear to pollution to
, or the destruction of property on purpose.
Each year, hundreds of millions of tourists visit special places around the world. In fact, according to the World Tourism Organization, by the end of this year about 668 million people will have made tourist trips. By 2020, the organization said, that number may more than double, to 1.5 billion tourists!
The problem is that a large number of visitors can damage a monument or park. The thousands of cars and buses that carry tourists to a site create air pollution. Air pollution can discolor and damage monuments made of stone and other materials. Huge numbers of tourists also cause garbage to pile up. And sometimes tourists take pieces of monuments away with them as souvenirs.
These are some of the special places that are suffering from too much attention:
. These are two of the biggest national parks in the United States. Millions of tourists each year crowd into these areas. As a result, air pollution, garbage, and other damage have marred these awesome sites.
. Located in Peru, a country in South America, Machu Picchu is the site of an ancient city in the Andes Mountains. A people called the Incas built the city almost 600 years ago for Incan royalty. Garbage tossed aside by tourists, as well as air and water pollution, are now problems at Machu Picchu.
. The Parthenon is a temple that was built almost 2,500 years ago in Athens, a city in the European country of Greece. Air pollution has pitted and discolored the marble that the beautiful building is made of.
. Located near the town of Dunhuang, in north-central China, these caves are covered with delicate paintings and carvings. However, the breath of the 300,000 visitors who pass through the 492 caves each year is damaging the artwork, which is between 700 and 1,700 years old.
To help preserve such important places, new rules are being written by organizations such as UNESCO, which is a part of the United Nations. UNESCO is working with governments worldwide to limit the number of tourists who visit some special sites.
UNESCO is also working to educate sightseers about how to avoid damaging the places they visit. As one student who works with UNESCO said, ""You have to protect the past to reach tomorrow.""
If you are visiting a monument or national park, here are a few rules the U.S. Park Service says you should always follow:
If you are camping, take your trash and leftover food out with you when you leave.
When visiting a monument, don't touch sculptures, paintings, or other artwork.
Leave any artifacts, plants, stones, or other things where they are.
If you see someone damaging a monument or throwing garbage on the ground in a park, tell a park ranger or another park official.

Scientists have identified 622 ""words,"" or repeated sounds, in the squeaking noises made by humpback whales. Scientists call the sounds ""songs,"" because many of them rhyme! On a separate sheet of paper, write what you imagine those whale songs might be about.

303,98,"Scientists are testing Columbus's bones to settle a dispute over where he is buried.
Christopher Columbus may be going on one more journey. Scientists have opened a tomb in Spain that they believe contains his bones. The bones are traveling to a laboratory in Spain for testing.
Scientists are trying to solve a mystery: Where is Christopher Columbus buried? The Dominican Republic-an island in Central America-also claims to have the remains of this famous explorer.
In 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain and arrived in North America. He made four trips altogether. Before he died in 1506, he asked to be buried on the island that is today the Dominican Republic. It is part of the area he explored on his third and fourth trips.
When Spain lost control of the island, his body was moved. Spanish officials think it was taken to the island of Cuba before possibly being moved back to Spain. However, the Dominican Republic says the Spanish travelers took the wrong remains. By testing the bones, Spanish scientists hope to get to the truth of the matter.

304,169,"According to reports, many U.S. cities are going to the rats. The number of rat sightings is up in the past year. For instance, in Boston, rat complaints are up by 40 percent. In Chicago, rat sightings are up almost 50 percent.
Rats have always lived in cities. The rodents live off food and waste that people throw away. Recently, however, rat populations have grown because many communities don't have the money to pay for rat-control programs, said Jerry Hershovitz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Such programs keep rat populations down.
Rats can carry diseases that can make people seriously ill, so controlling the rat population is important.
The solution to the rat problem is to limit their food supply, say experts. For example, people in cities should use garbage cans that rats cannot get into.

305,128,"More than 1,000 years ago, the Maya lived in part of what is now Central America and southern Mexico. They built huge pyramids and large temples. They studied astronomy and developed a calendar. Then for unknown reasons, the Maya disappeared.
Until recently, scientists didn't know what happened to the Maya. Now they may have found the answer hidden in an ancient staircase. They found the staircase in Dos Pilas, Guatemala. Dos Pilas was an ancient Maya city. Winds from a hurricane uncovered the staircase.
Scientists studied carvings on the steps. The carvings are called
, which are a kind of picture writing.
Scientists translated the hieroglyphs. The writing shows that the Maya disappeared after a brutal war.
During the long war, the people living in two Maya cities fought one another. The people of Tikal, in Guatemala, battled the people of Calakmul, in Mexico. The rulers of each city wanted to control the entire area.
Dos Pilas was located south of both cities. Dos Pilas had been founded by the ruler of Tikal as a military outpost. The brother of Tikal's ruler ran the outpost.
At one point in the war, Calakmul took control of Dos Pilas. Calakmul's warriors spared the life of the ruler of Dos Pilas, so he changed sides. He attacked and defeated his brother in Tikal.
""This was not part of a struggle between two brothers, but part of a world war,"" said historian Arthur A. Demarest.
After Dos Pilas defeated Tikal, the brutal war between Tikal and Calakmul got worse. Eventually Tikal regained its former strength and ""roared back and crushed Calakmul,"" Demarest said.
The fighting between the two cities continued for years. The constant warfare weakened both cities.
The war also weakened the Maya civilization, which began to crumble. Today, only ruins of ancient buildings remain as evidence that the Maya once ruled the area.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
A long war caused the Maya civilization to decline.

306,45,"Third grader David Bates won the Weekly Reader American Values contest. The U.S. Army and the Pentagon sponsored the contest. Nearly 14,000 kids in grades 3 through 6 entered the contest.
The contest asked kids to write an essay that answered this question: Which of seven American values-loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, or courage-is the most important in your daily life? Those seven American values are the core values of the U.S. Army.
David chose selfless service as the most important value in his life. David wrote that the other six values are part of selfless service. ""It is most important in my everyday life because it incorporates all the other values.""
David; his younger brother, Andrew; and his parents traveled from their home in Spanish Fork, Utah, to Washington, D.C., to get his prize. On November 11, they attended the Veterans Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery.
The next day, David was made honorary mayor of the Pentagon. He toured the Pentagon, where he met Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard Myers.

307,760,"It's no surprise that Wangari Maathai (wahn-GAHR-ee mah-TIE) planted a tree in her hometown in Kenya after learning that she won the Nobel Peace Prize. Kenya is a country located in East Africa.
Thanks to Maathai, many trees have taken root in Africa. Maathai was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize for saving forests and working for women's rights in Africa. She is the first African woman to win the prize. ""It's a really great surprise,"" Maathai said when she heard the good news.
The Nobel Peace Prize is one of the world's most
, or important, awards. Maathai will accept the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway, on December 10. The prize is presented each year on this date in honor of its founder's death.
The Nobel Prizes have been awarded each year since 1901. Their founder, Alfred Nobel (1833-1896), was a Swedish scientist who invented dynamite. Winners are honored with a $1.3 million award and a gold medal.
In 1977, Wangari Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement.
Judges award the Nobel Peace Prize to a person or a group working for peace. Nobel Prizes are also given for achievements in science, medicine, and literature. Those prizes are presented on December 10 as well, but in Stockholm, Sweden.
Maathai has dedicated her life to helping the environment. In 1977, she founded the Green Belt Movement. This organization has helped plant more than 30 million trees across Africa, which has suffered from the loss of forests.
The judges awarded Maathai the prize for growing more than trees. They said she has planted the seeds of peace by making sure that people have natural resources so they don't fight over them.
This year's Nobel Peace Prize recipient joins a group of well-known winners. Have you heard of any of them?

308,712,"A series of earthquakes strike the island nation.
People are recovering after a series of earthquakes rocked the Indonesian island of Sumatra in Southeast Asia. On March 6, a 6.3-magnitude quake destroyed dozens of buildings, killed at least 70 people, and injured hundreds of others. It was followed by several
or smaller earthquakes. The quakes sent people running from their homes in search of safety.
""We all just fled as quickly as we could,"" an Indonesian worker told reporters. The worker was in the seaside town of Padang when the ground began to move. Padang is just a few miles southwest of the
of the earthquake. The epicenter is the area above the underground point where the earthquake begins.
Many people living near the ocean ran for higher ground during the tremors. They feared that the earthquake would trigger giant waves similar to the devastating tsunami that hit southern Asia and eastern Africa in 2004. That disaster was caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake in the Indian Ocean off Sumatra. Fortunately, the March earthquake was not powerful enough to cause a similar disaster.
The earthquake was strong enough to topple buildings inland. The town of Solok suffered the most damage. Hospitals there ran out of beds for injured people. Cots were set up for patients being treated for cuts and broken bones.
The islands that make up Indonesia are located along the
That is an area along the edge of the Pacific Ocean where Earth's tectonic plates push against each other, often causing earthquakes and volcanoes. In parts of Indonesia, an average of five earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 5 occur each year.

309,136,"Latest Finds at La Brea Tar Pits
A saber-toothed cat leaps from behind a bush. It moves toward the side of a stream. It's a hot day, and the cat is thirsty. What the cat doesn't see is the shallow pool of liquid asphalt that is covered by a thin layer of sand. As the cat nears the stream, it steps into the sticky black asphalt.
The bones from about 2,000 saber-toothed cats have been pulled from La Brea.
Soon, all four paws are stuck in the muck, and the cat is trapped. Struggling to get free, the cat becomes covered in the asphalt. Several days pass, and the cat, still stuck in the asphalt, dies of starvation.
Now, 35,000 years later, that sandy streamside spot is known as the La Brea (BRAY-ah) tar pits in Los Angeles, California. Last month, scientists finished their annual dig at La Brea's Pit 91.
The scientists unearthed nearly 1,000 fossils and spent time studying those fossils. ""The information we captured will tell us more about what life was like in this area 35,000 years ago than we've ever known before,"" said scientist Chris Shaw. By studying the fossils pulled from the tar pits, scientists are learning more about how Earth's environment has changed through time.
Shaw has been working at the La Brea site for nearly 30 years. ""My favorite part of the job is when I'm actually in the pit digging,"" Shaw told
. He added that he has become used to being covered in dirt and asphalt. ""It's like working in a big sandbox.""
Shaw spends much of his time at the George C. Page Museum in Los Angeles overseeing the huge collection of fossils pulled from La Brea. The museum holds thousands of fossils of prehistoric animals that died in the tar pit.
Some of the animals that fell into La Brea include woolly mammoths, bison, horses, ground sloths, western camels, and llamas. Many of the fossils that have been collected are from about 25,000 to 35,000 years ago.
During that time, Earth was cooler and was just coming out of one of many ice ages.
During ice ages, when Earth's temperature cooled, great sheets of ice, called
, formed at Earth's poles and over huge areas of land.
Digging at Pit 91 has stopped until May 2001. In the meantime, Shaw and other scientists will study the many fossils they have pulled from La Brea.
After 30 years, Shaw still loves his work. ""The coolest thing about doing fieldwork,"" Shaw said, ""is realizing that the fossil you're touching has not seen the light of day for about 30,000 years.""

310,593,"Philippines hopes to set tree-planting world record.
Ready, set, plant! Nearly a million tree lovers
planted more than 500,000 trees on 2,137 miles of highway in the Philippines last month. (
means ""at the same time."") Planters were given 30 minutes to place their trees in the ground.
""This morning, we planted trees all over the
the biggest number of trees planted at one time in the history of the world,"" declared Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who took part in the planting. An archipelago is a group of islands.
The ""Green Philippine Highways"" project aims to improve air quality in the Asian nation. The Philippines has the second most polluted air among eight Southeast Asian countries polled, according to a recent study.
are substances discharged into the air from motor vehicles and factories. Emissions account for 70 percent of air pollution in the Philippines. Experts say it takes at least 10 trees to soak up the emissions from a single vehicle.
The current record for most trees planted at a single time is 300,587, set in 2005 by 16,317 people in India. Arroyo, however, is confident her countrys massive planting is in position to break the record. ""We will probably make it to the Guinness [World] Records,"" she says.

311,740,"Have you seen a 6-foot-tall statue that has red hair and red nose and is wearing a yellow outfit with big, floppy red shoes? If so, the police in Normal, Illinois, want to talk to you. They're looking for a statue of Ronald McDonald that was stolen from a McDonald's restaurant.
Police say this is the third time that the statue has been stolen in the last five years. A spokesperson for the McDonald's restaurant isn't sure how the statue was removed from the restaurant grounds. ""The guys who put the statue in [after the last time it was taken] said there was no way he was going to be taken again,"" the spokesperson said. But the installers were wrong.
The people who stole the statue may think that the theft is a prank. But they broke the law by stealing someone else's property. McDonald's wants Ronald back. The restaurant is offering a $250 reward for information on the missing statue's whereabouts.

312,733,"A group of college students has given new meaning to the words road trip. Beginning in mid-May, the students traveled from the East Coast to the West Coast aboard a bus that left the smell of fries and onion rings in its wake.
They weren't riding in an ordinary bus. They were traveling aboard a pollution-free vehicle that used recycled vegetable oil as fuel.
is the process of turning an old item into something new. Vegetable oil from cafeterias and restaurants powered the bus.
The students' college in Vermont provided about 200 gallons of vegetable oil to get the bus started. The vegetable oil had been used to fry chicken, potatoes, and other foods served in the cafeteria. As the students traveled across the country, they stopped at fast-food chains instead of gas stations to refuel the bus.
About a month later, the students completed their trek in Washington state. They hope to spread a message about protecting the environment.
Vegetable oil creates less pollution than diesel fuel, said one of the students. ""It's using some resource that was going to be thrown away and reusing it.""

As part of a contest, Leibowitz won a submarine trip to see the
. The Titanic was a passenger ship that sank on April 15, 1912, after hitting an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean.
On their wedding day, the couple boarded a small sub and traveled to the ocean floor. The sub stopped on the bow of the Titanic. Standing inside the sub, the couple were married.
Critics are not happy about the wedding. They say that the ship is a monument to a horrific event. It sank on its first voyage, killing 1,500 people.

314,200,"Scientists recently discovered three previously unknown species of mouse lemurs. The find is important, because the numbers of lemurs left in the wild is dwindling.
Scientists found the lemurs on Madagascar, an island nation off the southeast coast of Africa. Madagascar is home to more than 30 species of lemurs. Most lemurs are the size of small rodents, but some can grow to be as large as a medium-sized dog. Lemurs are usually
animals, which means they mostly sleep during the day and come out at night.
The discovery surprised scientists. ""It's incredibly rare to discover a new species of primate, let alone three new species,"" said Steven Goodman of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.
Lemurs live only in the island nations of Madagascar and Comoros.
The smallest lemur weighs about 1 ounce.
The newly discovered species live only in the rain forests along Madagascar's west coast. They weigh a few ounces and eat beetles, fruits, and plants.
All lemurs on Madagascar are in trouble, however. Scientists fear that lemurs are in danger of becoming extinct.
One threat is from people cutting down the trees in which lemurs live. The trees are being cleared to create farmland. Another threat to lemurs comes from hunters who are trapping the primates for food.
To protect lemurs and the rain forests in which they live, wildlife officials in Madagascar have set up special parks and nature reserves. Loggers and hunters cannot cut down the trees or hunt the animals in the nature reserves.
Scientists hope that the special areas are large enough to protect all the species of lemurs that are living today. Scientists are especially concerned because there may be undiscovered species that need protection. ""So many areas of Madagascar haven't been [explored],"" said Dean Gibson of the Duke University Primate Center. ""I think there are more [species] to find.""

315,302,"A Letter from First Lady Laura Bush to
On September 11, 2001, many Americans lost mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, and friends in a national tragedy. Those who knew them are feeling a great loss, and you may be feeling sorrow, fear, and confusion as well.
The feelings and thoughts that surround this tragedy are as plentiful as they are conflicting. I want to reassure you that there are many people including your family, your teachers, and your school counselors, who are there to listen to you.
September 11 changed our world. But with each story of sorrow and pain comes one of hope and courage. As we move forward, all of us have an opportunity to become better people and to learn valuable lessons about heroism, love, and compassion.
As we mourn those who died, let us remember that as Americans, we can be proud and confident that we live in a country that symbolizes freedom and opportunity to millions throughout the world. Our nation is strong, and our people resilient. We have a well-earned reputation for pulling together in the worst of times to help each other.
I send my best wishes and my hope that you will always take care of your family, friends, neighbors, and those in need.

316,548,"Brazil protects part of the Amazon rain forest.
Jaguars and anteaters in northern South America can rest easy. A section of the Amazon rain forest as big as Illinois was recently placed under government protection. The land in Brazil links to protected areas in other South American countries, including Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana.
In total, these protected forests cover nearly 58,000 square miles. The land also contains more than 25 percent of the world's
A tropical rain forest is a dense forest in a warm region that gets at least 100 inches of rainfall a year.
Environmentalists from the group Conservation International say this area of the northern Amazon has more
than all tropical forests on the planet. Biodiversity is the variety of plants and animals in an environment. The Amazon is home to more
or types, of plants and animals than any other place in the world.
Since 1970, more than 232,000 square miles of the Amazon rain forest have been destroyed. That is nearly the size of Texas! The destruction has endangered many animal species. Experts predict that the continued
or clearing of trees, at this rate would endanger the entire region by 2050.
Officials were especially concerned about preserving the forests. Part of the area is believed to contain more than half of all bird, animal, and plant species found in the Amazon. Many endangered animals, including the giant Amazon otter, make their homes there. Under the government's plan, those parts of the Amazon will be off-limits to the public.
""If any tropical rain forest on Earth remains intact a century from now, it will be this portion of [the northern Amazon],"" says Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International.
The Amazon rain forest is the world's largest tropical rain forest. It covers about 2 million square milesroughly two-thirds the size of the United States. The map shows the location of the Amazon rain forest and its newly protected areas.

317,720,"People often take trips on our nation's roads and highways. But recently, several sections of an old road went on a trip of their own.
Last month, workers in Oklahoma loaded about a dozen pieces of historic Route 66 onto trucks. Each of the 3,000-pound pieces then made a 1,400-mile trip to Washington, D.C., where they will become part of an exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
Route 66 has been called the ""Main Street of America."" It once stretched 2,400 miles, from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California. The road connected eight states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
In the 1920s, engineer Cyrus Stevens Avery of Tulsa, Oklahoma, envisioned a road connecting the Midwest and the Pacific Ocean. During the 1930s, Route 66 was completed and was soon lined with hundreds of businesses.
The road became so popular that it inspired a 1960s TV show,
, as well as a famous song, ""Get Your Kicks on Route 66.""
In the past few decades, however, Route 66 has fallen into disrepair, and parts of the old route have been dug up. Today, drivers use faster superhighways to get where they were going.
Even though fewer people drive on Route 66 now, many people still think of the road as the Main Street of America. That's why the National Museum of American History wants to include the road in its new exhibit, ""America on the Move."" The exhibit is scheduled to open in 2003.

318,422,"Toy companies are always looking for the latest toy craze. One toy maker thinks it has a jump on the competition. It has just come out with a high tech pogo stick called the Airgo.
Unlike other pogo sticks, the Airgo doesn't have squeaky springs that help kids jump up and down. Instead, it has an air pump that will give users some extra lift.
According to an official at Razor USA, which makes the toy, the newly designed pogo stick is ""really cool looking"". It has adjustable handlebars and folds down to 22 inches.
Even though the Airgo may be cool looking, safety experts say that users should always wear helmets and knee and elbow pads.

Fifth graders at Carolina International School (CIS) have a goal this Earth Dayto throw away as little trash as possible during lunch. To get their message across, students will encourage their peers to recycle. ""I celebrate Earth Day every day,"" Nirvanna Madho, 10, told
. ""I really don't throw anything away.""
Participating in a zero-waste lunch is just one of many ways students at the school in Harrisburg, North Carolina, work to better the environment. Each April, the school organizes an Earth Day event. Students rotate through stations set up across the school's 36-acre campus, which includes forests and
Wetlands are moisture-rich lowland areas such as swamps or marshes. Students take part in hands-on environmental activities from testing water quality to checking out the latest models of battery-operated cars.
This year, Earth Day at CIS kicks off a season of change. The school is preparing to go ""green"" with a major construction project, set to begin early next year. Being green means protecting the world and its resources. The school's Earthfriendly makeover will include outdoor
or sun-powered, lighting and rooftop gardens. A water recycling system and other features to protect natural resources will also be built. The lobby will include a flat-panel touch screen on which students can watch how energy is being
""It's very important to educate children about environmental issues,"" says principal Deanna Duncan. ""If we don't take care of [Earth], there isn't another one.""
CIS is just one of hundreds of schools in the United States that are going green. A
is built with recycled and environmentally friendly materials. Green schools are designed to use less energy than traditional school buildings.
The majority of the energy supply in the United States comes from the burning of
such as oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels were formed from the remains of prehistoric animals and plants. People use fossil fuels when they drive their cars, heat their homes, and power farms, factories, and cities.
Though people depend on fossil fuels, those energy sources have their drawbacks. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air and releases gases that contribute to global warmingthe gradual rise in Earth's average temperature.
Hoover Dam generates clean energy by using water to spin turbines.
Fossil fuels are gradually being used up. To conserve them, scientists are looking to
sources. Renewable energy is power from sources that can't be used up and do not pollute the environment. Water, wind, and solar power are types of renewable energy.
President George W. Bush announced an energy plan that calls on lawmakers to ensure that ecofriendly fuels are developed and made easily available to Americans. Gas is a fossil fuel used in cars, and the price to fill up a gas tank is rising. Gas costs about $3 a gallon in some parts of the United States.
At CIS, students are excited for construction to begin on their new school building. ""I think the school is going to be a lot better,"" Drew Barsody, 10, told
""I'm looking forward to seeing the solar panels.""
These wind turbines convert wind into electricity.
Here are some common environmentally friendly energy alternatives.
Solar Power: Solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat and electricity. California and Arizona are two states that use solar power. One drawback of solar power is that energy can't be collected if the sun isn't shining.
Energy produced from windmills is used to generate electricity. The amount of electricity generated from wind has been growing in recent years, tripling since 1998 in the United States. Electricity is produced from wind in 30 states, including California, Texas, and Iowa.
is one of the oldest sources of energy. Hydropower often comes from dams or waterfalls. Of all renewable energy sources, it is most often used to generate electricity. In 2004, it accounted for 7 percent of all the electricity generated in the United States.
Ethanol is a clean-burning fuel that can power cars. It is created from several sources, such as corn crops. Typically, a small amount of ethanol is combined with gasoline to fuel vehicles. That helps decrease the fuel's cost and harmful emissions.
Turning off the lights when you leave a room is one way to conserve energy. What are some other ways to save energy?

320,361,"The Heat Is On: Will Global Warming Affect Animals?
Polar bears in Alaska are having trouble catching one of their main meals--ringed seals. To get to the seals, the bears often walk across islands of ice floating in the water.
Ice throughout Alaska is melting earlier and faster in the spring than it did several years ago. So polar bears don't have as much time to catch seals before the ice melts. As a result, polar bears are catching fewer seals.
Ice along Alaska's coast is melting because the temperature is higher worldwide. In the last 100 years, Earth's temperature has risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit.
. Global warming is changing the environment worldwide. As a result, many plants and animals are being affected, say scientists from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
As temperatures rise, more and more animals will have to
, or move, in order to survive, said scientist Jay Malcolm of the WWF.
Many plants and animals that can't adjust or migrate will not survive the rise in temperature, said WWF scientists. In some areas of the world, the WWF says, as many as two in ten species of plants and animals will die out by the year 2100.
Here are some examples of how global warming is affecting some animals in North America.
The numbers on the map show where each animal can be found.
The black guillemot (GIL-uh-maht) is a bird that lives on an island off Alaska's coast. It eats Arctic cod, a fish that lives in water under ice. Rising temperatures have caused much of the ice to melt. The Arctic cod has moved to other parts of the sea where water is still covered with ice. The guillemot no longer has enough fish to eat.
The American bistort is a plant that lives in Mount Rainier National Park. The Edith's checkerspot butterfly drinks nectar from bistort flowers. The warming temperatures have caused the butterflies to hatch earlier, before the flowers bloom, so the butterflies don't have enough food right after they hatch.
Global warming is actually helping some animals.
The Mexican vole lives in areas with warm temperatures. It is spreading northward into Arizona and Colorado because of the rise in temperatures there.
For years, red fire ants lived in the warm southern part of the United States. Today, because of rising temperatures, they are spreading northward.
Scientists have learned that global warming is already affecting Earth. ""We should not expect the effects of global warming to take place 50 years in the future,"" said scientist Rafe Sagarin. ""It's happening right now.""
Scientists agree that Earth has been getting warmer for the last 100 years. They don't agree on
Gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming. Carbon dioxide in the air traps heat from the sun, causing Earth's temperature to rise.
Volcanoes and forest fires release carbon dioxide into the air. Some scientists blame the rise in temperature on volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and other natural events.
Other scientists blame human actions for the rise in temperature. They say Earth has always had volcanoes and forest fires, so why is Earth warming now? Those scientists say the carbon dioxide from automobiles and factories is causing the recent increase in global warming.

321,706,"For years, scientists have known about a huge hole in a layer of Earth's atmosphere. It's called the ozone hole. It is located above Antarctica. This year, the hole did something surprising. It split in two!
Earth's atmosphere is made of several layers. Ozone is a gas that makes up one of those layers. That layer stretches from 6 miles to 30 miles above Earth's surface.
Ozone is an important gas. It protects life on Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. Without ozone, life couldn't exist. The dangerous solar rays are called ultraviolet rays, or UV rays. UV rays can cause sunburn and skin cancer.
The pie chart shows the two most abundant gases in Earth""s atmosphere.
Scientists first noticed the ozone hole in the 1970s. Since then, each year, the hole has opened above Antarctica for a few months in the fall. The largest hole formed in 2000. It was three times larger than the United States. This year, unusually severe storms caused the hole to split, say scientists.
Cold temperatures in the atmosphere over Antarctica and chemical pollution cause the ozone hole. Chemicals that used to be in aerosol cans, air conditioners, and refrigerators made the pollution. To protect the atmosphere, people stopped using those dangerous chemicals in the mid-1990s.
Although the chemicals are no longer used, they stay in the atmosphere for a long time. Scientists say the ozone hole will continue to form for a long time. But it should start getting smaller.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
1. Ozone protects Earth from dangerous solar rays.
2. The largest ozone hole formed in 2000.

322,519,"On September 11, the foundations of some of America's most famous landmarks were reduced to rubble by terrorist attacks. But the foundations of the United States are not as fragile as those buildings. To prove that point, millions of Americans have come together to help one another.
President George W. Bush recently recognized the heroic efforts Americans have made in the wake of this tragedy. In a speech on September 18, Bush said: ""Out of our tears and sadness, we saw the best of America. We saw a great country rise up to help. Tens of millions of dollars and thousands of hours and tons of food and clothing have all been donated to help rebuild shattered lives.""
By flying flags and holding vigils, millions of Americans shared the president's sentiments. ""As Americans, there is a bond between us, no matter how far away we are from one another,"" said Karen Bogart of Pasadena, California.
In the aftermath of the attacks, thousands of heroes offered to help. Those heroes were the volunteers, firefighters, police officers, and emergency crews at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Many of those heroes traveled thousands of miles to help out at ""ground zero,"" the site of the World Trade Center collapse, in New York City. ""We've had fire departments from Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and so many other places help us,"" said New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In addition to their usual jobs, rescue workers looked for pets trapped in deserted apartments or injured in the attacks. Many people who live near the World Trade Center in New York City had to leave their apartments quickly and were not allowed to return--even for their pets.
""Sometimes the owners feel so guilty that they abandoned their pets,"" said Jennifer Olsen of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ""But it is so gratifying to see them when they reunite with their pets after all this time.""
The rescued animals included cats, dogs, birds, and even a
, a kind of lizard. To get to the gecko, named Little Dude, rescue workers had to climb stairs to the 39th floor of a building. Despite that obstacle, Little Dude was reunited with its owner.
Whether rescue workers cleared rubble, looked for and helped survivors, or retrieved lost pets, their heroic efforts made all Americans proud to be Americans. Recently, President Bush also spoke of national pride. ""As president of this great land, nothing made me more proud.""

323,465,"Overfishing is harming the world's sea life.
Troubled waters are ahead for the world's fish. Those finned creatures and shellfish, such as crabs and clams, may be a rare sight by 2048, according to a fouryear study. The study, recently published in the journal
was conducted by a team of 14 researchers in four countries.
If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
The study warns that ocean life is being wiped out because of overfishing and pollution.
Global warming (a rise in Earth's temperatures) and habitat loss are also to blame for the decline in seafood.
Although the world's sea life is in serious danger, it's not too late to reverse the problem, says the study's lead author, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. The researchers have called for measures to protect current fish populations, such as reducing large-scale fishing and pollution. ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we don't change things,"" Worm told reporters.
The loss of ocean life will cause more than just a shortage of seafood. It could spell disaster for ecosystems too. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that work together as a unit to live. A declining fish population would cause a disaster up and down the food chain. Larger animals, such as seals and dolphins, depend on fish for food. Without enough fish to eat, those animals would be in trouble.

324,257,"""A penny for your thoughts"" is something many people say to one another. Soon, however, the old saying may have to be changed to ""a nickel for your thoughts.""
Saying that a penny has ""virtually no value,"" Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona wants stores to stop using the penny. He has introduced a bill in Congress that would require stores to round prices to the nearest nickel.
Kolbe says that most people don't usually use their pennies. He says people just toss the coins aside.
Critics, however, disagree with Kolbe. They argue that if Kolbe's bill becomes law, people will pay more for many of the things they buy. The critics claim stores will round most of their prices up, not down.
The penny is the oldest currency authorized by the U.S. government. The government first minted the 1 cent coin in 1787. Since then, the U.S. Treasury Department has made more than 300 billion pennies.

326,322,"Scientists are going ape over orangutans (o-RANG-oo-tanz). They are working to help save these endangered tree dwellers before they disappear from the wild.
In recent years, the red-haired apes have found themselves out on a limb. Wildlife experts warn that they may die out, or become
, within the next 20 years. Scientists estimate that only 30,000 orangutans are left in the wild.
Today, orangutans can be found only in tropical rain forests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, in Southeast Asia. They are
creatures, which means they eat, sleep, and travel mainly in trees.
To search for food, orangutans swing from branch to branch. They like to dine on leaves, flowers, bark, and sometimes insects.
""Orangutans spend most of their time in the trees and won't cross open grounds, so the only way they can [move]... is through the trees,"" said one wildlife expert. ""We need to maintain these forest [areas] so that orangutan populations of the future have the opportunity to continue to survive.""
What is causing the numbers of orangutans to decrease at an alarming rate? The main reason is the destruction of their rain forest
Humans pose the greatest threat to orangutans for a number of reasons, say experts. People cut down trees for lumber. This illegal logging is destroying much of the animals' homes. Many countries, including the United States, buy the lumber. It is often used in shelves, picture frames, and floors.
Forest fires and farming are also to blame. As forests are cleared to make way for plantations, orangu-tans lose parts of their habitat.
In addition, orangutans have fallen victim to the recent boom in the illegal pet trade. People steal baby orangutans from the forest to sell them as pets.
To help bring these animals back from the brink of extinction, wildlife groups are working to protect orangutans and stop illegal logging. The government in the area is also involved in the effort to help orangutans. Police go into national parks to prevent illegal loggers from cutting down trees.
""Help is needed to save these amazing creatures,"" orangutan expert Cheryl Knott told
. ""If we can save the rain forest for orangutans, we can save it for other animals as well.""
The average life span for orangutans is about 50 years. Experts hope that orangutans born today will still be swinging through the trees at that age.
The orangutan got its name--which means ""person of the forest""--for a reason. Orangutans are remarkably intelligent. In the wild, scientists have spotted these clever creatures using sticks as tools to open fruit. Orangutans have been observed using large leaves as umbrellas to shelter themselves from heavy rains. Sometimes, the apes even use leaves as cups, from which they drink water.
Are there any endangered animals in the area where you live? What can people do to help them?

327,452,"Right now, 53 million kids--more kids than ever before--are in school in the United States. So many kids are now attending school that many communities don't have enough schools for all of them. To solve that problem, some communities are sending kids to school in old stores, car dealerships, and malls!
The number of kids in school is increasing. In 15 years, eight million more kids than today will attend U.S. schools. Educators wonder what to do with all those kids. ""We need to figure out where we will put these children and who will teach them,"" said Richard Riley, U.S. Secretary of Education.
Educators say 10 million additional teachers will be needed to teach those kids.
Mesa, Arizona, is typical of many communities that have more kids than school space. Mesa has 84 schools and 550 classroom trailers parked around those schools. And still there isn't enough room for all the school-age kids.
To solve its space problem, officials in Mesa are building new schools. The community is also recycling old stores into schools.
This year, 700 elementary students in Mesa are attending the new Pedro Guerrero School, which used to be a supermarket. Where families once shopped for vegetables, kids now learn reading, history, science, and math.
Cassandra Fernandez attends the new school. The fifth grader's mother, who used to shop at the store, was worried when she heard that the city planned to turn it into a school. ""I thought, how are they going to make that [store] into a school?"" she said. Cassandra's mother, however, now likes the school and all the new equipment in it.
Mesa isn't the only community that has recycled old buildings into schools. Schools in Georgia, New Jersey, Ohio, and other states are also recycling schools. Recycling old buildings into schools is less expensive and takes less time than building new schools. Recycling schools also helps the environment by leaving space for trees.

329,498,"Sixth grader Haley Small loves to wear a T-shirt, flip-flops, and pajama bottoms. But Haley doesnt wear her comfy pjs just for sleeping or lounging around the house. She wears them in publiceven to school.
Whats the appeal of pajamas? ""Part of it is because its cute, but the majority of it is because its comfortable,"" says the 11-yearold from Glen Rock, New Jersey. Haley often wears her pajamas to school because theyre more comfortable than jeansand so she can sleep an extra five minutes in the morning.
Haley isnt the only student parading around in pajamas in public. Sleepwearin plaids, stripes, and animal printsis popping up in schools across the country.
Boys are also following the trend, wearing elastic-waist or drawstring pants topped with T-shirts. Some kids are even shuffling down the school hallways in their slippers!
Pajamas may be the latest fashion trend, but they are not popular with everyone. School officials from Michigan to California have banned bedtime clothes from class. Take a look at both sides of the pj debate.
Some supporters think that school officials are dreamingkids do not need to get dressed up to learn. People who are pro pajamas say a ban limits students freedom of expression and creativity.
Haley agrees that one day she may need to dress up, but right now pajamas are fine by her. She says that school isnt a job and that wearing pajamas suits her personality. ""Im not a very dressed-up person myself,"" she adds. ""If you found me in a skirt, that would be amazing.""
Many principals and teachers say that sleepwear has no place in school. They argue that kids go to school to learn, and the casual trend
, or takes attention away, from learning. Ohio school official Gene Harris says pajamas set a bad example because students who dress for play ""want to play.""
Principal Shelly Fagenstrom from Great Falls, Montana, agrees. She has banned pajama wearing at her school. ""This isnt a sleepover,"" says Fagenstrom. ""Its school.""

330,368,"""This is George. He lived in Africa. He was a good little monkey and always very curious."" So begins the classic story of the inquisitive monkey Curious George, who leaves his jungle home to go with the man with the yellow hat. The book was first published in 1941 by H. A. and Margret Rey. Now the well-loved monkey stars in the animated movie
which opens in theaters on February 10.
Writer-and-illustrator team H. A. Rey and his wife Margret fled Paris on bicycles during World War II (1939-1945) with a handful of manuscripts. One was a story about a curious chimp. The couple eventually settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and wrote seven
tales in all. The books have been translated into 14 languages and describe the crazy adventures of George, whose curiosity often lands him in trouble. The man with the yellow hat helps George out of his various scrapes.
movie stars actor Will Ferrell as the voice of the man with the yellow hat. ""For years, Curious George has amused, entertained, and taught children around the world,"" Ferrell told
""His adventures make us laugh, and we all depend on humor in life.""

331,141,"Both George W. Bush and John Kerry support the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law.
Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two major candidates for president stand on important issues. This week's issue is
In 2002, President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act. This education law provides states with government money so they can help improve their school systems.
The law is meant to ensure that schools are doing enough to help students who are struggling learners. Bush says that the law helps students perform better in reading and math. Under the law, schools are required to measure students' progress through testing. Schools in which many students don't perform well on the tests have two years to improve. Otherwise, students have the option to transfer to different schools.
Senator Kerry voted for the No Child Left Behind Act. If elected, he will continue to support this law. However, Kerry wants the government to give states more money to enforce the education law and make sure schools receive the money they need.
In addition, Kerry proposes to increase the number of high school graduates. To do that, he plans to reduce class sizes and break up large, failing high schools. He also wants to begin a program in which college students mentor (help) middle school students plan for their futures.

332,716,"Daredevil skateboarder Danny Way, 31, jumped into the record books this summer. He became the first person in history to jump over the Great Wall of China on a skateboard.
Way made the jump using a massive ramp. He helped build the ramp near his home in California. The ramp propelled him over the wall at nearly 50 miles an houralmost as fast as a car travels!
""I was aware of the dangers and my heart was pumping in my chest the whole time, but I managed to pull it off with the help of my team,"" says Way.
Way fell on his first attempt leaping over the historic wall. On his second try, he made it over the wall, which stretches about 61 feet across. He completed the jump four times in alland even added 360-degree spins on his last three tries in front of his family and thousands of people.
More than 2,000 years old, the Great Wall of China is the largest structure ever built. Experts estimate that the wall is about 4,500 miles long.
Way has been skateboarding since he was 6 years old. Setting world records is nothing new to him. Way holds both the distance record of 79 feet and the height record of more than 23 feet for a skateboard jump.

333,403,"Scientists find the remains of an ancient village near the famous circle of stones.
Stonehenge is a mysterious monument that consists of a circle of stones. It was built about 4,600 years ago in southwestern England. Researchers recently unearthed an ancient village near Stonehenge. The village may have been home to the builders of the stone circle.
discovered the remains of close to 25 small houses about 2 miles from Stonehenge. (Archaeologists study the materials left by prehistoric peoples and their cultures.) The researchers say the village, known as Durrington Walls, was built at about the same time as Stonehenge. They
or guess, that Stonehenge was a memorial site or cemetery for the villagers. The village includes a wooden version of the stone monument.
""Clearly, this is a place that was of enormous importance,"" says British researcher Julian Thomas, who helped discover the village. He noted that both Stonehenge and Durrington Walls have avenues connecting them to the nearby Avon River. Villagers may have frequently traveled between the two sites.
Eight of the wooden houses have been
or dug up. The structures are about 14 feet long. There was evidence of bed frames along the walls and a dresser or storage unit on the wall opposite the door.
Two of the houses found by Thomas were separate from the others. They may have been the homes of community leaders. Stone tools, animal bones, arrowheads, and other
(humanmade objects) were also uncovered in the village.

Hispanic Americans have influenced food, music, and customs in the United States. Hispanic Heritage Month marks a time for Americans to celebrate the traditions and history of Hispanic people. It takes place from September 15 to October 15.
People in communities around the country will celebrate the month with festivals. Many students will recognize the month by learning about the important roles Hispanic people have played in our countrys history.
Ellen Ochoa, the first Hispanic American astronaut, told
that to understand the history of the United States, people should learn about the contributions of different groups, including Hispanic Americans.
People sometimes refer to the United States as a ""melting pot."" That phrase means that people from many different countries have settled here. People of Hispanic heritage, along with people from other cultures, help make the United States strong.
From science to sports, people of Hispanic heritage have contributed to the history of the United States. Take a look at some of these well-known people.
Dr. Novello was born in Puerto Rico. In 1990, she became the first Hispanic American to serve as the U.S. surgeon general. That is the doctor who leads our country on health issues. She worked to improve healthcare for Americans, especially children, women, and minorities.
Gary Soto is an award-winning Hispanic American author. He writes fiction and poetry for adults and children. His writing is based on his experiences growing up as a Mexican American in California. His books, including
Baseball in April and Other Stories and Taking Sides
, are popular with many young readers.
In 1990, Ellen Ochoa became the first Hispanic American woman astronaut when she was accepted into NASAs training program. Ochoa, whose fathers parents were from Mexico, flew her first space shuttle mission in 1993. Since then she has clocked more than 720 hours in flight.
Why is celebrating a variety of cultures important?

336,761,"Eleven-year-old Josh Cook from Ohio became hooked on pocket bike racing last year. Josh races his pocket bike, or mini motorcycle, on a private track. He also makes sure to wear protective gear and safety equipment, such as a helmet and heavy boots, whenever he rides.
Pocket bikes, also called pocket rockets, have found their way onto city streets. Pocket bikes are the most recent craze sweeping the country. Yet this pint-size fun is causing big trouble.
Police in cities from Los Angeles to Boston are concerned about the safety of kids riding the popular pocket bikes. At less than 2 feet tall, the mini motorcycles are low to the ground.
""The minibikes are extremely dangerous,"" Los Angeles police officer Ron Fisher told
. ""They are so low to the ground that it makes the rider invisible from a drivers viewpoint.""
The mini motorcycles, which are powered by lawn mower engines, are also noisy. They typically reach speeds between 25 and 40 miles an hour. That is about the same speed a car travels on local streets.
Although it is legal to buy the bikes, it is against the law to ride them on public streets in many states. Police have been giving tickets to illegal riders. In some cases, officers
This has some kids and parents upset. They argue that the companies selling the mini motorcycles dont inform buyers that they cant be ridden on public streets.
Fisher says the majority of pocket bike riders on the street are 9 and 10 years old. Officials in some states are working to pass laws to limit who can ride the bikes. The officials say that kids should have to wait until they have a drivers license.
Pocket bike racing has been a popular sport in Europe. It has caught on in some communities in the United States during the past few years.
Josh and other pocket bike racers agree that the mini motorcycles are not meant to be ridden on city streets. He told us that if people are interested in riding pocket bikes, they should find ""an organized race track.""

337,634,"Ann Thompson is one of the best athletes in the world. She is the captain of the U.S. Paralympic women's basketball team. She has already won five medals in earlier Paralympic games, and she is determined to win another in Sydney, Australia. Recently,
The Paralympics run from October 18 to 29.
: The Paralympics began in 1960. They parallel the Olympic Games. That's where the name comes from.
: What sports are part of the Paralympics?
: Eighteen sports are included the Paralympics. This year, we have two new sports, wheelchair rugby and sailing.
: Who can compete in the Paralympics?
: This year, 125 countries are sending 4,000 athletes, each with a physical disability.
: Besides the health benefits, sports teach many skills. First, there's the mental discipline involved with sports. You always have to concentrate, think, and plan ahead. Also, sports teach teamwork, leaderships skills, and self-confidence.
: Sports have always been a part of your life. What happened when you were 16 years old that almost ended your sports career?
: When I was younger, I was a skier. I was training in Austria when I fell and severed my spinal cord.
: How did that accident change your life?
: It didn't change anything. I never missed a beat. The accident didn't change my goals. My mind was not touched in the accident. I could do everything after the accident that I could do before it, except walk.
I'm the same person today that I was before the accident.
: Well, one thing changed. I switched sports. I'm no longer a skier. In the 1988, 1992, and 1996 Paralympics, I competed in track and field events, winning four medals. This year, I'm on the basketball team.
: What do you plan to do in Sydney?
: If you could say one thing to the kids of America, what would you tell them?
: Try. And I mean really try. If you want to do something, give it your best effort. If you find a roadblock in your path, take a detour. If you really want to do something, you can find a way to do it.

339,691,"Many kids think cell phones are cool. The portable phones come in fun colors and let you chat with friends anytime and anywhere. For many kids, owning the right cell phone is just as important as wearing the coolest sneakers or latest style of jeans.
Even though cell phones are a hot fad, some scientists are ringing an alarm about them. The scientists say that cell phones might pose a health threat.
In the United States, more than 90 million people use cell phones. Many of those people are kids. For kids, cell phones are about more than phone calls, says Anne Charlton of the University of Manchester in England. ""It's all about the cool factor,"" Charlton said. She added that a cell phone is not just about making calls, it's also a fashion statement.
Most cell phone users don't think about the health risks the phones might pose. Some scientists warn that cell phones give off radiation that might be harmful to users. One recent study shows that cell phone radiation might increase a person's chance of getting some kinds of cancer.
Other medical experts say cell phones don't pose a health threat. They point to studies that have not found any link between phone use and cancer.
Scientists say that people can protect themselves from cell phone radiation. One way is to use a headset instead of talking directly into a cell phone. Or, for an even simpler solution, people can make shorter calls.
When the first cell phones were sold, they all had the same ring. Today, most cell phones can be made to ring one of several different tones. But at least one cell phone manufacturer plans to change that.
Nokia plans to start making phones that play pop tunes when they ring. Users could choose tunes by the Spice Girls, Enrique Iglesias, Lenny Kravitz, and many other artists.
By choosing pop tunes instead of the standard ringing sound, cell phone users can program their phones to match their personalities and moods, explained a company spokesperson.

340,28,"A baby emperor penguin stays warm under its parent.
Temperatures are on the rise in Antartica. What does that mean for emperor penguins and other wildlife?
Emperor penguins and other Antarctic wildlife ""feel the heat"" as their icy home melts away.
In the hit documentary March of the Penguins,
emperor penguins make an amazing journey. They cross the vast continent of Antarctica, a frozen area that surrounds the South Pole. The penguins leave their ocean homes and cross the ice on a dangerous trip. They are blinded by blizzards and toppled over by strong winds. But each winter, they do this to lay their eggs and raise their chicks.
That cycle of life may be in trouble though. Scientists have discovered an alarming rise in temperatures around Antarctica. ""The region at the peninsula has warmed up about 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 40 to 50 years,"" Wayne Trivelpiece, a scientist who studies Antarctica, told Weekly Reader.
A recent study also shows that the ocean near the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed since the 1960s. A
is a stretch of land surrounded on three sides by water. A change in temperature could spell trouble for penguins, whales, seals, and other creatures at the South Pole.
Although researchers are certain about the increase in temperatures, they are still unsure about the cause. Many scientists blame
the gradual rise in Earths average temperature.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth. Temperatures there rarely reach above freezing. Although it is too cold for humans to permanently live there, many animals swim in the icy waters surrounding the continent. Penguins, for example, waddle across the ice and dive into the cold ocean waters in search of food. They eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called
In warmer water, however, krill have trouble surviving. ""Warming temperatures have led to a decline in sea ice,"" says Trivelpiece. ""Sea ice holds the food that krill need to survive. Without the ice, there is less food for krill and without the krill, the penguins are not surviving.""
These changes could upset the balance of the food chain and endanger larger animals and birds. A loss of penguins could leave leopard seals and whales hungry. (See
.) ""A very small change in temperature [can] completely change the whole food chain,"" says Trivelpiece.
Its not just emperor penguins and other creatures that may be in trouble. People who live thousands of miles away may be affected by melting ice.
As glaciers and sheets of ice melt, they add to the worlds sea level. When ice on land falls into the ocean and melts, it raises the water level. It is like dropping ice cubes into a glass of water. A 4-foot increase in global sea level would drown low-lying coastal areas.
The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air. Those gases collect in a layer and trap the heat from the sun. The process is called the
because the layer of gases is like the windows in a greenhouse. Too much of those gases in the air causes temperatures to rise. That is known as
Some scientists say global warming is caused by greenhouse gases in the air. Those gases are produced from
Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are used to power cars, heat homes, and create electricity.(See
Some heat from greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is necessary. Without them, Earth would be too cold to support life. But burning fossil fuels can release too much carbon dioxide into the air, which can cause temperatures to rise.
Scientists are working to persuade governments to reduce their use of greenhouse gases. Experts say that if greenhouse gases continue to gather in the air, temperatures will likely be higher by 2100 than any time in human history. ""Our research teaches us a lesson that even a small change in the environment can have a big effect,"" says Trivelpiece.
What are some ways that people can reduce their use of fossil fuels?
is a system of animals and plants in an area that depend on one another for food. At the top of the Antarctic food chain are large animals, such as whales. They eat seals, which eat penguins. Penguins munch on tiny shrimplike animals called krill. Krill eat tiny ocean plants called phytoplankton. A loss of smaller animals in the food chain could leave larger animals hungry.

Lily lives with her family in Scotland, a country in Europe. Lily's future looks bright now, but that wasn't always the case. When Lily was born, she was very sick. Doctors treated her with medicine that saved her life but left her completely deaf.
Her brother Max, now 10, and her family learned sign language to communicate with Lily. After undergoing surgery for the implant, Lily learned to speak.

342,120,"There's good news for manatees. For some time, manatees have been in danger of dying out. Now some scientists in Florida say the number of manatees has increased and the sea mammals should no longer be considered endangered.
Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.
Is it important to save manatees and other endangered plants and animals? Discuss in class and let us know at

343,232,"The Liberty Bell no longer rings today. During the move, wireless technology will be attached to the bell.
The Liberty Bell is about to get a new home. This fall, it will move from its current location at Liberty Bell Pavilion in Philadelphia to a new building down the street.
Why the change of address? It is part of improvements being made to the area where the bell now hangs.
Moving the bell, which weighs 2,080 pounds, could be tricky. Movers want to make sure that no additional harm is done to the bell's famous crack.
During the move, scientists will attach wireless technology to the bell. That technology will sound an alarm if strain from the move causes the crack to enlarge. Earlier this year, scientists conducted a test using wireless technology, and the crack did not appear to change.
""The bell is fragile because of the way it was [made],"" said one historian. The bell was built mostly of copper.
In 1752, the bell was brought to Philadelphia from England. The bell was rung to mark special events. It became a symbol of freedom in the United States. It was rung to call people to the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence on July 8, 1776. That document was signed on July 4, 1776.
This is not the first time the Liberty Bell has moved. From 1885 to 1915, the Liberty Bell traveled across the country, taking part in several World's Fair exhibits. During those years, it visited more than 400 cities and towns, including New Orleans, St. Louis, and San Francisco.
The last time the Liberty Bell changed location was in 1976.
At that time, it was taken from Independence Hall to its current nearby home. Many people consider Independence Hall the birthplace of the United States. Both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were signed there.
The Liberty Bell cracked the first time it was rung in 1752. However, the bell was rebuilt twice in its early years. The Liberty Bell cracked again sometime between 1817 and 1846. How it cracked remains a mystery. According to one report, its famous split occurred in February 1846 while it was ringing to celebrate George Washington's birthday.

345,34,"Five California condors died last summer in Arizona's arid backcountry.
A condor's wingspan is 9.5 feet across. That's about as wide as two kids lying down head to toe.
Wildlife experts say the condors did not die from the heat. Instead, the experts believe the huge birds died from lead poisoning. They say the condors had swallowed lead shotgun pellets.
, which means they eat the remains of dead animals. The condors probably ate the remains of an animal that had been shot by a hunter. As they ate the dead animal's flesh, the birds ate the deadly pellets.
If swallowed, lead can make an animal sick or cause death. Lead stops the body from making red blood cells. It can also damage an animal's organs, including the brain and liver.
The five poisoned birds were among 35 condors that have been released in Arizona since 1996. The release program has cost millions of dollars.
After the dead condors were found, wildlife experts recaptured and tested the 16 birds left in the Arizona group. All the birds were healthy and were soon released.
Members of the Peregrine Fund have been releasing and watching the condors set free in Arizona. Jeff Cilek, of the Peregrine Fund, told
that saving California condors is important. ""Condors are good for the environment. They [eat] dead animals,"" Cilek said.
California condors are among the world's largest birds. A hundred years ago, the birds were found in many parts of the United States. Today, the condor is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's list of endangered species. That means the number of California condors is so low they all could disappear someday.
Why are scavengers an important part of the food chain?
Peregrine Fund officials say there are 150 California condors left on Earth. Forty-eight of those birds are living in the wild; the rest are in zoos.

346,499,"Julie, age 9, looked serious as she described what happened to her recently while riding on the bus to school. ""My mom and I had bought these shoes that I really liked,"" Julie told
. ""But then these kids started teasing me about them. I felt embarrassed. After that, I didn't want to take the bus anymore.""
This graph comes from a survey that asked kids and parents about some of the toughest issues facing kids today.
Scenes like that take place every day at bus stops, on school buses, on school playgrounds, and in other places. A recent survey found that 55 of every 100 kids between ages 8 and 11 said bullying and teasing are a ""big problem"" for kids their age.
The survey results also show that 74 percent of kids between ages 8 and 11 said they have seen bullying in their school. The survey was conducted by Children Now, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and Nickelodeon.
of someone that takes place over a period of time,"" said Ronald Stephens. To
means to constantly pester or threaten someone. Stephens heads the National Center for School Safety, which works to prevent violence in schools.
Bullying can take many forms, such as hitting, name-calling, threatening looks, and spoken threats, Stephens said. ""Bullying can have long-term effects,"" he said, ""including the 'vigilante effect.'"" A
is a person who takes the law into his or her own hands. So if a bullied student feels a school isn't helping, that student may act out against others, he said.
Bullying may be one of the causes behind some of the recent shootings in U.S. schools, according to Stephens. Kids at Santana High School, in Santee, California, said bullying may have a part in a recent shooting there.
Santee student Charles ""Andy"" Williams, age 15, is accused of killing two boys and wounding 13 other people at Santana High School on March 5. According to schoolmates, in addition to having other personal problems, Williams had been bullied and teased.
School safety experts say everyone in a school, as well as parents, must work together to make sure no kids are disrespected or treated cruelly.
To stop bullying, some schools have organized
. A peer mediation group allows students who have problems getting along to work the problems out with the help of peers and teachers.
Other schools have sent students and teachers forms asking questions about such problems as bullying and teasing. The answers from the forms help school leaders and parents become more aware of kids' problems and figure out ways to solve them.
Finally, Stephens suggests that there are steps a student who is bullied can take. ""Make it clear that you don't like being bullied and then walk away and tell an adult,"" Stephens said.
Ronald Stephens, of the National Center for School Safety, gives these three tips to remember if you are ever bullied:
If a person is bullying you, tell the person in a firm, loud voice that you don't like what they are doing. Then...
Find an adult (teacher, parent, coach) and tell that adult what happened.

347,472,"Experts hope 2006 will be the year the world is polio-free.
Will polio be declared a disease of the past?
World health groups are fighting a war
with a crippling and sometimes deadly diseasepolio. Their efforts are paying off. Polio has been wiped out in 10 African countries, according to a recent report.
Since mid-2003, nearly 200 children in those 10 western and central African countries were
for life, but no new cases have been reported since last June. When people are paralyzed, they are unable to move different parts of their bodies and may be unable to walk.
The disease raced across Africa and into Asia after people in Nigeria refused the polio
mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think well get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told
She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria.""
Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly
disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havent been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims.
With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world. On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government approved the use of a vaccine that stopped people from getting the disease. Jonas Salk was the doctor who invented the first polio vaccine.
A boy in Africa receives an oral polio vaccine from a WHO (World Health Organization) worker.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world thanks to Salk, it still threatens children in Africa and Asia. Major efforts were recently under way to
or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been
Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door.
To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November.
After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Its uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives.""
Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization.
Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why?
Jonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.
From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Roosevelts death, Salks vaccine was declared officially safe.
In October 2005for the first time in 26 years in the United Statesfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnt at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.

About 40 years ago, the number of bald eagles in the United States was declining rapidly. Today, however, the bald eagle is returning to the skies. Wildlife officials hope to remove the bird from the list of threatened species by the end of the year.
In the early 1700s, bald eagles were a common sight. There were about half a million of those birds living in the United States.
Over time, their population fell dramatically. In the early 1960s, very few bald eagles remained.
What caused the number to drop? Hunting and the use of harmful chemicals sprayed on crops were largely to blame. Those chemicals poisoned the birds and their eggs.
Pollution also contributed to the problem. Bald eagles often became sick after eating fish from polluted waters.
was being destroyed as people cut down trees to build roads and homes. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal makes its home.
Although some threats still exist, the future looks hopeful for bald eagles. Today, there are about 20,000 bald eagles living in the United States. Thanks to laws that helped protect bald eagles and banned harmful chemicals, the birds are making a comeback.
, or protection, efforts have helped their survival. ""There is no doubt that it is the single best conservation story the United States has had,"" bald eagle expert Bryan Watts told
In 1782, the bald eagle was made the national bird of the United States. The nation's founders chose the bird because it symbolized freedom, strength, and courage. At the time, some people disagreed about the choice for the national bird. Benjamin Franklin, for example, thought the turkey would make a better choice because it was ""a much more respectable bird.""

349,747,"Students are spending more time studying at home, but is that a good thing?
Homework is on the rise! Nine- to 12-year-olds are spending 20 percent more time studying at home than they spent in 1997, according to a recent study from the University of Maryland. ""Kids spend an average of 50 minutes to 75 minutes studying every day,"" says the studys author, Sandra L. Hofferth.
But is taking schoolwork home a good thing? Two recent books have education experts asking, is homework helpful?
writers Nancy Kalish and Sara Bennett write that homework keeps kids from participating in school sports and other after-school programs. ""Its the youngest kids who seem to be getting the most homework,"" Bennett told
""and theyre the least ready to do it.""
that ""no scientific studies have shown that kids
from homework in any way before high school."" (
means ""to receive help."") Kohn thinks that too much homework can take the fun out of learning.
Many education officials say homework is good for learning. ""Its important [for kids] to get used to doing homework,"" Harris Cooper of Duke University told
Cooper is one of the countrys leading researchers on homework. He says practicing homework now will help kids in high school. Cooper suggests that students should expect to do 40 minutes of homework each day.
Many teachers see the value of homework as well. ""I think homework is helpful to most kids. It gives them more responsibility,"" fourth-grade teacher Pepper Schrock of Orlando, Florida, told
""I try to give meaningful projects as homework.""

350,583,"Germany, Chile, and Liberia elect their first female leaders.
Germany, Chile, and Liberia dont seem to have much in common. The three countries lie on separate continents. They do not share a language, currency, culture, or history.
But a closer look shows that the three nations are more similar than they may appear to be. In the past six months, each country has elected a woman as its leader for the first time in its history.
Angela Merkel of Germany, Michelle Bachelet of Chile, and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia join a small but growing group of female heads of state. Only 11 of 193 countries in the world have women in charge.
Johnson-Sirleaf vows to unite Liberia and create jobs.
The three recently elected women have bold plans for their countries. Merkel, the first woman to serve as the chancellor of Germany, promised that the government would work to reduce
or joblessness, in her country. ""We want to give people hope of having jobs,"" she says.
As the first woman president of Chile, Bachelet plans to bridge the large gap between the countrys rich people and poor people. She says, ""Chile needs to unite behind the goals of reducing poverty and creating more equal opportunities so that everyone can benefit from what the country has to offer.""
Johnson-Sirleaf is not only Liberias first woman president. She is also the first elected female head of state in all of Africa. As president, she faces the huge task of rebuilding Liberia after 14 years of war.
Although the war ended more than two years ago, the country still has no regular electricity or running water. More than 80 percent of the people in Liberia do not have jobs.
or bring back together, her country. ""I am excited by the potential of what I representthe aspirations and expectations of women in Liberia, African women, and women all over the world,"" she said in her inauguration speech.
Those recent elections have made some Americans think about a woman president too. Nearly 80 percent of Americans are ready for a female commander in chief, according to a Roper Public Affairs poll.
Some people think Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will run for president in 2008. Time will tell if the United States will have two female front-runners in that presidential election.

Simon, a rare red panda, now plays in the trees at a Jerusalem zoo. Jerusalem is a city in the Middle East. The small, bear-like animal likes to dine mainly on bamboo but also munches on fruits, acorns, and insects. Red pandas are excellent climbers and spend most of their time in trees.

352,259,"Aochan, a rat snake, and Gohan, a dwarf hamster, are an unlikely pair of friends. The two share a cage at a zoo in Tokyo, Japan. Zookeepers placed the hamster, whose name is Japanese for ""meal,"" in the snakes cage as a tasty snack. Instead of chowing down on Gohan, the snake befriended the furry rodent.

353,427,"A NASA Spacecraft Lands on an Asteroid for the First Time.
On February 12, scientists on Earth fired rockets on the
spacecraft, turning it toward Eros. Eros is an
, or space rock that is orbiting the sun. As the spacecraft slowly descended, it bounced and scientists were afraid the craft would crash.
Shown is the location of the asteroid belt in our solar system, and the orbit of Eros.
: The planets and their orbits are not drawn to scale.
began its incredible space odyssey five years ago. NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) launched the spacecraft in 1996. For the next four years,
sped toward Eros, covering nearly 2 billion miles.
After studying a few other space objects, the spacecraft settled into orbit around Eros on February 14, 2000. During the following year, the craft took more than 160,000 photos of the potato-shaped asteroid.
completed its mission orbiting Eros, NASA scientists decided to try to land the car-sized spacecraft on the asteroid. If the craft succeeded,
would become the first craft to land on an asteroid. Scientists knew that the odds were against a safe landing, but they thought it was worth trying. ""Chances [were] less than 1 percent for [
] to land intact,"" said scientist Helen Worth.
NASA scientists on Earth guided the spacecraft toward the surface of Eros by remote control. Descending at 4 miles per hour, the spacecraft landed after bouncing once.
Thinking that the spacecraft had crashed, scientists were surprised to learn that it was sending information from the asteroid's surface. ""It's working, and we are getting good information,"" said NASA scientist Jacob Trombka shortly after the landing. As a result of the successful landing, NASA continued the mission for an additional ten days.
Scientists already know that most asteroids orbit the sun between Mars and Jupiter in an area called the
. Eros, however, is a kind of asteroid that comes closer to Earth than most asteroids. Such asteroids are called
. Scientists believe that Eros may be similar to the near-Earth asteroid that slammed into Earth 65 million years ago, probably killing the dinosaurs.
About 350 near-Earth asteroids have been found. Scientists carefully map the orbits of those asteroids. They say those asteroids will not hit Earth anytime soon. However, one might hit someday, scientists say.
There may be another 1,000 near-Earth asteroids scientists haven't discovered. Scientists worry that one of the unknown asteroids might threaten Earth. Scientists will use the information they gathered from Eros to protect Earth from asteroids that come too close to the third rock from the sun.
Eros is about twice the length of Manhattan, New York.
Eros orbits the sun once every 21 months.
Eros has so little gravity that a baseball hit on its surface would fly into space.
A person weighing 200 pounds on Earth would weigh 2 ounces on Eros.
The daytime temperature on Eros is about 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
The nighttime temperature on Eros is about -238 degrees Fahrenheit.

The $10 bill is getting a new look! To outsmart counterfeiters, the U.S. government is rolling out a newly redesigned $10 bill that has splashes of red, yellow, and orange.
are people who try to make fake bills that look like the real ones. Counterfeiting is a crime.
""The new $10 note design continues the U.S. government's efforts to make our currency safer, smarter, and more secure,"" says Dawn Haley of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which produces all U.S. paper money.
The $10 bill is the latest in the series to get a new design. The $50 bill was updated last year, and the $20 bill was given a makeover in 2003.
There are several colorful changes on the new bill. A red image of the Statue of Liberty's torch appears next to the portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the treasury. On the portrait's other side is the phrase ""We the People,"" also in bright red ink. The background is light orange, and small yellow 10s surround the torch. A new ink makes the numeral 10 in one of the corners change color from copper to green when the bill is tilted.
But don't expect to find the new $10 note in your wallet just yet. In January 2006, the U.S. government will begin to circulate the new bills. The government plans to redesign the currency every seven to 10 years to stay ahead of counterfeiters.

357,501,"Just in time for Black History Month, President George Bush has signed a law to build a national museum honoring African Americans.
The National Museum of African American History and Culture will be part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. It will include exhibits on slavery and other important periods in black history.
Getting approval for the museum was no easy task.In fact, politicians and leaders worked for almost 100 years to get the bill signed. ""This has been a long, hard effort, but we're here today,"" one government official told
. Planners estimate that building the museum will take about ten years.

358,610,"History in the Making: Japan Invades Hong Kong
War broke out between China and Japan in 1937. An undeclared war was fought until 1941, when China, as well as the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, declared war on Japan, Germany, and Italy. In 1941, Japan invaded the British colony of Hong Kong, which is part of present-day China. Connie interviewed her grandfather, Locksley Siu, who was in Hong Kong during the Japanese invasion.
How old were you when World War II began?
World War II in Hong Kong was from 1941 to 1945. The Japanese army occupied the former British colony when I was 11 years old.
Where did you live, and did you have a car?
Altogether, eight people lived in [an] apartment of 500 square feet. Our apartment was in Wan Chai, on Hong Kong Island. Most people did not have cars. My dad had an old bicycle.
Did you still go to school during the Japanese occupation?
Yes, I continued to go to school for the first year. Later the school was closed because the school ran out of money. During the occupation, students were required to learn Japanese. Japanese teachers taught us Japanese.
Did you have enough food to eat every day?
No, we did not have enough food. We only ate vegetables, beans, and potatoes, but no rice at all. Meat was very costly and in short supply. When we were really hungry, we drank water. Sometimes we had to pick up grass and leaves from trees to eat.
How did the Japanese soldiers treat the Chinese people?
They were rude, and they hated Chinese people. We had to salute the Japanese soldiers when they passed by. Otherwise they would kick [us] in the back.
How was life affected by the occupation?
There was little freedom. The Japanese forbade people to go out after 11 at night. There was no traffic during the curfew. There was a lack of electricity for lighting; instead, we used candles. The only entertainment at night was the radio. The Japanese government took all Hong Kong dollars away. The Japanese government forced us to use Japanese yen. Roads such as Queen's Road and King's Road were changed to Japanese names.
Do you have any comments about the occupation?
More than 60 years after [the end of] World War II, there are still many people  who live in fear, hunger, and poverty because of wars. I hope that you will think more of those less fortunate.
I learned that there was little freedom under the occupation. I should be grateful that I live in a country where I am not forced to do things that I don't want to do. I'm going to do something for the less fortunate, just as my grandpa told me.

is a made-up story that is passed down from generation to generation. Myths often become accepted as the truth. Weekly Reader spoke with a few health experts to find out the truth behind some common beliefs.
: An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
: Although eating this fruit won't cure an illness, apples are a healthful food choice. ""[Apples] are good for you,"" said nutrition expert Dr. Melvin Heyman. ""They contain nutrients.""
are vitamins and minerals that your body needs to stay healthy. Apples are also a good source of fiber, which can decrease the risk of heart disease later in life.
: You should let a cut breathe.
: Contrary to popular belief, cuts do not need to breathe. ""The open cut or scrape should be covered,"" said skin expert Dr. Amy Harned. According to Dr. Harned, it's important to wash the wound first. Then, apply an antibiotic ointment and cover the cut with a bandage. Leaving a cut uncovered can allow germs to infect it.
: Eating carrots will improve your eyesight.
: Carrots are rich in vitamin A, which helps keep your eyes healthy. According to eye expert Dr. Timothy Wingert, ""Eating carrots will not improve your eyesight. But eating carrots is part of a well-balanced diet. Carrots have nutrients that help your eyes to function properly."" Carrots also make a tasty snack.
: You can hurt your eyes by sitting too close to the TV.
: There is some truth to this advice. According to Dr. Wingert, sitting too close to the television for long periods of time makes eyes tired and can cause eyestrain.

""Like so many Americans, Michelle Kwan has a unique personal story, one that has captivated people everywhere, especially young people,"" Rice told
Kwan, who was born in California, won her first world f igure-skating title when she was 15. She has won a total of 43 championships, including two Olympic medals. She took home an Olympic silver medal in 1998 and a bronze medal in 2002. Kwan says that in her new position, she hopes to bring countries closer together. She plans to speak to young people about the importance of setting goals.
""I am honored to accept this appointment and to serve my country,"" Kwan says. ""As an athlete, I have always been proud to represent the United States around the world. Being able to do so in this new position is very special and meaningful to me.""

361,254,"When thousands of baseball fans head to ballparks this summer, chances are theyll have trouble reciting the words to our national anthem. Two out of three Americans dont know the words to ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" according to a recent Harris Poll.
As a result, the National Anthem Project, spearheaded by music educators, is dedicated to reteaching people the words to Americas official song. A crosscountry campaign kicked off in January and is currently touring cities in the West from Los Angeles to Seattle.
The tour includes interactive exhibits and a singing contest. In each location, the singer who belts out the best version of the national anthem wins a $1,000 donation to a school music education program of his or her choice. In Richmond, Virginia, an 11-yearold boy took home the top prize.
Why dont people know the words to our countrys most famous tune? ""We see it as a consequence that music education programs are being diminished in schools,"" project spokesperson Elizabeth Lasko told
""[People who do] know the words say they learned them in school.""
or end, in Baltimore, Maryland, at Fort McHenry on September 14. That date and that place are when and where Francis Scott Key penned the poem that later became the national anthem.
According to the National Anthem Project, the song represents our countrys history and culture. Many people sing it at community events.
""We want people to know the words so they sing it together,"" says Lasko. ""If youre taught as a young person to sing it, youll always be able to sing it."" For more information on the National Anthem Project and tour cities, visit
During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote the poem that later became the national anthem.
On September 13, 1814, Key watched British ships bomb Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. The next morning, he spotted the American flag still flying over the fort. The sight inspired him to write the poem. In 1931, Congress made it the national anthem.
Here is the first verse of the four-verse song:
O say, can you see, by the dawns early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilights last
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through
     the perilous fight,
Oer the ramparts we watched, were so
     gallantly streaming?
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting
     in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was
     still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
Oer the land of the free, and the home of the

362,456,"On New Year's Day 2001, Irene Alexander and 2,538 other people gathered at Mount Vernon, George Washington's home in Virginia. They came to honor the slaves who had worked there. On New Year's Day 200 years earlier, 123 of George Washington's slaves had been freed.
Washington's widow, Martha, freed her husband's slaves on January 1, 1801. Martha was carrying out the wishes of the country's first president, who had died on December 14, 1799. In his will he had requested that his slaves be freed after his wife's death.
During the ceremony, Alexander, a descendant of a slave who worked at Mount Vernon, told visitors, ""I hope you all feel, as I do, a sense of joy, a sense of sadness but also a sense of hope that the contributions of good people will always be remembered.""
Jennifer Saxon, a spokesperson for Mount Vernon, told
that Mount Vernon couldn't have prospered without slave labor. ""Slaves did most of the work,"" she said.
When Washington was born, many Americans owned slaves. Those people used slaves to plant crops and perform many other duties. Most people thought slavery was OK. When Washington was 11 years old, his father died and left him ten slaves.
During the American Revolution, which began in 1775, some people began to think that slavery was wrong and should be ended. Washington was one of those people. He vowed never to buy another slave.
In his will, Washington wrote that all his slaves should be freed. ""Upon the [death] of my wife,"" he wrote, ""it is my...desire that all the slaves which I hold in my own right shall receive their freedom.""
To make sure Washington's wishes were carried out, Martha freed his slaves in 1801, a year before she died. Martha, however, kept the slaves she owned when she freed her husband's slaves.
Even though Washington freed the slaves he owned, slavery remained legal in some states for another 64 years, until 1865. Slavery did not end in the United States until after the Civil War ended it.

363,801,"A group of fourth graders witnessed firsthand proof that one person's junk is another person's treasure.
joined the students on their recent visit to the Garbage Museum in Stratford, Connecticut, where a giant, multicolored dinosaur molded out of garbage towered above them.
was sculpted out of a ton of trash! That is equal to 2,000 pounds of garbagethe amount of trash each person, on average, throws away each year. Philadelphia artist Leo Sewell scoured city dumps and created
out of old junk, from false teeth and license plates to toys, tires, and tennis rackets.
""I think the dinosaur is one of the coolest things I've ever seen,"" said fourth grader Jahkwe Aquart from Park City Magnet School in Bridgeport, Connecticut. His classmate Julie Pham, 9, agreed. ""Instead of throwing away our garbage, we can reuse it.""
was made out of a ton of trash, including false teeth, license plates, and tires.
That is exactly the point. ""The museum shows what happens to our trash, how we can reduce our trash, and what we can do instead of throwing our trash away,"" said museum director Sotoria Montanari.
Today, Americans create more garbage than ever before. In the early 1900s, most items were packed in containers that could be used again. Now, most of the food we buy, from cereal to milk, comes in boxes and cartons that can be thrown away.
So what happens to trash after it is tossed out? Some trash ends up in
. In a landfill, garbage gets buried between layers of soil. Because many states are running out of room for landfills, more and more garbage goes to
(or resource-recovery) plants. At these plants, garbage is burned and converted into electricity that people use to power their lights, TVs, and video games.
Plastic bottles can be recycled at centers like this one.
Garbage is a form of solid waste. The Garbage Museum and its recycling plant, which are run by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, provide visitors with ideas to cut down on solid waste. One way is to
, or make less, trashby throwing away fewer napkins when you eat, for instance. Another way is to
, or find new uses for, old items. Paper bags, for example, can be reused to make book covers or wrap gifts.
People also help decrease their solid wastes when they
. Recycling refers to putting old objects, such as glass, plastic bottles, newspapers, and aluminum cans through a special process so they can be used again. (See ""
Recycling has many benefits. Did you know that recycled plastic soft-drink bottles can be made into park benches, carpeting, and backpacks? The more people recycle, the less garbage ends up in landfills or waste-to-energy plants.
, or materials from Earth. To make an aluminum can from scratch, for example, the metal needs to be mined from the ground. That process harms the land and pollutes the air and water. Making aluminum cans from recycled cans uses 95 percent less energy and protects Earth's natural resources. In fact, the energy saved each year from recycled cans could light Washington, D.C., for nearly four years!
What are some other ways you can protect natural resources?
As part of their visit, the fourth graders got a look at the museum's recycling center. Here, they discovered that one
, or bundle, of recycled newspapers can save 17 trees! The message seems to have stuck with 9-year-old Arron Smith. ""When you recycle, you save trees and animals' homes.""
Did you ever wonder what happens to the aluminum cans you recycle?
watched a recycling center in action at the Garbage Museum.
Trucks drop off aluminum cans that are mixed with massive loads of plastic bottles and glass. The trash travels along conveyor belts to be sorted and separated.
Machines compress aluminum cans into giant bales.
The bales are sold to companies that turn the recycled cans into something usable. From recycled aluminum cans, more cans are made. When you buy recycled products, you ""close the loop.""
Each American throws away about 5 pounds of garbage each day. Earth Day, April 22, reminds people how important it is to reduce waste. Here are some ways:
Carry a lunch box instead of a paper lunch bag, and pack food in reusable containers.
Use both sides of a sheet of paper.
Donate old clothing and toys to a charity.
pile using food scraps, leaves, and grass clippings. Composting is nature's way of recycling. Plants and other wastes
, or rot, and nourish the soil.
Recycle plastic and glass bottles and jars, newspapers, and aluminum cans. Recycling just one aluminum can will save enough energy to run your TV for three hours!

364,300,"If two heads are better than one, a newly discovered turtle is head and shoulders above other turtles. May Toro found a two-headed turtle in Florida. ""I was shocked. I couldn't believe it,"" Toro said after she picked up the turtle.
Toro works for Mary Kraus, who studies turtles. Kraus says she has seen the eggs of two headed turtles before. However, she has never seen a living two-headed turtle. ""This is the first time I've ever seen one alive, fully developed, and hatched,"" Kraus said.
The two-headed turtle is a loggerhead turtle. The U.S. government says the loggerhead turtle is an endangered species. Loggerhead turtles can grow to be 3 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds!
After studying the turtle for a couple of days, Toto and Kraus let the turtle go. ""We didn't want it to become a freak in a freak show"", Kraus said.

365,173,"Marco Andretti is on the fast track to success.
Speed runs in Marco Andrettis family. His grandfather, Mario, and father, Michael, are two of the best-known race car drivers of all time. Now 19-year-old Marco is taking his place behind the wheel. He recently finished his first season as a driver for the Andretti Green Racing team. He placed second in this years Indianapolis 500, finishing ahead of his father. Marco also won the Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma (California). He recently slowed down long enough to talk to
So, how fast do you actually go?
[My] top speed [is] 240 [miles per hour].
How did you get started in racing?
I started at 9 years old. So its go-karts. Believe it or not, those things arent toys. It gets pretty competitive. The first time I ever sat in a go-kart, I was just going to have a go and see basically if I had it or not. Of course, the media was everywhere. There were so many cameras there, I couldnt even see the track.
How did you deal with all the attention at such a young age?
It was very overwhelming. I got to the point where I was winning races, but I wasnt enjoying myself. I would win a race and come away from the day saying thats what I needed to do, rather than enjoy it. I just took a little time off and then went crazy not driving, so I had to come back for myself.
What dont you like about coming from such a famous racing family?
You have a lot expected of you because of all their accomplishments, but Im just going to go have fun with it. You set your own goals.
How did it feel to pass your father in the Indy 500?

366,18,"What is one of your worst nightmares about the school day? No recess!
For students in cities across the country, from Atlanta to Las Vegas, break time is over. Elementary-school children at the Clark County School District in Las Vegas recently said good-bye to recess.
Why has this Las Vegas district and many others eliminated, or
, recess? School officials say they want students to have more classroom time to learn. They also hope that more time in class will help students perform better on their standardized tests.
The students in Clark County have a 30-minute lunch period. They have to squeeze playground minutes into that half-hour block. They no longer get an additional 15- to 20-minute recess.
Many teachers, parents, and students disagree with the decision to ban recess. Education experts often say that recess is an important part of the school day.
Those experts say that the benefits of recess outweigh the lost class time. Recess gives students the opportunity to take a break, exercise, and socialize with their friends. At recess, many students learn how to cooperate and play with other students. In addition, some studies show a recess break can help improve test scores.
One fifth grader in Virginia told the

367,105,"If you had to choose one invention you couldn't live without, which would it be-the toothbrush, car, cell phone, or microwave oven? That was the question asked of American teens and adults in a survey conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
The toothbrush emerged as the number-one invention that Americans can't live without. Following closely in second place was the car.
These findings show that important inventions do not have to be complicated. ""In today's high-tech society, we thought people would be voting for the high-tech inventions,"" said Kristin Joyce, a spokesperson at MIT. ""The results show that simple, low-tech inventions are important to people.""
The toothbrush has a long history, dating back to the 15th century. According to the American Dental Association, the first toothbrush was invented in 1498. To make the brush, a Chinese emperor placed hog bristles in a bone handle.
In 1938, nylon bristles replaced pig bristles. Dentists today are eager to remind people that while the toothbrush has taken the throne as king of the invention list, it still needs its handy sidekick-dental floss.

368,112,"What's purple and gold, wears sneakers, has horns and a tail, and weighs several hundred pounds? A statue of a cow, of course!
People in several U.S. cities are being treated to herds of cow sculptures. The sculptures are part of Cows on Parade.
Cows on Parade started in Switzerland in 1998. A U.S. businessman saw the cows and brought the idea to the United States in 1999. This year, about 1,000 cows are on display in several U.S. cities.

369,317,"Do you get good grades? Do you talk to your parents about what's happening at school and about things you and your friends are doing after school?
A recent study shows that how kids answer those questions tells a lot about whether they are headed for trouble. The study says kids who spend their free time aimlessly often get into trouble.
The study, called the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, was funded by the federal government. More than 90,000 kids between the ages of 12 and 18 took part in the study. Those kids attended 134 different U.S. schools. The study followed them from 1994 to 2000.
About half of the kids in the study said they were not involved in dangerous activities. But 25 percent said they had tried a cigarette, 26 percent said they had picked up a gun, and 47 percent said they had tried alcohol.
The study found that kids who spend their free time hanging out with nothing to do, who get poor grades, or who don't talk with their parents are eight times more likely to take part in unhealthful activities later on, such as smoking cigarettes or trying drugs.
Kids who hang out with friends who drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or have tried drugs are likely to do what their friends are doing, said Robert Blum. Blum is one of the doctors who conducted the study. In other words, kids tend to act like their friends, Blum said.
""How young people do at school and what they do with their free time are the most important [ways of predicting] risky behavior,"" said Blum.
Kids should get involved in interesting activities, Blum advised. Instead of hanging out with kids who are already trying what the study calls ""high-risk activities,"" Blum said that kids should play sports, read, talk with parents, or do homework.
The National Longitudinal Study finds that kids who are involved in activities usually don't get into trouble. Here's a story written by a
kid reporter about a few kids who know how to spend their time:
There are a lot of good kids. I know three of them who live in my hometown, Lockport, Illinois.
Amanda Clemmons and Heather Grein are best friends. Recently, they celebrated their birthdays together.
The two girls invited about 60 kids to a birthday party. The girls, however, asked their friends to bring pet supplies instead of presents. Their guests brought leashes, paper towels, pet food, treats, kitty litter, and toys to the party. Amanda and Heather then donated the pet supplies to the TLC Animal Shelter in Homer Township.

370,409,"More bears are alive and well, but are they ready to come off the endangered species list?
The bears are back after being on the brink of extinction in and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is located in the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana.
Now the U.S. government may remove the grizzly from its list of endangered species in this area. ""The future of the Yellowstone grizzly bears is bright,"" says Chris Servheen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
That wasnt always the case. The numbers of grizzlies began to shrink in the early 1900s largely because ranchers hunted the animals and farmers destroyed their
By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears still lived in the Yellowstone area. That year, the grizzly was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which offers special protection to animals facing extinction. Today, wildlife experts estimate that more than 600 bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone.
Grizzly bears live in other parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as well as Washington state and will remain on the list in those areas. Grizzlies in Alaska, which number about 30,000, have never been on the list because that population is healthy.
Its Not Time Yet Not everyone thinks its a good decision to remove grizzlies from the list. Some wildlife officials fear that if the bear is removed from the list, its habitat around Yellowstone could be used for logging, oil drilling, and development. Others worry that the bears will be hunted again. ""We would love to see the grizzly bear delisted, but its not ready,"" says wildlife supporter Louisa Wilcox.

Should grizzlies no longer be listed as an endangered species? Why or why not?
The grizzlys return isnt the only species success story. Take a look at some other animals that are being saved, thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists.
In 1963, only 417 pairs of bald eagles nested in the United States. There are now more than 6,400 pairs, and the national symbol may soon be removed from the list of endangered species.
Hawaiians used to hunt this reptile for dinner. Now they swim alongside the turtles near some islands. The number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400 a year. There were only 67 in 1973.
Pollution and habitat loss have made it hard for sea otters to stay afloat. In 1938, there were only several hundred otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500.

371,369,"For many years, parents in Honduras have been giving their children unusual first names. Some parents in the Central American country have given their children such names as Bujia, which means ""Spark Plug,"" or Llanta de Milagro, which means ""Miracle Tire."" Other parents have named their children after famous American presidents. For example, one kid's first name is Bill Clinton, and another kid's name is Ronald Reagan.
Now, a government committee in Honduras wants parents to stop giving their children such unusual names. The committee worries that some kids could tease those kids with uncommon names. ""Without a doubt,"" the committee said, ""such names are a bother to the people who have to carry them through life.""

372,303,"This summer, when 'N Sync took the stage at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Morgan Oseiki was there. The 9-year-old told
that the group did more than ""Bring in' Da Noise."" The members of the band talked about the dangers of illegal drugs.
Justin Timberlake, Chris Kirkpatrick, Lance Bass, JC Chasez, and Joey Fatone have joined forces with the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. The drug policy office designs programs to help kids stay away from drugs.
Because 'N Sync is one of the best bands today, the White House office asked the group to bring its anti-drug message to kids. ""We think having ['N Sync] as part of our team is really going to raise the volume on our message to kids,"" said Edward H. Jurith, who is head of the White House office. Together, the White House office and 'N Sync are promoting the National Youth Anti-Drug Campaign.
As part of their summer tour, the boys talked about their ""anti-drugs,"" the things they do instead of drugs. The group also invited kids to send their anti-drugs to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
Here's what some kids said their anti-drugs are:
Grace Chen, 11, of Glen Dale, Maryland, said it's music. She plays the violin.
Rachel Acevedo, age 10, of Altamonte Springs, Florida, said it's swimming.
Dipo Adedeji, age 11, of Glen Dale, Maryland, said it's basketball.
Abigail Tang, age 12, of Brooklyn, New York, said it's writing.
Diana Barrientos, age 11, of Alexandria, Virginia, said it's drawing.

373,122,"In October, a colorful object blazed through the sky over several states. Hundreds of people in Colorado, Utah, and Idaho saw the bright light. Many of them called local authorities to report what they saw.
""We've gotten several reports of [a] brilliant white light the size of a basketball with blue flames turning to orange,"" said one police official.
The people had seen an unidentified flying object, or UFO. Many people think that UFOs are spacecraft from other planets. Actually, a
is anything that you see in the sky and cannot identify. Usually, even the most mysterious UFOs are eventually explained.
Experts say the UFO seen in October was most likely a meteor, or space rock streaking through Earth's atmosphere. Other UFO sightings, however, remain a mystery.
For years, the U.S government has been studying UFO sightings. Much of the information that the government has gathered on UFOs is top-secret.
Now a new group wants the government to tell everyone what it knows about UFOs. The group is called the Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFI).
""It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the real nature of this phenomenon,"" said John Podesta. Podesta is a former White House official and a CFI member.
The members of CFI asked the government to release information about specific UFO sightings. One such sighting happened in December 1965.
On that cold night, people in western Pennsylvania saw a bright light streak through the sky. The light looked liked it crashed behind some hills.
The mysterious object might have been a rock from space. A space rock that crashes into Earth is called a meteorite. However, several witnesses claimed that soldiers searched the area where the object ""crashed."" They say the soldiers loaded a car-sized object onto a truck, placed a tarp over the object, and drove it away-never to be seen again.
The members of CFI claim that the U.S. government has never released information about the sighting and the object. ""We can't come up with a reason why this information is being withheld. The government won't even acknowledge that the incident took place, but we know that it did,"" said one CFI member.
For now, the exact nature of some UFOs remains a mystery. CFI members hope that the answer lies in secret government papers. They say they are only searching for the truth and they want everyone to know the truth.

374,72,"A group of students discovered more than 85 ancient canoes last April in a dry lake bed in Florida. Scientists later dug up the canoes to study them. They recently reported that the canoes were built between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago.
The students found the canoes in a lake near Gainesville, Florida. The Seminole people used to live near the lake. Seminole Chief James Billie said his ancestors called the lake
, which means ""place of the long boats.""
The sunken wooden canoes were exposed when the lake's water level dropped last spring. The mud at the bottom of the lake had preserved the canoes.
The scientists who studied the canoes say they are 22 feet long. After studying the canoes, the scientists returned them to the lake bed. They explained that leaving the ancient canoes exposed to the air would have caused them to crumble in a few days or weeks.

375,191,"One polar bear spent part of the summer feeling a bit off-color. The 14-year-old bears snowy white fur briefly turned purple after she was given medicine to treat a skin problem.
The bear, named Pelusa, lives at a zoo in Argentina--a country in South America. When Pelusa changed shades, visitors flocked to the zoo to see her purple coat. That must have been a ""berry"" strange site!

376,533,"After nearly two decades of rest, a sleeping giant has started to awaken. Mount St. Helens in Washington state is showing signs of life and has left scientists scrambling to determine if it will blow its top.
""Volcanoes are just like people--they're awake and active, and they go to sleep,""
. A volcanologist is a scientist who studies volcanoes.
In September, Mount St. Helens began blowing large
, or clouds of steam, thousands of feet into the air. The 8,364-foot mountain is not the only restless volcano in the country. Scientists are also paying close attention to awakened volcanoes in Alaska and Hawaii.
U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Geological Survey
Steam blasts from a crater on Mount St. Helens in October 2004.
Volcanoes can remain quiet for years and then erupt violently, sometimes without warning. Using the latest technology, scientists hope to better
Mount St. Helens is located in Washington.
Scientists say Mount St. Helens is one of the most closely monitored volcanoes and the most active volcano in the lower 48 states. Mount St. Helens is also among 13 active volcanoes that are located in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. That range is home to several powerful volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier and Mount Hood.
Although scientists say a large eruption at Mount St. Helens is unlikely, they are cautious because of the volcano's history. Officials have sealed off a 5-mile area around the volcano.
Mount St. Helens erupted with tremendous force in May 1980, blowing more than 1,300 feet off its top and killing 57 people. The blast destroyed thousands of acres of forest and scattered ash for thousands of miles. Mount St. Helens continued to rumble until 1986 but has been quiet since that time.
How can scientists tell when a volcano will awaken from its slumber? ""We measure earthquake activity, changes in the mountain, and volcanic gases,"" said Driedger.
Although scientists can't tell exactly when or with what force a volcano will blow its top, they rely on advanced equipment to help them predict eruptions. Special devices called
are installed around volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens to detect earthquakes. Earthquakes always strike before a volcano erupts.
Volcanoes are mountains where hot, liquid rock called magma deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure can cause magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the crater at the top of the volcano and vents, or cracks, along its side. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called lava. Once lava cools, it hardens into rock.
Scientists use special global positioning instruments to measure movements on the slopes of the mountain--a clue to the buildup of
. Magma is red-hot molten rock located inside the volcano. It is called
when it pours out of the volcano.
As magma rises, volcanoes release carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Sensors on helicopters test the air for gases that signal rising magma. ""The gases are like telegrams that tell us what's going on inside the volcano,"" said Driedger.
More than 500 million people around the world live near active volcanoes. Monitoring volcanoes is a dangerous job, but scientists take precautions to stay safe.
""By watching volcanoes, we learn how they work,"" said Driedger. ""The more we know, the better prepared we can be to save property and lives.""
Besides volcanoes, what natural disasters are hard for scientists to predict? Why?

377,25,"When you read a newspaper, do you usually open it to the comics section? Many people do! That's because those cartoons are funny.
The cartoons in the comics section may make you laugh, but another type of cartoon will also make you think. It's called an
. An editorial cartoon expresses an opinion about specific people or events in the news.
Lately, many editorial cartoonists have been focusing on the presidential candidates and the election. Artist Gary Markstein created two political illustrations to express his opinions about this year's election.
The economy is one of the main issues in this year's presidential election. (The economy refers to the way a country runs its jobs and industries.) The economy is like the weather--sometimes it's good, and other times it's bad. Political polls show that many people ""vote with their pocketbook."" That is, they vote based on how the economy is doing.
to make his point about the economy. Symbols are objects that represent other things. One cartoon shows two weather maps labeled ""Economy."" George W. Bush stands in front of a weather map covered with smiling faces. John Kerry holds an umbrella as he stands in front of a map with bad-weather symbols.
A forecaster is someone who predicts the weather. Why does the artist depict Bush and Kerry as weather forecasters?
What point is the cartoonist making about the candidates and the economy?
How do the symbols help convey the message? What do the suns represent? What do the hail and thunderstorm clouds represent?
Do you think the cartoonist prefers one candidate over the other? Why or why not?
What dirt are the presidential candidates digging up about each other? Some people think election campaigning is a messy business. In one cartoon, Markstein draws attention to negative campaigning and
between candidates. In politics, mudslinging refers to speaking negatively about another person or opposing party.
To make his point, the artist shows two men talking about dirt for sale. One man says to the other, ""The Bush and Kerry campaigns each ordered 2 tons...""
Why might the Bush and Kerry campaigns be ordering mud?
What message do you think the cartoonist is sending about the election campaign?
When Gary Markstein was in the fourth grade, he dreamed of being a cartoonist and having his own comic strip. He even put out a humor magazine with a friend that lasted for one issue.
Today, Markstein's audience is much larger. He draws cartoons for the
Markstein draws five cartoons a week that focus on politics and sports. To get ideas, he reads several newspapers each morning. ""Coming up with a good idea is the hardest and most challenging part, but it's also the most rewarding,"" he told
What's the best part of his job? ""I get paid to play!"" said Markstein. ""I draw on a different topic every day. I think it's the best job in the world!""
If you think you'd like to be an editorial cartoonist, Markstein has some tips:
Draw well and write well. (Yes, there is writing in most cartoons!)
Read the newspaper to learn what is going on in the world.

378,135,"Weather forecasters get ready for a busy tornado season.
Tornado season got off to a furious start this
year. Record-setting swarms of as many as 113 tornadoes clobbered five Midwestern states in mid-March.
The map shows tornado alley. More tornadoes sweep through tornado alley than any other part of the world.
Battered communities are continuing to recover from the tornadoes that sent fierce winds and softballsize hail across Missouri, Illinois, Kansas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. The powerful winds destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses, uprooted trees, and toppled power lines. The storms killed 12 people.
""Its just amazing how devastating it is,"" Mayor Tim Davlin of Springfield, Illinois, said after the storms. ""It looks like the pictures we saw a couple months ago after [Hurricane] Katrina."" Powerful tornado winds ripped through the state capital and left roof tiles, gasoline pumps, and other
in their wake. Debris is the scattered pieces of something that has been destroyed.

Tornado in Union City, Oklahoma, May 24, 1973
are natures most destructive storms, with winds that can spiral up to 300 miles per hour. A tornado, also known as a twister, is a rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm cloud to the ground. Tornadoes come in all shapes and sizes and do not always appear in the funnel form depicted in movies such as
The March tornadoes occurred when cold weather from the west collided with warm weather from the Gulf of Mexico.
Wind gusts that raged across the Midwest reached 90 miles per hour in five states, according to the National Weather Services Storm Prediction Center. One gust clocked in at 107 miles per hour in Kansas.
Tornadoes can strike in any month in any part of the world. In the United States, peak activity for tornado season is from April through July.
scientists who study weathersay the series of 113 damaging storms that tore through the Midwest will beat the recent record for the number of tornadoes on a single day in March. The previous record was 69 on March 13, 1990. ""For this early in the year, its a heck of a deal,"" says weather expert Joe Schaefer. ""What happens after that is anybodys guess.""
After the thunderstorms caused the series of deadly twisters, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for Michigan and Indiana. If a
is issued for an area, the conditions are favorable for a tornado to form. If the Weather Service issues a
for an area, a tornado has been spotted. In the case of a tornado warning, people should seek safe shelter immediately.
The National Weather Service also employs storm spotters to help predict where and when a tornado will strike. The trained volunteers are positioned before a storm hits to report what they see developing in the sky. Their reports confirm what weather forecasters see on their radar screens.
For many, there is no escaping the tornadoes wrath. ""It was over before you knew it,"" Greg Kospar of Bentonville, Arkansas, told reporters after the storm. ""The house is gone.""
The strength of a tornado and its potential to cause damage are rated using the Fujita scale, with 0 being the weakest and 5 being the strongest. A new tornado rating system is scheduled to go into effect early next year.
 Warm and cold air meet and rise into the storm cloud.
 Sometimes the rising air begins to spin, which can form a funnel-shaped cloud.
 When the funnel-shaped cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.
in the American Midwest. In this area, hot air traveling north from the Gulf of Mexico intersects with cool, dry air from Canada and the west, creating large thunderstorm clouds.
Each year the United States experiences about 100,000 thunderstorms. Those storms form about

Francis Campane and his wife took a train trip from Connecticut to Washington, D.C., in the spring. They were headed to the nation's capital to visit the newly opened National World War II Memorial.
is a special monument that honors a person, a group of people, or an event. The World War II memorial opened in April. It was built to honor the 16 million men and women who had served in the armed forces during World War II (1939-1945).
The trip was especially meaningful to Campane, 80, because he is a World War II
. Veterans are people who have served in the armed forces. Campane served in the U.S. Navy during the war. He was stationed aboard a ship called the U.S.S.
""I was amazed at the memorial and the gratitude the American people have shown World War II veterans,"" Campane told
. ""It's great to know our generation will be remembered.""
A plaza, a reflecting pool, fountains, and stone arches are among the memorial's main features. A wall of gold stars at the memorial honors the more than 400,000 Americans killed in the war.

The World War II memorial is one of many places across the country where people will remember the U.S. military on November 11. That is Veterans Day--a holiday set aside to honor our nation's armed forces.
People will pay tribute to the 140,000 U.S. troops still serving in Iraq and to the more than 1,000 members of the U.S. military who have died there. For his part, Campane plans to volunteer at a hospital that cares for veterans.

Sleep experts say that kids who do not get a good night's sleep on a regular basis put their safety at risk. Delaying bedtime for other activities can lead to accidents, such as falling off a bike or getting hurt on the playground.
In addition to preventing injuries, children who get enough sleep on a regular basis tend to get better grades and be in a better mood. ""Sleep is just as important as nutrition and exercise in our overall health,"" says Dr. Carl Hunt, a sleep expert with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Estimates show about 1 out of every 4 adults does not get enough sleep. Sleep experts think that number may be just as high for kids. According to the NIH, children ages 7 to 11 need at least nine hours of sleep each night.
Most kids and families today have busy schedules that can keep them from getting enough sleep. Plus, watching television, chatting on the Internet, and playing video games all compete with valuable sleep time.
Going to bed at the same time each night will help you get a good night's sleep. If you have trouble falling asleep, Dr. Hunt advises you to unwind with quiet time. Reading or listening to soothing music can help bring on sleep.

383,568,"Ten-year-old Hunter York might have a fear of snakes, but that didn't stop him from picking up the two-headed creature that he found in his father's backyard.
The Kentucky boy used a stick to pick up the two-headed black king snake.
The snake ""kind of freaked me out a bit,"" he said.
Hunter ran into the house to tell his father about the 8 1 / 2-inch reptile.
, like this snake, are cold-blooded animals that either crawl around on the ground or, like turtles and lizards, creep on short legs.
Hunter's dad left the reptile with a snake expert because they couldn't get it to eat.
""We couldn't force-feed it because we don't know which head eats,"" said his dad.
One scientist said that Hunter's find was very rare. Only about one of every 10,000 snakes has two heads!

384,240,"Could you keep quiet for one day? How about for a month or a year? That's what Brett Banfe is doing. The 18-year-old believes that silence is golden, and he has promised not to utter a single sound for an entire year.
Brett is remaining silent to raise money for charity. He came up with the idea when he was talking to several friends. ""We were talking about what it would be like to stop speaking for a day,"" he explained. ""And I said I could do it for a year.""
Brett says zipping his lips will change the way he listens to people ""because I'm not going to be trying to think about what I'm going to say next,"" he explained.

386,287,"Erin Beth Turner of West Hartford, Connecticut, was among the millions of kids who bought
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
this summer. After buying her copy, the 10-year-old told
, ""I'll read it until I go to bed, and finish it in a few days.""
The four Harry Potter books, by J.K. Rowling, are popular all over the world. More than 35 million copies have been sold. They have also been translated into 30 languages.
Although many kids say they love reading about Harry, some critics say the books aren't good for kids.
Many teachers say that their students don't read enough. So teachers are thrilled that many kids spend their free time reading Harry Potter books. Educators say reading helps kids do better in school. ""I know my kids aren't missing out on their reading,"" said Gillian Williams, an elementary school principal in New York City. ""They're reading Harry Potter.""
The books also teach kids new words. Megan LeMay, 10, of West Hartford, told
that as she reads, ""I write new words down and look them up in a dictionary.""
Although Harry has cast a spell on kids, some people fear it's an evil spell. The school board in Zeeland, Michigan, decided teachers couldn't read the books to students. Not everyone in Zeeland agreed with that decision.
recently talked to people in Zeeland about Harry.
Some Zeeland parents said they worry that Harry teaches kids to question parents and other authority figures. They also said that many of the characters don't have good values. ""The books don't have characters that are easy to respect,"" said parent Mary Elzinga.
Other parents in Zeeland had no problem with the books. Parent Mary Ocherse said kids
question some authority figures. Teacher Mary Dana agreed. ""Some of our greatest American heroes, such as George Washington, questioned authority,"" she said. ""We need to teach kids how and when to question authority figures.""
Dana also said the characters in the books are good role models kids can relate to. ""Harry is an outsider who is honest and is a good friend,"" she said. ""He makes mistakes, but he always tries to do the right thing.""
When asked their opinion, Erin, Megan, and many other kids said they don't understand what the fuss in Zeeland is about. They all said the Harry Potter books are ""just for fun.""

387,605,"Soaring high above California's coastline stand the magnificent redwood trees. Redwoods are the world's tallest known trees and are also some of the oldest. Some scientists are concerned about a disease that is threatening the ancient giants. It is called sudden oak death.
The disease has scientists alarmed. First identified in 1995, sudden oak death has spread along hundreds of miles of California's coastline and jumped into southern Oregon. In addition to attacking oak trees, it has spread to redwoods, Douglas firs, and other types of trees and shrubs. One of the worst outbreaks of the disease has occurred at California's Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park.
Scientists recently discovered the organism responsible for the disease. It is a fungus that causes oozing red blobs to grow on diseased oak trees. On younger redwoods, it dries up leaves and kills sprouts. According to scientists, redwoods are hosts for the disease. A host is an organism on or in which another organism lives.
The disease first showed up in rhododendron plants in the Netherlands in 1993. Scientists are concerned because the spread of the disease could pose a threat to the redwoods' ecosystem, an environment where plants and animals coexist. Scientist David Rizzo said that anytime you have a strange organism, there is cause for concern.
Coastal redwoods can grow upwards of 360 feet. Some are taller than the Statue of Liberty, which stands about 300 feet.
The diameter of redwoods can measure about 20 feet.
Named California's state tree, the redwood can live more than 2,000 years.
In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Muir Woods a national monument dedicated to protecting and preserving the mighty redwoods.
In 1904, a fungus from Asia began killing chestnut trees in New York. Over the next 50 years, the disease killed about 3.5 billion trees and almost wiped out an entire species. Scientists want to prevent this from happening in California or elsewhere in the United States.
Studies show this disease spreads rapidly during the wet months of spring. The coming months could be vital in tracking the disease. Current weather forecasts predict that this spring will be rainier than the last two springs. ""We have to get familiar with the symptoms and the treatments,"" said another scientist, ""because we don't know how much farther it will spread.""

And they're off! Teams of specially trained dogs are racing to the finish line across one of the toughest terrains in the world.
Along a jagged trail of snow and ice, the teams battle Alaska's below-zero temperatures. They are competing in the Iditarod (igh-DIT-ah-rod) Trail Sled Dog Race, which kicked off on March 6.
The Iditarod is the longest sled dog race in the world. This year, about 90 sled dog teams are running the roughly 1,110-mile route.
The race, now in its 32nd year, starts in the city of Anchorage and ends in the city of Nome. The stretch of land the teams must cross is almost equal to the distance from New York City to Miami.
A team of 12 to 16 dogs tow each sled. It can take more than two weeks for teams to complete the race. In 2002, a record holder completed the race in 8 days, 22 hours, 46 minutes, and 2 seconds.
guide and care for the dogs. Mushers must stop at all 26 checkpoints along the trail. There, animal doctors, called
, check the health of each dog.
During their journey, mushers set up camp to make sure the dogs get enough food, water, and rest. The mushers and dogs are required to stop for at least one 24-hour period and two 8-hour periods.
Not surprisingly, dog mushing is Alaska's state sport. Before mushing became a popular sport, dog teams served as an important form of transportation.
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, miners discovered gold in Alaska. Thousands of people traveled there for the gold rush.
During that time, sled dogs helped people get from place to place and transported gold, mail, and supplies. ""Dog teams were important to settling Alaska during this time,"" race director Joanne Potts told
In 1925, sled dogs in Anchorage delivered lifesaving medicine to sick children in Nome. The Iditarod teams follow the same route. The race
, or honors, that event and the role dog teams have played in the state's history.
Experiencing this year's race up close is fourth-grade teacher Jeff Peterson, from Minnesota. Peterson, who was selected as the 2004 Teacher on the Trail, is reporting on the race.
that the race is as much about the people, culture, and landscape of Alaska as it is about the dogs. ""I've been interested in the Iditarod since I was a kid,"" he said. ""To experience this race firsthand is like a dream come true.""
In January 1959, Alaska became the 49th state. More than twice the size of Texas, Alaska is the largest state.
Alaska's nickname is ""The Last Frontier"" because much of the land is wilderness that remains unsettled.
Mount McKinley, in Alaska, is the tallest mountain in North America.
In 1867, the United States bought Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million, or about 2 cents per acre.
Contrary to popular belief, Alaska is not one giant icebox! In some parts of the state, summer temperatures can reach into the 80s.

Decimals - Place value and ordering decimals
We use a decimal point to separate units from parts of a whole (like tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc).
0.1 is a tenth, 1/10 of a unit
0.01 is a hundredth, 1/100 of a unit
0.001 is a thousandth. 1/1000 of a unit
In 52.13, the value of the figure 1 is 1/10 , and the value of the figure 3 is 3/100.
When ordering numbers, always compare the left digits first.
Eg Which is greater, 2.301 or 2.32?
Both numbers have two units and three tenths, but 2.301 has no hundredths, whereas 2.32 has two hundredths. Therefore, 2.32 is greater than 2.301.
Another way to look at it is to add a zero to the end of 2.32 (this doesn't change its value as it's after the decimal point).
The two numbers are now 2.320 and 2.301 and it is quite easy to see that 2.320 is bigger (just as 2 320 is bigger than 2 301).
Q1. In the number 3.546, what is the value of the figure 4?
Q2. Place the following numbers in order, smallest first: 3.2, 3.197, 3.02, 3.19
A1. The value of the figure 4 is 4/100.
A2. Did you get 3.02, 3.19, 3.197, 3.2?
All the numbers have three units, so start by comparing the tenths. 3.02 has no tenths, 3.197 and 3.19 have one tenth, and 3.2 has two tenths. Therefore, 3.02 is the smallest and 3.2 is the largest.
You could also write the numbers as 3.020, 3.190, 3.197 and 3.200 and compare them.

396,191,"Persuasive texts try to persuade you to do something - like buy something or give money to charity. Magazine articles and newspaper reports may try to persuade you to agree with them.
Are you tired of the daily grind? Sick of working all hours of the day for little reward? Tired of never having enough money to really enjoy yourself?
Here's how to spot this type of text:
It tries to convince you to do or agree with something.
It contains a mix of fact and opinion.
It may use repetition, ""soundbites"" and persuasive or emotive language.
It often seems to speak directly to the reader.
Argument texts should be balanced and fair, and give all sides of an argument before coming to a conclusion.
Here's an extract from an argument text:
Foxhunting is a subject that provokes very strong feelings. Many people believe that it is cruel to hunt a fox with dogs, and totally agree with its ban.
Many farmers, and even conservationists, however, have always argued that the fox is a pest, which attacks livestock and must be controlled.
Here are some clues to help you identify an argument text:
It discusses an issue, considering all points of view.
It often uses a formal and impersonal style to seem balanced.
It uses connectives to connect points, for example ""however"", ""but"", ""similarly""

Diet, drugs and health - Digestion and enzymes
Our teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. Enzymes are needed so that this break-down happens quickly enough to be useful.
Take care - enzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients:
. Carbohydrase enzymes break down starch into sugars.
The saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough, the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet.
. Protease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. Digestion of proteins in the stomach is helped by
, which is strong hydrochloric acid. This also kills harmful micro-organisms that may be in the food.
Lipase enzymes break down fat into fatty acids and glycerol. Digestion of fat in the
, made in the liver. Bile breaks the fat into small droplets that are easier for the lipase enzymes to work on.
are already small enough to be absorbed by the body without being broken down, so they are not digested.
, which is why it cannot be absorbed by the body.

401,336,"When describing coordinates, always count from the origin.
For example, to describe the position of point A, start at the origin and move two squares in the horizontal (x) direction. Then move three squares in the vertical (y) direction.
The coordinates of point A are therefore (2, 3).

The rock cycle - Erosion and transport
Weathering and erosion are often confused, so be careful when answering questions about them.
is the movement of the broken pieces away from the site of weathering.
For example, a basalt cliff may be weathered by freeze-thaw, a type of physical weathering. This means that pieces of the cliff may break away.
Erosion happens when these pieces of rock fall away down the cliff.
In the photograph you can see a basalt cliff. At the bottom there are heaps of rocks, caused by weathering then erosion.
Rivers and streams can move pieces of rock. This is called
. Fast flowing rivers can transport large rocks, but slow moving rivers can only transport tiny pieces of rock.
As the pieces of rock are carried along by the water, they bash against each other and the river bed. They gradually wear away because of this. They become smaller and more rounded.

If you place a set of numbers in order, the
If there are two middle numbers, the median is the mean of those two numbers.
Find the median of each of the following sets of numbers:
a) 2, 4, 7, 1, 9, 3, 11
b) 4, 1, 3, 10, 6, 9,
1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11
The middle number is 4. Therefore the median is
there are two middle numbers (4 and 6), so we find the mean of these two numbers. The median is therefore:
If there are n numbers, the median will be the (n + 1)  2 = th number
If there are 3 numbers, the median will be the (3 + 1)  2 = 2nd number.
If there are 4 numbers, the median will be the (4 + 1)  2 = 2
Rachel records the number of goals scored by her five-a-side team in their first 20 matches.
The results are shown in the frequency table below:
What is the median number of goals scored?
20 matches were played, so the median will be the 21  2
7 matches scored 0 goals, and 5 matches scored 1 goal.

409,473,"Writing the speech is only half the task - the next part is presenting it.
The idea of presenting a speech might make you nervous but some people make speeches every day as part of their jobs. Think about your teachers - they regularly stand up before you and present to the class.
You might notice that some teachers are more interesting to listen to than others. It is not necessarily what they say that keeps you interested, but often how they say it. What do your teachers do to keep your attention? Make a list then compare it with the tips below.
Your listeners will switch off if they can't hear you. Use a loud and clear voice, and if you're unsure if your audience can hear you at the back - just ask ""Can you hear me at the back?""
If you speak too quickly, you won't be clear. If you speak too slowly, your audience is likely to go to sleep. Vary your pace for effect and use dramatic pauses where appropriate.
If you speak like a robot, in the same boring tone, your audience will quickly drift off. Speak naturally and use the pitch of your voice to show your emotions.
You don't have to gurn at your audience! But if you don't look like you're interested in what you have to say, your audience won't be either.
Again, keep it natural, but if you stand like a statue, you won't be very interesting to watch or listen to. On the other hand, too much arm flapping and leg hopping will distract your audience from the point you're trying to make.
Use them, but use them effectively. They need to be big enough to see, interesting to look at and relevant to what you are talking about. Don't be tempted to make a big poster to hide behind!
Choose words that are interesting, descriptive and appropriate to your audience. Don't baffle your audience with jargon or slang or lots of big words that are too difficult for anyone else to understand.
If it's appropriate to your audience and task, try to use Standard English. You don't have to be too formal or put on a silly accent, just speak in a way that is easy for everyone to understand.
Most people feel nervous about speaking formally in front of other people. Here are some tips to help you conquer your nerves:
Write your speech out in full and read it several times - this will help you gain confidence in the content.
Prepare small cards with key points of your speech. By now you should be familiar with your speech so these points will help you keep to your structure. Avoid the temptation to read your speech in full - the idea is to test your speaking skills, not your reading skills!
Practice your performance before the real thing. Try practicing at home on your own, and then in front of family or friends. If you have visual aids, be sure to practice using them.
On the day, take a deep breath, smile and try to enjoy it.
Improve your public speaking and maybe you'll be TV Presenter one day. But it's not all bad!
Talk your way out of trouble using your English skills.

Prospero has Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian in his power. He has them imprisoned, with other survivors (except Trinculo and Stephano who are still with Caliban) in a trance, by his cave.
He tells Ariel to fetch them to him. He says that although it would be understandable if he took revenge on them, he would forgive them if they were sorry for what they had done to him.
He also tells Ariel that he will soon be free, and tells him he will miss him.
Ariel leaves to fetch the group. Prospero, alone, declares that he will give up his magic, break his magic staff and throw his magic books into the sea as soon as this business is over.
When Ariel brings the men back, Prospero places them in a magic circle. After telling them off for the wrong things they have done, he releases them from his spell, so they can now wake up. In order that they will recognise him as they awaken, Prospero sends Ariel to fetch his Duke's clothing and sword.
The men slowly start to come to their senses. They recognise Prospero, but are amazed to see him in such a strange place.
Alonso is very ashamed of what he has done.

416,356,"Imagine that you are buying a t-shirt for 9.99, a pair of socks for 1.49 and a belt for 8.99 The cashier charges you 23.47. You feel that this is too much - but how do you know?
One way of finding out whether you have been over-charged is to estimate what the total amount should be. Round the different prices into easier numbers - 9.99 is approximately 10, 1.49 is approximately 1.50 and 8.99 is approximately 9 - and you can do the calculation quickly in your head.
10 + 1.50 + 9 = 20.50
This is almost 3 less than the cashier asked for, so obviously you have been over-charged.
By rounding the actual values to more manageable numbers, you can estimate the answers to many problems:
3 + 3 + 1 = 7
Round up, round up and try this activity!

418,456,"Test your listening skills with this quiz. Note down your answer to the questions and then 'click ideas' below to see what kind of listener you are.
1. Your group is having an informal discussion about an issue in a book. No one can agree and everyone is talking at once. Do you:
a) Shout the loudest to make sure that everyone hears what you have to say.
b) Seize the opportunity for a nap - no one will notice as they're all too busy arguing.
c) Suggest that you all take it in turns to speak whilst someone writes down everyone's ideas.
2. You've been asked to do a group presentation and there's a girl in the group who is really nervous. She starts to speak, but she suddenly goes silent and bright red. She's forgotten what else to say. Do you:
a) Point at her and burst out laughing.
b) Feel glad that everyone is staring at her and not you.
c) Help her by asking her a question about what she's already said.
3. You've prepared an individual talk on your hobby for homework. Someone else in the class has just given their talk on exactly the same subject. Do you:
a) Just read out what you had written in your notes. You weren't listening to the person who was just speaking, anyway.
b) Screw up your notes and lock yourself in the toilet until the bell rings.
c) Refer back to some of the things the other student said as you go along.
4. Your teacher puts you into pairs and asks you to improvise a missing scene from the play you've been reading. Do you:
a) Say as much as you can to fill the two minute slot you've been given. It doesn't matter if it's irrelevant and it doesn't matter if your partner doesn't get a chance to speak.
b) Allow your partner to do all the talking and keep your reactions to a minimum.
c) Swallow your sense of panic, listen carefully to what your partner says and try and react accordingly, taking turns so that the improvisation makes sense and is balanced.
You are confident and outgoing. You might find yourself going out alone though if you don't try to listen to others more often.
You probably are a good listener...but nobody knows it. Try to be brave and ask people questions during discussions. At least it will take the focus away from you, if that's what you want.
You have excellent listening skills. Well done!

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to argue
The key thing about writing an argument is that you present both sides and come to a clear conclusion. It's not like arguing with one of your friends, when you just say what you think. Instead, when you write an argument you have to show you are reasonable and can consider the different sides.
The following article has appeared in your local paper:
Ashfield Park is threatened with closure next month as a local business has applied for planning permission to turn the area into a car park. Local residents have begun a fierce campaign to save the park, which is a popular walking spot for young children and the elderly, as well as home to the War Memorial and many wildlife species.
Write to your local paper, arguing that the park should be preserved.
It would not be enough to write that you want the park to be saved - it might be how you feel, but it wouldn't be an argument..
It wouldn't even be enough if you wrote about all the good things in the park. That would be
as you haven't thought about any other views.
A good argument presents both the good and bad aspects of keeping the park. For instance, the park might protect nature, but cost a lot to keep clean. It might be a good place to walk, but few people actually go there. An argument depends on bringing these ideas together. Use connectives, like ""because"" or ""however"" or ""although"". These words give your argument a logical structure and help make the contrasts clear.
Once you have worked through these ideas, you come to your conclusion - saying whether they should keep the park or not.

Electric current and voltage - Series & parallel circuits
There are two types of circuit we can make, called
The components in a circuit are joined by wires.
if there are no branches then it's a series circuit
if there are branches it's a parallel circuit
In a television series, you get several episodes, one after the other. A series circuit is similar. You get several components one after the other.
If you follow the circuit diagram from one side of the cell to the other, you should pass through all the different components, one after the other, without any branches.
If you put more lamps into a series circuit, the lamps will be dimmer than before.
In a series circuit, if a lamp breaks or a component is disconnected, the circuit is broken and all the components stop working.
Series circuits are useful if you want a warning that one of the components in the circuit has failed. They also use less wiring than parallel circuits.
In parallel circuits different components are connected on different branches of the wire. If you follow the circuit diagram from one side of the cell to the other, you can only pass through all the different components if you follow all the
In a parallel circuit, if a lamp breaks or a component is disconnected from one parallel wire, the components on different branches
. And, unlike a series circuit, the lamps stay bright if you add more lamps in parallel.
Parallel circuits are useful if you want everything to work, even if one component has failed. This is why our homes are wired up with parallel circuits.

Diet, drugs and health - Absorption and egestion
These are the processes that happen in the digestive system:
We've already looked at how foods are broken down by enzymes in digestion. Now we will look at how the products of digestion are absorbed into the body.
. This means that they pass through the wall of the small intestine and into our
. Once in the bloodstream, the digested food molecules are carried around the body to where they are needed.
Only small, soluble substances can pass across the wall of the small intestine. Large insoluble substances cannot pass through. Study the slideshow to check your understanding of this.
The inside wall of the small intestine needs to be
. This allows absorption to happen quickly and efficiently. If the small intestine had a thick wall and a small surface area, a lot of digested food might pass out of the body before it had a chance to be absorbed.
To get a big surface area, the inside wall of the small intestine is lined with tiny
). These stick out and give a big surface area. They also contain blood capillaries to carry away the absorbed food molecules.
Excess water is absorbed back into the body in the large intestine. What is left then is undigested food. This is stored in the
, the lower part of the large intestine, until we are ready to go to the toilet. It then comes out of the rectum through the

427,46,"There are two different methods for finding the area of this shape:
Divide the shape into squares and rectangles, find their individual areas and then add them together.
Area = 16 + 16 + 48 = 80cm
Imagine the shape as a large rectangle with a section cut out.
Find the area of the large rectangle (12  8) and then subtract the part that has been cut out (4  4)
Area = (12  8) - (4  4) = 96 - 16 = 80cm
In the right area? Find out with this activity.

428,127,"There are two main types of language: literal and figurative.
Literal language is explicit, obvious, out in the open and plainly stated. It is a major part of non-fiction texts, but can also be found in fiction.
Figurative language infers or suggests things rather than stating them. Figurative language can give a text more richness and depth. It is often found in fiction texts and autobiographies, but can also be found in non-fiction.
Find out the difference between fact and fiction.

429,129,"Certain texts, especially non-fiction, will be laid out in ways that
, to make information clear, or to help you find what you want to read. You will not be asked to write in detail about how a text is laid out until GCSE, but your teacher may ask you a short question on layout.
Scan over the following text and note down at least four things the writer has done to make it look more interesting and easy to read.
Red Mount Chapel is on a mound on ""The Walks"" in the park.
Red Mount Chapel is a superb example of the Gothic style in architecture and even boasts its own musical ghost!
Built in 1485 at the time of Henry VII, the first Tudor king, it was a stopping-off place for pilgrims on their way to Walsingham via the port of King's Lynn. Octagonal in shape, it is very small, and had three floors. The top floor is a chapel with fan tracery much like that in Cambridge's King's College.
Underneath the chapel building there is reputed to be a long tunnel (not unusual), running to Castle Rising - a distance of 18km/12 miles (very unusual). An unfortunate, drunken fiddler once decided to explore the dark passageway with his instrument, his dog and his pint! He never reached the end of the tunnel, wherever it went, but his spirit remains and can be heard on occasions playing his tunes and singing, accompanied by the whining of his poor dog!
writing of the heading and unusual font catches our attention.
writing is used for the subheadings, which list the location details.
These details are separated from the rest of the text so they are easy to follow.
The most interesting fact, about the haunting, is mentioned first, and kept in a short paragraph of its own.
An image of the haunted tunnel is used to draw the reader's attention.
subheading is used to draw attention to ""Places of Interest in the Neighbourhood"".
These places are listed, using bullet points to make them clear.

430,188,"> Food chains - Plants and photosynthesis
Before we look at food chains we will go over the way green plants capture energy from the Sun to make food. This is the start of all the food chains we will look at.
Animals eat food to get their energy. But green plants don't. Instead they make their own food, glucose, in a process called photosynthesis. We say that plants can photosynthesise.
These are the things that plants need for photosynthesis:
These are the things that plants make by photosynthesis:
We can show photosynthesis in a word equation, where light energy is shown in brackets because it is not a substance:
carbon dioxide + water (+ light energy)
Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves, and water from the ground through their roots. Light energy comes from the sun.
The oxygen produced is released into the air from the leaves. The glucose produced can be turned into other substances, such as starch, which is used as a store of energy. This energy can be released by
Photosynthesis takes place inside plant cells in small things called
. Chloroplasts contain a green substance called chlorophyll. This absorbs the light energy needed to make photosynthesis happen. Plants can only photosynthesise in the light.

or get bigger when they are heated up. They
or get smaller when they are cooled down. This property can be useful.
Thermometers work because the liquid inside them expands and rises up the tube when it gets hotter.
Metal parts can be fitted together without welding using shrink fitting. The animation shows how this works.
The rod is too big to fit through the hole.
Materials expanding and contracting can also cause problems. For example, bridges expand in the summer heat and need special joints to stop them bending out of shape.
When substances expand or contract, their particles stay the same size. It is the

437,386,"Here are two examples of instinctive behaviour in animals:
Instincts are useful because they do not have to be learned and they can be complex, like the examples above. Instincts let animals form groups for protection, choose mates, fight to be in charge, and show many other behaviours.
Reflexes are a type of instinct. They happen automatically because of a particular stimulus. For example, if your hand touches something hot by accident, it automatically and quickly moves away. You do not have to learn to do this.
In order to see this content you need to have both
When the school bell rings at the end of break time, the students leave the playground and go to their lessons. People may say that the students are acting on instinct. But they would be wrong.
An instinct is a behaviour that happens automatically without any learning needed. The students have learned that the bell is a signal to do something, so leaving the playground when the bell rings is not an instinct. It is learned behaviour.

453,453,"> Speaking - Presentations and reading aloud
Presentations are sometimes less formal than speeches, and you'll probably be asked to present in groups rather than on your own. Use the tips on the previous page to make your performance strong.
Here are some extra tips for group presentations:
Organise the presentation fairly between each group member - ensure that everyone gets their chance to present. If you're shy, don't hide behind your group - you need to take part too!
A group presention needs to come across as a team effort - be careful not to allow over enthusiastic members to dominate.
Work together - if one person is speaking, another person can point to relevant visual aids.
You may be asked to find a poem or an extract from a story to read aloud to your class. Here are some tips to help you with reading aloud:
If you can choose a text you are familiar with this will probably boost your confidence.
Practise your reading using gestures and movement, and don't be tempted to hide behind your book.
Try to look up from your reading several times and make eye contact with your audience.
Vary your pitch and tone and make it relevant to your subject matter. If you're reading something spooky, try to reflect this in your voice. If you're reading a conversation between two characters, attempt to distinguish their voices.
Think about volume and pace - ensure that your audience can hear you clearly.
Improve your public speaking and maybe you'll be TV Presenter one day. But it's not all bad!
Talk your way out of trouble using your English skills.

Energy transfer and storage - Energy basics
Energy can be stored or transferred from place to place in different ways. Let's look at some examples.
things have kinetic energy. The heavier a thing is and the faster it moves the more kinetic energy it has. All moving things have kinetic energy, even very large things, like planets, and very small ones, like atoms.
A vibrating drum and a plucked guitar string transfer energy to the air as
. Kinetic energy from the moving air molecules transfers the sound energy to your eardrum.
Thermal energy is what we call energy that comes from
. A cup of hot tea has thermal energy in the form of kinetic energy from its particles. Some of this energy is transferred to the particles in cold milk, which you pour in to make the tea cooler.
release energy. For example, when an explosive goes off, chemical energy stored in it is transferred to the surroundings as
energy in moving charges in wires. For example, electrical energy is transferred to the surroundings by the lamp as
energy because of its position above the ground and the pull of gravity. This energy is called
. This is the energy it would release if it fell. As the rock falls to the ground, the gravitational potential energy is transferred as kinetic energy.

457,346,"Are you a chatterbox or a master speaker? Note down your answer to these questions and then 'click ideas' below to see what kind of speaker you are.
1. Your group is giving a presentation on a character in the book you've been reading as a class. Do you:
a) Make it up as you go along, forget what you've already said and start to laugh.
b) Spend all your time making a massive poster of the character.
c) Plan what you're going to say, and speak loudly and clearly, even though you feel nervous.
2. Your teacher asks you to read aloud in class. Do you:
a) Read the extract really quickly to get it done as soon as possible.
b) Read the extract and look up at the end when you've finished.
c) Read the extract in a slow and clear manner using emotion and pauses where appropriate.
3. You've written a really good speech and the time has come for you to present it to the class. Do you:
a) Wonder, at the last minute, if you look a bit of a geek, and read out the speech as if it was your granny's shopping list.
b) Hide in the toilet and hope that you'll get good marks for writing the speech even if you don't present it.
c) Try to act out the speech as if it were a piece of drama. You feel a bit nervous, but you want people to know how passionate you are about the subject.
4. During informal class discussions, you usually:
a) Talk as much as possible. Sometimes, even when other people are talking.
b) Keep quiet and let others do the talking.
c) Think about what you want to say before you speak, having listened to other people's ideas.
5. In a class debate, you are put on the team that opposes the motion, 'Meat is Murder', but you are a vegetarian! Do you:
a) Read out the speech that your team has helped you prepare, but lose interest for the rest of the debate.
b) Refuse to take part and say nothing.
c) Use your knowledge as a vegetarian to guess what the proposing team's points might be, so that you can help your team to knock those arguments down and win the debate.
You probably are a good speaker, but you haven't polished your skills yet. Deep down, you'd like people to take you seriously. Well, here's your chance!
You hate speaking and listening assessments and think you're going to die every time the teacher says you've got to do one. What you need to remember is that everyone feels just as nervous as you do. They're all just better at pretending.
You are a great speaker. It's not easy, but you take part and overcome your nerves
Improve your public speaking and maybe you'll be TV Presenter one day. But it's not all bad!
Talk your way out of trouble using your English skills.

, remember that any term that contained the same letter can be combined by adding and subtracting.
3g + 2k + 5g + 4k - g
= 3g + 5g - g + 2k + 4k
Like terms with powers can be added or subtracted but only if the powers are the same.
x is not the same as x
, so they cannot be added together.
Rearrange the expression so that like terms are next to each other:
+ 3x - 2x + 5 - 1
People usually write the expression with the 'x

You already know that the size of an enlargement is described by its scale factor.
For example, a scale factor of 2 means that the new shape is twice the size of the original. A scale factor of 3 means that the new shape is three times the size of the original.
It therefore follows that a scale factor of
To enlarge the triangle with a scale factor of
and centre of enlargement 0, do the following:
Enlarging a triangle with a scale factor of one half
What is the scale factor of enlargement in this diagram?
Remember that OA is 6 units and OA' is 2 units.
BC is 3 units and B'C' is 1 unit, so each side on the image is
of the length of the original shape.
Always check which is the object and which is the image, so that you don't confuse the scale factors. For example, a scale factor of 2 might be mistaken for a scale factor of
, or a scale factor of 3 mistaken for a scale factor of

Energy transfer and storage - Energy transfer diagrams
Energy transfer diagrams show the locations of
. For example, consider the energy transfers in the simple electrical circuit below.
We can show the transfers like this:
the energy to the surroundings by light. These are the
energy transfers - we use electric lamps to light up our rooms.
But there are also energy transfers that are not useful to us. In the example above, the lamp also transfers energy to the surroundings by
. If we include this energy transfer, the diagram looks like this:
Sankey diagrams summarise all the energy transfers taking place in a process. The thicker the line or arrow, the greater the amount of energy involved. This Sankey diagram for the lamp shows that it transfers most of the energy by heating, rather than by light:
Notice that the total amount of energy transferred to the surroundings is the same as the amount of electrical energy. We say that the energy has been conserved. Energy is always conserved, it is never ""lost"" or ""wasted"", although some energy transfers are useful and some are not.

463,249,"> Food chains - Getting carbon dioxide, light and water
Food chains - Getting carbon dioxide, light and water
Remember that the equation for photosynthesis is:
carbon dioxide + water (+ light energy)
Let's see how plants get the carbon dioxide and water they need for this process.
Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves. The carbon dioxide
through small holes in the underside of the leaf called stomata. (One of these holes is called a stoma. The plural is stomata.)
The lower part of the leaf has loose-fitting cells, to allow carbon dioxide to reach the other cells in the leaf. This also allow the oxygen produced in photosynthesis to leave the leaf easily.
A leaf usually has a large surface area, so that it can absorb a lot of light. Its top surface is protected from water loss, disease and weather damage by a waxy layer.
The upper part of the leaf is where the light falls, and it contains a type of cell called a
. This is adapted to absorb a lot of light. It has lots of chloroplasts and is shaped like a tall box.
Turgid plant that's watered regularly and a flacid plant without enough water.
Plants get the water they need for photosynthesis through their roots.
The roots have a type of cell called a root hair cell - these project out from the root into the soil. Roots have a big surface area and thin walls, which allow water to pass into them easily.
Note that root cells do not contain chloroplasts, as they are normally in the dark and cannot photosynthesise.
The water absorbed by the root hair cells passes through the plant in
tubes, and eventually reachers the leaves. If a plant does not absorb enough water, it will wilt or go floppy. Without water it may also not photosynthesise quickly enough, and it may die.

465,296,"> Writer's tricks - Persuading the reader
The extract below is from a leaflet about passive smoking.
. Passive smoking is breathing in other people's tobacco smoke. Other people's tobacco smoke is sometimes called environmental tobacco smoke.
. Only 15% of the smoke from a cigarette is inhaled by the smoker - the rest goes into the surrounding air and other people can breathe it in. Breathing air which contains tobacco smoke can be bad for your health. This is because the tiny particles and gases in tobacco smoke contain over 4000 chemicals, many of which are harmful - at least 60 are known to cause cancer. The gases also contain carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas that comes out of car exhausts.
Q. What is the effect on my health?
. Breathing other people's smoke is uncomfortable and can cause:
nose, throat and chest irritation and breathing difficulties
From a Health Development Agency Passive Smoking Information Leaflet
The following questions will draw on all the skills you have revised so far. Note down your answers then compare them with ours.
Q1. What, according to the leaflet, is ""passive smoking""?
Q2. How much of the smoke from one cigarette is inhaled by the smoker?
Q3. Name one effect that passive smoking can have on our health, according to the extract.
Q4. Who do you think is the target audience for the leaflet?
Q5. Give one reason why you think this.
Q6. Look at the second answer that the writer has given in the leaflet: the one beginning ""Only 15% of the smoke..."". Explain two ways in which the writer has used language to persuade the reader that passive smoking is dangerous.
Q7. Why has the writer phrased each heading as a question?
Q8. Explain two ways in which the writer has used layout to make the text more effective.
A1. Passive smoking is 'breathing in other people's tobacco smoke'.
A2. 15% is inhaled by the smoker.
A3. Coughing. (You could name any of the effects listed in the bullet points.)
A4. The target audience could be teenagers, or a broad audience. It is the reason that you give in the next answer that is more important.
A5. Reasons are: the language used is quite simple; sentences are mainly quite short and simple, many only contain one or two ideas; the information is broken up into short sections; the headings make the information easy to follow. All these would make the text accessible for many readers, including young people.
A6. There are three main ways: the simple statement that it is 'bad for your health'; the fact that tobacco smoke contains 'over 4000 chemicals', many of which are harmful; the mention of carbon monoxide which is 'poisonous'.
A7. The headings are phrased as questions to draw the reader into the text.
A8. Layout has been used in several different ways: the 'Q' and 'A' format is eyecatching; the short paragraphs are easy to follow; the bullet points at the end of the extract make the facts easy to read.

The weathering of rocks by chemicals is called chemical weathering. Rainwater is naturally slightly acidic because
from the air dissolves in it. Minerals in rocks may react with the rainwater, causing the rock to be weathered.
Some types of rock are easily weathered by chemicals. For example,
are made of a mineral called calcium carbonate. When acidic rainwater falls on limestone or chalk, a chemical reaction happens. New soluble substances are formed in the reaction. These are washed away and the rock is weathered.
Chemical weathering can hollow out caves form and make cliffs fall away.
are hard rocks that are weathered only slowly. Still some of their minerals do react with the acids in rainwater to form new, weaker substances that crumble and fall away.
When fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas are burned,
escape into the air. These dissolve in the water in the clouds and make the rainwater more acidic than normal. When this happens, we call the rain '
Acid rain makes chemical weathering happen more quickly. Buildings and statues made from rock are damaged as a result. This is worse when the rock is limestone rather than granite. Acid rain also kills trees and fish.

473,497,"> Atmosphere and setting - Implicit meaning
- it's suggested, but not openly stated. Implicit meaning can be harder to figure out than explicit meaning. Writers like to be clever and draw you into their text. It's up to you to make your mind up about a setting, in just the same way that it's up to you what to make of a new place you visit. Writers often use language in clever ways to build up a sense of atmosphere and setting.
Take a look at the following extract from Robert Westall's novel, 'Urn Burial'. Ralph has been captured by an alien race...
This was the worst nightmare yet. He was standing with his back pressed against a smooth wall cold as ice. The cold nibbled at his buttocks and legs; it ran up and down the knobbles of his spine, making him shiver; it invaded his lungs so he could hardly breathe; he felt he had been shivering a long time.
In the extract, the writer intends to create a very creepy, sinister atmosphere. The way that he describes Ralph's imprisonment makes it sound very unpleasant. He is ""pressed"" against a wall that is ""cold as ice"" and the cold is creeping into every part of his body, making him shiver. Ralph also feels as if he can ""hardly breathe"" because of the cold.
. The simile; ""a smooth wall cold as ice"", helps the reader relate to Ralph as they will know what ice feels like. The writer also uses personification; the cold ""nibbled"" at Ralph, it ""ran up and down"" his back and ""invaded"" his lungs. This makes the cold sound as if it were alive, running over and into Ralph, trying to eat away at him. This adds to the feeling that he has been overpowered and is in danger.

Romeo and his friends have left the Capulets' party. Romeo has run away from his friends. Mercutio has been shouting rude jokes because he thinks that Romeo has gone off with Rosaline. Mercutio and Benvolio finally give up looking for him and go home.
The second set extract begins with Romeo hiding from Mercutio and Benvolio in Juliet's garden. Romeo thinks to himself that Mercutio can never understand how he feels because he has never been in love.
""He jests at scars that never felt a wound""
He watches Juliet as she stands on her balcony thinking out loud. He thinks that she is like the sun
Romeo uses lots of words and images that relate to light when he describes Juliet.: 'sun', 'stars' 'brightness'.
and that the moon is jealous of her because she is so beautiful. He says that her eyes are like two stars that are so bright that they would stop night-time from being dark if they were in heaven, and the birds would sing because they would think that night was day.
Romeo uses more words and images to do with light to describe Juliet.
He idolises her and compares her to an angel.
When Romeo says that Juliet is like an angel from heaven, on the one hand, he is saying how lovely she is. On the other hand, you could say that he doesn't really see her as a flesh and blood person. He idolises her. Do you believe that he can really love her when he doesn't actually know anything about her? Or do you believe in love at first sight?
Juliet, not realising that Romeo is hiding in her garden, imagines what she would say to Romeo if he were there. She says out loud that she wishes he wasn't a Montague, but says that it doesn't really matter because she loves him anyway, and hopes that he loves her. After all, a name is just a word; it doesn't really mean that much.
If we used another word for a rose instead of the word 'rose', eg 'poo', the rose would still be a rose, it wouldn't smell like poo just because we used that word. In the same way, Romeo is still lovely even though his name is Montague.
When Juliet is thinking these things aloud on her balcony, she doesn't know that anyone else is watching. Have you ever practiced saying something to someone, even though you know that you would never be brave enough to say it?
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet
When Romeo replies, Juliet nearly jumps out of her skin.
""My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself""
When Romeo calls her 'dear saint', Juliet realizes who he is. Romeo called her 'dear saint' at the party.
Juliet is very worried for Romeo's safety; he is a Montague on Capulet property. Romeo uses very poetic and exaggerated language to describe how he managed to climb over the walls.
Romeo has been quite brave and perhaps foolish to break into Juliet's garden. He likes to takes risks and doesn't think clearly about the seriousness of his actions. He uses poetic language to exaggerate his bravery.
He declares that he'd rather die than live never having the opportunity to love Juliet.
Juliet admits that she is embarrassed that Romeo heard the things that she was saying about him. She asks him if he loves her too, but she doesn't give him the chance to answer.
Juliet is worried that she has shown herself to be too keen on Romeo. In Shakespeare's day, nice girls weren't supposed to show that they were interested in boys.
Juliet's speech is very long! Is she nervous or embarrassed? Is she a chatterbox? Is she so excited about her new love that she can't stop talking about it?
Romeo begins to use poetic language about the moon to describe how much he loves her, but Juliet won't let him finish.
Time - Juliet won't let Romeo finish his sentences! Poor Romeo! We already know how much he loves to speak! Juliet's mind is working very quickly. She is excited, but also worried about how suddenly they have fallen in love.
She says that if he swears by the moon, he might turn out to be just as changeable as the moon (the moon changes its shape throughout the month).
She worries that they have fallen in love so quickly.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.
She tries to say goodnight, but she is excited and passionate about her feelings for Romeo and can't seem to stop talking about it.
""My bounty is as boundless as the sea.
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite""
Juliet's use of imagery seems more heartfelt than Romeo's: her love is as deep as the sea, and the sea never runs out. That's passion!
Juliet's Nurse shouts to her from inside the house. Juliet asks Romeo to wait. As she goes into her bedroom, Romeo thinks to himself that their love seems like a dream.
Love - Is this true love? How could it have happened so quickly? Do you believe in 'love at first sight'? Remember, that same evening that he met and fell in love with Juliet, Romeo was moping about saying that he would never love anyone as much as he loved Rosaline! Romeo might argue though that he didn't really know what true love was until he met Juliet.
Juliet comes back out onto the balcony and tells Romeo that if he is serious about her, she will send a messenger out to him tomorrow to find out where and what time they will get married!
Time - events happen very quickly in this play. In less than a week, Romeo and Juliet fall in love, get married and die.
She says goodnight to him as her Nurse impatiently tells her to come inside.
Romeo finds it hard to say goodnight to her.
Romeo said that he was in love with Rosaline in the first extract. Less than a day later, he claims to be in love with Juliet. Has he really thought about the consequences of marrying Juliet. Perhaps, when you are in love, nothing else matters. What do you think?

Graphs - Plotting y = ax + b using tables
To plot a graph, you need to find some coordinates that satisfy the equation of the graph.
Plot the graph of y = 2x + 1
We need to choose values for x and see what value of y they give.
y = (2  -2) + 1 = -3
y = (2  0) + 1 = 1
y = (2  2) + 1 = 5
You can show this in a table:
You can now plot these points and join them to give the graph of y = 2x + 1:
In order to see this content you need to have both

479,566,"> Measures of average - The mean
The mean is the most common measure of average.
To calculate the mean add the numbers together and divide the total by the amount of numbers:
Mean = sum of numbers  amount of numbers
Five friends compare their marks in a French test. These are shown below:
Mean = (41 + 54 + 79 + 26 + 65)  5
Check your answer by asking yourself if it looks about right. If you had forgotten to divide by 5 then the answer would have been 265, which would not have made sense. Always check that your answer seems sensible.
A die is thrown 10 times. The following results are obtained:
3, 5, 1, 2, 6, 4, 2, 5, 6, 1
To find the answer, add the numbers together and divide by the amount of numbers:
Mean = (3 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 5 + 6 + 1)  10
How mean are you? Find out with this activity

480,594,"is a category within the classification system. Living things of the same type belong to the same species. For example, humans are one species and dogs are another species.
Individuals of the same species can reproduce to make more individuals of the same species. Two individuals belonging to different species cannot normally reproduce together. If they do, their offspring is usually infertile and unable to reproduce.
For example animals called ligers are produced when a male lion and a female tiger reproduce. But a liger cannot have offspring. This means that lions and tigers are different species.
All people are human. They belong to the same species. Your friends and classmates may have different eye colour and hair colour. Some will be boys and some will be girls. Some will be tall and some will be shorter. The presence of differences between living things of the same species is called variation.

481,101,"Try out these example questions about relative frequency.
Q1. 100 people were asked whether they were left-handed. Four people answered 'yes'. What is the relative frequency of 'left-handed'?
Q2. A white counter was taken from a bag of different coloured counters, and then replaced. The relative frequency of getting a white counter was found to be 0.3. If the bag contained 20 counters, estimate the number of white counters.
A1. The relative frequency is 4/100 =
A2. The relative frequency of white counters is 0.3, and there are 20 counters in the bag, so, as an estimate, 0.3  20 =
Relative frequency can only be used as an estimate.

Explore, imagine and entertain - Appealing to the senses
One way of being creative is appealing to the senses.
Let's go back to our description of a coastline. Imagine you want to write about a cliff, concentrating on the sense of sound, sight, touch, taste and smell.
- the waves crashed on the rocks beneath and I heard the gulls screaming above me.
- the heavy, grey rocks looked as if they were about to slide into the leaden sea.
-the wind lifted my hair and I felt sudden gusts sting my face.
- the spray from the waves hit my face and I could taste the salty water on my lips.
- the damp, warm scent of the seaweed rose gently.
Now, see if you can use the same list of senses to describe another sea scene. This time, describe a sunny beach. You don't have to tell a story, just make your description come alive and imagine that you really are there. Once you've written it, compare your ideas to ours on the next page...

Inform, explain and describe - Add the senses
Another way to add detail to your descriptions is to use your senses. Think about what you can see, what you can touch, what you can smell, what you can taste and what you can hear. If we go back to your house, you might be able to add sounds, like music from your sister's room, the sound of the neighbour's lawnmower, or a baby crying upstairs.
Here's a typical writing to describe question:
Write a description of your school during a typical break. Include information about the buildings and the people. You might want to write about the classrooms, the hall, the playing fields and the corridors as well as the pupils and the staff.

487,330,"Ducklings are able to walk almost immediately after hatching from the egg, and can even swim after a few days. They recognise their mother because of a behaviour type called
Ducklings will follow the first moving object they meet after hatching. They become socially attached to this object and treat it as their mother.
Imprinting lets young animals recognise their mother from a young age. They can follow her for food and protection.
Imprinting is useful if the first moving object they see really is their mother. But ducklings will imprint on people, balls and even cardboard boxes if these happen to be the first things they see.
Geese, chicks, and other baby birds that can walk around shortly after hatching, also show imprinting behaviour. Konrad Lorenz (1903 to 1989) was an Austrian scientist who studied animal behaviour.
He discovered that if he reared geese from when they hatched, they became imprinted on him. They followed him around and preferred to be near him even when they had grown into adult geese. Lorenz won the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine because of his experiments on animal behaviour.

There are many different ways of doing this. If it's a ghost story, you can leave it unsure and open, as if something else might happen next. Like this
He turned away just as a shadow rose up from the bricks. Was it a trick of the light? Or something else?
In other pieces, you need to come to a definite answer, like this
Once the trees are chopped down and the play equipment bulldozed away it will be too late. Too late to save our park. Too late to think about our children. And too late to remember those who died for our freedom. So act now to safeguard this valuable, beautiful area for the future.
If you get it wrong, it can seem silly, like these examples
Once the trees are chopped down and the play equipment bulldozed away it will be too late. Act now to safeguard this valuable, beautiful area for the future. But remember that it could still be a car park, and create jobs for our community. Think about it - are you sure? I certainly don't know what to think.
This person isn't sure what they want. So how can they convince anyone else?
Once the trees are chopped down and the play equipment bulldozed away - well who knows, really. It's one of those things, and who can blame anyone.
This argument has just fizzled away. There is no more detail. Make sure you don't waffle at the end.

491,164,"The beginning, or opening, is one of the most important sections of your writing. It should grab the reader's attention and make them want to read on. For instance, which is the best beginning for a ghost story?
a) The house was built in 1975. It was a typical semi-detached, but it did have quite an impressive front door. Most of the windows were double glazed and the garden was quite neat.
b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.
There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.
So you need to think about TAP (text, audience and purpose) and make a good start to your writing. You should try to 'set a context', which is like setting the scene. So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on.
a) The subject I am going to write about today is why the local park should not be closed.
b) Have you ever stopped to wonder how many hundreds of people make regular use of our Memorial Park?
a) It is unlikely that newspaper readers who enjoy all the things that our park has to offer will want it to disappear forever under tons of concrete.
b) 'Ashfield Park will be ruined,' claim protestors who held a meeting last night to organise opposition to the council's plans for a car park.
It should be clear that the ""b"" versions are better - they fit the style and show that the writer has used TAP to make their writing work. Remember - you need to make it interesting right from the start.
The importance of beginnings, middles and ends.

492,141,"> Measures - Speed, distance and time
Speed is worked out by dividing the distance travelled by the time taken:
If you travel at 70 km in 2 hours. What is your average speed?
Speed = 70  2 = 35 km/h
The distance in km and the time in h, so the units for speed are km/h.
If you know the speed, you can work out the time or the distance by re-arranging the equation.
hours at an average speed of 4 miles/h. How far will you have walked?
Distance = 4  1.5 = 6 miles

493,462,"The table shows some of the most common units and their equivalents. Make sure you know these conversions.
To convert a larger unit to a smaller unit (eg m to cm), first check the number of smaller units needed to make 1 larger unit. Then, multiply that number by the number of larger units.
To convert a smaller unit to a larger unit (eg cm to m), first divide it by the number of smaller units which are needed to make 1 larger unit.
To convert from a larger unit to a smaller one,
To convert from a smaller unit to a larger one,
So, to convert from m to cm multiply by 100, and to convert from cm to m divide by 100.
3.2m = 320cm (3.2  100 = 320)
400cm = 4m (400  100 = 4)
Convert the following to the units given in brackets:
Remember that 1kg = 1000g. To convert from g to kg, divide by 1000.
Remember that 1cl = 10ml. To convert from cl to ml, multiply by 10.
Remember that 1m = 1000mm. To convert from mm to m, divide by 1000.

Astronomy and space science - Days and nights
as they orbit the Sun. It takes the Earth 24 hours to make one complete turn on its axis, so an Earth day is 24 hours long.
Different planets take different amounts of time to make one complete turn, so they have different lengths of day.
The Sun lights up one half of the Earth, and the other half is in shadow. As the Earth spins we move from shadow to light and back to shadow and so on. It is daytime in the UK when our part of the planet is in the lit by the Sun. And it is night-time in the UK when our part of the planet is facing away from the Sun.
During the day, the Sun appears to move through the sky. Remember that this happens because the Earth is spinning on its axis. In the UK if we look south and follow the path of Sun in the sky during the day, it looks like this:
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west
. That's because the Earth is spinning towards to the east, so we see the Sun first appear there at the start of the day. The Sun 'rises' in the east and 'sets' in the west.
One way to remember which way the Earth turns is to remember ""
"", which means the Earth spins from west to east.
Star trails made by leaving the camera shutter open during the night
During the night, we cannot see the Sun. But the Earth is still spinning on its axis. This means that the stars appear to move from east to west in the sky, just as the Sun does in the day.

495,374,"Now consider the following extract. Read through it carefully and note down three things you think it tells us about the main character. Once you've done this, compare your ideas against ours.
Stanley didn't have many friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.
What does this extract show us about the main character?
Stanley is another big male, but it is clear that the writer wants us to react differently to him than we did to Jim Wellings in the earlier extract.
Stanley is a lonely boy, because he ""didn't have many friends at home"". He is bullied and teased, even by adults. The fact that the teacher causes him ""embarrassment"" by showing him up in front of the class proves that he feels uncomfortable about his weight.

Acids, bases and metals - Bases and alkalis
Bases are substances that react with acids and neutralise them. They are usually metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal carbonates or metal hydrogen carbonates. Many bases are insoluble - they do not dissolve in water.

All alkalis are bases, but only soluble bases are alkalis
You will have used some strong bases and alkalis at school, such as
. Like acids, their bottles are labelled with the warning symbol for
. This means that they will make your skin red or blistered unless you wash off any spills with plenty of water.
Alkalis feel soapy when they get on your skin, so it is easy to tell when you have had an accident and must wash your hands.
. They can attack metals and destroy skin if spilled. They are just as dangerous as concentrated acids, but many people do not realise this.
Bases react with oils and fats, so they are often used in strong household cleaners. Drain cleaners and oven cleaners usually contain sodium hydroxide for example. And
is also commonly used in cleaners. Ammonia can be recognised by its choking smell.
It is wise to wear gloves when using these substances, otherwise they will react with your skin and burn it.
Weak bases and alkalis are found in toothpaste, antacid tablets (to help cure an upset stomach) and baking powder.

Number patterns - Number patterns in diagrams
A number pattern in a diagram often requires counting shapes to find the rule. Again, look at how the pattern grows from one term to the next.
Pattern 1 has 0 orange tiles and 3 blue tiles, so 3 tiles altogether
Pattern 2 has 1 orange tiles and 5 blue tiles, so 6 tiles altogether
Pattern 3 has 2 orange tiles and 7 blue tiles, so 9 tiles altogether
Q1. Based on the number patterns above, draw pattern 4.
Q2. Look again at the number patterns above. Write the rule and the fourth terms for:
Pattern 4 has 3 orange tiles and 9 blue tiles, so 12 tiles altogether
a) The rule for the number pattern of orange tiles is 'add 1' and the 4th term is 3.
b) The rule for the number pattern of blue tiles is 'add 2' and the 4th term is 9.
c) The rule for the number pattern of all tiles is 'add 3' and the 4th term is 12.
Follow the rules and try this activity!

501,154,"> Inform, explain and describe - Describing
When you describe, you need to give lots of detail and make the words interesting for others to read. For example, if you wanted to describe your home, you wouldn't just write lots of facts, like this:
My house was built in 1972 of red brick with a pitched concrete tiled roof. The house was extended in 2003 with a small UPVC conservatory and an adjoining patio area of approximately 8 square metres...
This gives lots of facts, but these are the types of facts that someone buying a house might need. Most people would find a description like this boring. So what should you do?
The first thing is to think about what you want to show other people. Do you want to concentrate on the roof tiles or the types of bricks used? Or do you want to tell them about the fence panel your brother broke when he was chasing you last summer?
You could also write about the time Stephanie threw a tennis ball and it got stuck in the guttering - it's still there - and when it rains really hard the gutter overflows. You might even have a gnome in the front garden, which your grandad bought - it looks stupid, but you won't move it in case you offend him.
Each of these details is far more interesting than roof tiles or measurements. So, when you are describing something, think of drawing a picture or taking a photograph. You focus on a certain point, write a paragraph about it, then move to the next point and the next.

> The rock cycle - Sedimentary rocks
There are three main types of rock:
, pieces of broken rock as it flows along. When the river reaches a lake or the sea, its load of transported rocks settles to the bottom. We say that the rocks are
. The deposited rocks build up in layers, called
The weight of the sediments on top squashes the sediments at the bottom. This is called
. The water is squeezed out from between the pieces of rock and crystals of different salts form.
The crystals form a sort of glue that sticks or cements the pieces of rock together. This process is called
These processes eventually make a type of rock called sedimentary rock. It may take millions of years for sedimentary rocks to form.
These are the different processes in order:
The river transports bits of rock, and deposits them on the bottom of the river bed.
Sedimentary rocks contain rounded grains in layers. Examples of sedimentary rock are:
The oldest layers are at the bottom and the youngest layers are at the top. Sedimentary rocks may contain fossils of animals and plants trapped in the sediments as the rock was formed.

Sometimes you need to rearrange the formula to find the value you're looking for.
The area of a circle (A) is
This is useful if we know the radius of the circle and want to know the area. But what if we want to find the radius?
We need a formula that has r = (some expression in A). We get this by rearranging the A =
[Then find the square root of both sides]
[Swap the sides to make it easier to read]
The formula has been rearranged. We say that now r is
Q1. The formula to find the circumference of a circle: C = 2
Rearrange the formula to make r the subject.
Q2. The formula to convert the temperature in F to the temperature in C is :
Rearrange this formula so that it will convert the temperature in C to the temperature in F (so that f is the subject). Write down your working, then check your answer.
r, so divide both sides by 2
9c = 5(f  32) [multiply by 9]
= f - 32 [divide by 5]

forces. These forces act in the opposite direction to the movement. Friction makes it harder for things to move.
friction between our shoes and the floor stop us from slipping
friction between tyres and the road stop cars from skidding
friction between the brakes and wheel help bikes and cars slow down
Frictional forces are much smaller on smooth surfaces than on rough surfaces, which is why we slide on ice.
Friction can also be unhelpful. If you don't lubricate your bike regularly with oil, the friction in the chain and axles increases. Your bike will be noisy and difficult to pedal.
When there is a lot of friction between moving parts, energy is lost to the surroundings as

as they move. Air resistance is caused by the frictional forces of the air against the vehicle. The faster the vehicle moves, the bigger the air resistance becomes. The top speed of a vehicle is reached when the force from the cyclist or engine is balanced by air resistance.
Racing cyclists crouch down low on their bikes to
the air resistance on them. This helps them to cycle faster. They also wear streamlined helmets. These have special, smooth shapes that allow the air to flow over the cyclist more easily.
Modern cars are also streamlined. Their smooth shapes make the air resistance smaller, which allows them to travel further on the same amount of fuel.

Approximation - Rounding to a given number of places
Decimal places are counted from the decimal point:
So, the number 5.1492 has four decimal places and 4.34 has two decimal places.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places, look at the number in the next decimal place.
If it's less than 5 round down
If it's 5 or more, round up
Q1. Round 7.2648 to 2 decimal places (d.p.)
Q2. Round 8.352 to 1 decimal place
To round to two decimal places, look at the number in the third decimal place. It's a 4, so round down.
To round to one decimal place, look at the number in the second decimal place. It's a 5, so round up.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places then the answer must have that number of decimal places, even if you have to add some zeros.
For example, rounding 3.40021 to two decimal places gives 3.40 (2 d.p.).
You need to write both decimal places, even though the second number is a zero, to show you rounded to two decimal places.
Remember to look at the number after the one you're interested in. If it's less than 5, round down. If it's 5 or more, round up.

describes the condition of the atmosphere. It might be sunny, hot, windy or cloudy, raining or snowing.
Temperature is how hot or cold something is, for example the atmosphere or the sea. Use a thermometer to see how many degrees Celsius/centigrade it is above or below freezing point (0 degrees C) .
Precipitation is the term given to moisture that falls from the air to the ground. In the UK, the most common form of precipitation is rain, but snow, hail, sleet, drizzle, fog, and mist are also precipitation.
Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. Air can only hold a certain amount of water before condensation and precipitation occurs. Humidity is measured as a percentage, relative to the saturation point where the air can hold no more water vapour (ie 100 % humidity).
Atmospheric pressure is the weight of air resting on the Earth's surface. Pressure is shown on a weather map with lines called isobars. Low pressure occurs when air is warm and rises. High pressure occurs when air becomes colder and sinks.
of the part of atmosphere (air) closest to the surface of the earth.
The weather is constantly changing as temperature and humidity change in the atmosphere. Landmasses, such as the British Isles, experience constantly changing weather conditions.
is the average weather conditions - temperature, pressure, precipitation and humidity - expected for a certain place. Climate is based on the average weather experienced over 30 years or more.
Climate refers to what is expected to happen in the atmosphere rather than the actual conditions. It is possible for the weather to be different from that suggested by the climate.
Climatic conditions in an area can be affected by the landscape, relief and activities taking place (both human and natural). Climate can alter over time and space.
Within a climatic region, the climate may vary from place to place - eg the top of a hill, the sunny side of a hill, the shaded side of a hill and the bottom of a hill. These areas with their small variations are called
The science of monitoring and studying the atmosphere and predicting its weather and climate is called
. People who study the weather and climate are known as meteorologists.
Climates are influenced by many factors, such as proximity to the equator or the poles and proximity to the sea, as well as things like ocean currents, atmospheric pressure belts and
The prevailing wind is the wind direction that occurs most often throughout the year, or occurs most often at this time of year, in a certain geographical region.
A place's climate influences the types of vegetation and animals that live there. It is possible to divide the world into a number of climatic zones or

Temperatures drop the further an area is from the equator. Due to the curvature of the earth. In areas closer to the poles, sunlight has a larger area of atmosphere to pass through and the sun is at a lower angle in the sky. As a result, more energy is lost and temperatures are cooler.
In addition, the presence of ice and snow nearer the poles causes a higher
Albedo is a measure of how much sunlight a surface reflects.
. This means that more solar energy is reflected, also contributing to the cold.
Locations at a higher altitude have colder temperatures. Temperature usually decreases by 1 C for every 100m in altitude.
Oceans heat up and cool down much more slowly than land. This means that coastal locations tend to be cooler in summer and warmer in winter than places inland at the same latitude and altitude. Glasgow, for example, is at a similar latitude to Moscow, but is much milder.
. A warm ocean current called the
keeps Britain warmer and wetter than places in continental Europe.
The prevailing wind is the most frequent wind direction a location experiences. In Britain the prevailing wind is from the southwest, which brings warm, moist air from the Atlantic Ocean. This contributes to the frequent rainfall. When prevailing winds blow over land areas, it can contribute to creating desert climates.
The British Isles have variable weather that changes from day to day between different regions and within different regions. Consequently it is very difficult to predict or forecast the weather.
Britain has four distinct seasons of fairly equal length - spring, summer, autumn and winter. In winter it is colder and wetter and the days are shorter than in summer.
Different parts of the UK experience slightly different regional climates. These can be summarised as:
- cool summers, mild winters, heavy rain all year.
- cool summers, cold winters, steady rain all year.
- warm summers, mild winters, light rain all year, especially summer.
- warm summers, mild winters, heavy rain all year, especially winter.
The variability of weather and climate in different regions of the British Isles is due to the different air masses that meet over the Isles. Each air mass brings with them different characteristics, as shown in the map below.
Prevailing winds and climate zones in the UK
are greatest along the south coast of England (average of 1750 hours of sunshine per year) and are least in mountainous areas (average less then 1000 hours).
Scotland has shorter winter days and longer summer days than the rest of the UK, because it is further north. In the north of Scotland there are four more hours of daylight in mid-summer than in London.
On average it rains one in three days in the UK. However, rainfall varies greatly from region to region. It is generally wetter in the west than the east and wetter in the highlands than the lowlands. The wettest place is Snowdonia in Wales (average annual totals exceeding 3000 mm of rain a year), followed by the Highlands of Scotland, the Lake District, the Pennines and the moors of southwest England.
Parts of the east, such as East Anglia, receive less than 700 mm a year.
In most places in the UK it will rain twice as much in winter months as in summer months. Although in central and south-eastern England, and parts of southeast Scotland, July and August are often the wettest months of the year. In London and Birmingham it will thunder on average 15 days a year, compared to less than 10 elsewhere in the UK.
Average temperatures in UK are warmer at lower
Latitude is the distance a place is from the equator. Lines of latitude are lines on a map showing distance from the equator. Lower latitudes are nearer the equator, higher latitudes are further from the equator.
and colder at higher latitudes. They are also warmer at lower

and colder at higher altitudes. Average yearly temperatures at low altitude vary from 7C in The Shetlands, in northern Scotland, to 11C on the southwest coast of England. The coldest (and highest) place is Ben Nevis - altitude: 1344m - where the average temperature is less than 0C.
The coldest months are January and February and the warmest are July and August. In summer Scotland will be about three degrees cooler than England. The average daily maximum temperature at Glasgow in July is 19C compared with 22C in London.
Scotland tends to be worse affected by severe weather than the rest of the UK. Snow is more common in highland regions than in lowland areas, so while snow might fall on the south west of England less than 10 days a year, it will fall on the peaks of the Cairngorm Mountains over 100 days a year.

travelling across the Atlantic Ocean. These depressions may pass close to or over Scotland, with Orkney and Shetland experiencing the strongest winds. Occasionally they can reach hurricane force, eg the storm in October 1987.
Climate graphs show average rainfall and temperatures typically experienced in a particular location. The temperature is shown on a line graph, and rainfall on a bar graph. They are usually represented on the same set of axes with the months of the year along the base.
Look at the shape of the graph. Is the temperature line steep or gentle? Does it change throughout the year and/or look almost flat?
Look for extremes  quote the highest and lowest temperature and rainfall and the month in which it occurs. Remember to quote units, eg Celsius or millimetres.
Can you identify the seasons when most rain or least rain falls? Or when the highest and lowest temperatures are experienced?
Work out the temperature range by subtracting the lowest figure from the highest figure.
Add the rainfall totals for each month together to work out the total annual rainfall.

. In 1937, Gring was made Economics Minister with the job of making Germany self-sufficient in four years. However, the measures he introduced were not successful:
Controls were put on imports, but, if anything, imports of luxuries increased.
Scientists tried to make oil from coal and to find substitutes for rubber, petrol, cotton and coffee.
Farmers were subsidised to produce more food, and food imports were reduced.

Renaissance knowledge about the body and disease
The Early Modern Age was an exciting time for medicine, with knowledge of the human body progressing in fundamental ways - although the causes of disease remained a mystery.
Two key practitioners moved knowledge forwards in the Early Modern Age:
Follower of Vesalius in graveyard, searching for bodies to dissect
, whose patron was Charles V of Spain. He trained at Louvain, Paris and Padua universities, and ransacked cemeteries and gibbets for bones and for bodies to dissect.
. He also realised that the famous doctor Galen could be wrong, when he discovered that the great man was mistaken about there being two bones in the jaw, and about how muscles were attached to the bone.
He became professor of medicine at Padua University. He said that medical students should perform
""... our true book of the human body is man himself.""
He published 'Fabric of the Human Body' (with high-quality annotated illustrations).
- who discovered the principle of the
through the body. He trained at Cambridge and Padua universities, and became doctor to James I and Charles I of England.
He calculated that it was impossible for the blood to be burned up in the muscles (as Galen had claimed).
He published 'Anatomical Account of the Motion of the Heart and Blood', which scientifically proved the principle of the circulation of the blood. This book marked the end of Galen's influence on anatomy.

524,1949,"In your German exam you will have to show your reading skills. This exercise will help you understand an article where some students describe where they live.
Read these short descriptions, given by Claudia, Eva, Michael and Lars, of where they live. Don't worry if you don't understand every word at this stage.
Ich wohne seit vierzehn Jahren in Herborn. Ich fahre oft nach Gieen, aber ich bin immer froh, wenn ich von der Uni wieder nach Hause fahren kann. Es gibt zwar nicht sehr viel zu tun, aber das macht mir nichts aus. Ich brauche nur meine Freunde anzurufen und in zehn Minuten sitzen wir zusammen in einer der vielen Kneipen in der Altstadt und reden miteinander. Und nachher kann ich einfach nach Hause laufen.
Ich wohne in einer Wohnung in Offenburg, etwa fnf Gehminuten vom Bahnhof. Es gefllt mir dort, denn ich kann morgens im Stadtpark joggen. Ich habe daran gedacht, nach Freiburg zu ziehen, weil es dort viel mehr zu tun gibt, besonders was Sport betrifft. Aber da so viele Leute dort studieren wollen, sind die Lebenskosten viel hher und ich muss ein paar Jahre warten, bis ich dahinziehen kann.
Ich wohne immer noch bei meinen Eltern in Spiesen-Elversberg. Das liegt am Waldrand, etwa fnf Kilometer sdlich von Neunkirchen. Es ist ganz schn ruhig hier und man kann sich gut vom Schulstress erholen, aber abends und am Wochenende wird es mir langweilig. Meine Eltern sind super und fahren mich nach Neunkirchen zum Kino und holen mich oft sehr spt ab. Ich freue mich schon auf nchstes Jahr. Bis dann habe ich hoffentlich meinen Fhrerschein. Dann htte ich vor allem in Saarbrcken eine grere Auswahl an Filmen.
Seit fnf Jahren wohne ich auf dem Lande. Frher habe ich in Berlin gewohnt. Klar hat das Spa gemacht, in einer Weltstadt zu wohnen. Aber ich denke jetzt nie daran und auf dem Bauernhof habe ich alles, was ich brauche. Das geht allerdings nicht ohne Wagen und Telefon, denn hier gibt es so gut wie keine ffentlichen Verkehrsmittel.
Wer ist das? Schreiben Sie den Namen, der am besten passt.
Eva finds it restful at home after school.
Living costs are too high in Freiburg for Michael to move there.
Lars moved from Berlin five years ago.

Read the text through once, aiming to get a general sense of each paragraph. Don't worry if there are words that you don't understand - look for similarities with English words, for example:

525,4766," in textile factories after 1785, then in distilleries, iron forges and blast furnaces, coal mines, engineering firms, waterworks.
 at first, railways used stationary steam engines to wind wagons up banks. Then in 1800, Trevithick invented the steam-powered locomotive. The first steam-powered boat was built in 1802. This had significant effects, not only on industry and agriculture and the transport of goods, but on the transport of people and their mobility and social lives (eg holidays at the seaside).
 the steam engines used coal, so industry was located on the coalfields.
 steam engines were expensive, so mainly large firms could afford them. The steam engines allowed large-scale production.
 the steam engines never flagged or stopped, so this required significant changes in the way people worked. There was now no requirement for workers to be strong or skilled and, if a person was big, it could now be a disadvantage. The steam-powered machine did all the work, so children replaced men as the key workers in industry.

with inputs, processes and outputs. The most common method of manufacturing electronic products is the batch method - though one-off production and continuous-flow production are also important.
ICT is used extensively in electronics manufacturing. The use of machines that are controlled by computers is called computer-aided manufacture or CAM.
Electronics systems diagrams are used to show how the parts of a product work together. Many electronic products are made up of a number of standard system circuits (circuits that are common to many different products), such as sensors, amplifiers, timers, counters and output devices.
System diagrams usually take the form of a
in which each part of the electronic system is represented by an input, a process or an output.
The block diagrams below shows two types of system.
has no feedback mechanism, so the accuracy depends on how well the system was set up before hand.
electronic systems use sensors to provide feedback. This means that if the output is not satisfactory, the inputs or processes can be altered.

533,6002,"There are already ways in which we can reduce the air pollution caused by the burning of fuels, and others may be developed in the future. New applications that result from scientific research are subject to official regulations and laws.
Coal is an example of a fossil fuel
The fossil fuels include coal, natural gas and the products from the fractional distillation of crude oil, such as petrol and diesel. When any fossil fuel is burned, one of the combustion products is carbon dioxide.
amounts of fossil fuels have been burned each year. This has led to an increase in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air. Many scientists believe this is causing
Global warming refers to the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's surface. In the last 100 years it is believed to have risen by 0.6 degrees C. There are estimates that in the next 100 years, the global temperatures could rise by as much as 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.
One way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air is to burn
fossil fuels. Unfortunately, we depend on the burning of fossil fuels for heating, electricity generation and transport. If we are to burn less fossil fuels, we will need alternatives for these essential activities.
Clouds of smoke and other combustion products are emitted from chimneys
Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.
to produce electricity are one of the main contributors of carbon dioxide in the air.
One way to reduce the air pollution caused by power stations is to
. Some ways to do this are:
turning off lights when you leave a room
using a microwave instead of an electric oven
from 2006 about saving energy in the home.
Power stations give out sulfur dioxide which is a cause of
Acid rain is rain that contains a high level of acids. These acids can contaminate drinking water, damage plants and water creatures and buildings. It is believed to be caused by pollution and, maybe, natural activity such as volcanic eruptions.
. The amount of sulfur dioxide given off by a power station can be reduced by:
removing sulfur from natural gas and fuel oil
removing sulfur dioxide from the flue gases emitted by coal-burning power stations
Coal-powered stations give off solid particulates. These can also be removed from the flue gases.
Atmospheric pollution caused by the exhaust gases given out by motor vehicles can be reduced by:
Exhaust gases given out by motor vehicles causes atmospheric pollution
burning less fuel by having more efficient engines
using catalytic converters, which convert nitrogen monoxide to nitrogen and oxygen, and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide

is about the finding of the lost boy, who has been following a 'wandr'ing light'. God appears and leads him back to his mother, who has been searching for him.

Blues songs were so called because of their often sombre content, reflecting the unhappiness of slaves' lives. They became a national craze in 1920s America.
Jazz was first developed around 1902 in the red light district of New Orleans, by the cornet player Buddy Bolden and other musicians.

537,1546,"What is it? How do you know?
What type of publication do you think text 2 is? A comic? A newspaper? A magazine? A web page? A business document?
This one isn't so easy, so let's rule some things out...
: No. Comics are generally brightly coloured and full of cartoons. This isnt!
: No. Newspapers generally use narrow columns, black and white print and the pages are very full when you look at them.
: No. There are no giveaway clues such as 'click here', 'contact us', 'print this page' - so it cant be a web page.
: No. In a magazine, one would expect to see more writing and pictures on each page. This layout is too spacious.
: You are pretty close - text 2 comes from the Environment Agency. This is from the booklet the organisation would give to members of the public if they asked for information about what the Government is doing to protect and improve the environment.

describes the condition of the atmosphere. It might be sunny, hot, windy or cloudy, raining or snowing.
Temperature is how hot or cold something is, for example the atmosphere or the sea. Use a thermometer to see how many degrees Celsius/centigrade it is above or below freezing point (0 degrees C) .
Precipitation is the term given to moisture that falls from the air to the ground. In the UK, the most common form of precipitation is rain, but snow, hail, sleet, drizzle, fog, and mist are also precipitation.
Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. Air can only hold a certain amount of water before condensation and precipitation occurs. Humidity is measured as a percentage, relative to the saturation point where the air can hold no more water vapour (ie 100 % humidity).
Atmospheric pressure is the weight of air resting on the Earth's surface. Pressure is shown on a weather map with lines called isobars. Low pressure occurs when air is warm and rises. High pressure occurs when air becomes colder and sinks.
of the part of atmosphere (air) closest to the surface of the earth.
The weather is constantly changing as temperature and humidity change in the atmosphere. Landmasses, such as the British Isles, experience constantly changing weather conditions.
is the average weather conditions - temperature, pressure, precipitation and humidity - expected for a certain place. Climate is based on the average weather experienced over 30 years or more.
Climate refers to what is expected to happen in the atmosphere rather than the actual conditions. It is possible for the weather to be different from that suggested by the climate.
Climatic conditions in an area can be affected by the landscape, relief and activities taking place (both human and natural). Climate can alter over time and space.
Within a climatic region, the climate may vary from place to place - eg the top of a hill, the sunny side of a hill, the shaded side of a hill and the bottom of a hill. These areas with their small variations are called
The science of monitoring and studying the atmosphere and predicting its weather and climate is called
. People who study the weather and climate are known as meteorologists.

Neurons carry signals from one place to another, around the many parts of the nervous system. They connect sense receptors to the central nervous system and also connect one part of the nervous system to another, for example in the brain and spine. They also
from the nervous system to effector organs, such as muscles and glands.
When neurons are stimulated they transmit an

The living substance inside a cell (not including the nucleus).
. The cytoplasm forms a long fibre that is surrounded by a cell
. The axon carries the electrical impulse and is protected by a fatty sheath - a bit like the plastic coating around an electrical wire. The fatty sheath increases the speed at which the nerve impulse is transmitted. The nerve ending is branched to make good contact with other neurons or the effector organ.
Two neurons do not make direct contact. Where they meet, there is a very small gap called a
a tiny gap at the junction between two nerve cells which nerve signals must cross
. The signal needs to cross this gap to continue on its journey to, or from, the
Central Nervous System (brain and spinal cord).
. This is done by means of chemicals which

540,5869,"Jane is excited about returning to Thornfield and Mr Rochester, even though she believes he is married to Blanche Ingram. It is obvious when they meet that Rochester is delighted to see her, too.
What follows is ""a fortnight of dubious calm"", in which Jane expects to hear about the marriage but nothing is said.
On midsummer eve, Jane goes into the garden after Adele has gone to bed. She finds Mr Rochester there. The scene is described in extraordinary detail, as it moves to his proposal.
He is perhaps teasing or testing Jane as he talks of her having to move on, claiming to have found her a new position in Ireland. Eventually, however, he proposes, revealing that any chance of a relationship with Blanche ended when he pretended to have less money than she considered acceptable.
Rochester talks frequently of what he is doing as being wrong, but claims his love and care for Jane will atone for it. As readers, we think there could be something sinister behind this. However, Jane does not pick up on more than his emotion as they go into the house.
Jane is blissfully happy, but still aware that Mrs Fairfax seems shocked. So she asks Mr Rochester to speak to her the following day. Her congratulations, when they come, seem very subdued, fuelling our suspicions.
Jane decides she will not abandon her previous path. She refuses expensive gifts and spends a lot of time with Adele. Mr Rochester is eager to be with her, but allows her to dictate terms in this way in the four weeks leading up to the wedding.
Then we hear of a very bizarre episode. Mr Rochester has had to go away. When he returns, Jane describes having been woken by someone in her room. She describes the woman in hideous terms, and explains that her wedding veil was ripped in two, so it could not have been a dream. Mr Rochester encourages her to continue to blame Grace, and insists she shares Adele's room the night before the wedding.
The wedding morning arrives. Mr Rochester is possessed by tension and a desire that everything should be done quickly. Even Jane is encouraged to hurry.
There are no family present at the wedding. Perhaps for this reason, Jane notices two men, apparently waiting for the ceremony, enter the church before them.
When the priest asks if there is any impediment to the marriage, one of the men, Mr Briggs - a lawyer - explains that Rochester is already married to the sister of Mr Mason, who comes forward at this point.
Clearly, there can be no marriage. Mr Rochester takes them back to Thornfield to see his wife, Bertha, a dangerous lunatic, and Grace, her keeper. Bertha attacks Mr Rochester, but he is able to restrain her. Even though
The crime of marrying one person while still being married to another.
is a serious crime, it becomes easy to understand what drove him.
Before Briggs and Mason depart, we learn that it was a chance connection between Jane's uncle in Madeira and Mr Mason that brought Briggs and Mason to stop the marriage. We also learn that Jane's uncle is on his death-bed.
Jane spends a long time numb with shock at what has happened. She eventually meets with Mr Rochester and he tries everything in his power to keep her with him. He explains how he was trapped by his family into the marriage, and how he spent time in Europe seeking, in vain, some kind of escape.
He asks Jane to come away with him, but she is controlled by conscience and cannot allow herself to be loved by a married man. She knows she cannot stay with him and keep her resolution, so says she will leave.

541,865,"The three main causes of population change are:
- usually measured using the birth rate (number of live births per 1000 of the population).
- usually measured using the death rate (number of deaths per 1000 of the population) .
- the movement of people in and out of an area.
of population change. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate of a country or place is called the
. The natural increase is calculated by subtracting the death rate from the birth rate.
natural increase = birth rate - death rate
The rate of natural increase is given as a percentage, calculated by dividing the natural increase by 10.
For example if the birth rate is 14 per 1000 population, and the death rate is 8 per 1000 population, then the growth rate = 14 - 8 = 6

Some employers required their overseers to raise a minimum amount each week from fines.

(line 8) sounds miraculous: we are reminded of the first breath a new-born baby breathes, or a puppeteer in a fairy tale who makes his puppets come to life.

The silent crowd is drawn by the dread of it (line 10): they can't stop watching. The

Words strung together with repeated (often initial) consonants, eg Max made many men mad.
Words that sound the same through the use of similar vowels or consonants, eg hot and slop or fold and filled.
are used to make the description more vivid. Look at:

sounds imitate the sound and 'feel' of swans in flight.
Lines of poetry that make up a unit; verses.
In poetry, the use of words which have the same or a similar sound - eg 'flow' and 'bow' - to form a pattern of sound.
(for example, earth/breath and bowed/soaked), which creates the effect of a distant echo.
The fourth stanza contains one very long, sprawling sentence, broken over several line-ends: it's hard to grasp exactly what is being said, beyond the impressions of shadowy willows, murky water, and low-flying swans. This lends an obscure, dream-like feeling to the description.

545,1137,"A theme is a subject or idea that keeps appearing in the text. You usually find more than one theme in a story. They help to hold the story together, and often encourage us to think more about the plot, and what lies beyond it
""You're so innocent, you didn't realise. You're too trusting, too kind, you don't know what these people can be like.""
The narrator wishes her daughter was still innocent like a young child. She is shocked and disgusted at the evidence she finds of her growing experience.
The mother also feels guilty and ashamed of her own sexual experience before marriage, and has kept it a secret. This relates to the narrator's obsession with purity.
The word 'white' is often mentioned. And cleanliness is important to her, too.
The daughter, by contrast, is seen as 'dirty', lying 'on a pile of filth', living the most sordid life the narrator can imagine.
What is interesting about these contrasting ideas is that we realise things are not always what they seem. The narrator seems to have high moral standards, but when she was young she broke the rules, too.
""I had to help with the housework but my brother did nothing.""
The narrator seems to have different standards for men and women:
It's OK for men to use bad language, but not women.
Fathers are in charge, and might be strict if you do not abide by the rules.
Men do not like to talk about emotions.
Women should keep the house tidy and learn to cook.
Women should not say how they feel. They should also avoid being rude.
When a man loses his temper, a woman should accept this and not defend herself.
Women who try to make themselves look attractive are 'tarts'.
Girls who are curious about sex before marriage are 'dirty'.
Which of these points do you agree or disagree with?
You may think it is no wonder the daughter ran away. You might also comment that these expectations belong to a different era to the modern day.
""Rows of high heels, all of them too small for her, she was so vain, all of them moulded to the shape of her feet.""
The narrator wants to control her daughter, but finds that she cannot do this.
The narrator feels the need to control her emotions. She finds this increasingly difficult as the story progresses.
The daughter displays a lack of control: she loses her temper, drinks alcohol, binges on food, and does not want to wait until marriage before having sex.
The narrator's mother displayed a lack of control, too: she was ""plump"", said things without thinking, and had rows of shoes that were too small for her - but wore them anyway, rather than sensible shoes.
The narrator finds comfort in the fact that she can lock up the shoes, tie them together, make them clean, and keep them safe and warm in bed.
""They're best in here with me I think, safe and warm in bed. Tucked up tight.""
The narrator could not live up to her father's expectations.
Her daughter is not living up to her expectations.
The narrator is sad that she was not close to her mother.
She recognises the distance between herself and her daughter's generation.

550,1138,"Try to split problems of this type into a series of two-dimensional questions. It is easier to work in two dimensions than three. Look at the following example.
has a square base that is 4cm long. The height of the pyramid is 3cm.
O is the centre of the base, so AQ is half of AC.
are equilateral triangles with sides that are 4cm long.
QU is part of the triangle QUV, where V is the point we used in the first part of this question, midway between S and R.
For this question, you will need to use the answers from the previous questions. Use the perpendicular height of the prism, UV, which is
and the base is 18.8 (1 dp).
Keep your answers in surd form (like
), or store them in the memory of your calculator. Using rounded values later on in a question will lead to inaccurate answers.
You might also be expected to apply the sine or cosine rules to a 3-D problem. Look at the following example.
Sally and Kate stand some distance away from a building (B) which is 10m high. Sally is on a bearing of 030 from the building. From where she is standing, the angle of elevation of the top of the building is 35. Kate is on a bearing of 090 from the building. From where she is standing, the angle of elevation of the top of the building is 50. This information is shown in the diagram.
What is the distance between Sally and Kate?
In the same way we can find OK = 8.39m (3 s.f.)

551,2508,"German 19th-century scholar, who founded Marxism (key theory of Communism).
People should contribute to the public wealth according to their ability, but receive according to their needs.
The means of production should be owned equally by the whole community (hence communism), not as in capitalism where individuals (who might be very rich) own the means of production and leave the rest of society to be poor and oppressed wage slaves.
A deterministic interpretation of history, which said that society must inevitably develop through successive stages of slavery, feudalism, then capitalism, ending up with the violent overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a communist society.
They should work to overthrow capitalism throughout the world by means of a revolution by the proletariat (workers).
Class was a feature of capitalist society, and should be destroyed and replaced by a society of equals.
The economy should be planned - controlled by the government.
Lenin changed Marx's ideas to add that a Communist government first had to be a dictatorship which was essential in order to bring in the communist state safely.

trained dogs to expect food whenever he rang a bell. The dogs eventually produced saliva when they heard the bell ring.
The dog salivates naturally when given food.
Pavlov rings a bell every time the dog eats.
After much repetition the dog salivates when the bell rings, even when there is no food.
. The dogs were conditioned to salivate when the bell rang.
A ringing bell does not normally cause salivation in dogs. However, when the ringing bell becomes a secondary stimulus, it does cause salivation, even though the dog will not be able to eat the bell as food.
This is now called a conditioned reflex. In a conditioned reflex the final response (salivation) has no direct connection with the stimulus (ringing bell).
Predators mistake the hoverfly for a wasp due to similar markings
For example, birds will not eat caterpillars with bright colouring because they are conditioned to think of bright colours as poisonous. Some caterpillars use this to their advantage. Their bright colours protect them, even though they are not poisonous.
How often have you run away from a harmless hoverfly because it has the same markings as a wasp?
a reflex response. It does this by sending an impulse along a motor neuron of the reflex arc. This enables us, for example, to hold onto a hot dinner plate when normally we would drop it.
Put down that pen and listen to some additional Science audio.

560,4899,"Some music is written with 'block' chords, some music has weaving parts around the tune, while some has no harmony at all. These are all examples of
Music that has no chordal accompaniment, where different instruments or parts play or sing the same notes is described as in
Here is an example of unison: a male choir singing a traditional Armenian hymn.
This literally means 'sounding together'. Homophonic music is played in block chords. Sometimes, homophonic music is called chordal music, it means the same thing.
Here is an example of music with a homophonic texture, written by Henry VIII.
This literally means 'different sounds or voices'. Polyphonic music has parts that weave in and out of each other. Sometimes this is called contrapuntal music - it means the same thing.
Polyphonic music may contain an element of imitation, where one voice or instrument copies what has just been played by another. (Think of a roundsong like
Listen to this example of music that has a polyphonic texture, from JS Bach's
A fugue is a special type of polyphonic texture. Fugues always begin with a tune that is played on a solo instrument/voice or by instruments/voices in unison. This tune is then played by all the other instruments or voices in turn but not necessarily at the same pitch.
Here is an example of a fugue. Notice how the solo starts the fugue tune and then the other voices join in one at a time.
A capella music is always for voices. It describes vocal music that has no instrumental accompaniment.
A capella music can be polyphonic, homophonic or unison - so you might see a piece of music described as 'homophonic a capella' or 'polyphonic a capella'.
The words 'a capella' in Italian mean 'In the style of the chapel'. This is because early music for the church was for unaccompanied voices.
Listen to this example of a capella singing - yodelling from Gabon in Africa.
This is a melody which can be sung or played on an instrument, with an accompaniment. A song with piano accompaniment falls into this category.
Here is an example of melody and accompaniment:
This texture is when a solo is heard which is immediately answered by another tune played or sung by a group. It is used a lot in popular music, jazz music and music from other cultures.
Here is an example of a call-and-response song from Latin America
Listen to this extract of music by Mozart that only uses the words 'Kyrie Eleison' and 'Christe Eleison' and comment on the textures voices and instruments you hear.
: The music starts with just one instrument and one voice. The other voices and instruments then join in one at a time. At the end, all the instruments and voices play their own tune starting at different times.
Talvin has obviously heard that the voices have tunes starting at different times, but has not gone into enough detail about it. He didn't mention any instruments or voices by name and couldn't mention any of the textures by name either.
: The music starts with just the trombones and the bass voice. This type of texture is called 'unison'. The alto voice then joins in making the texture weave in and out. The voices sing Kyrie Eleison. A high voice then comes in singing a tune to the words 'Christe Eleison' which adds to the weaving style. There are timpani and strings in this piece. At the end, all the voices are weaving in and out of each other.
This is a good answer by Sarah. She has named one texture, unison. She heard that the music was 'weaving' but didn't use the proper word 'polyphonic'. She has also correctly identified one voice and an instrument.
: The music begins with the trombones and bass voices in unison. The voices sing the words 'Kyrie Eleison'. The alto voices then join in with faster notes singing the words 'Christe Eleison'. The texture is now polyphonic. The Soprano voices then sing the 1st tune (that the basses sang at first) to the words 'Kyrie Eleison' while the tenor voices sing the tune that the altos sang earlier to the words 'Christe Eleison'. The texture is still polyphonic. Timpani are heard to add emphasis to the bass part. Towards the end, all the voices sing both tunes to both sets of words in a polyphonic texture. Overall, the music has two tunes. The style is a fugue, where the tunes overlap each other.
Geeta has used the proper words to describe the textures and the voices/instruments used in this excerpt. She spotted that each set of words 'Kyrie Eleison' and 'Christe Eleison' has its own tune. Finally, she correctly identified the piece of music as being a fugue.

561,2621,"In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems look at the power the older generation have over the younger but 'We Remember' is from the older generation's point of view, Kid from that of the younger generation.
Robin in Kid has broken free from Batman and now has the upper hand; the child in the Duffy poem still feels downtrodden.
A feeling of potential conflict between a group of people. In an audience or reader, a sense of potential conflict, or a feeling of anxiety due to what may be about to happen.
between generations, both from the point of view of the older generation.
The young people in the Yeats poem seem to have a pleasant time of it; the child in We Remember seems very unhappy.
Both poems about the distance between parent and child, both from the point of view of the older generation.
Margaret's love for her child is clearly genuine - the parents 'love' in the Duffy poem rings hollow.

562,6930,"William Blake: The Little Boy Lost / The Little Boy Found
are deceptively simple poems, written as if spoken by children. They are generally hopeful and optimistic. The
are also childlike in approach, but darker and more pessimistic.
When Blake published them together, he called them
Shewing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul.
This suggests he believed people needed both 'states' to understand life. Many of the
poems have a poem that 'answers' them in the

In the extract from Karimah's work journal, shown below, you will see how she has explained her work to others. This was a statement she included with her exhibition of coursework. Along with her other notes and explanations, she was able to help others understand how she had developed her ideas and work.

My art exhibition shows a series of artwork that I have created which all deal with my journey from Nigeria to England. During the term, I have created a series of art pieces that concentrate on the theme of 'Identity'. In the art pieces, I explore the journey that I have made from Nigeria to live in England. The reason that I have focused on this subject under the title of 'Identity' is because, the journey I have made was a life changing journey and it is a significant part of my identity.
I first started exploring this journey by creating self portraits, this was to develop my skills and ideas in art to help me to become more advanced. I then planned and created a collage of Africa. This collage shows the journey that I made to England from Nigeria, through symbols, colours and pictures used to represent the contrasting countries. The main elements that I included in my collage work is that England has a cool calm atmosphere and climate whilst Nigeria is hot and roars with excitement and noise. Nigeria has a beautiful collection of exotic animals that run wild and free, whilst in England the animals are locked up in a zoo. The environment in England is clean and fresh but in Nigeria, it is dirty and humid. I chose to show my journey this way because it is an effective way of showing the striking difference between England and Nigeria.
After the first collage I realised that collage is my strongest point in art and I began to produce a series of mixed media pieces that featured collage. 'Tree of Life' is a piece where I used a symbol of a tree to represent my life growing out of a symbol of Africa. In 'The first self portrait collage' I used maps to show the physical part of my journey. 'The second self portrait collage', is a piece where I used the different flags of England and Nigeria to show my journey and the comparison between England and Nigeria.
I have linked my theme of 'Identity', with numerous artists because they have all been exploring a similar theme to me. Gerard Quenum is an African artist who uses dolls to symbolise identity, Richard Long, an artist who expresses his journeys through photographs, Louise Bourgeois who deals with her identity by using memories of her childhood, Frida Khalo a Mexican artist who uses powerful images to show her identity and Henri Matisse who uses his knowledge of African art and refines it into a simpler form in his pieces of art. I have been to the National Gallery, the Tate Modern, the October Gallery, the Century City exhibition and the library to learn about artists that may have connections with my theme.
I have been exploring my cultural and family background through family photographs. This is because the photographs prompt ideas for units of work and they tell different stories through the atmosphere or pose in the picture.
The journey in the art pieces is presented in mixed styles of aboriginal art and African art. I do this to experiment with the different ways of presenting my journey to viewers and to give a variation in the techniques and arts styles that I use.
My progress whilst creating units of artwork has improved dramatically compared to the beginning of term where I was unable to develop and explore ideas. Overall, I am pleased with the way that I have managed to link all my units of artwork together all under the topic of 'Identity'. I have improved my art skills from the beginning of the term, when I had very little art skills. I am glad that I can now expand and explore ideas, compared to when I first started art and I could not develop an idea because of lack of experience and knowledge of art.

567,4852,"Generators can be turned directly, for example, by:
When electricity is generated using wave, wind, tidal or hydroelectric power (HEP) there are two steps:
Generators can be turned indirectly using fossil or nuclear fuels. The heat from the fuel boils water to make steam, which expands and pushes against the blades of a
. The spinning turbine then turns the generator.
These are the steps by which electricity is generated from fossil fuels:
Heat is released from fuel and boils the water to make steam.
The turbine turns a generator and electricity is produced.

569,1615,"is part of a line which has two end points (ie, it is not infinite). Each end of a line segment is usually labelled with letters.
If A is the point (1, 1) and B is the point (4, 5), what is the length of the line segment AB?
It is not easy to picture this without drawing a sketch. Have a look at the diagram below:
A has an x-coordinate of 1. B has an x-coordinate of 4. So, to get from A to B, we move along 3 units.
A has a y-coordinate of 1. B has a y-coordinate of 5. So, to get from A to B, we move up 4 units.
We have created a right-angled triangle. So to find the length of AB we use Pythagoras theorem.
If P is the point (1, 5) and Q is the point (5, 1), what is the length of the line segment PQ? Give your answer correct to 1 decimal point (d.p.).
If you get a question like this, it is fine to draw a sketch or diagram. If you get really confident, you might be able to answer the question without using a diagram.
If X is the point (1, 1) and Y is the point (3, 5), what is the midpoint of the line segment XY?
It is clear from this diagram that the midpoint of (1, 1) and (3, 5) is (2, 3).
In fact, the x-coordinate of M is the average of the x-coordinates of X and Y
And the y-coordinate of M is the average of the y-coordinates of X and Y.

570,4377,"Iron and steel rust when they come into contact with water and oxygen. They rust faster in salty water or acid rain. Aluminium, on the other hand, does not corrode easily, because its surface is protected by a layer of aluminium oxide.
Steel and aluminium have advantages and disadvantages when used to make cars, which are recycled to re-use valuable materials and cut down on waste.
Iron and steel rust when they come into contact with water and oxygen. Both water and oxygen are needed for rusting to occur. In the experiment below, the nail does not rust when air - containing oxygen - or water is not present:
Calcium chloride absorbs water in the right-hand test tube
Salt dissolved in water does not cause rusting, but it does speed it up, as does acid rain.
Aluminium does not rust - corrode. Its surface is protected by a natural layer of aluminium oxide. This prevents the metal below from coming into contact with air and oxygen.
Unlike rust, which can flake off the surface of iron and steel objects, the layer of aluminium oxide does not flake off.
reaction. The iron reacts with water and oxygen to form
, which we see as rust. Here is the word equation for the reaction:
iron + water + oxygen    hydrated iron(III) oxide
Most iron is converted into steel - an alloy - before being used. Compared to iron, steel is:
Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.
Cars are complex machines. Many different materials are used in their manufacture.
The main materials used in the manufacture of cars
tough and easily moulded to desired shape
good heat insulators, and can be woven into fabrics
European Union law requires that at least 85 per cent of a cars materials can be recycled, rising to 95 per cent by 2015. Recycling reduces the amount of waste, and the use of natural resources.

There are many roles you could try in addition to playing the sport, like coaching younger teams to see if teaching may be a hidden talent! Earning a qualification by taking courses and awards may help guide you towards longer-term job prospects.
Outside influences and social groupings may mean you take up a certain sport or avoid it altogether. One things certain, weve got more leisure time than ever, so why not do something physical with it?
Your school can influence you to become a lifelong participant in sport as a player, organiser or official. Schools have to teach PE within the National Curriculum. Within this you will experience a number of
. Each has benefits to you and others.
Improve your knowledge of the rules. Can still contribute when unable to play.
Allows teachers to teach rather than umpire/referee
Develop organisational skills, stay involved in sport if not able to participate
Enable sport to happen and arrange competitions etc
Outlet for creativity, develop ideas beyond your own ability
Provide exciting and challenging context for dancers
When thinking about the other ways in which school can influence the
of sports in which pupils participate, consider the ways in which each of the following has an impact:
- how do GCSE, JSLA etc help? Can these courses lead to a career in sport?
- does your school have a swimming pool, Astroturf pitch, sports hall or tennis courts?
- what sports activity does your school have outside of PE lessons?
- are they positive? Do they have favourite sports? What if your favourite isnt the same as theirs?
- are you introduced to clubs in the area?
Your school's links with local clubs can affect your participation
Role models such as David Beckham, Tanni Grey-Thompson and Kelly Holmes have had a huge influence on participation in recent years.
Women are now accepted as managers, officials and club directors although this was not always the case.
Some sports, such as squash, have declined in popularity whilst womens football and extreme sports are booming. Media coverage of sport affects participation levels. So does the rising concern about safety which has stopped a lot of 'free play' on the streets and in parks.
A number of organisations have responsibility for sport and these both

are the groups to which you are 'attached' because of your circumstances. Social groupings can have either a positive or negative influence on your involvement in sport.
If they enjoy and play sport, you will join in.
If they do not share your interest, they can encourage you to give up sport.
An interest in specific sports will encourage participation. Inherited ability may help you to be successful. They provide good role models.
They may influence you to move away from a sport you like and towards their favourite sport. If they do not like sport, it may be hard for you to get support.
Boys often find it easier to access sport. Women are now active in developing women-only gyms and teams. This encourages participation.
Some people may expect you to conform to
An assumption based only on a general expectation.
behaviour. Opportunities for women are increasing, but support is still limited in some areas. Some religions do not encourage women to participate.
Some ethnic groups have a particular interest in certain sports. This cultural influence encourages participation.
Racist attitudes still make participation uncomfortable for some sportspeople, so they may quit.
All sports are available if you can afford them.
Sports needing lots of equipment, travel or expensive facilities are not available to those with little money.

The pressure to conform to the actions of people of the same age and background.
is very strong during the teenage years. This can encourage participation, or make it difficult to do your own thing.
Leisure time is the time we have when we are not working, taking care of ourselves or completing our family and home duties.
It has increased as a result of:
Better working conditions - paid holidays have increased
We can choose what we do in our leisure time. Local authorities and the leisure industry try to influence us to take part in physical activity and sport. Local authorities have targeted certain user groups by offering them
A reduction in the usual price of a ticket granted to a special group of customers, eg students
, such as special opening times, reduced fees and organised classes- to encourage participation.
Facilities are provided for participants of all ages and levels of ability including:
Crystal Palace, Bisham Abbey, Lilleshall, Holme Pierrepoint, Plas-y-Brenin
also provide stadiums, playing areas and leisure clubs.
Golf courses can be run by the council or privately owned
The provision of facilities is always based upon:
Location  is it in the right place? Can permission for it be obtained?
Scope  does the location and the size of the site enable the provision required? Can it be accessed easily?
Funding  can the funds be found to build it? Can they be sustained to keep it running?
Hosting a major event leaves locals with improved facilities
Hosting sports events can be very expensive but many cities and countries compete to be awarded the football World Cup, the Commonwealth Games, the Olympics and a number of other competitions.
There are pros and cons to this:
Advantages of hosting a major sporting event
Disadvantages of hosting a major sporting event

572,3606,"In a bid to improve roads, the first Turnpike Trusts were set up in 1663. These organisations introduced tolls on roads and aimed to use the money raised to maintain the roads. However, the Turnpike Trust scheme still had its problems.
The first attempt in Britain to improve roads started in 1663. This was when the Turnpike Trust was set up. The trusts had one simple aim:
to charge people to use newly improved roads
and then the money raised from the tolls was used to pay for the upkeep of the roads.
who were sometimes more interested in making a profit than maintaining the good condition of roads for their customers. The businessmen had to get an Act of Parliament passed to build their turnpike and had to employ professional road surveyors, treasurers and reputable road engineers.
A carriage passes through the toll gate while engineers survey the road
As you can see from the illustration, the road engineers built
gates across the entrance of the roads
and then toll keepers collected tolls from people using the roads. People were charged different tolls depending on the method of transport they were using. This money was then meant to be used to maintain the roads.
Some trusts did maintain their roads and
(such as Thomas Telford) to build straighter and better roads. However, people who had always used local roads did not like suddenly having to now pay for the same route. For example, during the Rebecca Riots in Wales (1842-44) rioters dressed as women burned down toll keepers' cottages and tollgates in protest at road tolls.
out of a possible 120,000 miles were improved by Turnpikes.
and many minor roads were still in a bad condition.
Trusts began to care more about making a profit than the upkeep of road surfaces and often tried to charge
along routes to make extra money and this began to slow down people's journeys.
from roads as Britain's quickest and cheapest form of transport.
To make sure that you are clear about the changes that took place with roads look back at the diagram and then try to recreate it on a piece of paper.
As part of your revision, think about the

have limited amounts of the resources needed by the living organisms who live in them. Animal (including humans) and plant organisms can only survive if they can get enough resources from their habitat, and they must compete with other organisms for these resources.

Moniza Alvi: Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan
Moniza Alvi was born in Lahore in Pakistan, the daughter of a Pakistani father and an English mother. She moved to Hatfield in England when she was a few months old. She didn't revisit Pakistan until after the publication of her first book of poems - 'The Country over my Shoulder' - from which this poem comes.
Presents from My Aunts...was one of the first poems I wrote. When I wrote this poem, I hadn't actually been back to Pakistan. The girl in the poem would be me at about 13. The clothes seem to stick to her in an uncomfortable way, a bit like a kind of false skin, and she thinks things aren't straightforward for her.
I found it was important to write the Pakistan poems because I was getting in touch with my background. And maybe there's a bit of a message behind the poems about something I went through, that I want to maybe open a few doors if possible.

577,6456,"Where no profit or loss is made ie where total revenue = total costs.
point is when a firm begins to make a profit. It will make a loss if it produces and sells output below this level.
The breakeven point for a firm is when total costs equals total revenue. Expenditure and income are the same and the firm makes neither a profit or a loss. If the firm can sell at production levels above this point, it will be making a profit. If sales fall below this point, it will be making a loss. Establishing the breakeven point helps a firm to plan the levels of production it needs to be profitable.
Before you can calculate the breakeven point, you need to identify the firm's costs. These include:
Renting an office block is part of a company's fixed costs
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
are constant and do not change however many goods are produced. They include rent and insurance.
Wages paid to employees are part of a company's variable costs
These change according to output eg raw materials.
include raw materials and wages. You need to calculate the variable costs per unit. These costs increase in direct proportion to the number of units produced.
By adding the firm's variable costs and fixed costs you can work out the
Fixed costs plus variable costs make total costs.
The firm's variable costs are added to the fixed costs and these make the total costs.
You need to establish how many units are to be produced.
You need to know the selling price of the units.
Once you have the above information, you can begin to calculate the breakeven point. You do this either by using a chart or an equation.
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
These change according to output eg raw materials.
You may find it helpful to work through the
Here is how to work out the breakeven point, using the example of a firm manufacturing compact discs. You can assume the firm has the following costs:
You first construct a chart with output (units) on the horizontal (x) axis, and costs and revenue on the vertical (y) axis. On to this, you plot a horizontal fixed costs line (it is horizontal because fixed costs don't changewith output).
Then you plot a variable cost line from this point, which will, in effect, be the total costs line. This is because the fixed cost added to the variable cost gives the total cost. To do this, you multiply:
variable cost per unit  number of units
In this example of the CD manufacturing firm, you can assume that the variable cost per unit is 2 and there are 2 000 units = 4,000
Once you have done this, you are ready to plot the
The value of sales at a given output ie sales price multiplied by output.
sales price  number of units (output)
If the sales price is 6.00 and 2.000 items were to be manufactured, the calculation is:
6.00  2,000 = 12,000 total revenue
Where the total revenue line crosses the total costs line is the breakeven point (ie costs and revenue are the same). Everything below this point is produced at a loss, and everything above it is produced at a profit.
Fixed costs: 10,000, Variable costs: 2 per unit, Sales price: 6 per unit
If you read downwards, it tells you how many units you need to produce and sell at this price to breakeven: 2,500 CDs
If you read across, it tells you how much money you must spend before you recover your outlay: 15,000
As with any calculation, it is easy to make a mistake. There are two simple equations you can use to double-check your answer. You can calculate the breakeven point in:
Either way, the result should be the same.
For the breakeven point in costs/revenue, you then multiply the breakeven point in units, which you have just calculated, by the sales price.
If you look at the breakeven chart, you will see this is the correct answer.
Breakeven analysis is a favourite exam topic. In an exam, you could be asked to complete a breakeven chart. With these two equations, you'll be able to double check your calculations, get them right and improve your marks.
Use the example of the CD manufacturer above and plot your own chart with the same costs, but this time with a different total revenue line:
You should have calculated a breakeven point of 2,000 units and a costs revenue of 14,000.
If you have made a mistake, calculate the breakeven point in units, and then in costs/revenue again and double check your calculations again.

The presence of a potentially harmful substance that can reduce quality of a natural resource, such as water, and have knock-on impacts on the environment.
. Industrial pollution can affect the environment in a number of ways:
It may damage the well-being of humans and other species - for example, it can pollute drinking-water supplies or poison plants and animals.
It may interfere with natural processes - for example, it could change local climatic conditions or destroy wildlife habitats.
It may impact on people's livelihoods - for example, pollution of the sea will hurt people who are involved in fishing and tourism.
Some governments have introduced legislation to try to cut down on avoidable pollution and to encourage industries that are more
Sustainable means using something or doing something in a way that minimises damage to the environment and which avoids using up natural resources, eg by using renewable rather than scarce resources.
. These laws need to be enforced by courts.
A recent example of courts taking action against a company for causing pollution was in 2004 when a US court ordered the oil company
to pay 2.5bn for an oil spill in 1989.
ran aground while off course. It spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil contaminating over 1,300 miles of the coast of Alaska. It is estimated that the spill killed as many as 250,000 seabirds, 3,000 sea otters, 300 seals and 22 killer whales.
The court wanted Exxon to pay to help compensate those people in Alaska whose livelihoods were hurt the worst. The 2.5bn pay out is the latest ruling in a long-running court case.

581,3045,"There were two types of water transport available in Britain before the 18th century - coastal shipping and navigable rivers. However, although both these methods were useful, they still had their problems, so something new was needed...
Bad weather was a risk of coastal shipping
, but ships could be affected by tides, winds and pirates.
Heavy goods such as coal and iron could only be transported by coastal shipping and not by roads.
Some rivers had to be widened and deepened for large ships
Rivers that were large enough and deep enough to link towns and cities in Britain were called navigable rivers.
The main navigable rivers in Britain were the Thames, Severn, Humber, Trent and Mersey.
rivers were widened and deepened by local communities
While coastal shipping and navigable rivers were useful, there needed to be a more effective form of transport than roads and the existing water transport. The main reasons for change were:
during winter and dry up during summer months.
did not always link the major towns
A rapidly growing population also needed a more efficient method of transport because
canals would be the next step forward
Read this Revision Bite and then attempt to write down the information that you consider to be
for revising the early problems with pre-18th century water transport.
As part of your revision, think carefully about the
the benefits were of early water transport.
coastal shipping and navigable rivers needed to change.

583,104,"Metals are very useful. Ores are naturally occurring rocks that contain metal or metal compounds in sufficient amounts to make it worthwhile extracting them. For example, iron ore is used to make iron and steel. Copper is easily extracted, but ores rich in copper are becoming more difficult to find. Aluminium and titanium are metals with useful properties, but they are expensive to extract. Most everyday metals are mixtures called alloys.
The outer layer of the Earth, on top of the mantle. It is between 6 and 48 kilometres thick and includes the continents and the ocean floor.
Substances formed by the chemical union (involving bond formation) of two or more elements.
such as gold, iron oxide and aluminium oxide, but when found in the Earth these are often mixed with other substances. To be useful, the metals have to be extracted from whatever they are mixed with. A
is a rock containing a metal, or a metal compound, in a high enough concentration to make it economic to extract the metal.
The method used to extract metals from the ore in which they are found depends on their reactivity. For example, reactive metals such as aluminium are extracted by
Electrolysis is the decomposition (separation or break-down) of a compound using an electric current.
, while a less-reactive metal such as iron may be extracted by
Reduction is a reaction in which oxygen is removed from a substance. Reduction also means a gain in electrons.
Thus the method of extraction of a metal from its ore depends on the metal's position in the reactivity series:
Metals - in decreasing order of reactivity
Note that gold, because it is so unreactive, is found as the native metal and not as a compound, so it does not need to be chemically separated. However, chemical reactions may be needed to remove other elements that might contaminate the metal.

584,2114,"Back at school, Scout learns about Hitler's treatment of the Jews and is amazed that no one in Maycomb seems able to connect that to the racism in the town.
Mr Ewell tries to break into Judge Taylor's house and menaces Tom Robinson's widow.
They are both attacked on Halloween night
Jem and Scout attend a Halloween pageant at school - its subject is the history of Maycomb county and Scout is dressed as a shoulder of ham. She misses her entry on stage and so decides to keep her costume on to walk home in, to hide her embarrassment. It is a dark night and Jem soon realises they are being followed. They are both attacked - Scout is squashed inside her costume and Jem breaks his arm. Someone carries Jem home.
The attacker was Mr Ewell: he is found dead, with a kitchen knife in his ribs.

585,5428,"You need to go to the exam with strategies that will help you work well under pressure. Here are some suggestions:
You are usually given 5 minutes to read through the paper before the tape starts. Use this to your advantage by looking right through the paper so see what kind of tasks there are.
Look closely! Should you listen for precise information (like train arrival and departure times)? Or should you be listening to the whole passage, in order to draw a conclusion (for example, name the girl who has the best relationship with her parents)?
As you read the question, try to predict the sort of information that may be in the passage. It will help focus your mind.
Look at the title of the question or section very carefully. Make sure you understand
to give your answer. If there is an example, look closely at the answer given - it will show you whether you need to write a single letter, a single word, or more than one word.
Have a good look at any illustrations. They could give important clues as to what is coming.
word - there is probably a lot of 'redundant' language you don't need. Be positive. Concentrate on what you do understand. Sometimes the passage can be difficult, but the questions are easy.
Use your knowledge of grammar. For example, it may be important to know whether someone is talking about the past, the present, or the future.
Use your knowledge of Spanish-speaking countries. For example, if you hear someone was on holiday in Madrid, it is unlikely they spent time on the beach.
Don't just listen to the words. The tone of someone's voice may also be helpful - for example in telling you if they are making a statement or asking a question.
If you have to write answers in Spanish, remember you will not be penalised for minor spelling mistakes.
Don't just read it, practise your Spanish with downloadable audio bites.

586,2963,"Moving cars have kinetic energy, which is changed into heat energy when they brake. Safety features in modern cars, such as seat belts and crumple zones, are designed to absorb kinetic energy in a crash.
Active safety features include the anti-lock braking system and safety cage. Passive safety features include electric windows and adjustable seats.
Moving cars have kinetic energy. As energy cannot be created or destroyed, when a car
its kinetic energy changes into heat energy. The brakes heat up and then transfer the energy to the surroundings. Modern cars also have

588,6205,"The elements in group 0 are called the noble gases. They belong to the right-hand column in the periodic table. The noble gases are all chemically unreactive which means they are
The noble gases have the following properties in common:
they exist as single atoms (they are monatomic)
The main uses of the noble gases
Used in balloons and airships. It is much less dense than air, so balloons filled with it float upwards.
Used in advertising signs. It glows when electricity is passed through it, and different coloured 'neon lights' can be made by coating the inside of the glass tubing with other chemicals.

591,729,"This Revision Bite will help you understand the different types of production costs and how to calculate them.
A manufacturing company's production department will need to consider the quality and quantity of a product in relation to cost. If a firm wants to make a profit, it has to know what it is spending as well as what it is earning. Here are some of the costs it needs to know to do this:
Now look at each of these costs in more detail:
These costs do not change however many units of a product are made. Factory rent, insurance premiums and administration salaries stay the same, whether the factory is working at full capacity or producing nothing. The owner of the business may have taken out a loan to buy equipment or refurbish a building. The loan will have to be repaid whether or not the business has customers.
the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process
changes. For example, the amount of raw materials needed varies as the levels of output go up or down.
The employee is paid according to the number of units produced.
wages also fluctuate, depending on the employees' efficiency and the demand for the company's products.
The fixed costs and the variable costs are added together to establish the total costs. The fixed costs remain constant, but the variable costs increase in direct proportion with output.
The amount spent on producing one extra unit. It is the increase in total cost when one more unit is produced.
is a way of measuring how much more it will cost a company to make one more individual item. Here is an example:
A company produces compact discs. It has produced 99 CDs and the total costs have amounted to 999. If the total costs increase to 1,000 when the hundredth CD is made the marginal cost of the last CD is 1.00.
The firm knows that now each CD should cost only 1.00 or less to produce. As the cost per unit usually decreases with a rise in output, it should become cheaper to produce each one. The firm may be able to offer a more competitive price to customers.
The example of the CD shows the benefits of economies of scale, where mass production results in a lower unit cost. The reason is that the fixed costs do not change and are spread across a greater level of output.
The amount spent on producing each unit of output. It is calculated by dividing the total level of cost by the level of output.
helps a firm to monitor its progress, and makes it easier to set prices. It is calculated by dividing total cost by total output.
Using the example of the compact disc firm above:
This might seem expensive, but if the firm produces another hundred units at a marginal cost of 1.00 per CD, its average cost will fall radically:
The firm can use this information to decide whether it is worth accepting a new order for goods.
The examiner will want to see that you understand what the different costs are, how they are calculated, and why it is important for a firm to work them out. You will be expected to apply your understanding to a real life situation.
A company will always incur costs, no matter how efficient it is. Wages,
Raw materials are anything naturally occurring in or on the earth/in the sea before being processed. These are obtained through primary activities such as mining, fishing, forestry and farming.
, transport and power all have to be paid for. The company needs to establish all its costs to ensure it doesn't lose money.
Read the case study and answer the question below
Martin and Ashley started their window cleaning business with 1,500 they borrowed from Ashley's dad, and a 550 bank loan. They used the money to buy a second hand van and cleaning equipment. Ashley's dad doesn't charge any interest. They pay him back 50 a month. They also have to pay the bank 50 a month over two years. They don't get many bookings in winter when the weather is bad. Martin and Ashley aim to pay themselves 50 a month each.
What costs do Martin and Ashley have to meet even when they have no customers? (10 marks)
When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page.
They have got to pay back the money they borrowed.
Jamie needs to give far more explanation. He should use business terms and show he understands what fixed costs are.
They have to pay Ashley's father each month, as well as the loan from the bank. They may have other costs, like the cleaning materials they buy to run their business.
Morag started her answer quite well, mentioning both loans which, as fixed costs, have to be repaid. The cleaning materials, however, form part of the variable, rather than the fixed costs.
Costs which have to be paid, regardless of the level of output, are called fixed costs. Martin and Ashley have the fixed costs of repaying Ashley's dad 50 a month, and they probably pay bank interest on the loan. Their pay is a fixed cost. They might want to consider paying themselves piece rate, to help their business survive. The road tax and insurance on the van are fixed costs they have to pay. They have already bought the van, so this is a sunk cost, and no longer a fixed cost they have to pay.
Rani's answer would probably get a A grade. She has answered the question well, and has shown she can use business terms like fixed costs. She has thought about the pay they only receive when they have the business, and correctly counted it as a fixed cost.

593,6792,"Fabrics usually need to be washed, bleached and dyed, before they are suitable for making into textile products. Often they need to be printed as well, using either block-printing or screen-printing techniques. Garments are assembled using various joining techniques including sewing, fusing and heat-sealing. Finishing is a process which improves the appearance, handle and performance of fabrics; while pressing is used to shape and stabilise fabrics.
Dyed cloth in a souk in Marrakesh
Before dyeing and printing the fabric is prepared by washing, bleaching and
treating cotton yarn with an alkali to improve its strength, lustre and receptivity to dye.
In industrial production fabric is dyed by continuous or batch dyeing:
, the fabric passes through a dye bath. The fabric is then squeezed between rollers to spread the dye evenly and remove excess dye. Continuous dyeing is used for colours that do not need to change too quickly with fashion.
, fabrics are produced without dye. They are then dyed to order in large batches according to the colours required. Batch dyeing is used for colours that need to change frequently with fashion.
Fabrics are printed by block or screen printing:
is done using metal or wooden blocks, one for each colour. The background shapes are cut away to leave a raised design on the block. Dye is applied and stamped onto the fabric. This is a very slow process used by specialised craft industries.
a pattern is printed onto fabric through a
a sheet of paper, celluloid, or other material in which a design has been cut, so that when ink is passed over the sheet the design is reproduced on the surface below
held in place by a screen. Each screen prints one part of the design in one colour. After printing the dyestuff must be fixed using steam or dry heat.
The graphics show three different types of screen printing.

automates this process, with the fabric moved through the machine on a conveyor belt and the print repeating rapidly.

and roller squeegees - one roller for each colour; this is a very fast process used in the continuous printing of furnishing and clothing fabrics.

resin. Fusing is sometimes done by hand, sometimes by machine.
Fusing by hand is used to join Vilene to fabric to make it stable and strong. It is also used to reinforce and strengthen fabrics for garments, bags and accessories; and allows hems to be turned up without stitching.
In a factory there are two types of machine used for fusing: a flat-bed press is used to join short fabric lengths for batch production; a conveyor press is used for fusing long fabric lengths for mass production.
is used for synthetic fibres made from thermoplastics, such as polyester or nylon. Heat-sealing is used to set a material into a shape, eg pleats. It is also use to seal the seams on all-weather gear and tents to make them waterproof.
In industry a range of different sewing machines are used for stitching seams, embroidery, buttonholes etc. The main ones are listed in the table below:
Stitches, cuts and finishes seams in one process
Finishing is done to improve a product's appearance, properties and quality. It covers many different processes, some mechanical and some chemical.
Mechanical finishing uses heat, pressure and rollers to improve the appearance of the fabric.
cotton or nylon fabrics makes them fluffy and warm, with a soft

using caustic soda. Mercerised fabrics are stronger, dye well and have improved lustre.
Wool can be given a shrink-resist finish using silicone or Teflon. This results in soft, smooth, lustrous yarns and fabrics that are machine-washable.
Cotton and viscose fabrics are given a crease-resistant finish using
'raw' plastic, especially when in semi-liquid form (Resistant materials). Substances (eg acrylics and urethanes) which, applied to a fabric's surface, evaporate to leave a film upon it (Textiles technology).

Make sure that you can explain any decorative technique you used in your coursework, such as applique, patchwork, tie-dye, batick, quilting or embroidery.These are favourite exam topics!
You may be asked about tools and equipment used for measuring, marking, cutting or sewing fabrics. Again - check your coursework notes.
You may be asked to explain the benefits of using CAM or CNC sewing machines - so make sure you can!

594,2154,"Species gradually evolve by a process of natural selection. The individuals in any population with the inherited features best suited to the environment in which they live are most likely to survive and reproduce. When they do, they pass on the genetic information for these features to their offspring.
Over time, a species can change its appearance and may even become a new species, unable to reproduce successfully with individuals of the original species.
Selective breeding, also called artificial selection, involves people taking charge of selection to produce new 'varieties' of various species. A variety is a type of a particular species that is different in some clear way from other varieties of that species.
For example, pedigree dogs come in lots of different varieties (or breeds) - they may be different colours and sizes, but they are all still dogs.

Suppose you wanted a variety of cow that produced a lot of milk. This is what you could do:
choose or select the cows in your herd that produce the most milk
select the offspring that produce the most milk
keep repeating the process of selection and breeding until you achieve your goal
The key here is to identify the feature you want, and only breed from the individuals that have that feature. Here are some examples of what selective breeding can produce:
hens that lay big eggs of a particular colour
tomato plants that produce lots of tomatoes

They release enzymes to break down compounds, so that they can absorb the nutrients. We can preserve our food, for example by freezing or canning, to remove the conditions needed for decay to occur.
Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another.
Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
Intensive farming practices include growing high-yield crops, using fertilisers and pesticides and keeping animals indoors. Food production is increased but there are unwelcome side effects.
Organic farming bans chemical inputs and has a less harmful effect on the environment but often produces less, more expensive food.
Hydroponics is the production of food using nutrient-rich solution rather than soil.
Leaves enable photosynthesis to happen. Photosynthesis is the process by which leaves absorb light and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrate (food) for plants to grow. Leaves are adapted to perform their function eg they have a large surface area to absorb sunlight.
Plants use minerals from the soil to build the complex molecules they need to survive and grow. Poor plant growth may be due to a deficiency of one or more minerals. Tests can be done to establish which mineral is deficient or a general purpose NPK fertiliser added.
Plants have two different types of 'transport' tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots.
The element carbon is the present in all living organisms. It's recycled through various processes, which are described in the carbon cycle.
Nitrogen is essential for the formation of amino acids to make proteins. The nitrogen cycle describes the ways in which nitrogen is recycled.
Osmosis is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low water concentration through a partially permeable membrane. Osmosis takes place in all living cells.
Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis through their root hair cells. Plants use water for several vital processes including photosynthesis and transporting minerals.
All substances are made from atoms. Each atom is made of a nucleus - containing protons and neutrons - surrounded by electrons.
The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. The elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in ascending order of atomic number.
The mass number of an atom is the total of protons plus neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and hence different mass numbers) are called isotopes of that element.
A covalent bond is formed between non metal atoms, which combine together by sharing electrons. Covalent compounds have no free electrons and no ions so they don't conduct electricity.
The Periodic Table is an arrangement of the elements in order of atomic number. Elements in the same vertical column are in the same group or family and have similar chemical properties.
Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid using electricity. When ionic compounds are molten or dissolved in water the ions are free to move.
When sulfuric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen is produced at the cathode (negative electrode) and oxygen at the anode (positive electrode). Aluminium is extracted from the mineral bauxite using the process of electrolysis.
All matter is made of atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements, and each one has a symbol. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other.
When atoms of different elements join together they make a compound. Compounds are represented by formulae that show how many atoms of each element are in the compound. Formulae can be worked out from the charge of the ions that make up the compound.
Chemical reactions can be written down as balanced chemical equations.
The Group 1 elements in the Periodic Table are known as the alkali metals. They include lithium, sodium and potassium, which all react vigorously with air and water.
The reactivity of the alkali metals increases down the group. Flame tests are used to identify alkali metal ions in compounds.
The Group 7 elements are also known as the halogens. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, which all have seven electrons in their outer shell.
In a displacement reaction a less reactive element is
Ionic bonding occurs between positive and negative ions, which attract each other and bind together to form ionic compounds. For example, sodium chloride consists of Na
Each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions held in place by electrostatic attraction and forming an ionic crystal lattice. The ions in a crystal lattice are very strongly bonded - a high temperature is required to melt the crystal.
The physical properties of different metals make them useful for different purposes. For example, aluminium conducts heat, which makes it a useful material for making saucepans and gold is shiny, which makes it an attractive material for jewellery.
Metal particles are held together by strong metallic bonds, which is why they have high melting and boiling points. The loose electrons in metals can all move together through the metal  creating an electric current.
The elements in the middle section of the Periodic Table are the transition elements. They're all metals with typical metallic properties eg conducting heat and electricity. They often form coloured compounds.
Transition metal carbonates undergo thermal decomposition - a reaction in which a substance is broken down into at least two other substances by heat.
Transition metal hydroxides are insoluble in water. They can be precipitated out of a transitional metal compound solution using sodium hydroxide solution.

596,3802,"Sea water contains a number of dissolved salts. When these salts dissolve in water, the ions separate. Sea water therefore contains a mixture of ions. The most common ions in sea water are shown in the table:
It is possible to deduce from the table which salts dissolved to form the mixture of ions:
When sodium chloride dissolves it forms sodium ions and chloride ions.
When magnesium chloride dissolves it forms magnesium and chloride ions.
When magnesium sulfate dissolves if forms magnesium ions and sulfate ions.
When potassium chloride dissolves it forms potassium ions and chloride ions.
When potassium bromide dissolves it forms potassium ions and bromide ions.
You can use the charge on the ions shown in the table to work out the formulae of the ionic compounds.
. For the charges to cancel out in the neutral salt sodium chloride, they must be in a ration of 1:1. So the formula of sodium chloride is NaCl.
. For the charges to cancel out in the neutral salt magnesium chloride, they must be in a ration of 1:2. So the formula of magnesium chloride is MgCl
Put down that pen and listen to some additional Science audio.

598,1822,"You should know some of the factors affecting the stopping distance of a car.
It takes a certain amount of time for a driver to react to a hazard and start applying the brakes. During this time, the car is still moving. The faster the car is travelling, the greater this thinking distance will be.
The thinking distance will also increase if the driver's reactions are slower because they are:
The braking distance is the distance the car travels from where the brakes are first applied to where the car stops. If the braking force is too great, the tyres may not grip the road sufficiently and the car may skid. The faster the car is travelling, the greater the braking distance will be.
The braking distance will also increase if:
The weather conditions are poor, such as an icy or wet road.
The car is more heavily laden, for example, with passengers and luggage.
The stopping distance is the thinking distance added to the braking distance. The graph shows some typical stopping distances.

599,4397,"There is no physical description of any of the characters. There is very little direct description of their feelings either, because Hemingway prefers to let us read between the lines.
The story seems to be told from Nick's viewpoint. Although it is told in the third person - both characters are referred to as 'he' and 'she' - the story remains with Nick after Marjorie has left, so we get his reaction to the break-up, but not hers.
Nick has planned to break up with Marjorie, and has discussed it with Bill beforehand - Bill asks: ""Did she go alright?"" You could see Nick as being unfair, since he has planned this and still goes on the fishing trip with her.
Nick seems to be quite aggressive at times in the story: when responding to things Marjorie says, and picking arguments.
He does not have the courage to break up with her outright - he has to pick an argument first. It is Marjorie who asks the definitive question.
Earlier in the story, is Nick trying to break the idea to Marjorie gently when he comments that the fish will not ""strike"" - in other words, they will not commit, like him?
Hemingway only directly mentions what the characters are feeling once or twice. He uses the word 'afraid' to describe Nick's feelings when he is talking to Marjorie. What do you think he is afraid of?
After Marjorie has gone, Nick seems upset. He tells Bill the break-up went fine, but is described as ""lying, his face on the blanket"". The 'lying' is
- is it about the position of his body or the truth of his words?
She seems more inclined to romance, likening the broken down mill to a 'castle'.
She also tries to draw Nick into a shared past, referring to it as 'our ruin'.
Hemingway says she ""loved fishing. She loved fishing with Nick."" The repetition seems to put emphasis on his presence being important to her. Nick says he has taught her everything about fishing. She has learned about it for his sake.
Marjorie is perceptive. She tells Nick he does not have to 'talk silly', and asks him: ""What's really the matter?""
She is very calm and collected throughout the story. She acts with dignity even when being dumped, and when he is snapping at her. When he says that love is not 'fun' anymore, she does not argue or protest. She merely leaves in dignified silence.
Bill is Nick's friend. Hemingway uses him to show what Nick is feeling, instead of telling us directly.
Bill knows that Nick is upset. When Nick tells him to 'go away', Bill moves a little way away, but remains in calling distance.
At the end, Bill's attitude to the picnic basket and fishing rods is very relaxed and casual - highlighting the tension in Nick's behaviour towards both earlier in the story.

Sometimes the instructions on the reading exam are in English - but be careful,they may not be as straightforward as they seem!
Read each situation carefully and think about what you actually need to know.
Read every choice all the way through. There might be a word or part of a word that you recognise.
Don't jump to conclusions! Sometimes a word like 'Oficina' can be used in a way that it isn't in English.
Don't panic if you don't know what a word means. Look through all the choices and eliminate the ones you know aren't the right answer.

Look at magazines, books and the internet.
Cut out interesting images from magazines and newspapers.
Write notes about your work. - Explain what's going on in your head, and describe your initial thoughts.
Decide what's important and worth continuing with. What works, what doesn't?
Can you make links? - Look carefully at what you're drawing - are there links with what others have done?
What are you looking at, and what does it mean?
Explain your thoughts in detailed notes and further drawings.
Look at how your particular idea has been approached by different cultures. - Visit local museums and art galleries.
Collect thumbnail images and postcards.- Compare your own work with the work of others.
Start to develop your ideas and work.
Experiment with the size or colour of your work.
Write down your thoughts and explain the processes.
Do you know what you're doing in your final exam?
Make a small model of it, or paint a rough version.
Don't do an exact copy of it, but do resolve any problems - then you'll use the ten-hour exam time well.

We have split Gamze's work journal into two halves, so you can see her research development and then the final ceramic pieces she created.
She started work by studying things from the sea from first-hand experience. She looked at shells, coral, fish, sea creatures, seaweed etc, and used water colours, pen and pencil.
Gamze looked at pictures of sea life in books, and at artwork by different artists. She planned to work in ceramics and so she also looked at the work of ceramicists like Kate Malone.
Gamze also developed her ideas by looking at work from different times and places in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Floods can cause damage to homes and possessions as well as disruption to communications. However, flooding can also have positive impacts on an area.
Flooding deposits fine silt (alluvium) onto the floodplain, making it very fertile and excellent for agriculture. People living on or near floodplains may rely upon regular flooding to help support their farming and therefore provide food.
A Less Economically Developed Country [LEDC] has low levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the southern hemisphere (eg countries in southern Africa, southern Asia and South America) are LEDCs, while more of the countries in the northern hemisphere are More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs].
A More Economically Developed Country [MEDC] has high levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the northern hemisphere are MEDCs, eg UK, USA, Canada, Europe. More of the countries in the southern hemisphere are Less Economically Developed Countries [LEDCs].
by the effects of flooding. This is partly because LEDCs have more farms, and farming communities are attracted to fertile flood plains. LEDCs often do not have the resources to prevent flooding or deal with the aftermath of flooding.

605,2476,"will ask you to look at the relationships between the characters, their feelings or problems. You could also be asked to write about how characters are presented by Doris Lessing, the writer, or the methods she uses. Whatever you are asked to do, make sure you read the question very carefully and spend some time planning your answer.
One important thing to remember is that these questions might look very different but they often cover very similar ground. For instance, if you are going to write about the old man, you need to show how the writer presents him. Or if you are writing about the problems a character faces, you should also look at their relationships with other characters in the story.
The other thing to remember is that there are a lot of different ways to answer the same question. You do not have to include things in a fixed order.
It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters and themes.
It is also useful to include a personal reaction. This shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied someone else's ideas. For instance, you might feel sympathetic to the old man's situation, or feel he has no right to try to control Alice as he does.
In addition, try to include short quotes in your answer. The previous sections have plenty of examples, like using in a single word:
When he lets the pigeon escape he smiles 'proudly' at his granddaughter.
You can also use a short phrase, such as:
She stares, does 'not smile' and is 'wide-eyed, and pale' with 'tears shivering off her face.
Many people make the mistake of regurgitating numerous sentences, or even complete paragraphs, from the story. There is no need for this. It wastes time and does not provide a focus to your answer. Instead, look for a specific point and the exact word or words to illustrate it. Next, we will look at an example these techniques.
The old man is clearly the main focus of
. He is the first character we meet, and the one we know most about. For instance, we find out he lives with his daughter and her family, and how important his pigeons are to him.
Lessing also writes the story mainly from his point of view. For instance, we are told his thoughts, such as thinking about how his other granddaughters were 'transformed' by marriage and became 'serious young matrons' rather than girls who doted on their grandfather. In this way, the old man is shown to be rather selfish - he is thinking more about himself than the happiness of others in his family. This is most clearly shown when he asks his daughter about Alice and if they can 'keep her a bit longer'.
This is a good start - it keeps to the point and does not waste time retelling the entire story. It also includes short examples to make each point clearer.
The word 'keeping' might strike us as rather odd, because it is usually reserved for animals, not your children or grandchildren. However, Lessing draws several comparisons between particular characters and animals, in particular the pigeons. I especially liked the old man's fingers 'curling like claws into his palms', because it made me think he was becoming just like his birds. It also indicates that his quiet rage is building up as he starts to speak to Alice.
Alice seems to be the one the old man loves the most, but also despises. At times he is very rude to her, even calling her an 'impudent little bit of rubbish'. Yet it is obvious to me that he loves her deeply and can hardly bear to see her leave. For instance, he almost instantly regrets being rude to her, and starts to cry when he learns she is going to marry Steven.
Lessing seems to use contrasts like this throughout the story. For example, the behaviour of the old man and Lucy is very effectively portrayed. The old man is angry, stamps his feet and shouts like a child, while his daughter is able to humour him, and even 'croons' like one of his pigeons to calm him down.
This is only the start of the task. There is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction. It continues to treat each point fairly briefly, but manages to refer to the plot, language, relationships and themes.

Ich wohne seit vierzehn Jahren in Herborn. Ich fahre oft nach Gieen, aber ich bin immer froh, wenn ich von der Uni wieder nach Hause fahren kann. Es gibt zwar nicht sehr viel zu tun, aber das macht mir nichts aus. Ich brauche nur meine Freunde anzurufen und in zehn Minuten sitzen wir zusammen in einer der vielen Kneipen in der Altstadt und reden miteinander. Und nachher kann ich einfach nach Hause laufen.
Ich wohne in einer Wohnung in Offenburg, etwa fnf Gehminuten vom Bahnhof. Es gefllt mir dort, denn ich kann morgens im Stadtpark joggen. Ich habe daran gedacht, nach Freiburg zu ziehen, weil es dort viel mehr zu tun gibt, besonders was Sport betrifft. Aber da so viele Leute dort studieren wollen, sind die Lebenskosten viel hher und ich muss ein paar Jahre warten, bis ich dahinziehen kann.
Ich wohne immer noch bei meinen Eltern in Spiesen-Elversberg. Das liegt am Waldrand, etwa fnf Kilometer sdlich von Neunkirchen. Es ist ganz schn ruhig hier und man kann sich gut vom Schulstress erholen, aber abends und am Wochenende wird es mir langweilig. Meine Eltern sind super und fahren mich nach Neunkirchen zum Kino und holen mich oft sehr spt ab. Ich freue mich schon auf nchstes Jahr. Bis dann habe ich hoffentlich meinen Fhrerschein. Dann htte ich vor allem in Saarbrcken eine grere Auswahl an Filmen.
Seit fnf Jahren wohne ich auf dem Lande. Frher habe ich in Berlin gewohnt. Klar hat das Spa gemacht, in einer Weltstadt zu wohnen. Aber ich denke jetzt nie daran und auf dem Bauernhof habe ich alles, was ich brauche. Das geht allerdings nicht ohne Wagen und Telefon, denn hier gibt es so gut wie keine ffentlichen Verkehrsmittel.

607,5266,"A lot of everyday items are made from polymers. Many of these polymers are not biodegradable - microbes cannot digest them and they take a long time to break down. Polymers are usually disposed of by burying them in landfill sites or burning them in incinerators. These methods of disposal cause environmental problems, and waste valuable resources.
The properties of polymers depend on the structure and bonding found in their molecules. Smart materials such as Gore-Tex have more useful properties than other polymers.
Polymers are large molecules formed from many identical smaller molecules (monomers).
. Addition polymers are formed from alkenes. For example:
ethene can polymerise to form polyethene, which is also called polythene
a typical use of polythene is for a plastic shopping bag or plastic bottle
a typical use of polystyrene is for insulation and protective packaging
Some polymers are not made from alkene monomers. These are called condensation polymers. Nylon and polyesters are like this. They can be drawn into very fine fibres and woven into cloth for clothing. Often, natural fibres such as cotton are mixed with nylon or polyester fibres to make a soft but hard-wearing cloth.
One of the useful properties of polymers is that they are unreactive, so they are suitable for storing food and chemicals safely. Unfortunately, this property makes it difficult to dispose of polymers. They are often buried in landfill sites or incinerated - burned.
Waste polymers are disposed of in landfill sites. This uses up valuable land, and suitable sites often fill up quickly.
Polymers release a lot of heat energy when they burn. This energy can be used to heat homes or generate electricity. But there are problems with incineration. Carbon dioxide is produced, which adds to global warming. Toxic gases are also produced, unless the polymers are incinerated at high temperatures.
Polymers have recycling symbols like this one for PVC to show what they are
Many polymers can be recycled. This reduces disposal problems and the amount of crude oil used. But first the different polymers must be separated from each other. This can be difficult and expensive.
Most polymers, including poly(ethene) and poly(propene), are not biodegradable. This means microorganisms cannot break them down, so they may last for many years in rubbish dumps. However, it is possible to include chemicals that cause the polymer to break down more quickly. Carrier bags and refuse bags made from degradable polymers are already available.
Nylon has some desirable properties. It does not let ultraviolet light pass through it, and it is:
Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.
Gore-Tex has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.
Teflon is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.
Gore-Tex fabric is a sandwich of materials
Structure and properties of polymers - higher
Strong covalent bonds join atoms to each other in individual polymer molecules. Weak intermolecular forces attract polymer molecules towards each other. The properties of solid materials like polymers depend on:
the strength of the forces between these molecules
A polymer will melt when the intermolecular forces are overcome. The stronger the forces, the more energy is needed to break them, and the higher the materials melting point.
Many polymers, such as poly(ethene), contain long molecules that lie side by side. These can uncoil and slide past each other, making the material flexible. Long polymer chains have stronger forces of attraction than shorter ones: they make stronger materials.
Cross-linking is where the polymer chains are chemically joined together in places, by covalent bonds. The polymer molecules cannot slide over each other so easily. This makes materials tougher and less flexible, and they cannot be easily stretched. Cross-linking also gives materials high melting points.
Vulcanised rubber has cross-links. Its polymer molecules are cross-linked by sulfur atoms. It is tough but flexible, and used for making tyres.

the use of several types of media outputs from a computer in order to give the user a richer and more interesting experience
Most presentation software packages allow you to create your multimedia product using a series of slides. Text, images, video, animations, links and sound can be combined on each slide to create a sophisticated final product.
The most widely used presentation software is Microsoft PowerPoint but there is other presentation software, such as Impress (part of the OpenOffice suite).
Slides that can contain any mixture of text, images, video, animations, links and sound.

An editor like Notepad offers greater control over the code when compared to a WYSIWYG editor because each and every character that forms the HTML and the resulting web page is hand typed. The disadvantage is its a slow process.
The web page is designed, and the content written and styled, using a series of tools. The page can be previewed in the default browser from within the

. This makes building a web page much faster because only a limited knowledge of HTML is needed as its automatically generated. However, the code can still be edited by hand.
Not all browsers render (display) web pages in the same way. Common browsers include:

There are two key pieces of evidence for Big Bang theory. Theses are
You may have noticed that when an ambulance or police car goes past, its siren is high-pitched as it comes towards you, then becomes low-pitched as it goes away. This effect, where there is a change in frequency and wavelength, is called the Doppler effect. It happens with any wave source that moves relative to an observer.
This happens with light too. Our sun contains helium. We know this because there are black lines in the spectrum of the light from the sun, where helium has absorbed light. These lines form the absorption spectrum for helium.
When we look at the spectrum of a distant star, the absorption spectrum is there, but the pattern of lines has moved towards the red end of the spectrum, as you can see below.
This is called red shift. It is a change in frequency of the position of the lines.
Astronomers have found that the further from us a star is the more its light is red shifted. This tells us that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and that the further a galaxy is the faster it is moving away. Since we cannot assume that we have a special place in the universe this is evidence for a generally expanding universe. It suggests that everything is moving away from everything else. The Big Bang theory says that this expansion started billions of years ago with an explosion.
Scientists discovered that there are microwaves coming from every direction in space. Big Bang theory says this is energy created at the beginning of the universe, just after the Big Bang, and that has been travelling through space ever since.
A satellite called COBE has mapped the background microwave radiation of the universe as we see it. Big Bang theorists are still working on the interpretation of this evidence.
A summary of some of the evidence of the Big Bang and its interpretation
The light from other galaxies is red-shifted.
The other galaxies are moving away from us.
The further away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.
The most likely explanation is that the whole universe is expanding. This supports the theory that the start of the universe could have been from a single explosion.
The relatively uniform background radiation is the remains of energy created just after the Big Bang.
For an activity that is out of this world!

615,3582,"This Revision Bite is about how people communicate with each other in a business setting.
It will help you understand why communication is such an important issue and examines various methods of getting a message across in different situations.
Communicating means passing on information, or receiving it from somebody else. Imagine the problems that could occur if this is not done carefully. Here are some examples of what might go wrong:
Delivering the wrong items to a customer.
Delivering correspondence on the wrong date or to the wrong address.
Management using incorrect data when making decisions.

616,4008,"Sometimes, rather than rounding off to the nearest whole number, you might need to be a little more accurate. You might need to include some of the digits after the decimal point.
In these cases, we can round off the number up to a certain number of decimal places.
Do not confuse this with rounding off using significant figures (intermediate), as this is slightly different!
The same rules for rounding up apply here:
Write 2.6470588 to 2 decimal places (dp).
? You needed to round up. We want 2 decimal places.
decimal digit is 4. So the number lies between 2.64 and 2.65
The next digit is 7, so we have to round up. So the answer is
, giving your answer correct to one decimal place.
We need one decimal place. That means one number after the decimal point. The 1
number after the decimal point is 8.
This means the answer lies between 7.8 and 7.9
The next digit is 7. This means we have to round up.
Round off the number 3.9762645 to 1 dp.
The number lies between 3.9 and 4.0. The 7 after the 9 means you have to round up. So the answer is
Learn about the dark side of numbers!

619,2967,"Like many female characters in the story, Justine is an orphan who cares for other people before herself.
She is brought up in the Frankenstein family home, and acts as their servant.
She is especially fond of Victor's youngest brother, William, and feels responsible when he is murdered by the Monster.
Justine is very beautiful. This beauty angers the Monster when it finds her sleeping, as it knows it will never be allowed to love anyone so attractive. The Monster then places the locket around her neck, knowing it will lead to her being put on trial for the murder.
She is bullied into confessing by a priest. Her calmness and virtue are emphasised and contrasted with the immorality of those who should know better - like Victor, the priest and the judge.

621,3160,"(Mishnah and Gemara collected together) describe different roles for men and women.
Traditionally women have a sacred role - they bear children, run the home and take responsibility for their childrens Jewish upbringing. The woman passes on Jewish values and it is because of the mothers Jewish faith (not the fathers) that a child is born Jewish.
While Jewish law excuses women from some religious duties (eg, they dont have to wear the
Fringes on the corners of the Tallit (prayer shawl).
Small leather boxes containing passages from the Torah, strapped to the forehead and arm for morning prayers on weekdays.
) there are some duties that women are obliged to carry out like the lighting the
is the day of spiritual renewal and rest commencing at sunset on Friday, terminating at nightfall on Saturday.)
. Men and women sit separately in Orthodox services and women cannot take an active part in this worship. Some Jewish women today accept these limitations, but they are as well-educated as men and choose to combine a career with family responsibilities.
Progressive Jews (which includes Jews of both liberal and reform traditions) think that this attitude is wrong and treat women equally in all respects, so they too can become rabbis (Jewish teacher) if they choose to do so.

623,4239,"Memory is improved through repetition. If we repeat things, especially over a long period of time, we are much more likely to remember them using our long-term memory.
A strong stimulus - including colour, light, smell or sound - also helps us to remember things.
For example, which of these are you more likely to remember?
Incident 1: The sound of a car, braking suddenly, to avoid a cat crossing the road.
Incident 2: Your mother asking you to pick up a loaf of bread on your way home.
You are more likely to remember Incident 1, as the stimulus is stronger.
We are more likely to remember information if we can either see or make a pattern out of it.
They are much easier to remember if we impose a pattern on them:
down the road. The dog barked and knocked a
Put down that pen and listen to some additional Science audio.

624,245,"They have got to pay back the money they borrowed.
Jamie needs to give far more explanation. He should use business terms and show he understands what fixed costs are.
They have to pay Ashley's father each month, as well as the loan from the bank. They may have other costs, like the cleaning materials they buy to run their business.
Morag started her answer quite well, mentioning both loans which, as fixed costs, have to be repaid. The cleaning materials, however, form part of the variable, rather than the fixed costs.
Costs which have to be paid, regardless of the level of output, are called fixed costs. Martin and Ashley have the fixed costs of repaying Ashley's dad 50 a month, and they probably pay bank interest on the loan. Their pay is a fixed cost. They might want to consider paying themselves piece rate, to help their business survive. The road tax and insurance on the van are fixed costs they have to pay. They have already bought the van, so this is a sunk cost, and no longer a fixed cost they have to pay.
Rani's answer would probably get a A grade. She has answered the question well, and has shown she can use business terms like fixed costs. She has thought about the pay they only receive when they have the business, and correctly counted it as a fixed cost.

625,3485,"There are four main types of industrial production -
production - which have progressively larger scales of operation. ICT is now important in virtually every type of commercial design and production, with different types of computer-control of design and making processes grouped together as
Computer Aided Design - a system which helps the user produce accurate drawings.
The different production methods may have different design requirements, but most commercial designers have three roles: a
relating to the performance of a product - its 'fitness for purpose'
relating to shape, style, colour, pattern and other aspects of a product's visual appeal
role and an organisational role. Designers need to be aware of the standards and conventions which regulate industrial design practices.
There are four main types of industrial production methods:
is when only one product is made at a time. As every product is different, one-off production is labour intensive. Products may be made by hand or a combination of hand and machine methods.
is when a small quantity of identical products are made - from two up to about 100. Batch production may also use a lot of labour, but jigs and templates are used to aid production. Batches of the product can be made as often as required. Often the machines can be easily changed to produce a batch of a different product.
production is when hundreds of identical products are made, usually on a production line. Mass production often involves the assembly of a number of sub-assemblies of individual components. Some parts may be bought from other companies. There is usually some automation of tasks (eg by using
the use of computers to control cutting and shaping machines. CNC for short
machines) and this enables a smaller number of workers to ouput more products.
production is when many thousands of copies of identical products are made. The difference between this and mass production is that the production line is kept running 24 hours a day, seven days a week to maximise production and eliminate the extra costs of starting and stopping the production process. The process is highly automated and few workers are required.
Computer-aided design and making are nowadays commonplace in industry. ICT is most often used in mass production, as computer control makes it possible to produce many identical items very quickly. But ICT is also useful in small batch and even one-off work, as computer control also enables complicated shapes to be produced more accurately than by hand.
The box summarises the many roles of ICT in industry:
Data can be stored electronically and retrieved easily.
Designs can be modelled on-screen and viewed from any angle.
Reaction to outside forces, such as wind flow and pressure can be modelled.
""Zoom"" facilities can allow for the whole product or one detail to be easily seen.
Libraries of standard components can be stored electronically and integrated into new designs.
Control sequences can be simulated before working on the actual material.
CNC (Computer Numerical Control) manufacturing is usually more accurate.
You need to know and understand a number of terms used to describe aspects of ICT in design and production. They are:
Different production methods - eg, one-off, batch, and mass or continuous production - have somewhat different design requirements, related to the differences between types of product, client expectation, and the scale of operation. In particular there are differences in the relationship between the designer and the
person or organisation that wants a product manufactured - eg a retailer.

individual. Individual products may be made by hand or a combination of hand and machine methods. As every product is different, one-off production is labour intensive.
production the designer is frequently the maker as well. The client is usually the end-user of the product, and will have high expectations about the quality of the product. The designer will nearly always have a direct relationship with the client, so it is essential that the designer is fully conversant with the end-user's requirements.
production method for making a small quantity (between two and about 100) identical products.
production the process of designing is more formalised, but the number of people involved may still be quite small. The client may be the user, but is more likely to be another company who sell the product. The designer will not necessarily have any contact with the end-user of the product.
production method for making hundreds of identical products, usually on a production line. Also called repetitive flow production.
production method for making many thousands of identical products. The difference between this and mass production is that the production line is kept running 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
flow production the processes of designing and manufacturing are much more formal. Making of changes can become slower. There is little or no contact between the designer and the client. The designer is therefore dependent on other people feeding back the end-users' views.

direct mail (ads sent out in the form of leaflets, mail shots, emails and texts)

, designed to protect consumers from inferior, misleading or unsafe goods and services:
law which protects consumers where the following are not acting in their interest: monopolies, where businesses have 25 percent of the market, mergers, where two companies plan to join together, and rogue traders, where the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) will take action against persistent offenders. In 2003 the Enterprise Act replaced the Fair Trading Act.
law which protects the public by: prohibiting the manufacture and supply of unsafe goods, making the maker or seller of defective products pay for damage it causes and allows councils to seize or suspend the sale unsafe goods.
law which makes it an offence for a trader to make false or misleading statements about goods or services. The Act carries criminal penalties and is enforced by local authorities' Trading Standards Officers.

Conventions are ways of doing things - for example, technical drawings - which conform to a common standard. Using conventions saves time and ensures that a drawing means the same thing to anyone who sees it. The BSI standard for drawings is

we saw how you could use short quotations as evidence.
We might want to say Don John is an aggressive and angry character. We can then support this view by looking at his language. He says that if he had a mouth he ""would bite"", and that he only has his unhappiness to make use of.
Here we are using two ways to provide evidence: words that are directly from the play are put in quotation marks, for example, ""I am a plain-dealing villain."" The second way is to describe what is said in your own words, for instance, Don John plans to stop Claudio's marriage to Hero. It is often good to combine these methods, perhaps quoting just one word from the play. For instance, Don John despises Claudio and calls him a ""start-up"" (an 'upstart' in modern English).
The one thing you should avoid is using a long quotation. Many students write out whole chunks of the play. This is just like retelling the story - there is no reason for it, and you will not get any marks for it.

629,4832,"Guarding against hazards: food workers in a prawn processing plant
Safety is vitally important in the food industry, for obvious reasons. As in any other type of production, the most important part of safety-consciousness is identifying and monitoring potential
anything likely to cause harm and/or damage
) and taking steps to avoid them. There are three main types of hazard in food production:
is where foods become dangerously infected by bacteria. This might lead to food poisoning, such as salmonella.
occurs where foreign bodies, such as nuts and screws from factory machinery, personal jewellery and fingernails, fall into the food.
is where potentially dangerous fluids or pesticides have found their way into food.
Control of Substance Hazardous to Health (COSHH)
regulations help to protect workers in the food and other industry from hazardous substances such as cleaning fluids and pesticides. It encourages employers to put safety procedures in place to prevent accidents.
is a set of procedures used by caterers to ensure food is always safe to eat. This is based on
Critical control points (CCPs) are pre-determined checks which take place at specified points in the food production or preparation process. They must be carefully documented, with details of the checks themselves, the processes being checked, any faults and remedial action taken. Some of these checks will be done by hand - others may be computerised under CAM. They will include checking:
speeds at which machines and conveyor belts move
scanning for impurities, such as metal, and other potential hazards

630,5878,"Club dance music of the late 20th and 21st centuries has many different forms, including drum and bass, hip-hop, garage, R and B, trip-hop, house, rave, techno, ambient and europop. You won't have to know all the differences between these styles, but you will need to be able to pick out the main musical elements and comment on the use of technology in GCSE questions.
Club dance music always makes use of technology. In particular :
: where a pattern, usually in the bass or drum part, is repeated constantly.
: where a voice or a sound clip has been processed by a computer to distort it.
, an echo effect on the voice, and
, where the voice is given a synthesised effect.
: a DJ technique where the hand is put on the vinyl disc and moved backwards and forwards on the turntable.
: This is a process on the computer where fast notes are automatically put into time by shifting the note to the nearest (usually) semiquaver. The effect of this is that the music is always completely in time with the beat.
: Where each part of the music (bass, drums, main vocal etc.) is recorded on its own track. It means, for example, that a singer can perform the main vocal and later perform the backing vocal as well (overdubbing).

631,2893,"There are different opinions about what the Industrial Revolution actually consisted of and what caused it. This Revision Bite will look at some of the arguments that question the definition and timing of the Industrial Revolution.
wrote the famous economic historian EJ Hobsbawm.
""It is little wonder that the Victorian period is sometimes called the Age of Iron""
The economic historian JU Nef always argued that it was the move to coal as a fuel that kicked off the technological changes, which created the Industrial Revolution -
""The steam engine was one of the most important of mans inventions for without it the Industrial Revolution could never have taken place""
confusion about the nature of the Industrial Revolution

639,73,"Information technology has led to many changes in how we work, where we work and even when we work. It has had a dramatic effect on our working lives.
Until the mid-90s it was not possible to shop online. The closest alternative was shopping by phone.
The same was true for banking and all the host of Government and other services which now exist online.
electronic mail - a message written or typed on a computer and sent electronically rather than by post
an application that allows users to send instant messages (text) to one another
Instead of mobile phones there was a trend for CB (Citizen's Band) radio.
Documents could not be sent as email
a file that's 'attached' to an email is called an attachment
and were faxed instead (a paper document is digitised, sent down a phone line, and then printed at the other end).
The need to travel for essential services, eg banking, was far greater for those who lived outside town.
Today, customers expect even the smallest of businesses to have a professional, informative
a web page or group of web pages hosted on one web server and viewed in a web browser
. Businesses that have failed to embrace the advancement of communications and ICT have put themselves at a disadvantage.
It is now common for adverts to include a

address in addition to, or even instead of a phone number.
The introduction of information technology has caused some unemployment, for example:
Computer-controlled warehouses need only a handful of staff to operate them.
Computer-controlled robots are now common on production lines, replacing human workers.
The old skills of workers in the printing industry are now out-of-date.
Some jobs have disappeared as they can now be done automatically, eg marking multiple choice exam papers.
However, it is fair to say that the development of information technology has led to many new jobs such as computer technicians, programmers,

IT is more likely to have changed someone's work rather than led to them losing their job. People in certain professions have had to be retrained to make use of modern technology:
Travel agents book holidays by computer, not by phone or letter.
has meant that many bank staff now work by phone in front of a computer, instead of being in a branch, behind a counter.
De-skilling has taken place. Some jobs which needed a high level of skill in the past can now be done more easily. For example, print workers today can use
an application that allows text and images to be laid out on a page
used extensively in the automotive industry, aerospace industry, and in architectural design to draw 2D and 3D designs
rather than pencil and paper on a drawing board.
Products made with computers should be of a better quality than before. For example, car bodies are welded more accurately by robots than by humans.
Robots don't get tired so the quality of work is consistent.
Machines controlled by computer are more reliable than those controlled by humans.
Miniaturisation - many electrical items, such as mobile phones and video cameras have become much smaller due to developments in technology.
High street stores now find themselves competing with each other for business both on the high street and online.
opens the market to customers nationally and internationally
enables smaller companies to compete with larger companies
reduces in staffing and/or high street stores thereby reducing costs
provides the option to offer 24 hour shopping at minimum additional cost
- businesses once competing with the shop in the next town now find themselves competing on a global scale.
- with increased competition, local companies may have to reduce their work force.
- the move to e-commerce may not be a smooth one and will certainly require a degree of investment.
- if high street stores are closed in an effort to save money, customers who prefer to shop on the high street may not be comfortable buying online so may go elsewhere.
Now, both for companies and individuals, there is pressure to have Internet access to do everyday things such as submit orders or look up details in a catalogue. There are initiatives to make as many services available on the Internet as possible, including e-government, where government departments such as the Inland Revenue can be dealt with using secure
a web page or group of web pages hosted on one web server and viewed in a web browser
, means working from home using modern technology to keep in touch with your business. Jobs can be relocated to places where it is more attractive, more convenient or cheaper to live.
a global network connecting millions of computers
electronic mail - a message written or typed on a computer and sent electronically rather than by post
a technology used to digitise hard copies of documents, transfer them across the telephone network, and print them on receipt
Office running costs and overheads (rates, electricity, heating etc) can be reduced, which in turn may reduce the need for office space.
Travel-related problems may be reduced, ie staff being unable to get into work due to rail/road delays.
It may tempt better staff to come and work for the company.
Employers need to be able to trust their staff and be prepared to have less direct control over them.
work in a comfortable environment - their home
less human interaction - fewer opportunities to meet people, share ideas with etc.
more difficult to work as part of a team, especially if they're all office based
greater temptation to spend time on non-work-related activities
difficult to separate personal life from work
Video conferencing means using computers to provide a video-link between two or more people. Instead of just talking to someone by telephone, you are able to see them as well.
The following is needed to take part in a video conference call:
a microphone (most webcams have a microphone built-in)
a global network connecting millions of computers
a general term used to describe an application or a program
It is possible to buy a special video conferencing machine just for this purpose.
Meetings can take place without leaving the office.
Travel costs and the time taken to travel can be reduced significantly.
Meetings can be called instantly worldwide with little notice.
Delegates can still attend meetings even if they are physically unable to.
May not be as productive as a discussion around a table.

640,2826,"Compare your answer with the hints below:
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Both poems are about water when it is dangerous. Clarke describes a near-drowning while Heaney describes the savage sea in a storm.
In Clarke's poem the water seems to subtly hide its dangers (e.g. satiny mud blooms in cloudiness) but Heaney recognises its force and violence - the flung spray hits the very windows.
Clarke uses the image of water to question our powers of memory, whereas Heaney uses it to show the power of nature.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Like Heaney, Whitman describes a violent storm at sea.
Like Clarke, however, Whitman hints at the supernatural. His references to demoniac laughter and the savage trinity seem on the surface more threatening than the fairytale references in Clarke's poem.
We question the endings of both poems. We wonder about the dim weird forms that Whitman sees and about the lost things that Clarke imagines drowned in the lake.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Yet for Clare, the water is innocent. It is part of the beauty of summer as it supports the wildlife: marsh marigolds and water lilies, moor hens and insects. Clarke also suggests the beauty of the water (e.g. long green silk), but for her it could be hiding something potentially sinister, while for Clare it is simply the clear lake.
The sonnet form suggests Clare's love of the water, while Clarke's use of alternating stanzas and half rhyme suggests an uncertainty. She cannot be sure what is under the water; she cannot be sure of her memory.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

641,3656,"These are standard tests to assess how well particular types of
a general term used to describe an application or a program
work. They are used to evaluate new software and hardware releases using a series of scored tests. Many computer magazines publish the test results. A typical test for a printer might be how long it takes to print a page of text.
It's a good way of getting cheap advice on the suitability of one product when compared to what else is available.
Benchmark tests may not include a feature that is really important to a particular end user. In fact they may be based on features the user may not be interested in at all.

642,7593,"This Revision Bite will give you practice in creating and structuring a presentation about a famous person in five key sections: introduction, past, present, future and concluding opinion.
In your presentation exam you should speak for about one minute in Irish on a topic you have prepared, then you will be asked questions in Irish about what you have said. You are usually allowed to take a prompt card into the exam with you with five brief points on it and as many pictures as you like, to help you remember what to say.
A good way to structure your presentation so you include a variety of tenses plus an opinion is to start with
('tomorrow' - the future), before finishing off with
For his presentation Samus has written five paragraphs about Peter Canavan, but the order of the paragraphs has been jumbled up. Can you work out which paragraph is the introduction, which is about Peter Canavan's past, present and future, and which is the concluding opinion? It will help you to look out for uses of different tenses.

643,4124,"You need to be able to draw dot-and-cross diagrams to show the
Electrically charged particles, formed when an atom or molecule gains or loses electrons.
An ionic compound occurs when a negative ion (an atom that has gained an electron) joins with a positive ion (an atom that has lost an electron). The ions swap electrons to achieve a full outer shell.
, while chloride ions have the formula Cl
. You need to show one sodium ion and one chloride ion. In the exam, make sure the dots and crosses are clear, but do not worry about colouring them.
, while oxide ions have the formula O
. You need to show one magnesium ion and one oxide ion.
. Chloride ions have the formula Cl
You need to show two chloride ions, because two chloride ions are needed to balance the charge on a calcium ion.

647,3430,"Website designs vary from basic ones set up by users as a hobby to sophisticated designs that represent large international companies. Before designing a website, you should take a look at other websites to help you decide how your webpages should look.
You should also read the project brief carefully. Make sure you do exactly what the examiners want. There is no point in doing any more - if they say five pages, only do five pages.
Normally, on a website there is a title bar at the top, a menu on the left and then the main information appears in the big space on the right.
Stick to a simple, clear page layout
Try to avoid flashy things like sound, scrolling banners and animated text/graphics. These might look 'cool' to you, but, unless they are really suitable for the purpose and audience, they are more likely to lose you marks than earn you marks.
The examiners will be looking for a consistent house style throughout each publication you produce.
A good example of this can be seen on the BBC GCSE Bitesize website. GCSE Bitesize uses the same font, sizes and layout throughout the site. This gives a much more professional impression than constantly chopping and changing between different pages.
Ideally, you should come up with a few ideas for fonts, layouts and colour schemes and then test them on members of your target audience. Remember to include details of this testing when writing your reviews and evaluations. Always remember the publication has to appeal to your target audience!
Have consistent left-hand navigation on each page.
Don't have too much text on one page - people don't like scrolling down pages.
Break text up using bullet points, short paragraphs and tables. It's more difficult to read text on screen than it is on paper.
Keep graphics to a minimum. Graphics increase the page weight and increase the time pages take to download.
Take a look at the image below. It's a classic example of a badly designed website! Make sure you avoid using garish colours and patterned backgrounds.
Bright colours and poor quality photographs are not very attractive
Here are some important rules to stick to when writing text for a website:
Stick to a single font colour and size on your website. Try to stick to black text on a white or light-coloured background.
Arial size 12 is easy to read on websites. Try not to use a smaller sized font.
Remember the intended audience. Always test your website on users.
Do not use underlining on webpages. Users will think it is a hyperlink and get confused when it doesn't link to another website.
Keep it simple. Be consistent across the whole website.
Webpages need file names. This allows you and visitors to your website to identify each webpage.
There are several rules you need to stick to when naming webpage files.
Use correct file extension names, eg .htm .html or .shtml.
Do not use symbols, eg + & % in file names.
Do no put spaces in your file or folder name. Use either dashes (-) or underscores (_)
Name your files sensibly. Video_intro.shtml, video_movie.shtm are easier to identify than page1.shtml, page2.shtml etc.
Webpage file names should mean something to you and the user
Keep html, image, flash and other media files in separate folders.
Put images in a folder called images, put audio files in a folder called audio.
There should be an index.shtml file in the site folder.
Do not create folders that contain too many or too few files.
All screen-based publications are likely to need some images. The things to keep in mind when selecting images are:
For the current eportfolio, you are only allowed to use jpg, png, gif and tif. You may need to use a graphics package to convert the graphic to a suitable format.
If they are copyright images, you will actually lose marks for putting them in (you could email the person who holds the copyright, but this can take months to sort out).
If not, use a graphics package to re-size or crop them. Editing inside Powerpoint or a website package is likely to spoil the way the graphic appears.
Have you updated your list of sources?
Each time you add a graphic to a publication, you should update your list of sources.
Can you use some of your own graphics?
It's a good idea to create some graphics. This could be with a digital camera or by doing some original artwork on the computer.
How much memory do the graphics take up?
Remember your eportfolio has a maximum size so keep an eye on individual graphics to make sure they are not too big.
At all times, make sure the graphic is suitable for the intended audience and purpose.
Before creating a website, make sure you know the difference between relative and absolute links.
These point to where the file you want to link to is saved. For example, Jeff is saving his files on his school network. He has a file called intro.html for which the absolute link is:
Look at the image below to see the folders in which intro.html sits.
The problem with absolute links is that the examiner will not have access to your schools server. When your folder and files are copied across to the exam boards server, any absolute links will not work.
For example, Jeff hands in his folder called
to the examiner. In this folder is another folder called
. The examiner, therefore, has access to everything stored within the jeffd201 folder. Now look at the absolute link again - everything that has been handed into the examiner is in bold:
The part that is not in bold represents the school's server, which the examiner
Therefore, you must use relative hyperlinks (the part in bold) when linking your webpages together.
As you have read above, an example of a relative link in Jeff's folder is:
This hyperlink just describes where the file (intro.html) is relative to the current file  in this case, in a subfolder called webpages.
Relative links make it easier to type hyperlinks  youre less likely to make errors. Files can be moved from a local system (your school server) to another server (the examination board).
Remember that the examiner will not have access to your school server. Never refer to the server, or absolute address when you use hyperlinks.
Now look at the image below taken from the examiner's computer. Notice how Jeff's files and folders have been copied on to the exam board's server.
The absolute link for Jeff's file has now changed to:
But notice how the relative link is still the same:
It is crucial to thoroughly test your presentations and websites, as well as all the publications you produce.
First, check that all the links work. It is best to copy the website or presentation onto another device (like a memory stick or CD) and try it out away from the school network - this will show if you have used absolute hyperlinks by mistake. All the links must work before you submit your work for marking and moderation.
Secondly, test your publication with members of the target audience.
Listen carefully and improve your publication accordingly.
One good way of doing this is to prepare a checklist for the reviewer to fill in. Include questions like:
Was the information at the right level?
Finally, write the results of your tests in the review section of your eportfolio. Remember to say how well your publication meets the needs of the audience and include ideas on how it can be improved.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a computer language. HTML is used to make webpages. Many software packages such as Dreamweaver and Homesite allow you to build webpages and save them as html files.
The websites listed below offer HTML tutorials and advice for building your first website.
Practise your HTML in this online text editor with examples and tutorials.
This site is a bit patronising but is a good source of basic information
Images on websites can improve the look and style of the page. However, you must be careful to save images in the correct format.
The two main formats for web images are gif and jpg.
These are used for images that have only a few colours, such as line drawings, text and logos.
Images with few colours should be saved as a gif file
These are used for images or photographs that include details and more colours.
If you save a photo or graphic in the incorrect format, how the image looks will be affected. Look at the images below. When the fish photo is saved in a gif format, colours and details are lost.
When the bitesize graphic is saved incorrectly as a jpg, unwanted colours appear and the looks less sharp. Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Cropping allows you to select the part of the image you want to show. It's likely that you may take a photograph or find an image that is too big and you only want to use one part of the image.
To crop an image, you can use image editing software such as Word, Photoshop or Paintshop.
1. Crop this image to include only the penguin.
A penguin surrounded by a large area of pebbles and someone holding a bucket
2. Select the crop tool in a picture editing package.
3. Use the crop tool to outline the part of the image you want to keep. Adjust the size of the area to be cropped by dragging on the boxes on the selection border.
