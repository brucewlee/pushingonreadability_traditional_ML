All whales, like blue whales, breathe air through
. A blowhole is an opening on top of a whale's head. The blowhole is closed when the whale is under the water. When the whale comes to the top, its blowhole opens. The whale breathes out, making water spray into the air. Then the whale breathes in and goes under the water again.
Killer whales breach, or jump out of the water.
. A breaching whale jumps up out of the water. Then it comes down and makes a huge splash!
No one is sure why whales breach. Some people say that they do it just for fun!

If insects could talk, what might they say? I found food. Are you a relative? Watch out for danger! Of course, insects dont talk the way people do, but they do
with one another. That means they exchange information.
A bee does the waggle dance. It walks in a figure eight and shakes its body. The farther away the food, the longer the bee shakes. The direction in which it walks tells other bees the way to the food.
Honeybees get food from flowers. When a honeybee finds a field of flowers, it flies back to the hive. The bee tells the other bees where to find the food. How? It dances! The round dance shows that food is nearby. If the food is far away, the bee performs the waggle dance. That dance shows the location of the food.
Fireflies have a chemical inside their bodies. It makes light. Fireflies flash lights at one another. Each
or kind, of firefly has a different flash pattern. That helps the insects find members of their own species. The flash pattern also helps male and female fireflies find one another
Grasshoppers send messages by chirping. They often rub a back leg against a wing. That causes a vibration and makes sound. Mostly male grasshoppers make sounds. They chirp to attract females. Each species of grasshopper has its own call. Some grasshoppers make sounds to warn other males to go away.
A leaf-cutter ant carries a piece of a leaf back to its nest.
Ants give off scents to pass along messages. If an ant finds food, it goes back to its nest. The ant leaves a scent trail along the way. Other ants follow the trail to find the food. They walk with their antennae to the ground. Why? Ants smell with their antennae. Ants can also leave a special scent to warn about danger.

In a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear.
Scientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help.
Scientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled.
Scientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest.
The African elephant is the largest animal that lives on land. African elephants can weigh up to 16,000 pounds.
An elephant's trunk contains more than 40,000 muscles. The trunk is used to smell, breathe, touch, eat, drink, and bathe.
An angry or frightened elephant can run about 25 miles per hour.

""Our research teaches a lesson,"" said Trivelpiece. ""Even a small change in the environment can have a big effect.""
The burning of fossil fuels gives off carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide and other gases around Earth trap heat from the sun. That can cause a rise in temperature around the world. That rise is known as global warming.
How might people reduce their need for fossil fuels?

Thousands of years ago, enemy armies and natural disasters destroyed the cities of Zeugma and Herakleion (ee-RAH-klee-on). This summer, however, scientists known as archaeologists (ahr-kee-OL-uh-jists) discovered the lost cities. They found Zeugma in Turkey, a country in Asia. Other scientists found Herakleion underwater off the coast of Egypt, a country in Africa.
About 2,000 years ago, Zeugma was an important meeting place for traders and soldiers. The ruins show that some of the homes had water pipes and mosaics.
Zeugma is located near a dam on the Euphrates (yoo-FRAY-teez) River. The dam is needed to make electricity for people who live nearby. But the dam will cause the river to rise. Soon the river's water will cover part of Zeugma's ruins.
Off the coast of Egypt, divers are finding the remains of Herakleion. Herakleion was built to honor Hercules, an ancient hero.
Experts say Herakleion is at least 2,500 years old. They say an earthquake probably caused the city to sink into the Mediterranean Sea. Archaeologists have found the remains of houses, roads, temples, statues, and coins under 30 feet of water. ""It was really a lost world,"" said Franck Goddio, an archaeologist working on the site.

619,"On April 22, millions of people around the world will celebrate Earth Day. People are finding many ways-from inventions to projects-to help protect the environment. Look inside to find out how they are working to make a difference.
Earth Day inspires people to take action and help the environment. Many people will be spreading the message that the Earth needs to be cared for year-round.
Kids around the world will participate in Earth Day events. Some will clean up parks. Others will plant trees. What do you plan to do on Earth Day to help the environment?
One way to protect the Earth is to reduce pollution. Pollution occurs when people harm the air, land, and water. Most air pollution comes from the burning of fuels, such as oil, coal, and gas. The fuel is used to run cars and heat homes. Water and land pollution often come from chemicals and garbage.
Some Earth-friendly inventions help reduce pollution. These inventions conserve, or use fewer, energy and natural resources such as water. Take a look at some of these exciting inventions.
? An Earthship is actually not a ship at all. It is a house built to save energy and water. Earthships use solar power from the sun for heat and electricity.
Earthships are made from recycled material. Old tires, aluminum soda cans, and glass bottles are some common materials used to build Earthships.
Many people who live in Earthships also recycle their water. When it rains, they collect and filter the rainwater. The filter makes the water safe to use for drinking, washing, and cooking. The leftover water is saved for other uses, such as watering indoor plants.

The Colima (koh-LEE-mah) Volcano in Mexico has roared to life again. The 12,500-foot volcano is also called the ""Volcano of Fire."" Over the past few months, its eruptions have been larger and more frequent. It has been shooting hot gas and ash high into the sky.

The whooping crane is an endangered bird. Only one flock of whooping cranes lives naturally in the wild. Those birds migrate between Canada and Texas. Scientists decided that having more than one flock would keep these birds from dying out.
Whooping cranes trained by Operation Migration in the past have remembered the route. They return to Wisconsin each spring and fly back to Florida in the fall.
""We want our birds to pay attention to us for the first year, until we get them down to Florida,"" said Duff. ""After that, we hope they communicate with wild birds and become wild birds themselves.""

266,"Are Kids' Movies and TV Shows Too Violent?
have in common? Both movies were made for kids and are rated G, which means they are OK for everyone to watch. But two scientists say those movies and many others should be rated ""V"" for their violent content.
The two scientists--Kimberly Thompson and Fumie Yokota--work for Harvard University. They watched 74 G-rated movies and said, ""We were surprised that every single movie had some act of violence."" The violence in the movies ranged from insults to attacks.
One in five TV shows for kids has no educational content, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center.
The two scientists also found that, in 46 of the movies, at least one character was hurt. And they found that, in 37 of the movies, at least one character was killed.
Most of the movies contained nearly ten minutes of violence, the scientists said. The most violent movie the scientists watched was
. That movie has 24 minutes of violence, Thompson and Yokota said.
Violent programs can also be found on TV. The Media in the Home Survey, conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, recently found that more than one-quarter of all children's TV shows had four or more violent scenes in each episode.
Some scientists say that watching too many violent TV shows and movies could make some kids violent. Watching violent shows could make some kids ""think it's no big deal for somebody to be smacked in the head with a hammer,"" said Yokota.
Scientists also worry that kids might imitate the violent acts they see on TV and in movies. Joanne Cantor, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin, said TV and movies usually don't show the effects of violence. Instead, shows often make violence look funny. Kids who think violence is funny might hurt other people without thinking about the pain they're causing.
You can protect yourself from violent TV shows and movies. First, you can limit the amount of TV you watch. The American Pediatrics Association says kids should watch no more than two hours of TV a day. Next, watch TV and movies with your parents. Talk with your parents about what you are watching on TV, and discuss what would happen if the same things happened in real life.
You and your parents can use the Internet, magazines, and newspapers to learn more about TV shows and movies. For instance, you can read TV and movie reviews on the ""Kids-in-Mind"" and ""Screen It"" Web sites.

802,"North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear site, viewed from space in February 2002
In late January, officials fro South Korea traveled to North Korea. Both countries are located in eastern Asia. The reason for their visit was to try get North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Last October, officials in North Korea admitted to a U.S. official that North Korea is building nuclear weapons. That action violates a 1994 agreement to stop the spread of nuclear arms.
Tensions further increased when North Korea's leader, Kim Jong II, opened up nuclear power plants. The power plants had been closed under an agreement that North Korea made with the United States nearly ten years ago. Officials in North Korea say the power plants will only be used to generate electricity.
However, people in the United States and countries near North Korea, like South Korea and Japan, are concerned. They think that North Korea will use the plants make nuclear arms. North Korea recently kicked out U.N. weapons inspectors. That only added to the mistrust.
North Korea is an extremely poor country. Yet it spends most of its money on its army. It relies on help from other countries to feed its starving people.
Area: 46,500 square miles (about the size of Mississippi)
Economy: many children and families are starving
Area: 38,000 square miles 9about the size of Indiana)
Economy: it has the fourth largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The United States is working with countries in the region, such as South Korea, to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear crisis. South Korea was hoping to help the United States negotiate a peaceful solution. However, officials in North Korea want to discuss the issue directly with the United States.
U.S. official have said they will communicate with North Korea if it abandons its nuclear weapons program. President Bush has said that the world will respect North Korea when it is no loner a nuclear threat.
North Korea and South Korea are located on a Peninsula in Eastern Asia. Soldiers from the United States and South Korea routinely divides North Korea and South Korea. After World War II (1939-1945), Korea was split in half. In 1950, the Korean War began when North Korea attacked South Korea, The United States helped defend South Korea.

587,"Florida is the 23rd largest state in the United States. Key West is the southernmost part of the continental United States.
Moving slowly and silently through more than a million acres of wetlands in Florida, water is the lifeblood of the Everglades. However, for the past few decades, the Everglades has been losing its lifeblood.
President Bill Clinton plans to sign a new bill into law that may breathe new life into the Everglades. The bill is called the Everglades Restoration Act. The act will help restore parts of the Everglades to the way they were many years ago, say supporters. Critics of the plan say that it does not go far enough to restore the Everglades.
The Everglades is like a shallow, slow-moving river that covers millions of acres. The ""river of grass,"" as the Everglades is called, is 50 miles wide and 120 miles long. It flows from Lake Okeechobee into Florida Bay.
A large part of the river of grass is contained within the Everglades National Park. The park covers about 1.5 million acres (about the size of Delaware). Many plant and animal species, including alligators, panthers, egrets, and manatees live in the park.
An alligator suns itself in the Everglades. Manatees, many kinds of birds, and panthers can be found in these wetlands.
The Everglades Restoration Act will spend about $8 billion to restore the river of grass over the next 30 years. The act will be managed in part by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
One important part of the act calls for the removal of dams, dikes, and flood control gates. The Corps of Engineers began installing many of those devices in 1948 to control the flow of water in the Everglades. Those devices protect towns and farms from flooding and provide
By removing dams and closing canals, the Corps of Engineers will restore the flow of water in the river of grass to the way it was more than 100 years ago. That's when people first began to drain water from the Everglades.
The act will also improve water treatment plants. Those plants clean wastewater coming from farms or towns near the Everglades. The improved plants will allow less water pollution to flow into the Everglades. The Corps of Engineers will also build reservoirs, relocate roads, and shut off drainage canals.
The maps show (1) how water flowed through the Everglades before farms and towns began draining water from the Everglades, (2) how water now flows through the Everglades, and (3) how water may flow when the plan is completed.
Many people, from environmental groups to private citizens, applaud the act. ""This is as major a restoration as one would hope for,"" said Charles Lee, a spokesperson for the Florida Audubon Society.
Critics of the plan, however, say it does not go far enough toward restoring the wetlands. For example, the Everglades once covered 9 million acres, say officials from the Sierra Club, an organization that works to protect the environment. The Corps of Engineers drained much of that land so it could be used as farmland and to build houses. More of that land should be returned to the way it used to be before the 20th century, Sierra Club officials have said.
Whatever disagreements people may have, all agree that the restoration of the Everglades will take a long time and a lot of hard work. Once the act becomes law, said Stuart Applebaum of the Corps of Engineers, it will be time to ""roll up our sleeves [and get to work] for the next 30 years.""

217,"An Iowa class heads into high-tech tests.
Every student in class has a remote control, and the kids are clicking away at the screen. But they aren't changing channels. They're taking a test! Terry Rex's fourth graders at Wings Park Elementary School in Oelwein, Iowa, are using a new kind of classroom technology. Instead of writing with pencils on exam papers, the students use remote controls to take tests.
""It's more fun,"" Courtney Ricchio, 9, told
""I don't have to write, and my hand doesn't get tired."" The remote controls are part of the Classroom Performance System (CPS). When students use CPS to take a test, the questions appear on an electronic screen. Students key in their answers on the remote-control response pad.
Rex is one of the first teachers in Iowa to use CPS. His students use the technology for more than taking tests. They also play learning games with the system. Sam Myott, 9, says his favorite CPS activity is a football game. ""It's a math game with multiplication and subtraction,"" he told
""Since it's on the computer, it's more fun than a worksheet on your desk.""
Some teachers think using CPS to grade a test is more
or a better use of time, than grading a written test. The computer keeps track of the students' answers and prints out their grades at the end of the day. The computer also reports which questions the class found most difficult to answer, so Rex can review them with the group.
Classrooms across the country are trying out new teaching gadgets.
Sixth graders Marina Gagliano and Kerry O'Conner of Wellwood Middle School in Fayetteville, New York, label parts of a microscope on an interactive whiteboard. The whiteboard allows students to use their fingers to click and tap answers on the projected image.
Fourth and fifth graders at Elton Hills Elementary School in Rochester, Minnesota, are on the move. Their classrooms have no chairs! Tiny desks hold high-tech gadgets, such as laptops and iPods, with different lessons. Researchers say this setup may be healthier for students than sitting at desks all day.

Collectible coins and currency worth about $1 billion were on display at the World's Fair of Money. The fair was held this August in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
During the five-day event, money was displayed for looking at, buying, and selling. Some coins were worth as little as half a cent. Other coins were worth millions.
The event drew thousands of coin lovers from around the world. That's not surprising--coin collecting is one of the world's most popular hobbies.
, or a way to make money in the future. Most collectors, however, are not in it for the money. They participate in the hobby because of each coin's story. One coin expert referred to money as ""history that you can hold in your hand.""
Among the fair's most valuable coins were two Liberty Head nickels. The nickels were worth between $2 million and $3 million each.
A 1794 coin couldn't be missed at the fair either. Experts say the coin, believed to be the first silver dollar in the United States, is worth about $10 million.
Coin hobbyists point out that just because a coin is old doesn't necessarily mean it's valuable. A coin's worth depends on how many exist, on how many people want it, and on its condition.
Coin collectors are used to paying more for a coin than its original value. They say their hobby is worth every penny.
Each day, the government prints 37 million bills, worth about $696 million.
About 18 tons of ink per day go into printing those bills.
If you had $10 billion and you spent $1 every second of every day, you would go broke in 317 years.

A year may be only 365 days, but a lot can happen in such a short time. Below are just a few of the many important events that took place this past year.
It was a tough summer for many people in the western United States. Wildfires burned about 7 million acres of land--six times the size of the Grand Canyon National Park. The fires forced thousands of people to leave their homes. Many people returned home and found charred rubble.
Recovery is already under way in most burned areas. In Utah, officials from one park are using a helicopter to spread grass seeds over wide areas.
The United States was the top medal winner at the 2000 Olympic Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. The United States took home a total of 97 medals, 39 of which were gold.
There were some spectacular events in this year's Summer Games. One of the highlights was the victory of U.S. wrestler Rulon Gardner (left) over Russian Alexander Karelin. Gardner beat Karelin, who had not lost a match in 13 years, by 1 point.

More than 97 million people voted for president of the United States on Tuesday, November 7. Most political experts had predicted that the race would be close, but no one knew that it would be as close as it turned out to be.
On the day after the election, Vice President Al Gore had slightly more votes than Texas Governor George W. Bush had. But the vote in Florida was so close that the state had to recount all 6 million votes cast in that state. The race was so close that no one knew who had actually won the election long after the polls closed.

Each year, however, 15 million kids worldwide die from diseases, including hepatitis, cholera, and diarrhea, Arntzen said. Most of the children who get those diseases live in the poorest countries in the world, mainly in Asia, Africa, and South America.
Arntzen says it's impossible to send a doctor to vaccinate kids in every village in the world. Even if doctors could go to every village, many poor people couldn't afford to pay for the vaccinations.
That's why scientists are working on ways to change fruit and vegetable seeds. They want to make vaccines part of the plants, explained Arntzen. If the scientists are successful, people in poor countries could use the seeds to grow food that would protect them from some diseases. That way, an apple a day would not only keep the doctor away, but would keep deadly diseases away as well.

Lately, many editorial cartoonists have been focusing on the presidential candidates and the election. Artist Gary Markstein created two political illustrations to express his opinions about this year's election.
The economy is one of the main issues in this year's presidential election. (The economy refers to the way a country runs its jobs and industries.)

to make his point about the economy. Symbols are objects that represent other things. One cartoon shows two weather maps labeled ""Economy."" George W. Bush stands in front of a weather map covered with smiling faces. John Kerry holds an umbrella as he stands in front of a map with bad-weather symbols.
A forecaster is someone who predicts the weather. Why does the artist depict Bush and Kerry as weather forecasters?
What point is the cartoonist making about the candidates and the economy?
How do the symbols help convey the message? What do the suns represent? What do the hail and thunderstorm clouds represent?
Do you think the cartoonist prefers one candidate over the other? Why or why not?
What dirt are the presidential candidates digging up about each other? Some people think election campaigning is a messy business. In one cartoon, Markstein draws attention to negative campaigning and
between candidates. In politics, mudslinging refers to speaking negatively about another person or opposing party.
To make his point, the artist shows two men talking about dirt for sale. One man says to the other, ""The Bush and Kerry campaigns each ordered 2 tons...""
Why might the Bush and Kerry campaigns be ordering mud?
What message do you think the cartoonist is sending about the election campaign?

CIS is just one of hundreds of schools in the United States that are going green. A
is built with recycled and environmentally friendly materials. Green schools are designed to use less energy than traditional school buildings.
The majority of the energy supply in the United States comes from the burning of
such as oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels were formed from the remains of prehistoric animals and plants. People use fossil fuels when they drive their cars, heat their homes, and power farms, factories, and cities.
Though people depend on fossil fuels, those energy sources have their drawbacks. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air and releases gases that contribute to global warmingthe gradual rise in Earth's average temperature.
Hoover Dam generates clean energy by using water to spin turbines.
Fossil fuels are gradually being used up. To conserve them, scientists are looking to
sources. Renewable energy is power from sources that can't be used up and do not pollute the environment. Water, wind, and solar power are types of renewable energy.
President George W. Bush announced an energy plan that calls on lawmakers to ensure that ecofriendly fuels are developed and made easily available to Americans. Gas is a fossil fuel used in cars, and the price to fill up a gas tank is rising. Gas costs about $3 a gallon in some parts of the United States.
At CIS, students are excited for construction to begin on their new school building. ""I think the school is going to be a lot better,"" Drew Barsody, 10, told
""I'm looking forward to seeing the solar panels.""
These wind turbines convert wind into electricity.
Here are some common environmentally friendly energy alternatives.
Solar Power: Solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat and electricity. California and Arizona are two states that use solar power. One drawback of solar power is that energy can't be collected if the sun isn't shining.
Energy produced from windmills is used to generate electricity. The amount of electricity generated from wind has been growing in recent years, tripling since 1998 in the United States. Electricity is produced from wind in 30 states, including California, Texas, and Iowa.
is one of the oldest sources of energy. Hydropower often comes from dams or waterfalls. Of all renewable energy sources, it is most often used to generate electricity. In 2004, it accounted for 7 percent of all the electricity generated in the United States.
Ethanol is a clean-burning fuel that can power cars. It is created from several sources, such as corn crops. Typically, a small amount of ethanol is combined with gasoline to fuel vehicles. That helps decrease the fuel's cost and harmful emissions.
Turning off the lights when you leave a room is one way to conserve energy. What are some other ways to save energy?

361,"The Heat Is On: Will Global Warming Affect Animals?
Polar bears in Alaska are having trouble catching one of their main meals--ringed seals. To get to the seals, the bears often walk across islands of ice floating in the water.
Ice throughout Alaska is melting earlier and faster in the spring than it did several years ago. So polar bears don't have as much time to catch seals before the ice melts. As a result, polar bears are catching fewer seals.
Ice along Alaska's coast is melting because the temperature is higher worldwide. In the last 100 years, Earth's temperature has risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit.
. Global warming is changing the environment worldwide. As a result, many plants and animals are being affected, say scientists from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
As temperatures rise, more and more animals will have to
, or move, in order to survive, said scientist Jay Malcolm of the WWF.
Many plants and animals that can't adjust or migrate will not survive the rise in temperature, said WWF scientists. In some areas of the world, the WWF says, as many as two in ten species of plants and animals will die out by the year 2100.
Here are some examples of how global warming is affecting some animals in North America.
The numbers on the map show where each animal can be found.
The black guillemot (GIL-uh-maht) is a bird that lives on an island off Alaska's coast. It eats Arctic cod, a fish that lives in water under ice. Rising temperatures have caused much of the ice to melt. The Arctic cod has moved to other parts of the sea where water is still covered with ice. The guillemot no longer has enough fish to eat.
The American bistort is a plant that lives in Mount Rainier National Park. The Edith's checkerspot butterfly drinks nectar from bistort flowers. The warming temperatures have caused the butterflies to hatch earlier, before the flowers bloom, so the butterflies don't have enough food right after they hatch.
Global warming is actually helping some animals.
The Mexican vole lives in areas with warm temperatures. It is spreading northward into Arizona and Colorado because of the rise in temperatures there.
For years, red fire ants lived in the warm southern part of the United States. Today, because of rising temperatures, they are spreading northward.
Scientists have learned that global warming is already affecting Earth. ""We should not expect the effects of global warming to take place 50 years in the future,"" said scientist Rafe Sagarin. ""It's happening right now.""
Scientists agree that Earth has been getting warmer for the last 100 years. They don't agree on
Gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming. Carbon dioxide in the air traps heat from the sun, causing Earth's temperature to rise.
Volcanoes and forest fires release carbon dioxide into the air. Some scientists blame the rise in temperature on volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and other natural events.
Other scientists blame human actions for the rise in temperature. They say Earth has always had volcanoes and forest fires, so why is Earth warming now? Those scientists say the carbon dioxide from automobiles and factories is causing the recent increase in global warming.

That isnt the only thing the landmarks share. Experts say the Everglades, the Great Barrier Reef, and Kathmandu are in trouble and should be closed off by 2020.
are endangering the landmarks, warns a new report by the Centre for Future Studies (CFS). Global warming is the gradual rise in Earths average temperature.
""The combined impact of too many tourists stomping all over these important sites plus climate change is having a severe [effect],"" Susi Moser, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told
The last nine years were the hottest since scientists began tracking Earths temperature in 1861. Some scientists say global warming will create more
or powerful, hurricanes. Researchers predict that the heat will cause glaciers in the Antarctic to melt. That will cause ocean levels to rise.
Those changes could destroy the Everglades, the CFS report says. Stronger hurricanes could threaten the areas plant and animal species, including American crocodiles and manatees. Rising seawater could flood the swampy region.
Its important to protect the 2,358-square-mile landmark, Jan Michael Jacobson, director of the Everglades Institute, told
""The Everglades primarily is valuable because it is a unique habitat,"" he said.
The historic temples of Kathmandu, Nepal, were built between 1300 and 1800. They draw millions of tourists each year.
The Great Barrier Reef and Kathmandu are facing a different threattourists. The Great Barrier Reef attracts about 1.8 million tourists a year, who pump billions of dollars into Australias economy. Visitors can also damage the delicate system of coral reefs.
Tourists are endangering Kathmandu, too, CFS officials say. The valley is in the shadow of Mount Everest, the worlds tallest mountain. The report warns that skiers and climbers hoping to tackle Mount Everest and other Himalayan peaks may harm Kathmandus ancient temples.
The effects of global warming are already being felt. More than 150 countries are working to stop the rising temperatures. They have
emissions. Those gases contribute to global warming.
As for the Great Barrier Reef and Kathmandu, the CFS report recommends limiting the number of tourists allowed to visit the sites. But some people say that visiting endangered landmarks could encourage tourists to fight for their protection.
Many cars and factories burn fossil fuels. That releases greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the air. Those gases form a layer and trap the suns heat close to Earth.
That process is called the greenhouse effect. The layer of gases acts as a window in a greenhouse doesit lets in heat but doesnt let much out. The result is global warming, a worldwide rise in average temperature.
There are 788 World Heritage Sites, but becoming one is not easy. Landmarks must meet one of 10 requirements. For instance, a site must represent a unique culture or a significant period in history. Independent groups
or examine, each landmark. Then an international committee, which is part of the United Nations, votes on the new sites. The Great Wall of China and the Statue of Liberty are included on the list.
Why is it important to protect threatened landmarks?

517,"Meet a monkey with a Mohawk! Scientists recently discovered the unusual-looking creature with spiked hair in the mountains of Tanzania, a country located in East Africa. It is Africa's first new
or type, of monkey to be identified in 20 years.
The long-tailed, tree-dwelling monkey is a highland mangabey (MANG-guh-bee). It is covered with brownish-gray fur and has an off-white belly and tail. The new monkey makes an odd ""honk-bark"" call.
This latest discovery has surprised scientists. ""The chances of finding a large, noisy monkey that no one has ever scientifically described before makes this a rare event indeed,"" says scientist Trevor Jones.
Highland mangabeys are shy creatures. Their shyness makes them difficult to spot. That might explain why scientists were unaware that the species had existed. Another reason is that the monkeys live high in the forest
Scientists are working hard to protect the highland mangabey's environment. It is estimated that fewer than 1,000 of the monkeys live in the wild. Scientists say the discovery shows that there is still a lot to learn about Africa.

Evelyn Arroyo is the mother of three girls who were students at Hockanum Elementary School in East Hartford, Connecticut, where Bocchichio teaches. Last year, Bocchichio learned from Arroyo's daughters, Leslie, Juanita, and Iris, that their mother was sick with kidney disease.
The diagram shows some of the organs in the human body. The diagram shows the kidneys in front of other body organs so you can see them. The kidneys are actually behin these organs.

to stay alive. In a kidney transplant operation, doctors remove the diseased kidney and replace it with a working kidney.
In the United States, many people suffer from kidney disease. According to Arroyo's doctor, David Hull, more than 47,000 people are waiting for kidney transplants. For many of those people, finding a kidney is a problem.
Some of Evelyn Arroyo's relatives offered a kidney, but their kidneys did not match the tissue that made up Arroyo's kidneys. Arroyo's family feared she might die before a matching kidney was found.
That's when Bocchichio volunteered one of his kidneys, which matched Arroyo's tissue. During the operations, which took place in January, doctors removed one of Bocchichio's kidneys and put it inside Arroyo.
After the operations, Arroyo told Bocchichio, ""I want to thank you again for this chance to live for my beautiful girls;... you're my angel.""
Word of the operations' success quickly spread through Hockanum Elementary School. ""I am very proud of what he has done,"" Principal Ismael A. Torres told

A tropical rain forest is warm and has heavy rainfall. The Amazon, in South America, is the largest rain forest in the world.
Yet the Amazons future is grim. Farmers are rapidly destroying this lush landscape.
has been huge problem in the Amazon since the 1960s. Deforestation occurs when farmers and loggers cut down trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Until recently, scientists thought the rain forest was losing about 5,800 square miles a year. However, using the latest satellite technology, researchers have discovered that the Amazon is shrinking at about twice that rate.
Why should we worry about a rain forest that is thousands of miles from where we live? Deforestation reduces the rain forests
or the variety of plants and animals in a particular area. The Amazon is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant diversity. It is home to the biggest flower in the world, a bird-eating spider, and a monkey about the size of a toothbrush.
Scientists estimate that they have identified only a small number of all species that live in the rain forest. As loggers and farmers destroy the forest, animals and plants may become extinct before they are discovered.
Deforestation affects people too. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines we need come from the rain forest.
The Amazon is often called the ""lungs of the world."" Its trees clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans. Carbon dioxide is a
Greenhouse gases trap the suns heat close to Earth. Without the trees in the rain forest, the Earths climate would become much hotter.
Stopping the destruction of the rain forest is not an easy task. Brazils government recently created two national parks in the Amazon rain forest. The governments efforts placed 3.7 million acres of rain forest off-limits for development. The protected area is more than twice the size of Maryland.
Others think that this is not enough. ""The single most important factor contributing to forest loss is population growth in Brazil,"" scientist Jim Bowyer of the University of Michigan told
""People make the forest their home. All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive.""
Scientists estimate that if deforestation continues at its current rate, the rain forest may survive only another 40 to 50 years. ""We need to address the real causes of deforestation, like poverty and population growth,"" says Bowyer. ""Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest.""

23,"Did you know that the average child will spend more time in front of the television than at school this year? That's according to the TV-Turnoff Network.
Beginning April 21, millions of children and their families across the country will trade some TV time for other activities. They will zap off their television sets for an entire week.
April 21 through 27 is the ninth annual TV-Turnoff Week. ""The idea of the week is to encourage people to take a break from TV,"" said Frank Vespe of the TV-Turnoff Network. ""One of the things we learn is that TV is taking away from other things that we might do for fun.""
The goal of the week, according to its organizers, is to help kids discover other activities they enjoy. Then kids may make lasting changes in their lives.
Health experts warn that too much television can have negative effects on kids. Children who spend too much time watching television often get too little exercise. They also don't perform as well in school as do children who watch less TV.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
1. This is the ninth year of TV-Turnoff Week.
2. Many kids like to watch TV.
3. TV-Turnoff Week lets kids discover other activities they enjoy.
So think about what you might do if you zapped off your television set for an entire week. Would you read a book? Head outside to ride your bike? Play a board game with your mom or dad?

Thousands of kids recently had a sneak peek at the world of tomorrow. They experienced talking robots, underwater vehicles, and lifesize video games. These inventions were among the 150 creations at this years NextFest fair. The four-day festival was held in New York City, New York.
NextFest gave inventors a chance to unveil their latest creations. Many were right out of the lab. Others were still being developed. Here are a few of the high-tech gadgets that captured our attention.
Actroid is a robot designed to look and talk like a human.
Dont let this photo fool you! Actroid may look real, but she is actually a
or humanlike, robot. She was designed to greet and entertain people. When Actroid talks, she moves her hands and makes eye contact. Other versions of this robot are programmed to reply to hundreds of questions, such as ""What time is it?"" and ""Are you a real person?""
What is it like to live like a sea creature? The Bionic Dolphin gives people the chance to find out. The vehicle can cruise across the water at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour (mph) and then dive at least 10 feet. Its inventor, Thomas Rowe, designed the vehicle with wings to enable it to ""fly"" underwater as fast as 40 mph. ""The majority of my research was on dolphins, but where I got the most help was penguins and diving birds,"" Rowe told
The Bionic Dolphin was first designed for
or play. However, it may be used in the future to save whales entangled in nets. A larger version of the vehicle has been designed to rescue people lost at sea. ""It swallows them,"" says Rowe.
What combines music, rock climbing, and video games? Its a musical climbing wall called DigiWall. This climbing wall has interactive games based on speed, cooperation, and creativity. ""We wanted to do some kind of computer game where you are very physical,"" project leader Mats Liljedahl told
""We removed the computer screen, and instead we are using the lights and the grips."" The grips light up when they are touched.
Robonaut may help astronauts in future space missions. The robot is being designed by NASA, the U.S. space agency. The robot will ""perform tasks that up until now only astronauts could do,"" NASA engineer Roger Rovekamp told
Robonaut can operate on its own or be controlled by a human operator from Earth or in space. The operator would wear a special headset that displays live video from the cameras on the robots head. By wearing a glove with sensors, that person can control the actions of Robonauts fingers, which can hold tools as small as tweezers.

That is exactly the point. ""The museum shows what happens to our trash, how we can reduce our trash, and what we can do instead of throwing our trash away,"" said museum director Sotoria Montanari.
Today, Americans create more garbage than ever before. In the early 1900s, most items were packed in containers that could be used again. Now, most of the food we buy, from cereal to milk, comes in boxes and cartons that can be thrown away.
So what happens to trash after it is tossed out? Some trash ends up in

The hammerhead suffered the steepest drop-an 89 percent decrease. The number of great white sharks declined by 79 percent.

Another risk to sharks are the people who kill them for their fins, which are used to make shark-fin soup. The United States prohibits that practice.
The decline in the shark population has scientists worried. All plants and animals in the ocean depend on one another for food. The link between them is called the
Sharks are predators at the top of the food chain. A predator is an animal that survives by eating other animals. Sharks hunt, or prey upon, other animals such as seals and tuna. Seals and tuna eat smaller fish. Those smaller fish feed on tiny fish and ocean plants.

Earth's atmosphere is made of several layers. Ozone is a gas that makes up one of those layers. That layer stretches from 6 miles to 30 miles above Earth's surface.
Ozone is an important gas. It protects life on Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. Without ozone, life couldn't exist. The dangerous solar rays are called ultraviolet rays, or UV rays. UV rays can cause sunburn and skin cancer.

Scientists first noticed the ozone hole in the 1970s. Since then, each year, the hole has opened above Antarctica for a few months in the fall. The largest hole formed in 2000. It was three times larger than the United States. This year, unusually severe storms caused the hole to split, say scientists.
Cold temperatures in the atmosphere over Antarctica and chemical pollution cause the ozone hole. Chemicals that used to be in aerosol cans, air conditioners, and refrigerators made the pollution. To protect the atmosphere, people stopped using those dangerous chemicals in the mid-1990s.

125,"Lack of Zzzs Can Lead to Injuries
Fourth grader Annie Inglese knows how important it is to get the right amount of sleep each night. ""If I don't get enough sleep,"" she says, ""I have trouble getting up in the morning.""
Sleep experts say that kids who do not get a good night's sleep on a regular basis put their safety at risk. Delaying bedtime for other activities can lead to accidents, such as falling off a bike or getting hurt on the playground.
In addition to preventing injuries, children who get enough sleep on a regular basis tend to get better grades and be in a better mood. ""Sleep is just as important as nutrition and exercise in our overall health,"" says Dr. Carl Hunt, a sleep expert with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Estimates show about 1 out of every 4 adults does not get enough sleep. Sleep experts think that number may be just as high for kids. According to the NIH, children ages 7 to 11 need at least nine hours of sleep each night.
Most kids and families today have busy schedules that can keep them from getting enough sleep. Plus, watching television, chatting on the Internet, and playing video games all compete with valuable sleep time.

To enter the exhibit, visitors walk through a turnstile similar to one they would find at a baseball stadium. Inside, more than 100 objects from 1840 through the present are on display. The exhibit includes scorecards, baseball cards, bats, painted baseballs, artwork, and even an autographed quilt among its many items.
""It's baseball history and trivia,"" Elizabeth Warren told
when describing the exhibit she organized. ""It combines baseball and art.""
Warren says that Jackie Robinson is depicted on many objects, more than any other baseball player. In 1947, Jackie Robinson made history. He became the first African American baseball player in the major leagues when he joined the Dodgers. At that time, the Dodgers were located in Brooklyn. Today, they are in Los Angeles.
""Jackie Robinson was a hero both on and off the field,"" said Warren. ""He's such a great role model.""
The exhibit runs through February 1, 2004

is an opening in Earths surface through which molten rock, ash, and other materials blast out. Volcanoes erupt because of a buildup of heat and pressure deep within Earth. Volcanoes occur where Earths plates push together or pull apart.
For weeks, Mayon has threatened thousands of people who live near the volcano. Repeated eruptions of hot ash and fiery lava have destroyed crops and forests. Experts warn that more violent eruptions could happen at any time.
Mayon is the most active volcano in the Philippines. Scientists consider a volcano active if it has erupted within the last 10,000 years. A dormant volcano is ""sleeping"" but is expected to erupt in the future. An extinct volcano is not expected to erupt again.
Why might a volcano not erupt for years and years?

759,"Standing on a cliff, a sharpshooter carefully aimed his rifle at a Mexican gray wolf. Bulls-eye! The wolf went down. A short time later, he shot a second wolf.
The wolves, however, weren't injured. The sharpshooter had shot special darts at them. The darts contained a drug that put the wolves to sleep.
U.S. government officials picked up the sleeping wolves. They planned to move the wolves to an area far away from people.
The two wolves are part of a program to bring wolves back to Arizona and New Mexico. Until about 1900, the Mexican gray wolf lived in both states. Some of the wolves ate cattle and attacked people. People hunted the wolves because they thought the animals were dangerous. By 1950, few wolves were left in the area.
The U.S. government has brought wolves back to those states. But ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico say wolves are causing problems again.
What's the scariest animal? Is it a grizzly bear, a shark, or a wolf? Or is it something else? Believe it or not, deer are more dangerous.
Deer may seem harmless, but they can cause a lot of trouble. Deer often wander onto busy roads. When they do, they can cause car accidents. In 2001, deer caused 26,000 car accidents. A year earlier, they caused 83 human fatalities.
Ranchers say the wolves that the sharpshooters hit with darts killed 19 calves. The ranchers fear that the wolves might attack people as well.
""I can handle the bears and the mountain lions and the bobcats,"" said one rancher. When you see [those animals], they take off. They're scared of you. These wolves, they're not scared. And that's what scares me.""
The ranchers say wolves cannot be reintroduced to their area because too many people live there now. ""You can't turn back the clock,"" one person said.

472,"Experts hope 2006 will be the year the world is polio-free.
Will polio be declared a disease of the past?
World health groups are fighting a war
with a crippling and sometimes deadly diseasepolio. Their efforts are paying off. Polio has been wiped out in 10 African countries, according to a recent report.
Since mid-2003, nearly 200 children in those 10 western and central African countries were
for life, but no new cases have been reported since last June. When people are paralyzed, they are unable to move different parts of their bodies and may be unable to walk.
The disease raced across Africa and into Asia after people in Nigeria refused the polio
mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think well get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told
She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria.""
Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly
disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havent been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims.
With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world. On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government approved the use of a vaccine that stopped people from getting the disease. Jonas Salk was the doctor who invented the first polio vaccine.
A boy in Africa receives an oral polio vaccine from a WHO (World Health Organization) worker.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world thanks to Salk, it still threatens children in Africa and Asia. Major efforts were recently under way to
or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been
Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door.
To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November.
After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Its uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives.""
Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization.
Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why?
Jonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.
From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Roosevelts death, Salks vaccine was declared officially safe.
In October 2005for the first time in 26 years in the United Statesfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnt at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.

41,"Recently, historians found an old well in Jamestown, Virginia.
Historians believe that colonists from England dug the well nearly 400 years ago. Shortly after the well was completed, it dried up. The colonists then used the well as a dump.
The historians have found a piece of old armor in the well. Studying the armor and other ""garbage"" from the well will help us learn about life in early Jamestown.
The history of Jamestown begins in England. On December 20, 1606, three ships sailed from England. The ships were bound for Virginia. After the colonists on the ships landed in Virginia, they built a fort. The colonists arrived in North America 14 years before the Pilgrims.
Most of the colonists came to Virginia to search for treasure. Most did not know how to grow crops to feed themselves. They became so hungry that they ate dogs, rats, and snakes.
Eventually, more people settled in Jamestown. They turned the fort into a town. The colonists began to grow and sell crops. The small fort became the first permanent English settlement in North America.
The ""garbage"" from the well is helping historians better understand how the colonists lived.
""When one stands at Jamestown today, it is hard to imagine how much hope, regret, fear, hatred, hunger, pain, and death were experienced at this place,"" historian Ivor Noel Hume wrote of the fort's earliest colonists.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
The settlers at Jamestown were often hungry.

Currently, 1 out of every 6 kids in this country is Hispanic. Officials estimate that by 2020, 1 out of 4 children will be Hispanic American.
Hispanic Americans have influenced food, music, and customs in the United States. Hispanic Heritage Month marks a time for Americans to celebrate the traditions and history of Hispanic people. It takes place from September 15 to October 15.
People in communities around the country will celebrate the month with festivals. Many students will recognize the month by learning about the important roles Hispanic people have played in our countrys history.

People sometimes refer to the United States as a ""melting pot."" That phrase means that people from many different countries have settled here. People of Hispanic heritage, along with people from other cultures, help make the United States strong.
From science to sports, people of Hispanic heritage have contributed to the history of the United States. Take a look at some of these well-known people.
Dr. Novello was born in Puerto Rico. In 1990, she became the first Hispanic American to serve as the U.S. surgeon general. That is the doctor who leads our country on health issues. She worked to improve healthcare for Americans, especially children, women, and minorities.
Gary Soto is an award-winning Hispanic American author. He writes fiction and poetry for adults and children. His writing is based on his experiences growing up as a Mexican American in California. His books, including
Baseball in April and Other Stories and Taking Sides
, are popular with many young readers.
In 1990, Ellen Ochoa became the first Hispanic American woman astronaut when she was accepted into NASAs training program. Ochoa, whose fathers parents were from Mexico, flew her first space shuttle mission in 1993. Since then she has clocked more than 720 hours in flight.

Most kids who play football get minor bruises and scrapes. Some injure their knees and even break bones. Others get head concussions. But a 10-year-old girl died on September 2. Doctors said a football injury probably caused the fatality.

Although not enough is known about sports-related injuries among children, Washington and other doctors say kids and coaches can follow certain safety tips. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh give this advice:
Coaches should receive first-aid training. They should also be trained to recognize whether a child athlete has a severe head injury.
Leagues should have rules that require kids to take time off from playing after they have suffered an injury-especially a head injury.
To make sure they are safe, kids should always wear the proper safety equipment when playing any sport.

One of the most historic regions in the United States is in trouble. The 175-mile-long area of land stretches through Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
The area is home to more American history than any other slice of land in the country, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. George Washington built his estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison also built their homes in that state. The region at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains includes many battlefields from the Civil War (18611865).
As people construct new houses, roads, and buildings, they are destroying acres of history. Officials say the region has lost more than 150,000 acres of farmland in the past 20 years. That is an area slightly smaller than New York City.
To call attention to the problem, the Trust placed this region on the 2005 list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. The trust works to

The following places are in the region between Pennsylvania and Virginia that was added to this year's list of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in the United States.

489,"Going, Going, Gone! African Monkey Declared Extinct
In 1933, a discovery in Africa excited scientists around the world. They had found a
, or kind, of monkey that they had never seen before--the Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey. Now, only 77 years after it was found, that monkey is extinct, scientists recently announced.
No one has seen a Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey for more than 20 years. In 1988, scientists declared the monkey an endangered species. For the last seven years, scientists searched for the monkey in Ghana and Cte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), two countries in western Africa. They found no sign of the animal.
""If [the] red colobus were present near any of our survey routes, it is likely that we would have seen one,"" said scientist John Oates.
Scientists blame the animal's extinction on hunting and the destruction of the forests where it lived.
Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was the first primate --which includes monkeys and apes--to become extinct in nearly 300 years. But scientists say it will not be the last. They worry that many of the 600 other primate species may die out within the next 100 years. Twenty-five species may die out within ten to 20 years. More than 120 primate species may become extinct before the end of this century, said Ross MacPhee of New York City's American Museum of Natural History.
Endangered primates live in Africa, Asia, and South America. Many of those primates live in areas where people are poor and need to hunt for food to survive.
Scientists fear that unlimited hunting could kill off more primates. ""Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was eaten by people. The last ones probably went into someone's pot,"" said scientist John Terborgh.
MacPhee explained that the best way to help primates is to protect them and the areas where they live. ""As long as there are a few individuals, and as long as humans leave them alone, they'll come back [from near extinction].""

467,"How will a growing U.S. population affect the countrys future?
The United States is about to reach a huge milestone. The population will hit 300 million sometime in late October, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The estimate is based on a running total of births, deaths, and the number of people moving in and out of the country.
""[The 300 million mark] is like a birthday. Its a number that gives us an opportunity to see where weve been and think about where we want to go,"" scientist Howard Hogan of the U.S. Census Bureau told
Its been almost 40 years since the U.S. population hit the 200 million mark. The country has added about 2.8 million people each year. On average, a baby is born every eight seconds in the United States.

Hispanic Heritage Month is September 15 to October 15.
Hispanic Americans are the fastest-growing minority group in the United States. Nearly 43 million Hispanic Americans live in the country, reports the U.S. Census Bureau. They are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries.
To honor Hispanic traditions and history, Americans celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. It began on September 15. That date marks the anniversary of independence for Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.
During Hispanic Heritage Month, many Americans will take part in festivals and parades. Students across the country will also spend the month learning how people of Hispanic heritage have added to our countrys history.

As a little girl, Eileen Collins dreamed of becoming an astronaut when she grew up. ""I wanted to fly the space shuttle,"" she said. ""When I was very young and first started reading about astronauts, there were no women astronauts.""
After many years of hard work in college, flight school, and the military, Collins's dream came true. She made history in 1995 as the first woman to pilot a space shuttle. In 1999, she made history again when she became the first female shuttle
for NASA, the U.S. space agency. A commander is someone who leads a crew.

exploded after a 16-day mission. All seven astronauts aboard were killed.
During liftoff, a piece had broken off

After the accident, space travel seemed riskier than ever. Because of the dangers, some people wondered whether NASA's shuttles would return to space.
Now NASA officials say it's time. Collins will lead the historic return-to-flight mission. The mission is scheduled for May or June on the space shuttle
Although NASA's shuttles have been grounded, they haven't been collecting dust. In fact, Collins and her crew of six astronauts have been very involved in updates to the shuttles to prevent another disaster. (See ""

The mission's success will be measured on how the safety improvements made to

To Collins and the crew, there is more than success at stake. They believe the mission will honor the lost astronauts of

NASA has been working to make the shuttle safer. New inspection tools and cameras have been installed on

Once in space, the astronauts will control a robotic arm called a boom from inside the shuttle. A camera at the end of the boom will look for damage on the shuttle's underside and wings. If damage is detected, the astronauts can attempt to repair it or wait to be rescued at the International Space Station.
Given the dangers of space travel, should the shuttle program continue? Why or why not?

710,"Alhaji Babah Sawane was only 10 years old when a rebel group kidnapped him in his African country of Sierra Leone. Taken from his family, he was forced to learn how to fire a rifle. He fought in an army for the next two and a half years.
Peacekeepers from the United Nations (U.N.) helped to free Alhaji. In 2001, he addressed the U.N., asking that organization to help children around the world who are forced to fight in war zones.
""We ask this body on behalf of Sierra Leone to do all they can to bring our sad story to an end,"" he said. ""We want to be able to move about freely in all parts of the country.""
Sierra Leone is just one of an estimated 41 countries around the world that use child soldiers. While the most offenses occur in Africa and Asia, the problem also exists in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East.
Most children who become soldiers come from very poor countries. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers estimates that 300,000 children are fighting as soldiers. In some countries, boys and girls as young as 8 years old are being recruited, or called upon, to fight.
Protecting children in war and conflict zones has become a top job for the United Nations. And the U.N. has made significant progress. In a report issued in December 2002, the U.N. named 28 governments and armed groups that use children to fight their battles.
International law prohibits countries from using children who are younger than 15 years old in combat. However, several U.N. conventions condemn, or do not approve of, having anyone under 18 serve as a soldier. If a country recruits child soldiers, it is violating, or breaking the rule of, international agreements.
Why us it important for governments around the world to protect children?
The U.N. wants to save children like Alhaji Babah Sawane from suffering. The report sends a strong message to governments everywhere: They will be held accountable for their actions.

One of New Hampshires most famous faces recently became history. In May, the Old Man of the Mountain crumbled to the ground.

is a side view of a face.
Located on Cannon Mountain, the Old Man was a popular tourist spot and a favorite among the people of New Hampshire. In fact, the jagged rock face was considered the state symbol. It appeared on state quarters, road signs, and many souvenirs.
The famous landmark stretched 40 feet high and 25 feet wide. Long concerned that it would collapse, officials made several efforts to save the mountain face. However, the heavy snow and strong winds of this past winter finally caused the cliff to collapse.
Now a special state committee has been set up to decide if the stone profile should be replaced with a man-made face. ""He was part of our history, and he can still be a part of our history if we rebuild him,"" said a New Hampshire man who recalled learning about the famous face in the fourth grade.
Do you think the Old Man should be rebuilt? Why or why not?

That is not the case for Rich Bradley, a real-life Spider-Man. He can't get enough of the creepy crawlers. Bradley is an

Although the hairy creatures spook many people, there isn't much reason to be afraid of spiders. ""Most spiders are not very dangerous,"" said Bradley.
In fact, most are timid creatures that are unable to give humans more than a harmless bite. Although spider venom is deadly to insects, it often has little effect on humans because of our larger size.
Spiders may have a bad reputation for being scary, but they are important to us. Bradley hopes his work shatters some

Spiders eat mosquitoes and other insects that harm farmers' crops and carry diseases. Bradley's research is teaching scientists more about how spiders help control

Get caught up on some different types of spiders. Spiders come in all shapes and sizes. Crab spiders, jumping spiders, and orb weavers have made Rich Bradley's Ohio count. Find out more about them and other spiders.
Can you guess how this spider got its name? It may not live in the ocean, but it looks like a crab. The crab spider lives on flowers. It can match its body color to the flower's color. That allows it to sneak up on insects.
What a leap! The jumping spider can jump between 10 and 40 inches. To catch an insect, this hunting spider sneaks up on its prey and pounces.
The trap-door spider lives in a tunnel. The spider, common in the southwestern United States, lines the tunnel with silk and fashions a door made of silk and dirt. It peeks out of the slightly open door and grabs passing insects.
The tarantula is a large, hairy spider found mainly in warm regions, including the southwestern United States. Although the tarantula's bite is painful, it is not very poisonous to humans. Tarantulas hunt insects, lizards, mice, toads, and frogs.
E. B. White's famous spider Charlotte was an orb weaver. The orb-weaving spider spins a wheel-shaped web. When an insect flies into the web, the spider races toward its meal.

61,"Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, homeland security has become an important issue for many people.
This week Grade 4 looks at where the two major candidates for president stand on
. Both candidates recognize that the world has changed since the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Each candidate has his own plan to make the United States more secure and keep its citizens safe.
President Bush's antiterrorism program has included removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and restoring freedom to the country. He has also worked to stop terrorist groups in Afghanistan.
In October 2001, shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush signed the Patriot Act. The law gives the government more power to investigate suspected terrorists. President Bush believes that the law should be renewed when it comes up for review in 2005.
Bush also created the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 to keep our airports, borders, and ports safe from attacks. He says that he has worked to improve national security at airports through increased screening and advanced equipment.
Senator Kerry promises to continue to track and stop potential terrorists. He voted for both the Patriot Act and the Department of Homeland Security.
Kerry supports the Patriot Act's renewal in 2005 if some changes are made to it. He argues that certain sections of the Patriot Act violate citizens' rights. Some of those parts include allowing the government to wiretap phone conversations and search business and library records.
If elected, Kerry has a plan to protect the country's borders, ports, and airports. He also says that he will work to give police officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel the information and equipment they need to perform their jobs safely and effectively.

Whoosh! Within seconds, a spark sets off large flames. The flames of a wildfire tear through a forest, destroying thousands of acres of trees and brush and threatening the homes of people and animals.
From California to Colorado and from Alaska to Arizona, firefighters have been battling thousands of wildfires this year. Wildfire season began in June and will last through November. So far, the flames have destroyed more than 3 million acres in the United Statesan area about the size of New Jersey!
The states in red show where the most wildfires have occurred this year.
Most wildfires are started naturally, either by lightning or from the sun's heat. Others are accidentally started by careless humans who leave campfires burning.
Hot, dry weather has caused most of this season's wildfires to spread. ""This year is unique,"" Rose Davis, an official at the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center, told
. Davis explained that the Northwest is suffering a
. A drought is a long period of dry weather with little rain. In the Southwest, heavy rains in the spring caused a lot of new grass to grow. The new grass burns quickly when it dries out.
Firefighters have been fighting the scorching flames from the ground and the air. Specially trained firefighters called
parachute from planes or helicopters to reach
fires. Because smoke jumpers leap into out-of-the-way areas, they carry enough food and water with them to survive for several days.
Although wildfires can be very dangerous, they are not all bad. In areas where few people live, officials monitor the wildfires. Sometimes, officials allow them to burn because the fires help the environment and keep forests healthy. ""If fires are going to spread to people's homes and property, we have to put them out,"" smoke jumper Lori Messenger told
Wildfires are like nature's housekeeperand forests come back to life after fires. ""Fire is a natural part of our forests,"" says Messenger. ""The fires kill the less healthy, diseased trees. They clean out the brush to make space for animals to graze on the new grass that grows.""
Some plants also need heat from a fire to help them release their seeds, which grow into new plants after a fire. Fire is nature's way of recycling dead plants into the soil. The dead plants help return nutrients to the soil.
Although some animals die, many creatures have ways of protecting themselves. Large animals, such as deer, moose, and buffalo, head to safety. Small animals, such as snakes, toads, and mice, burrow in the ground.
""It's important to realize that fires are an important part of what happens in a forest,"" says Messenger. ""It's a complicated balance, and people who manage the forest have to make good decisions about what fires will be fought and what fires will be left to burn.""
What qualities do you think a person needs to be a smoke jumper?
A fire requires three ingredients to burnheat, fuel, and oxygen. The combination of those three building blocks is referred to as the fire triangle.

Our classroom play celebrates Philadelphia's hometown hero. Discover how his hard work helped to improve the lives of all Americans.
Honor the 300th birthday of one of our countrys greatest thinkers, inventors, and statesmen with our classroom play.
Each morning, Benjamin Franklin asked himself, ""What good shall I do today?"" And that is how he lived his life.
His can-do attitude launched him into the history books as one of Americas most famous citizens. Ben was a printer, a writer, an inventor, a community leader, and a founder of our nation.
Ben was born in a cottage in Boston on January 17, 1706. He attended school only between the ages of 8 and 10. Bens education was cut short because his family was poor and needed him to work.
His love of learning, however, stayed with him throughout his life. Ben read all the time. He often went without food to buy books! At 12, he began his lifelong love of printing.
In honor of the 300th anniversary of Bens birth, our three-act play looks at some key events in the life of this great American. Find out how his good deeds helped shape the history of our country.
ACT 1: Ben the Young Man, Boston, 1718-1723
Bens older brother, James, owns a printing press that publishes a very popular newspaper,
In 1718, Bens father decides that 12-year-old Ben should work for James.
At that time, Ben signs a document promising he will work for his brother until he is 21, without pay. In return, his brother is to provide Ben with food and clothes.
Ben likes to read and is a good editor and proofreader. Over the next few years, he learns all about printingand even begins writing letters to the newspaper under a different name. Thanks to Bens sense of humor and clever writing in those letters,
becomes one of the most-read newspapers in Boston.
James finds out that the letters are from his brother and he becomes jealous of Ben. James is furious and vows never to publish any of Bens writing again. He also finds fault with Bens work, even though Ben rarely makes errors.
I know I am a better printer than he is.
You cant leave! You have to work for me until you are 21!
Youll never find a job in this city! Youll come crawling back to me.
But Ben never comes back to his brother. Instead, he leaves in the early morning and runs away to New York City, in hopes of finding work as a printer. After not finding a job there, he heads to New Jersey where he boards a boat to Philadelphia.
The journey is three days long, and Ben is dirty, hungry, and penniless. But Philadelphia is a lively city, and Ben loves it.
ACT 2: Ben the Community Leader, Philadelphia, 1723-1740s
After arriving in Philadelphia, Ben works to establish himself as a printer. In 1728, he opens a printing shop and begins publishing his own newspaper,
A few years later, he also publishes
The book includes weather forecasts, recipes, and jokes. It also contains some of Bens sayings, such as ""Well done is better than well said."" The almanac becomes a best seller and makes Ben wealthy.
Although Ben works to better himself,it is also important to him to help the community. He considers Philadelphia his hometown and works to make life in the city better.
Ben starts projects to pave and sweep Philadelphias streets. He redesigns the citys streetlights so that roads are safe at night.
Ben also helps set up the first public library, hospital, and volunteer fire department. At this time, most houses in Philadelphia are made of wood and stand side by side. When a fire breaks out, it can destroy an entire neighborhood.
Extra! Extra! Fire destroys row houses on Market Street!
We need to train men to fight fires so that this doesnt keep happening.
Ben persuades more than 30 men to form the Union Fire Company.
We nominate Ben as our fire chief.
Ben is appointed fire chief. He makes sure that firefighters are trained to put out fires and rescue people.
(dragging a leather bucket full of water)

The Union Fire Company meets once a month to discuss fire prevention. Ben also publishes fire prevention tips in his newspaper.
Bens ideas for Philadelphia help shape how fire departments, hospitals, libraries, and post offices work in other cities.
ACT 3: Ben the Statesman, Philadelphia, 1776
Along with his work in Philadelphia, Ben helps change the course of American history.
At the time, America is made up of 13 Colonies ruled by Britain. England has passed many laws that the Colonists think are unfair.
Ben works to mend the relationship between the Colonies and Britains ruler, King George III.
Despite his efforts, the Colonies decide to break away from Britain. They fight Britain in the Revolutionary War (1775-1783).
Ben is appointed to the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence. This document frees the Colonies from Britains rule.
We have to decide who should write the Declaration of Independence.
I wont. Many people disagree with my opinions.
I cant. I am not a writer.
I am unsure about independence from Britain.
You must write this very important document. Your writing style is perfect.
When Thomas Jefferson finishes his draft, he shows it to Ben.
Ive made small changes. For example, you wrote, sacred and undeniable, and I changed that phrase to make it stronger.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.
On July 4, a group of representatives from the 13 Colonies approve the Declaration of Independence and some people sign the document.
This for King George, so he can read it without his glasses.
On August 2, Ben and others also sign the document. They know they are risking everything for freedom from Britain.
Seven years later, in 1783, Ben negotiates the treaty that ends the Revolutionary War. In 1787, at age 81, he signs the U.S. Constitution.
Ben Franklin dies on April 17, 1790, at the age of 84. He is buried in Philadelphia. In honor of the 300th anniversary of his birth, people across the country will celebrate the life of this remarkable man.
If you could award a medal to Ben Franklin for one of his achievements, which accomplishment would it be? Why?

734,"Some call his journey remarkable. Others call it just plain crazy. For Christopher Swain, it was the swim of a lifetime.
Swain recently made history as the first person to swim the entire length of the Columbia River. In July 2003, the Oregon man ended a yearlong journey to raise awareness about pollution in that river. His 1,243-mile trip began in Canada and ended where the river meets the ocean-the Pacific Ocean.
Why did he do it? ""Every waterway needs a champion,"" Swain told
. ""I learned as much as I could about the river so I could see what I could do to clean it up.""
In 1805, explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were journeying west to find a passage to the Pacific Ocean. At that time, they described the Columbia River as clear, free flowing, and teeming with, or full of, salmon.
The Columbia River has changed since the days of Lewis and Clark's journey. Today, it is ravaged by
, or damage, the air, water, or land. Chemicals and waste from factories and towns contribute to water pollution. The pollution has caused a drop in the river's salmon population.
that have been built along the river mean the Columbia no longer flows freely. The dams are water barriers that provide electricity, control flooding, and carry water to farms.
The pollution in the river inspired Swain to take action. Wearing out seven wetsuits along the way and battling several colds, Swain braved water temperatures as low as 38 degrees. Followed by a boat, he swam between 5 and 25 miles a day through the polluted water.
""The Columbia River is a contaminated beauty,"" Swain told
. ""It runs through some of the most majestic landscapes on Earth.""
Despite the pollution, Swain is hopeful about the future of the river. During his journey, he spoke with nearly 13,000 people, including 8,000 schoolchildren, about keeping the river clean.
""With all the affection for the river, we have a chance to turn the [pollution problem] around,"" Swain said. ""Kids know that they want clean water.""
Earlier last year, Swain received the International Earth Day Award for protecting the Columbia River. And he hasn't finished making a splash yet! Later this year, he plans to swim in Lake Champlain, which borders Vermont and New York, the Hudson River in New York, and the Charles River in Boston.
How will Swain celebrate Earth Day on April 22? ""I will be in an East Coast waterway on Earth Day,"" he promised.
Each year, people celebrate Earth Day on April 22. They participate in community activities and care for the environment.
This year, the Earth Day theme is ""Water for Life."" Here are some ways experts say that kids can help protect water:
You can conserve water by turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth.
Organize a beach or river cleanup. Beach garbage, such as plastic rings, can get tangled around sea creatures and injure or harm them.
Make sure to put trash in its proper place-not in the water or down a drain.
What does Swain mean when he refers to the river as a ""contaminated beauty""?

Each fall, the skies between eastern Canada and the mountains of central Mexico fill with orange-and-black monarch butterflies.

or move from one place to another. Beginning in early August, the butterflies head south for the winter months.
Most monarchs travel from Canada to Mexico. Others travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north. They are the only insects to make such a long round-trip migration.
Mexican pilot Francisco Gutierrez and a crew of other pilots from Canada and the United States departed from Quebec, Canada, on August 15. The group plans to arrive in Mexico on November 2.
The crew hopes to raise awareness about the monarchs' fragile habitats. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning the forests that protect the butterflies from rain and cold.
No one has ever followed the butterflies in the air for their entire journey. Doing so can teach scientists how the winged insects deal with wind patterns and difficult weather. Gutierrez says, ""It's going to be an adventure.""

According to scientists in England, cookies pick up moisture as they cool after coming out of the oven. The moisture causes the cookies to expand and contract, which results in cracks. The cracks cause cookies to easily break when they're moved or packaged.
Bakers can use that information to adjust the temperature during the cooling process. Scientists hope the discovery will help keep cookies from crumbling during normal handling.

""Volcanoes are just like people--they're awake and active, and they go to sleep,""
. A volcanologist is a scientist who studies volcanoes.
In September, Mount St. Helens began blowing large
, or clouds of steam, thousands of feet into the air. The 8,364-foot mountain is not the only restless volcano in the country. Scientists are also paying close attention to awakened volcanoes in Alaska and Hawaii.

Volcanoes can remain quiet for years and then erupt violently, sometimes without warning. Using the latest technology, scientists hope to better
Mount St. Helens is located in Washington.
Scientists say Mount St. Helens is one of the most closely monitored volcanoes and the most active volcano in the lower 48 states. Mount St. Helens is also among 13 active volcanoes that are located in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. That range is home to several powerful volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier and Mount Hood.
Although scientists say a large eruption at Mount St. Helens is unlikely, they are cautious because of the volcano's history. Officials have sealed off a 5-mile area around the volcano.
Mount St. Helens erupted with tremendous force in May 1980, blowing more than 1,300 feet off its top and killing 57 people. The blast destroyed thousands of acres of forest and scattered ash for thousands of miles. Mount St. Helens continued to rumble until 1986 but has been quiet since that time.
How can scientists tell when a volcano will awaken from its slumber? ""We measure earthquake activity, changes in the mountain, and volcanic gases,"" said Driedger.
Although scientists can't tell exactly when or with what force a volcano will blow its top, they rely on advanced equipment to help them predict eruptions. Special devices called
are installed around volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens to detect earthquakes. Earthquakes always strike before a volcano erupts.
Volcanoes are mountains where hot, liquid rock called magma deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure can cause magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the crater at the top of the volcano and vents, or cracks, along its side. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called lava. Once lava cools, it hardens into rock.
Scientists use special global positioning instruments to measure movements on the slopes of the mountain--a clue to the buildup of
. Magma is red-hot molten rock located inside the volcano. It is called
when it pours out of the volcano.
As magma rises, volcanoes release carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Sensors on helicopters test the air for gases that signal rising magma. ""The gases are like telegrams that tell us what's going on inside the volcano,"" said Driedger.
More than 500 million people around the world live near active volcanoes. Monitoring volcanoes is a dangerous job, but scientists take precautions to stay safe.
""By watching volcanoes, we learn how they work,"" said Driedger. ""The more we know, the better prepared we can be to save property and lives.""
Besides volcanoes, what natural disasters are hard for scientists to predict? Why?

During the past three years, mobile phones have become more and more popular. Growing numbers of our students bring them to school, and parents encourage this as they can stay in touch with their children and know they are safe. However, many of our students keep their phone on during the day which can disturb lessons. A number of phone thefts have also occurred recently, both in and out of school. I would like to call a meeting to discuss this issue with staff, parents and students. I don't want to ban them, but we must agree on how they can be used sensibly and safely.
Write a speech to be given at this meeting analysing the advantages and disadvantages of allowing mobiles in school and suggest how they can be used sensibly and safely.

As a parent, I have constant battles over TV and films. My children feel they should be allowed to watch whatever they want, no matter how violent, gory or creepy. They say it's just entertainment, and that it has no effect on them. I don't agree! Many of the films are rated 18, and my oldest is 14. I'm afraid my kids will become more aggressive and uncaring towards people, or that they might end up seeing something which really disturbs them.

. A simple sentence consists of one clause that has a subject and a verb. A simple sentence puts across one simple idea.
A complex sentence is used to put across more
ideas. A complex sentence contains one main clause that can make sense on its own, and one or more minor clauses that are linked to it.
The main clause is the 'big dog barked' because it has a subject and a verb and makes sense by itself.
The minor clause is 'When I arrived'. Although it is a clause with a subject and a verb, it doesn't make sense on its own, it needs a main clause.
We can add more minor clauses to make a more complex sentence.
We can even split the main clause with a minor clause and still have a complex sentence.

You can solve simultaneous equations by adding or subtracting the two equations from each other.
Add the two equations together and you will find that the y disappears:
3x + 2x + y - y = 9 + 1
6 - 5 = 1 (which is correct)
To make the 3x's disappear we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
3x - 3x + 2y - (-y) = 8 - 5
6 - 1 = 5 (which is correct)
So the solution is x = 2, y = 1

A swimming pool at 30C is at a lower temperature than a cup of tea at 80C. But the swimming pool contains more water, so it stores more thermal energy than the cup of tea.
To boil water we must increase its temperature to 100C. It takes longer to boil a large beaker of water than a small beaker because the large beaker contains more water and needs more thermal energy to reach 100C.

Explore, imagine and entertain - Ending short-stories
The other problem some writers have is ending the story. It doesn't matter if it's a happy ending or not, but it has to make sense. There are lots of ways of ending, such as:
, where we have to wait until the final moment until we know. For instance, the spy who manages to stop the bomb two seconds before it explodes.
, where we are fairly sure about something, but in the final part everything changes. For example, we then learn that this is a fake bomb, and the real one is hidden somewhere else and will explode in five minutes.
, where the story stops, but we aren't sure what has actually happened at the end. For instance, the bomb is defused and everyone is safe. But then an army commander reports the theft of another bomb... only this time twice as powerful.
However, there are two endings to avoid:
, where a bomb will inevitably explode and as it does, the narrator wakes up - it was all a dream. Some English teachers don't mind this sort of thing, but others hate it. You have been warned.
, where the secret agent suddenly stops worrying about the bomb, retires, and goes off to play golf. This is even worse, and no-one likes it because the ending has nothing to do with the story.
Whatever kind of story you write, decide on your ending and include it in your plan.
Writing that explores, imagines or entertains depends on being creative. You need to experiment a little and not be frightened to try something new.

Ivan Pavlov (1849 to 1936) was a Russian scientist who investigated conditioning. He discovered that dogs produced extra saliva when they were offered food. This is a natural response to a stimulus - food makes a dog's mouth water. The saliva produced is needed to start digesting food and to make swallowing food easier.
Pavlov noticed that they also did this when the person who fed them came into the room, even if the person had not brought any food. Pavlov went on to ring a bell at the start of feeding time, and eventually the dogs produced extra saliva when they heard the bell, before any food was brought in.
A dog salivating when it hears a bell is not a natural response. They would not do this without being conditioned to do so. The behaviour has been learned. It's called a

On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.

Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.
For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.
By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.
You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:
Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:
In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:
To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:
Divide both sides by 2, to give:
a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7
b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7
When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers.
For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7.
7 + 5 does equal 12, so your answer is correct.

Magnets are made from magnetic materials. These are metals that can be magnetised or will be attracted to a magnet. Most materials are not magnetic, but

We say that unlike poles attract, and like poles repel.
How can you test if a piece of metal is a magnet. Seeing if it sticks to a magnet is not a good test, because unmagnetised iron, steel, cobalt and nickel objects will be attracted to either pole of a magnet.
So you can't test for what it is attracted to. But you can test what it repels:

Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts
A salt is always made when an acid is neutralised by a base. But the exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used.
The name of a salt has two parts:
the first part comes from the metal in the base used
the second part comes from the acid that was used
Where does the name potassium nitrate come from?
These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt:
How can we make copper sulfate? The first part of the name is 'copper', so we need a base containing copper. We could use copper oxide or copper carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'sulfate', so we need to use sulfuric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
copper sulfate + water + carbon dioixde
How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
sodium chloride + water + carbon dioxide
It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced.

a) The house was built in 1975. It was a typical semi-detached, but it did have quite an impressive front door. Most of the windows were double glazed and the garden was quite neat.
b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.
There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.
So you need to think about TAP (text, audience and purpose) and make a good start to your writing. You should try to 'set a context', which is like setting the scene. So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on.
a) The subject I am going to write about today is why the local park should not be closed.
b) Have you ever stopped to wonder how many hundreds of people make regular use of our Memorial Park?
a) It is unlikely that newspaper readers who enjoy all the things that our park has to offer will want it to disappear forever under tons of concrete.
b) 'Ashfield Park will be ruined,' claim protestors who held a meeting last night to organise opposition to the council's plans for a car park.
It should be clear that the ""b"" versions are better - they fit the style and show that the writer has used TAP to make their writing work. Remember - you need to make it interesting right from the start.

Diet, drugs and health - Digestion and enzymes
Our teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. Enzymes are needed so that this break-down happens quickly enough to be useful.
Take care - enzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients:
. Carbohydrase enzymes break down starch into sugars.
The saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough, the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet.
. Protease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. Digestion of proteins in the stomach is helped by

When you are infected by a microbe, it takes time for your body to start fighting the infection. It does this by making enough white blood cells with the correct antibody. During this time, you continue to feel unwell.
You begin to recover when enough antibodies have been produced. After the microbes have been killed, the amount of antibodies goes down again. But some of the white blood cells that produce the correct antibody remain in your blood.

Immunisation is a process that doctors use to make people immune from certain illnesses, even before they have been infected. It involves you receiving an injection containing a
Vaccines contain a dead or weak form of the disease-causing microbe, or some of its antigens. In response to the vaccine your immune system produces white blood cells with the correct antibody to kill the microbe, so you become immune without falling ill.
You are likely to have been immunised against several microbes, viruses and bacteria, including the ones that cause diphtheria, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, meningitis, measles, mumps and tuberculosis. Girls are also immunised against rubella.
Vaccination works against diseases caused by both bacteria and viruses.

154,"> Inform, explain and describe - Describing
When you describe, you need to give lots of detail and make the words interesting for others to read. For example, if you wanted to describe your home, you wouldn't just write lots of facts, like this:
My house was built in 1972 of red brick with a pitched concrete tiled roof. The house was extended in 2003 with a small UPVC conservatory and an adjoining patio area of approximately 8 square metres...
This gives lots of facts, but these are the types of facts that someone buying a house might need. Most people would find a description like this boring. So what should you do?
The first thing is to think about what you want to show other people. Do you want to concentrate on the roof tiles or the types of bricks used? Or do you want to tell them about the fence panel your brother broke when he was chasing you last summer?
You could also write about the time Stephanie threw a tennis ball and it got stuck in the guttering - it's still there - and when it rains really hard the gutter overflows. You might even have a gnome in the front garden, which your grandad bought - it looks stupid, but you won't move it in case you offend him.
Each of these details is far more interesting than roof tiles or measurements. So, when you are describing something, think of drawing a picture or taking a photograph. You focus on a certain point, write a paragraph about it, then move to the next point and the next.

Jamie needs to give far more explanation. He should use business terms and show he understands what fixed costs are.
They have to pay Ashley's father each month, as well as the loan from the bank. They may have other costs, like the cleaning materials they buy to run their business.
Morag started her answer quite well, mentioning both loans which, as fixed costs, have to be repaid. The cleaning materials, however, form part of the variable, rather than the fixed costs.
Costs which have to be paid, regardless of the level of output, are called fixed costs. Martin and Ashley have the fixed costs of repaying Ashley's dad 50 a month, and they probably pay bank interest on the loan. Their pay is a fixed cost. They might want to consider paying themselves piece rate, to help their business survive. The road tax and insurance on the van are fixed costs they have to pay. They have already bought the van, so this is a sunk cost, and no longer a fixed cost they have to pay.
Rani's answer would probably get a A grade. She has answered the question well, and has shown she can use business terms like fixed costs. She has thought about the pay they only receive when they have the business, and correctly counted it as a fixed cost.

Progressive Jews (which includes Jews of both liberal and reform traditions) think that this attitude is wrong and treat women equally in all respects, so they too can become rabbis (Jewish teacher) if they choose to do so.

3877,"Owen's anti-war sentiments contrast starkly with the work of other poets.
Owen makes clear to the reader that he is unconvinced by the rhetoric of previous poets who have declared the glory of dying in war. Poems such as Tennyson's
offer a final message of glory and bravery, with sacrifice for one's country a noble and desirable end. Wilfred Owen's poem
rejects 'The old Lie'. Owen experienced war, and so his poems are more closely reflective of the views of the serving soldiers.

4397,"There is no physical description of any of the characters. There is very little direct description of their feelings either, because Hemingway prefers to let us read between the lines.
The story seems to be told from Nick's viewpoint. Although it is told in the third person - both characters are referred to as 'he' and 'she' - the story remains with Nick after Marjorie has left, so we get his reaction to the break-up, but not hers.
Nick has planned to break up with Marjorie, and has discussed it with Bill beforehand - Bill asks: ""Did she go alright?"" You could see Nick as being unfair, since he has planned this and still goes on the fishing trip with her.
Nick seems to be quite aggressive at times in the story: when responding to things Marjorie says, and picking arguments.
He does not have the courage to break up with her outright - he has to pick an argument first. It is Marjorie who asks the definitive question.
Earlier in the story, is Nick trying to break the idea to Marjorie gently when he comments that the fish will not ""strike"" - in other words, they will not commit, like him?
Hemingway only directly mentions what the characters are feeling once or twice. He uses the word 'afraid' to describe Nick's feelings when he is talking to Marjorie. What do you think he is afraid of?
After Marjorie has gone, Nick seems upset. He tells Bill the break-up went fine, but is described as ""lying, his face on the blanket"". The 'lying' is
- is it about the position of his body or the truth of his words?
She seems more inclined to romance, likening the broken down mill to a 'castle'.
She also tries to draw Nick into a shared past, referring to it as 'our ruin'.
Hemingway says she ""loved fishing. She loved fishing with Nick."" The repetition seems to put emphasis on his presence being important to her. Nick says he has taught her everything about fishing. She has learned about it for his sake.
Marjorie is perceptive. She tells Nick he does not have to 'talk silly', and asks him: ""What's really the matter?""
She is very calm and collected throughout the story. She acts with dignity even when being dumped, and when he is snapping at her. When he says that love is not 'fun' anymore, she does not argue or protest. She merely leaves in dignified silence.
Bill is Nick's friend. Hemingway uses him to show what Nick is feeling, instead of telling us directly.
Bill knows that Nick is upset. When Nick tells him to 'go away', Bill moves a little way away, but remains in calling distance.
At the end, Bill's attitude to the picnic basket and fishing rods is very relaxed and casual - highlighting the tension in Nick's behaviour towards both earlier in the story.

- businesses once competing with the shop in the next town now find themselves competing on a global scale.
- with increased competition, local companies may have to reduce their work force.
- the move to e-commerce may not be a smooth one and will certainly require a degree of investment.
- if high street stores are closed in an effort to save money, customers who prefer to shop on the high street may not be comfortable buying online so may go elsewhere.
Now, both for companies and individuals, there is pressure to have Internet access to do everyday things such as submit orders or look up details in a catalogue.

Both poems look at the power the older generation have over the younger but 'We Remember' is from the older generation's point of view, Kid from that of the younger generation.
Robin in Kid has broken free from Batman and now has the upper hand; the child in the Duffy poem still feels downtrodden.

7545,"Moniza Alvi: Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan
Moniza Alvi was born in Lahore in Pakistan, the daughter of a Pakistani father and an English mother. She moved to Hatfield in England when she was a few months old. She didn't revisit Pakistan until after the publication of her first book of poems - 'The Country over my Shoulder' - from which this poem comes.
Presents from My Aunts...was one of the first poems I wrote. When I wrote this poem, I hadn't actually been back to Pakistan. The girl in the poem would be me at about 13. The clothes seem to stick to her in an uncomfortable way, a bit like a kind of false skin, and she thinks things aren't straightforward for her.
I found it was important to write the Pakistan poems because I was getting in touch with my background. And maybe there's a bit of a message behind the poems about something I went through, that I want to maybe open a few doors if possible.
Listen to the poem and watch the slideshow

I couldn't rise up out of its fire,
But it was stolen from our car.
The presents were radiant in my wardrobe.

Prickly heat had me screaming on the way.
What is 'Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan' about?
The speaker in the poem, who is of mixed race, describes the gifts of clothes and jewellery sent to her in England by her Pakistani relatives.
She is drawn to the loveliness of these things, but feels awkward wearing them. She feels more comfortable in English clothes - denim and corduroy.
She contrasts the beautiful clothes and jewellery of India with boring English 'cardigans/from Marks and Spencer'.
She tries to remember what it was like for her family to travel to England.
Her knowledge of her birthplace, which she left as a baby, comes to her only through old photographs and newspaper reports.
She tries to imagine what that world might be like.
Loose trousers and tunic, traditionally worn by Pakistani women.
The traditional dress worn by women in India and some parts of Pakistan.
Asian clothing is often decorated in lots of tiny round mirrors.
Decorative panelling, with cut-outs so you can partly see through it.

to another, in the way that the poem does, and sometimes surprise us by fixing on odd details - like the 'tin boat', perhaps (line 54).
The poem is full of associated, sometimes contrasting, images.
Here are two lists of words that describe things to do with Pakistani culture and things associated with English culture.
'The presents were radiant in my wardrobe'
Add to the lists and think about the words that the poet has chosen.
What strikes you most strongly about the way the clothes from Pakistan are described in the first
A group of lines of poetry that make up a unit - like a paragraph in a piece of prose; a verse.
Why are English things referred to in such an ordinary way?
How does the England she knows contrast to the 'fractured land throbbing through newsprint' of Pakistan?
How else does life in England differ from life in Pakistan (especially for a woman)?
Does the girl feel that all the Pakistani objects 'fit' into an English way of life?
A visual representation of something; a mental picture; a persona that is presented to the world.
in a poem tends to carry a particular significance - it's the one our imagination is left with.
The speaker imagines herself 'there' in Lahore - somewhere she has been only in her thoughts.
However, she is 'of no fixed nationality'. This sounds a slightly threatening phrase (there's a similar one - 'of no fixed abode' - which is used in law courts when the defendant is homeless). Can you link this phrase with other words earlier in the poem?
The speaker imagines herself staring 'through fretwork' at the beautiful Shalimar Gardens. Why is this such an effective image to end on?
Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. 'Attitude' can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
How do you think this poem should be read?
In a confused voice, as if the girl cannot decide whether she is more Pakistani or English?
Wistfully, as if she regrets having lost her original culture?
Gratefully, as she thinks about the beautiful, exotic gifts?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
In an interview, Moniza Alvi has said:
Growing up, I felt that my origins were invisible, because there weren't many people to identify with in Hatfield at that time of a mixed race background or indeed from any other race, so I felt there was a bit of a blank drawn over that. I think I had a fairly typically English 1950s/1960s upbringing.
When I eventually went to Pakistan, I certainly didn't feel that was home, I'd never felt so English. But I never feel entirely at home in England, and, of course, I'm not part of the Asian community at all. And it feels a bit odd sometimes that because of the group of poems that I've written about my Asian background, I sometimes tend to be identified as a black writer. I tend to think of England as being very culturally mixed now.
But it's important to know where you come from, which is perhaps what I was lacking as a child. I think it's important to know what has gone into your making, even quite far back, I think it gives you a sense perhaps of richness.
Read this question carefully. It is similar to the type of question you will be asked in the exam

What do you think the poet has to say about the past, and the way it relates to the present?
If you would prefer to concentrate on just Moniza Alvi's poem at this stage, write for 20 minutes.
In writing about John Agard's poem, you could include short paragraphs about:
The poet's personal history, and how this links with the situation described in the poem.
The imagery of Pakistan and the imagery of England.
What the poem says about the girl's thoughts and feelings.

between the two. In what ways are the poems similar - in the style of language, or in ideas? In what ways are they different?
The girl in the poem doesn't think much of the salwar kameez because it's old-fashioned. It says 'like at school, fashions changed'. She prefers denim and corduroy ('I longed for denim and corduroy'), so she can be more like her school friend, especially at weekends. When she first came to England she didn't want to, it says she was 'screaming all the way' (line 50) but now she quite likes it.

but hasn't grasped what the poem is about

The girl in the poem doesn't quite know what to think about the presents. The way she describes them makes them sound beautiful
but when she puts them on she doesn't feel right
I could never be as lovely as those clothes
She admires the way the clothes have little mirrors embroidered on them
the candidate understands that the girl is pulled both ways
doesn't quite connect to wider issues of identity
The girl in the poem doesn't quite know what to think about the presents. The way she describes them makes them sound beautiful
but also slightly dangerous, because the bangle 'drew blood', and she felt 'aflame' when she put them on. They make her feel 'alien in the sitting room', when your sitting room should be where you feel at home. The clothes remind her that she is 'half-English', which makes her feel uncomfortable. At the same time, she says the clothes are 'radiant in the wardrobe' - even though she isn't wearing them, they seem full of light and beauty compared with her other things. She is drawn to the rich colours, the same as she is drawn to her mother's jewellery and her parents' camel-skin lamp
marvel at the colours like stained glass
She realises that all this is part of her own family's past, and another side of her identity. At the end of the poem, she tries to imagine how it might have been if she'd lived in Lahore instead, and wonders would she have been more or less at home in the other half of her background?

Pollution is the addition of substances to the environment that may be harmful to living organisms. Population growth and increases in the standard of living cause more waste to be produced.

Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.

She is brought up in the Frankenstein family home, and acts as their servant.

Justine is very beautiful. This beauty angers the Monster when it finds her sleeping, as it knows it will never be allowed to love anyone so attractive. The Monster then places the locket around her neck, knowing it will lead to her being put on trial for the murder.
She is bullied into confessing by a priest. Her calmness and virtue are emphasised and contrasted with the immorality of those who should know better - like Victor, the priest and the judge.

3857,"We often use formulas without even noticing. For example, we might convert miles to km by multiplying by 1.6, or find the circumference of a circle by multiplying pi by the diameter.
km = 1.6 x miles is an example of a formula.
We have already seen that km = 1.6 x miles and C =
 d are examples of formulas. There are many others that we use regularly in other subjects. Sometimes we have to construct our own formula:
A taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00. Write down a formula for the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles.
Travelling 1 mile would cost 2 + 50p.
Travelling 2 miles would cost 2 + 2 x 50p.
Travelling 3 miles would cost 2 + 3 x 50p.
So travelling for 'n' miles will cost 2 + n x 50p.
The formula is C = 2 + (n x 50p)
A rectangle has a width of x and a length of 2x.
Write down a formula for the perimeter (P) in terms of x.
P = 2x + x + 2x + x
Did you remember to include all 4 sides?
To recap, the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles, when a taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00 is:-
C = 2 + (n x 50p)
To find the cost of the taxi for a journey of 20 miles, replace 'n' with 20.
C = 2 + (20 x 50p)
What is the cost of hiring this taxi for 16 miles?
Remember that C = 2 + (16 x 50p)
The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.
r, so we divide both sides by 2
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c
Rearrange the formula to make 'c' the subject.
[To work this out: y = mx + c, so subtract mx from both sides.]

Alan Davie: 'To a Celtic Spirit, 1'
Alan Davie is a prominent Scottish artist well known for his work in a range of mediums including drawing, painting, and screenprinting.
He was born in 1920 and graduated from the Edinburgh Royal College of Art in 1940. After serving in World War II he began teaching in Edinburgh and in 1947 became a professional jazz musician.
In 1948 he took up a travelling art scholarship from the college and travelled throughout Europe in 1948-9. In Venice he met

and reflects the artist's love of jazz music, non-western cultural symbols, ancient religious and ethnic influences.
My ideas are intuitive and most ideas come from my thoughts. The art I create is no way expressive or impressionist, it just comes from an artist drive I have to keep on creating.
The work of art seems to be something thrown off, a by-product of the process of being and working. Art just happens, like falling in love.
When I am working, I am aware of a striving, a yearning, the making of many impossible attempts at a kind of transmutation  a searching for a formula for the magical conjuring of the unknowable. Many times the end seems just within reach, only to fly to pieces before me as I reach for it.
I paint because I have nothing, or I paint because I am full of ideas ... or I paint because after I last painted, something appeared miraculously out of it.
The titles are not necessarily directly linked to the image, they are more often terms I have to use to catalogue the artwork I have created.
Inside is a place of magic; resounding, surrounding, where big hanging works in progress are constantly being transformed and re-worked, making a shifting environment of developing moods, spaces, colours, forms, poetry fragments, script, signs and symbols, laughing, singing.

412,"Comets are balls of ice and dust in orbit around the Sun. The orbits of comets are different from those of planets - they are elliptical. A comet's orbit takes it very close to the Sun and then far away again. The time to complete an orbit varies - some comets take a few years, while others take millions of years to complete an orbit.
Comets have a range of different orbital periods and all leave a trail of debris behind them
Comets are often visible from Earth when they get close to the Sun, because the Sun's heat vaporises material from their surface, and this vapour forms a tail.
Asteroids are rocky objects, smaller than planets. Most of them are found in an 'asteroid belt', in orbit around the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. The minor planet Ceres is found here, too. Asteroids can crash into each other. When they do, they may break apart and their orbit may change.
The orbits of some asteroids cross the Earth's orbit. At various times during the Earth's history, asteroids have hit the Earth. When this happened, a tremendous amount of energy was released, throwing up billions of tonnes of dust. This blocked heat and light from the Sun, making the Earth very cold.
It is thought that it was the collision of an asteroid with the Earth that helped to drive the dinosaurs to extinction. Scientists worry that an asteroid could still hit the Earth and cause a global catastrophe.

Precipitation is the term given to moisture that falls from the air to the ground. In the UK, the most common form of precipitation is rain, but snow, hail, sleet, drizzle, fog, and mist are also precipitation.
Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. Air can only hold a certain amount of water before condensation and precipitation occurs. Humidity is measured as a percentage, relative to the saturation point where the air can hold no more water vapour (ie 100 % humidity).

Climate refers to what is expected to happen in the atmosphere rather than the actual conditions. It is possible for the weather to be different from that suggested by the climate.
Climatic conditions in an area can be affected by the landscape, relief and activities taking place (both human and natural). Climate can alter over time and space.
Within a climatic region, the climate may vary from place to place - eg the top of a hill, the sunny side of a hill, the shaded side of a hill and the bottom of a hill. These areas with their small variations are called

Temperatures drop the further an area is from the equator. Due to the curvature of the earth. In areas closer to the poles, sunlight has a larger area of atmosphere to pass through and the sun is at a lower angle in the sky. As a result, more energy is lost and temperatures are cooler.
In addition, the presence of ice and snow nearer the poles causes a higher
Albedo is a measure of how much sunlight a surface reflects.
. This means that more solar energy is reflected, also contributing to the cold.
Locations at a higher altitude have colder temperatures. Temperature usually decreases by 1 C for every 100m in altitude.

keeps Britain warmer and wetter than places in continental Europe.
The prevailing wind is the most frequent wind direction a location experiences. In Britain the prevailing wind is from the southwest, which brings warm, moist air from the Atlantic Ocean. This contributes to the frequent rainfall. When prevailing winds blow over land areas, it can contribute to creating desert climates.
The British Isles have variable weather that changes from day to day between different regions and within different regions. Consequently it is very difficult to predict or forecast the weather.
Britain has four distinct seasons of fairly equal length - spring, summer, autumn and winter. In winter it is colder and wetter and the days are shorter than in summer.
Different parts of the UK experience slightly different regional climates. These can be summarised as:
- cool summers, mild winters, heavy rain all year.
- cool summers, cold winters, steady rain all year.
- warm summers, mild winters, light rain all year, especially summer.
- warm summers, mild winters, heavy rain all year, especially winter.
The variability of weather and climate in different regions of the British Isles is due to the different air masses that meet over the Isles. Each air mass brings with them different characteristics, as shown in the map below.
Prevailing winds and climate zones in the UK
are greatest along the south coast of England (average of 1750 hours of sunshine per year) and are least in mountainous areas (average less then 1000 hours).
Scotland has shorter winter days and longer summer days than the rest of the UK, because it is further north. In the north of Scotland there are four more hours of daylight in mid-summer than in London.
On average it rains one in three days in the UK. However, rainfall varies greatly from region to region. It is generally wetter in the west than the east and wetter in the highlands than the lowlands. The wettest place is Snowdonia in Wales (average annual totals exceeding 3000 mm of rain a year), followed by the Highlands of Scotland, the Lake District, the Pennines and the moors of southwest England.
Parts of the east, such as East Anglia, receive less than 700 mm a year.
In most places in the UK it will rain twice as much in winter months as in summer months. Although in central and south-eastern England, and parts of southeast Scotland, July and August are often the wettest months of the year. In London and Birmingham it will thunder on average 15 days a year, compared to less than 10 elsewhere in the UK.
Average temperatures in UK are warmer at lower

and colder at higher altitudes. Average yearly temperatures at low altitude vary from 7C in The Shetlands, in northern Scotland, to 11C on the southwest coast of England. The coldest (and highest) place is Ben Nevis - altitude: 1344m - where the average temperature is less than 0C.
The coldest months are January and February and the warmest are July and August. In summer Scotland will be about three degrees cooler than England. The average daily maximum temperature at Glasgow in July is 19C compared with 22C in London.
Scotland tends to be worse affected by severe weather than the rest of the UK. Snow is more common in highland regions than in lowland areas, so while snow might fall on the south west of England less than 10 days a year, it will fall on the peaks of the Cairngorm Mountains over 100 days a year.

Can you identify the seasons when most rain or least rain falls? Or when the highest and lowest temperatures are experienced?
Work out the temperature range by subtracting the lowest figure from the highest figure.
Add the rainfall totals for each month together to work out the total annual rainfall.

'I rise in the dawn, and I kneel and blow
Till the seed of the fire flicker and glow;
And then I must scrub and bake and sweep
Till stars are beginning to blink and peep;
And the young lie long and dream in their bed
Of the matching of ribbons for bosom and head,
And their day goes over in idleness,
And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress:
While I must work because I am old,
And the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold.'
The poem is about a hard-working, poor old woman who compares herself to the young women of the house who spend their days dreaming of love and worrying about their appearance. It is not clear whether these young women are her own children or the children of people she works for as a maid. The poem is written in the

Temperature is how hot or cold something is, for example the atmosphere or the sea. Use a thermometer to see how many degrees Celsius/centigrade it is above or below freezing point (0 degrees C) .
Precipitation is the term given to moisture that falls from the air to the ground. In the UK, the most common form of precipitation is rain, but snow, hail, sleet, drizzle, fog, and mist are also precipitation.
Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. Air can only hold a certain amount of water before condensation and precipitation occurs. Humidity is measured as a percentage, relative to the saturation point where the air can hold no more water vapour (ie 100 % humidity).
Atmospheric pressure is the weight of air resting on the Earth's surface. Pressure is shown on a weather map with lines called isobars. Low pressure occurs when air is warm and rises. High pressure occurs when air becomes colder and sinks.

Climate refers to what is expected to happen in the atmosphere rather than the actual conditions. It is possible for the weather to be different from that suggested by the climate.
Climatic conditions in an area can be affected by the landscape, relief and activities taking place (both human and natural). Climate can alter over time and space.
Within a climatic region, the climate may vary from place to place - eg the top of a hill, the sunny side of a hill, the shaded side of a hill and the bottom of a hill. These areas with their small variations are called

Adding and subtracting numbers in standard index form:
Convert them into ordinary numbers, do the calculation, then change them back if you want the answer in standard form.
Multiplying and dividing numbers in standard form:
Here you can use the rules for multiplying and dividing powers. Remember these rules:
To multiply powers you add, eg, 10
To divide powers you subtract, eg, 10
Multiply 2 by 3 and add the powers of 10:
If not, remember that you should first work out 36  6, then work subtract the powers of 10 (because it is division), like this:
