589,"Inspector Goole announces that he has come to investigate the suicide of a young working-class girl who died that afternoon. Her name was Eva Smith. After seeing a photograph of her, Birling admits that she used to be one of his employees: he discharged her when she became one of the ring-leaders of a strike asking for slightly higher wages. Birling justifies sacking her by saying he paid his workers the usual rates; he cannot see that he has any responsibility for what happened to her afterwards.

4766," in textile factories after 1785, then in distilleries, iron forges and blast furnaces, coal mines, engineering firms, waterworks.
 at first, railways used stationary steam engines to wind wagons up banks. Then in 1800, Trevithick invented the steam-powered locomotive. The first steam-powered boat was built in 1802. This had significant effects, not only on industry and agriculture and the transport of goods, but on the transport of people and their mobility and social lives (eg holidays at the seaside).
 the steam engines used coal, so industry was located on the coalfields.
 steam engines were expensive, so mainly large firms could afford them. The steam engines allowed large-scale production.
 the steam engines never flagged or stopped, so this required significant changes in the way people worked. There was now no requirement for workers to be strong or skilled and, if a person was big, it could now be a disadvantage. The steam-powered machine did all the work, so children replaced men as the key workers in industry.

7531,"Ask your teacher to check your presentation for you before you learn it, or send it in to SOS Teacher.
As you learn it, keep breaking it down into separate headings or pictures until you have gone from a page of A4 to a small piece of paper with a maximum of 5 headings.
If you are talking about different subjects, draw them and try talking around the pictures. The more picture associations you can find, the easier your presentation will be to remember on the day.
Practise your talk with another person, or record it on to a minidisc or cassette, or onto your computer, and play it back. If you haven't been through the whole thing a few times, you won't know if you can remember all the points you want to make.

7121,"The alkali metals - trends in reactivity
As you go down the group, the atomic number of the alkali metals increases, and their properties change:
You will probably see lithium, sodium and potassium at school, but rubidium and caesium are considered to be too reactive to use in the classroom. Francium is radioactive and very rare - there are only a few grams of it in the whole of the Earth's crust at any time.
Reactions of lithium, sodium and potassium with water
The hydroxides formed in all these reactions dissolve in the water to form alkaline solutions. These turn universal indicator purple - showing that the pH is more than 7.

Drawing 1: Sketching, enhancing, shapes and charts
There are a range of techniques for enhancing the appearance of a drawing, making it look more like the real object. The technique used will depend on the type of drawing and what you are trying to show.
For this technique, thin lines are used in between adjoining surfaces. Thick lines are suitable when only one side can be seen. The drawing illustrates the idea.
of the same colour. A lighter tone is called a tint and is made by adding white to the base colour. A darker tone is called a shade and is made by adding black to the base colour.
Tone can also be shown by using patterns of lines, dots, shading, reflections and highlights. It is also possible to obtain sheets of dry transfer material to represent different tones.
There are a number of ways of showing on paper the texture of materials used to make a product. These are intended to give an impression of the material, rather than represent it exactly. Some examples include drawing the grain on pieces of wood or drawing lines at angles to show reflected light on clear glass or plastics. Textures can be represented in shades of grey or colour.
Colour is an important part of graphic design. You need to know the following facts about colour.
are made by mixing the primary colours as follows: red + yellow = orange; red + blue = violet; blue + yellow = green.
Mixing primary and secondary colours together creates tertiary colours. These are dark browns, greens and greys.
The colour wheel illustrates how the colours relate to each other.
The colours next to each other harmonise (go together). Use harmonising colours to make elements of a design look related to each other.
Colours that are on opposite sides of the wheel contrast with each other (they are 'complementary' colours). Use contrasting colours to make elements of a design stand out from each other.
Yellow, orange and red are 'warm' colours; green and blue are 'cold'. Warm colours appear to come towards you from the page, while cold colours appear to recede.

2044,"Giant covalent structures contain a lot of non-metal atoms, each joined to adjacent atoms by
A covalent bond between atoms forms when atoms share electrons to achieve a full outer shell of electrons.
. The atoms are usually arranged into giant regular
A lattice is a regular grid-like arrangement of atoms in a material.
- extremely strong structures because of the many bonds involved. The graphic shows the molecular structure of diamond and graphite: two
Allotropes are structurally different forms of an element. They differ in the way the atoms bond with each other and arrange themselves into a structure. Because of their different structures, allotropes have different physical and chemical properties.
of carbon, and of silica (silicon dioxide).
From left to right - graphite, diamond, silica
- Substances with giant covalent structures have very high melting points, because a lot of strong covalent bonds must be broken. Graphite, for example, has a melting point of more than 3,600C.
To allow electricity, heat or other energy forms to pass through.
Sub-atomic particles, with a negative charge and a negligible mass relative to protons and neutrons.
, so it does conduct electricity. Silicon is semi-conductive - that is, midway between non-conductive and conductive.
Graphite is a form of carbon in which the carbon atoms form layers. These layers can slide over each other, so graphite is much softer than diamond. It is used in pencils, and as a
A substance used to reduce the friction between two solid surfaces.
. Each carbon atom in a layer is joined to only three other carbon atoms. Graphite conducts electricity.
Diamond is a form of carbon in which each carbon atom is joined to four other carbon atoms, forming a giant covalent structure. As a result, diamond is very hard and has a high melting point. It does not conduct electricity.
Silica, which is found in sand, has a similar structure to diamond. It is also hard and has a high melting point, but contains silicon and oxygen atoms, instead of carbon atoms.
The fact that it is a semi-conductor makes it immensely useful in the electronics industry: most transistors are made of silica.
Structure of a buckminsterfullerene molecule - a large ball of 60 atoms
Buckminsterfullerene is yet another allotrope of carbon. It is actually not a giant covalent structure, but a giant molecule in which the carbon atoms form pentagons and hexagons - in a similar way to a leather football. It is used in lubricants.

have been removed from farmland to allow machinery to be used more easily and farm the land more intensively. Hedgerows help to hold the soil together and act as valuable windbreaks.
If the topsoil (the most productive layer of the soil) is removed, then crop yields can decline.
Loss of biodiversity (a diverse range of wildlife) in rivers  fish species find it difficult to breed because they lay their eggs in the gravel at the bottom of rivers and deposition of sediment smothers the gravel. Eggs that are smothered in sediment do not receive sufficient oxygen to survive.
Roads and footpaths can become slippery, causing a hazard to walkers, motorists and cyclists.
Drains can become blocked with eroded soil causing localised flooding.
Sediment can find its way into water storage reservoirs, reducing storage capacity for water supplies and increasing flood risks.
Phosphates (chemicals from fertilisers) in the soil can cause excessive algal growth in rivers, lakes and reservoirs. If the sediment finds its way to an estuary or is dredged and dumped out at sea it can also cause algal growth in marine water. Algal growth causes damage to ecosystems and can be toxic.
Water quality can be reduced - it may require treatment before it becomes fit for human consumption.
The navigability of water courses can be reduced because of deposition of sediment.
Soil erosion is also a problem in
A Less Economically Developed Country [LEDC] has low levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the southern hemisphere (eg countries in southern Africa, southern Asia and South America) are LEDCs, while more of the countries in the northern hemisphere are More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs].
The soil is exposed and vulnerable to erosion as a result of the removal of vegetation and overgrazing.
Trees, which provide protection from the wind and rain, are removed to be used as
Nomadic tribes have become more sedentary, which puts pressure on the land where they settle.
When soil is blown away the land becomes useless for grazing and crops and causes
. This is a problem in the Sahel region of Africa.
Salinisation occurs when the water in soils

to many plants and make the land unusable. This has consequences such as low yields, poor profits and even starvation.

4317,"Nylon has some desirable properties. It does not let ultraviolet light pass through it, and it is:
Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.
Gore-Tex has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.
Teflon is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.

453,"The Chartist movement was a curious mix of both classes and ideas. This meant that the two very different Chartist movements, Moral and Physical, also had very different ideas about what tactics would be effective in getting the vote for all men. This Revision Bite will discuss the three main tactics used by Chartists - meetings, petitions and riots.
Chartists met on a national and local level where leaders gave speeches, recruited new members and collected funds. Some meetings were violent and others were peaceful. Many Chartist groups bought their own buildings to use for meetings called
during periods of high unemployment and poverty. They were an attempt to convince Parliament to accept the People's Charter.
There were three petitions presented by Chartists to Parliament in 1839, 1842 and 1848. The first two were rejected and led to violence such as the
. The third one was rejected mainly because it contained many false names and Lovett resigned in disgust when it failed.
Physical Force Chartists believed that violent protests would help them to get the vote. There were a number of violent protests between 1839 and 1848. These included the
. Fighting also took place in Sheffield, Bradford and Dewsbury. It was the violent protests that led to many middle-class people withdrawing their support for Chartism.
In November 1839, 5,000 miners and ironworkers marched on the town of Newport in South Wales. They were led by John Frost - the ex-mayor of Newport. They decided to take over the town of Newport and release the Chartists imprisoned there, including Henry Vincent. The Chartists marched on the Westgate Hotel. The magistrates were warned and soldiers fired into the crowd. Up to 20 people were killed.

What does Source B suggest about the Newport Rising?
See the next page for the answer and in depth source analysis.
When answering a source based question, it is important to pick apart the source and study every detail to see what it suggests.
For Source B, you must be able to identify which people in the source are the Chartists and which ones are the government. You must also ask questions:
These are the Chartists  most of them are carrying pikes but at least one of them has a gun.
These figures are the government  you can tell this by the top hats that they are wearing. They are holding guns.
Source B suggest that the Chartists and government fought in Newport outside the Westgate Hotel. The Chartists look fierce and organised, while the government men appear to cower in front of the hotel. There is a lot of smoke between the two groups which suggests a lot of gunfire and violence.
When referring to sources in your examination answers, never use the phrase ""Source B tells us"". A source never tells you something, it suggests information. Instead use phrases such as:
As part of your revision for the Chartist section, you need to be aware of which tactic the two very different Chartist movements supported. Think about the
it was necessary for Chartists to meet regularly.

707,"Line graphs, frequency polygons and stem and leaf diagrams
For the exam, you will need to know how to draw and interpret statistical diagrams including two way tables, line graphs, frequency polygons and stem and leaf diagrams.
Below is an example of a two-way table showing the number of boys and girls in a 6th form college:
We can find out lots of information from this table, for example:
There are 260 girls in the college (120 + 140)
of the boys are in U6 (100 out of 240)
48% of the pupils are boys (
If a girl is chosen at random, the probability that she is in class L6 is
(there are 260 girls, and 120 of them are in L6, so
If a boy is chosen at random, what is the probability that he is in U6?
There are 260 pupils in L6 (140 boys and 120 girls)
Line graphs are made by joining up points plotted on a graph.
This table shows a country's grape production (in thousands ['000s] of tonnes) for the years 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980 and 1990.
This data can be represented in the form of a line graph as shown below.
Frequency polygons can be used to represent grouped data.
Fifty bags of sweets were opened. The number of sweets in each bag is recorded in the table below:
Represent this information in the form of a frequency polygon.
The frequency polygon is plotted at the
A maths test is marked out of 50. The marks for the class are shown below:
This data can be more easily interpreted if we represent it in a
This stem and leaf diagram shows the data above:
The stem and leaf diagram is formed by splitting the numbers into two parts - in this case, tens and units.
The tens form the stem and the units form the leaves.
This information is given to us in the
It is usual for the numbers to be ordered. So, for example, the row
shows the numbers 21, 23, 24, 24, 25 and 27 in order.
From the stem and leaf diagram how many children scored more than 40?
6 people had a score of more than 40
To find this look down the ""stem"" to the the column labelled 4, and don't forget to include the child who scored 50!
As well as providing valuable evidence to support your finding, statistics can be misleading. They are often used to prove a point, and can easily be twisted in favour of that point.
Here are some examples of misleading graphs.
What is wrong with this bar chart? How should the information be represented?
From this graph, it looks as though house prices have trebled in one year! It is misleading because the vertical axis does not start at 0. Look at the 'improved' version of the same graph. This gives a much more accurate picture of what has happened.
Although the vertical scale starts at 0, it does not go up in even steps. This distorts the graph, and makes it look as though the biggest jump is between 1 and 2, rather than 3 and 4.
Also, there are no labels on the axes, so we have no idea what this graph represents!
What is wrong with this 3D bar chart?
This 3D bar chart might look very attractive, but it is also very misleading. There is no scale on the vertical axis and, because of the perspective, it looks as though sales for 1995 were far greater than those for any other year. In fact, they were identical to those in 1997.
The data would be better represented on a 2D-bar chart, with appropriate labelling on each axis:
What is wrong with this pictogram showing the number of people who own different types of pets?
On this pictogram, there is no category for people who do not own a pet. The pictures are different sizes, and it appears that more people own a horse than any other animal.
An improvement would be to redraw the pictogram, with each of the animals the same size and aligned with one another like this:

5417,"AO3 is all about experimenting - but you can't start on that until you've found a theme that inspires you. This Revision Bite should help you find subjects you can really go to town on.
You can get lots of ideas by making a spidergram, mindmap or flowchart. Don't stop until there's nothing left to write, however strange the connections you make!
Write the theme your teacher has given you in the middle of a piece of paper. Then just see what that theme makes you think about. Whatever it is, write it down, and then see what that makes you think about next. Just let each idea connect in some way with the next. Let your ideas flow. Don't worry that they might seem silly.
Have a look at Shreya and Kathy's spidergrams below for examples of the start of a spidergram - click on them to see a bigger version. (If you have Flash, click Magnify to see the detail - to remove the viewfinder just click Magnify again.)
Kathy's spidergram on the theme of food and drink
Go to the next page to follow on.
Now circle the best bits on the spidergram. Use these points as new headings, and try to make more spidergrams. Look below to see how Shreya has chosen to explore the idea of celebrations further.
If you'd been her, what would you have explored further?
Shreya's spider diagram developing the theme of Indian celebrations
- so put them in your work journal.
Now you've lots of ideas buzzing around, you can also write some notes in your work journal. Go to the next page to see how another student has done this.

4254,"The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.
r, so we divide both sides by 2
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c
Rearrange the formula to make 'c' the subject.
[To work this out: y = mx + c, so subtract mx from both sides.]
See if you can do it better than Einstein!

6710,"The elements in group 7 are called the halogens. They belong to the column second from right in the periodic table. The halogens are all toxic, but this is a useful property. Chlorine is used to sterilise drinking water and water in swimming pools. Iodine is used in antiseptics to treat wounds.
The halogens have the following properties in common:
they have low melting and boiling points
they are poor conductors of heat and electricity

7545,"Moniza Alvi: Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan
Moniza Alvi was born in Lahore in Pakistan, the daughter of a Pakistani father and an English mother. She moved to Hatfield in England when she was a few months old. She didn't revisit Pakistan until after the publication of her first book of poems - 'The Country over my Shoulder' - from which this poem comes.
Presents from My Aunts...was one of the first poems I wrote. When I wrote this poem, I hadn't actually been back to Pakistan. The girl in the poem would be me at about 13. The clothes seem to stick to her in an uncomfortable way, a bit like a kind of false skin, and she thinks things aren't straightforward for her.
I found it was important to write the Pakistan poems because I was getting in touch with my background. And maybe there's a bit of a message behind the poems about something I went through, that I want to maybe open a few doors if possible.

What is 'Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan' about?
The speaker in the poem, who is of mixed race, describes the gifts of clothes and jewellery sent to her in England by her Pakistani relatives.
She is drawn to the loveliness of these things, but feels awkward wearing them. She feels more comfortable in English clothes - denim and corduroy.
She contrasts the beautiful clothes and jewellery of India with boring English 'cardigans/from Marks and Spencer'.
She tries to remember what it was like for her family to travel to England.
Her knowledge of her birthplace, which she left as a baby, comes to her only through old photographs and newspaper reports.
She tries to imagine what that world might be like.
Loose trousers and tunic, traditionally worn by Pakistani women.
The traditional dress worn by women in India and some parts of Pakistan.
Asian clothing is often decorated in lots of tiny round mirrors.
Decorative panelling, with cut-outs so you can partly see through it.

to another, in the way that the poem does, and sometimes surprise us by fixing on odd details - like the 'tin boat', perhaps (line 54).
The poem is full of associated, sometimes contrasting, images.
Here are two lists of words that describe things to do with Pakistani culture and things associated with English culture.
'The presents were radiant in my wardrobe'
Add to the lists and think about the words that the poet has chosen.
What strikes you most strongly about the way the clothes from Pakistan are described in the first
A group of lines of poetry that make up a unit - like a paragraph in a piece of prose; a verse.
Why are English things referred to in such an ordinary way?
How does the England she knows contrast to the 'fractured land throbbing through newsprint' of Pakistan?
How else does life in England differ from life in Pakistan (especially for a woman)?
Does the girl feel that all the Pakistani objects 'fit' into an English way of life?
A visual representation of something; a mental picture; a persona that is presented to the world.
in a poem tends to carry a particular significance - it's the one our imagination is left with.
The speaker imagines herself 'there' in Lahore - somewhere she has been only in her thoughts.
However, she is 'of no fixed nationality'. This sounds a slightly threatening phrase (there's a similar one - 'of no fixed abode' - which is used in law courts when the defendant is homeless). Can you link this phrase with other words earlier in the poem?
The speaker imagines herself staring 'through fretwork' at the beautiful Shalimar Gardens. Why is this such an effective image to end on?
Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. 'Attitude' can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
How do you think this poem should be read?
In a confused voice, as if the girl cannot decide whether she is more Pakistani or English?
Wistfully, as if she regrets having lost her original culture?
Gratefully, as she thinks about the beautiful, exotic gifts?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
In an interview, Moniza Alvi has said:
Growing up, I felt that my origins were invisible, because there weren't many people to identify with in Hatfield at that time of a mixed race background or indeed from any other race, so I felt there was a bit of a blank drawn over that. I think I had a fairly typically English 1950s/1960s upbringing.
When I eventually went to Pakistan, I certainly didn't feel that was home, I'd never felt so English. But I never feel entirely at home in England, and, of course, I'm not part of the Asian community at all. And it feels a bit odd sometimes that because of the group of poems that I've written about my Asian background, I sometimes tend to be identified as a black writer. I tend to think of England as being very culturally mixed now.
But it's important to know where you come from, which is perhaps what I was lacking as a child. I think it's important to know what has gone into your making, even quite far back, I think it gives you a sense perhaps of richness.
Read this question carefully. It is similar to the type of question you will be asked in the exam
Choose two poems which deal in some way with the experience of migration, and show how this is explored in the imagery of the poems.
If you are ready to practise writing a full answer, you should spend 40 minutes on this, and write about two poems. In the exam itself, you will only have
Refer to anything you know about the
of the poem which helps you to understand the poems.
the poem is written, referring to particular words and phrases.
What do you think the poet has to say about the past, and the way it relates to the present?
If you would prefer to concentrate on just Moniza Alvi's poem at this stage, write for 20 minutes.
In writing about John Agard's poem, you could include short paragraphs about:
The poet's personal history, and how this links with the situation described in the poem.
The imagery of Pakistan and the imagery of England.
What the poem says about the girl's thoughts and feelings.
If you want to practise writing a full answer, you could also write about the poem by Sujata Bhatt, Grace Nichols, Fiona Farrell or Edward Kamau Brathwaite.
When writing about two poems, you should try to end by making a
between the two. In what ways are the poems similar - in the style of language, or in ideas? In what ways are they different?
The girl in the poem doesn't think much of the salwar kameez because it's old-fashioned. It says 'like at school, fashions changed'. She prefers denim and corduroy ('I longed for denim and corduroy'), so she can be more like her school friend, especially at weekends. When she first came to England she didn't want to, it says she was 'screaming all the way' (line 50) but now she quite likes it.
refers to details in the poem, which is important
but hasn't grasped what the poem is about
uses quotations, but takes the words out of context
The girl in the poem doesn't quite know what to think about the presents. The way she describes them makes them sound beautiful
but when she puts them on she doesn't feel right
I could never be as lovely as those clothes
She admires the way the clothes have little mirrors embroidered on them
the candidate understands that the girl is pulled both ways
doesn't quite connect to wider issues of identity
The girl in the poem doesn't quite know what to think about the presents. The way she describes them makes them sound beautiful
but also slightly dangerous, because the bangle 'drew blood', and she felt 'aflame' when she put them on. They make her feel 'alien in the sitting room', when your sitting room should be where you feel at home. The clothes remind her that she is 'half-English', which makes her feel uncomfortable. At the same time, she says the clothes are 'radiant in the wardrobe' - even though she isn't wearing them, they seem full of light and beauty compared with her other things. She is drawn to the rich colours, the same as she is drawn to her mother's jewellery and her parents' camel-skin lamp
marvel at the colours like stained glass
She realises that all this is part of her own family's past, and another side of her identity. At the end of the poem, she tries to imagine how it might have been if she'd lived in Lahore instead, and wonders would she have been more or less at home in the other half of her background?
develops the ideas more fully than the other two candidates
connects the clothes to broader feelings about identity

Je viens de lire l'article ""Visiter l'Angleterre? Non, merci!"" dans votre journal. Quelle injustice!
A mon avis les Anglais sont trs travailleurs. Mon pre travaille six jours par semaine, neuf heures par jour. Hier je suis all au collge aprs avoir distribu des journaux pour gagner de l'argent. Je pense que les Anglais travaillent trop!
Mes grands-parents disent que quand ils taient jeunes, la cuisine anglaise tait mauvaise: mais maintenant on mange bien. Prs de chez moi il y a des restaurants chinois, italiens, indiens et franais, et ils sont tous excellents. Chez nous, mon pre fait un grand effort pour aider aux repas. Samedi dernier, par exemple, il a prpar des ptes avec une sauce dlicieuse.
En ce qui concerne le temps, je suis d'accord qu'il fait plus beau en France. Je n'aime pas notre hiver parce qu'il fait froid et gris. Par contre, il fait souvent chaud en t. L'anne dernire, par exemple, il a fait un temps superbe jusqu'au mois d'octobre.

6315,"You will usually be able to choose your own presentation topic, from a list provided by your teacher. It is important to pick a topic that allows you to show off your best level of language.
In this section - Personal and Social Life - it is tempting to choose to talk about your family, as it is a topic you know well, but simple descriptions of your family won't score you the highest marks.
You can afford to be ambitious in your choice of topic, as you can prepare your presentation in advance. So in this unit we are looking at the topic 'Special Occasions', which allows you to show off a high level of language, and knowledge about other cultures.
Many of the names of festivals such as 'Diwali' and 'Eid' are known by the same names in both English- and German-speaking countries.
Here are some example questions you should learn the answers to. See if you can finish off the sentences.
1 - What festivals and holidays do you celebrate in your family?
2 - Which festival is your favourite?
7 - What do you send and receive?
10 - What did you do last year?
11 - What will you do next year?
12 - What do you know about special occasions in German-speaking countries?

6039,"There is no single way to calculate the level of development because of the variety of economies, cultures and peoples. Geographers use a series of
to compare the development of one region against another. For example:
Do the population have access to medical care? What level of healthcare is available - basic or advanced? Is it free?
A Less Economically Developed Country [LEDC] has low levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the southern hemisphere (eg countries in southern Africa, southern Asia and South America) are LEDCs, while more of the countries in the northern hemisphere are More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs].
focus on primary industries, such as farming, fishing and mining.
A More Economically Developed Country [MEDC] has high levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the northern hemisphere are MEDCs, eg UK, USA, Canada, Europe. More of the countries in the southern hemisphere are Less Economically Developed Countries [LEDCs].
focus on secondary industries, such as manufacturing. The most advanced countries tend to focus more on tertiary or service industries, such as banking and information technology.
Do the population have access to education? Is it free? What level of education is available (ie primary, secondary or further/higher education)?
MEDCs are countries which have a high
Standard of living of a person or a population is usually measured in economic terms, ie how much wealth they have. It also takes into account what there is to spend more on, ie the goods and services that are available for purchase. Life expectancy, literacy rate and other indicators may also be taken into account, when determining standard of living.
Gross Domestic Product [GDP] measures the wealth or income of a country. It is the total value of goods and services produced by a country in a year.
. LEDCs are countries with a low standard of living and a much lower GDP.
The map shows the locations of LEDCs and MEDCs. Most of the southern hemisphere is less developed, while countries in the northern hemisphere are more developed.

4832,"Guarding against hazards: food workers in a prawn processing plant
Safety is vitally important in the food industry, for obvious reasons. As in any other type of production, the most important part of safety-consciousness is identifying and monitoring potential
anything likely to cause harm and/or damage
) and taking steps to avoid them. There are three main types of hazard in food production:
is where foods become dangerously infected by bacteria. This might lead to food poisoning, such as salmonella.
occurs where foreign bodies, such as nuts and screws from factory machinery, personal jewellery and fingernails, fall into the food.
is where potentially dangerous fluids or pesticides have found their way into food.
Control of Substance Hazardous to Health (COSHH)
regulations help to protect workers in the food and other industry from hazardous substances such as cleaning fluids and pesticides. It encourages employers to put safety procedures in place to prevent accidents.
is a set of procedures used by caterers to ensure food is always safe to eat. This is based on
Critical control points (CCPs) are pre-determined checks which take place at specified points in the food production or preparation process. They must be carefully documented, with details of the checks themselves, the processes being checked, any faults and remedial action taken. Some of these checks will be done by hand - others may be computerised under CAM. They will include checking:
speeds at which machines and conveyor belts move
scanning for impurities, such as metal, and other potential hazards

6210,"Evidence for the Big Bang - higher
There are two key pieces of evidence for Big Bang theory. Theses are
You may have noticed that when an ambulance or police car goes past, its siren is high-pitched as it comes towards you, then becomes low-pitched as it goes away. This effect, where there is a change in frequency and wavelength, is called the Doppler effect. It happens with any wave source that moves relative to an observer.
This happens with light too. Our sun contains helium. We know this because there are black lines in the spectrum of the light from the sun, where helium has absorbed light. These lines form the absorption spectrum for helium.
When we look at the spectrum of a distant star, the absorption spectrum is there, but the pattern of lines has moved towards the red end of the spectrum, as you can see below.
This is called red shift. It is a change in frequency of the position of the lines.
Astronomers have found that the further from us a star is the more its light is red shifted. This tells us that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and that the further a galaxy is the faster it is moving away. Since we cannot assume that we have a special place in the universe this is evidence for a generally expanding universe. It suggests that everything is moving away from everything else. The Big Bang theory says that this expansion started billions of years ago with an explosion.
Scientists discovered that there are microwaves coming from every direction in space. Big Bang theory says this is energy created at the beginning of the universe, just after the Big Bang, and that has been travelling through space ever since.
A satellite called COBE has mapped the background microwave radiation of the universe as we see it. Big Bang theorists are still working on the interpretation of this evidence.
A summary of some of the evidence of the Big Bang and its interpretation
The light from other galaxies is red-shifted.
The other galaxies are moving away from us.
The further away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.
The most likely explanation is that the whole universe is expanding. This supports the theory that the start of the universe could have been from a single explosion.
The relatively uniform background radiation is the remains of energy created just after the Big Bang.

1074,"Why does Mr Rochester marry Bertha Mason? In part, it is because he believes he is marrying an attractive woman. In part, it is to oblige his family by making a good marriage financially speaking. And in part it is because his father and brother, and Bertha's relatives, kept the madness in her family from him. While Rochester blames himself for falling for Bertha's superficial charm, he cannot forgive the betrayal of the deception. Even after his brother and father die, he is still trapped by the situation.
It is clear that he tries to hide from the reality of it, but when he meets Jane he sees her as extraordinarily different and refreshing. He falls deeply in love, but does not have the courage to tell her. He admits, after Mason has stopped the wedding, that he wanted to have her ""safe"" first, knowing her moral stance as he does. The fact that he was prepared to deceive her, even after his own experience, might suggest he needs a period of
before the happy ending. What is never in any doubt is how much he loves Jane:
""Oh, Jane! my hope - my love - my life!"" (Chapter 27.)

2249,"A mountain of household and industrial rubbish
Pollution is the addition of substances to the environment that may be harmful to living organisms. Population growth and increases in the standard of living cause more waste to be produced. If this waste is not handled correctly, it leads to pollution. The most obvious form of pollution is often simply just litter on the ground, but pollution can affect the air and water too.
Most rubbish is buried in landfill sites and not all of it comprises safe materials. Even
common household items can contain toxic chemicals
such as poisonous metals. Many smoke alarms contain radioactive americium.
Industrial waste is also discharged onto the land
chemicals used to kill insects, weeds and micro-organisms that might damage crops
to improve their crops, but these can damage living things. Toxic chemicals can be washed from the land into rivers, lakes and seas.
Spilled crude oil causes a lot of harm to the environment, both sea and land
Water pollution is caused by the discharge of harmful substances into rivers, lakes and seas.
animals cannot survive in polluted water, so their presence or absence indicates the extent to which a body of water is polluted.
Some common water pollutants and their effect
kills aquatic organisms and harms human health

1263,"Despite some MEDCs having food surpluses and problems such as obesity, many people in LEDCs suffer from malnutrition and starvation. This could be a result of factors such as drought, debt or conflict, eg in the Darfur region of Sudan.
This is an example of 'sustainable agriculture'. It benefits small farmers and enables them to use their land efficiently. The projects use cheap, appropriate technology to increase yields in ways that make farmers more independent and conserve their natural resources.
Farmers in 50 developing countries have adopted sustainable techniques and some have experienced increased yields. By combining science with traditional knowledge, sustainable agriculture could meet the long-term food needs of developing countries without damaging the environment.
Genetically modified (GM) foods, for example, could change food production methods. They allow more food to be produced in a smaller area using fewer resources. Some people are against GM crops and question whether it will reduce hunger in LEDCs and are concerned about the impact on the environment.
In the 1960s high-yielding varieties of crops were used to increase food production - this became known as 'The Gene Revolution'. In the Gene Revolution, genes from one plant were copied and inserted into another to give it new characteristics. This allowed foods to be developed to suit specific environments and food demands.

165,"LEDCs face difficulties as they try to improve the conditions of their citizens. Many solutions have been proposed, with varying degrees of success, but poverty is still a daily reality for millions of people.
Factors that affect the economic gap between MEDCs and LEDCs.
such as the regime in power, relationships with other countries and old colonial ties will influence trading links. The current political regime in Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe is a major factor contributing to the low level of development.
such as susceptibility to floods, drought and other hazards can influence development. Frequent drought in the Sahel region of Africa is a huge obstacle in the way of development.
such as wealth generated through industry, agriculture or the availability of natural resources influences development. The UK is one of the world's most developed nations because these factors allowed it to industrialise during the Industrial Revolution.
 many LEDCs are in debt to MEDCs, which means they have to prioritise paying these off with interest before investing in development.

581,"Huntingtons disorder is caused by a dominant
, written as H. The symptoms usually develop in middle age, and include problems with controlling your muscles and forgetfulness.
You only need to inherit one copy of the faulty allele to have Huntingtons disorder, unlike cystic fibrosis, where you need to inherit both copies. You can inherit Huntingtons disorder if one or both of your parents carry the faulty allele, because it is a
an allele that always expresses itself whether it is partnered by a recessive allele or by another like itself
You can show inheritance of the disorder using genetic diagrams.
In this example, one parent, the mother, carries one copy of the Huntingtons allele. She has the disorder. The father does not carry the Huntingtons allele, so he does not have the disorder.

5532,"This Revision Bite will help you understand why branding and packaging is an important part of marketing.
The basic function of packaging has always been to protect and contain a product. In a competitive market, branding and packaging are important and have become an integral part of the product. We instantly recognise products by the size, shape and colour of packaging.
The marketing department give a product a unique look and decide on the package design. This will incorporate the
and will differentiate the product from competitors.This is known as a
The unique thing about the product that makes consumers buy it. This can be branding, packaging or a feature of the product.
The shape, size and colour are important factors when packaging a product. The marketing department will want to make the packaging attractive and distinctive. Coke's packaging is dominated by red. This helps consumers to recognise a product instantly, when they are in a shop. The same applies to the shape of the packaging. Deodorants and shampoos, for example, come in all shapes and sizes. Remember that the actual product is inside the container, so the packaging and advertising are all that will attract us to try a product in the first place.
Large manufacturers understand the importance of their brand name. Kellogg's, Adidas and Microsoft are all household names which we associate with quality. As a result, we are likely to buy one of their products when we go shopping rather than an untried or unknown one even if it is say, a supermarket's
A company, say a supermarket, produces its own brand of a well known product eg Cola.
. This is why it is important for their brand name or a striking

Giving the product a unique selling point.
is to give a product a distinctive image which will differentiate it from similar products. An expensive perfume or aftershave might be sold in an elegantly designed bottle. This sort of packaging suggests quality and would be targeted at a person with taste. Even if the product itself was not very good, the packaging alone could give the impression that it was.
The success of a product through branding can lead to
Choosing and continuing to buy your favourite brand.
. A positive buying experience results in repeat sales. Consumers tend to stick to a product if we like it. This in turn can lead to a trust in other products under the same brand name.
There are so many products on the market, many of them similar to each other, that the decision to make a first time purchase can be a difficult process. If we don't know about the product already, we take advice from people who do or we read the magazine reports about it. Without personal recommendation, we rely on advertising and the product's packaging to help us make a buying decision.
In a highly competitive market, the marketing department try to make their products stand out against the rest. A supermarket is a good example of this, with shelves full of almost identical products to choose from. The challenge facing the package designer is how to grab our attention so we make an
Read case studies carefully as the information given will help you structure your answer. Make sure you give the correct number of examples.
Fizz, a soft drinks company, is bringing out a new product, which is a mixture of lime, apple juice and lemonade. They want to target it at school children. Give two factors that they should consider in their packaging, and explain your reasons.
When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page
Fizz should make sure their name is clearly shown on the packaging. Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one. As they want to sell to schoolchildren it would be a good idea to use bright colours on the packaging.
Surj's answer shows that he only understands the basics of packaging. There is very little detail, and he has also only given one reason. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade.
Fizz should make sure their name is clearly shown on the packaging to make sure their product stands out. Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one as opposed to another similar product. As they want to sell to schoolchildren it could also be a good idea to use bright colours on their packaging as this has been a very successful way of attracting children in the past.
Saf's answer shows that she understands packaging quite well as she gives good reasons. She could, however, have been a little more detailed and used business terms. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade.
Fizz should make sure their brand name and logo are clearly shown on the packaging to help the consumer recognise their brand and to differentiate the product. This would allow Fizz to take advantage of brand loyalty. Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one as opposed to another similar product. As their target market is schoolchildren it could also be a good idea to use bright colours on their packaging and perhaps even a cartoon character, as these have been very successful ways of attracting children in the past.
Marlon's answer is very thorough. He gives good reasons for his suggestions and uses the correct business terms, like 'brand loyalty' and 'differentiate the product'. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.

A type of relief print made from an assortment of found materials such as card, string, sandpaper, embossed wallpaper, tinfoil, in fact anything that's relatively flat and textured.
A collage is an image that is made up of a mixture of materials, such as newspaper, magazine cuttings, string and so on.
A collotype can be made by layering corrugated card, bubble wrap, string, sandpaper, embossed wallpaper, tin foil, thick areas of pva glue - in fact anything with a texture - onto a base. This can then be inked-up and printed from.

2476,"will ask you to look at the relationships between the characters, their feelings or problems. You could also be asked to write about how characters are presented by Doris Lessing, the writer, or the methods she uses. Whatever you are asked to do, make sure you read the question very carefully and spend some time planning your answer.
One important thing to remember is that these questions might look very different but they often cover very similar ground. For instance, if you are going to write about the old man, you need to show how the writer presents him. Or if you are writing about the problems a character faces, you should also look at their relationships with other characters in the story.
The other thing to remember is that there are a lot of different ways to answer the same question. You do not have to include things in a fixed order.
It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters and themes.
It is also useful to include a personal reaction. This shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied someone else's ideas. For instance, you might feel sympathetic to the old man's situation, or feel he has no right to try to control Alice as he does.
In addition, try to include short quotes in your answer. The previous sections have plenty of examples, like using in a single word:
When he lets the pigeon escape he smiles 'proudly' at his granddaughter.
You can also use a short phrase, such as:
She stares, does 'not smile' and is 'wide-eyed, and pale' with 'tears shivering off her face.
Many people make the mistake of regurgitating numerous sentences, or even complete paragraphs, from the story. There is no need for this. It wastes time and does not provide a focus to your answer. Instead, look for a specific point and the exact word or words to illustrate it. Next, we will look at an example these techniques.
The old man is clearly the main focus of
. He is the first character we meet, and the one we know most about. For instance, we find out he lives with his daughter and her family, and how important his pigeons are to him.
Lessing also writes the story mainly from his point of view. For instance, we are told his thoughts, such as thinking about how his other granddaughters were 'transformed' by marriage and became 'serious young matrons' rather than girls who doted on their grandfather. In this way, the old man is shown to be rather selfish - he is thinking more about himself than the happiness of others in his family. This is most clearly shown when he asks his daughter about Alice and if they can 'keep her a bit longer'.
This is a good start - it keeps to the point and does not waste time retelling the entire story. It also includes short examples to make each point clearer.
The word 'keeping' might strike us as rather odd, because it is usually reserved for animals, not your children or grandchildren. However, Lessing draws several comparisons between particular characters and animals, in particular the pigeons. I especially liked the old man's fingers 'curling like claws into his palms', because it made me think he was becoming just like his birds. It also indicates that his quiet rage is building up as he starts to speak to Alice.
Alice seems to be the one the old man loves the most, but also despises. At times he is very rude to her, even calling her an 'impudent little bit of rubbish'. Yet it is obvious to me that he loves her deeply and can hardly bear to see her leave. For instance, he almost instantly regrets being rude to her, and starts to cry when he learns she is going to marry Steven.
Lessing seems to use contrasts like this throughout the story. For example, the behaviour of the old man and Lucy is very effectively portrayed. The old man is angry, stamps his feet and shouts like a child, while his daughter is able to humour him, and even 'croons' like one of his pigeons to calm him down.
This is only the start of the task. There is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction. It continues to treat each point fairly briefly, but manages to refer to the plot, language, relationships and themes. It also includes some of the writer's personal thoughts, giving a wide-ranging and detailed discussion of how the old man is presented in the story.

In each of these sections, we refer to the original shape as the
an object, we move it up or down or from side to side. But we
Which of the following triangles (P, Q or R) is a translation of triangle ABC?
a translation of triangle ABC. Triangle ABC has been translated 3 squares to the right and 2 squares up.
a translation of triangle ABC because the object and its image are facing in opposite directions.
a translation of triangle ABC because the object and its image have different side lengths. They are different shapes.
When we translate an object, every vertex (corner) must be moved in the same way.
Triangle PQR has been translated 3 squares down and 4 squares to the right. All of the vertices have been translated in the same way, and the object and its image are exactly the same shape and size.

2851,"You should know the different types of
The table summarises the main types of electromagnetic radiation and a typical use for each of them.
Unlike sound waves, electromagnetic waves do not need a substance to travel through. They can travel through the
of empty space. In a vacuum, they all travel with the same very high speed: 300 000 000 m/s.
A beam of electromagnetic radiation delivers energy in packets called photons.
The energy delivered by each photon increases with the
of the electromagnetic waves. This means that gamma photons have the most energy, and radio photons the least.
of a beam of electromagnetic radiation is the energy it delivers to a surface each second. This depends on how much energy each photon delivers, and on how many photons per second arrive at that surface.

3606,"In a bid to improve roads, the first Turnpike Trusts were set up in 1663. These organisations introduced tolls on roads and aimed to use the money raised to maintain the roads. However, the Turnpike Trust scheme still had its problems.
The first attempt in Britain to improve roads started in 1663. This was when the Turnpike Trust was set up. The trusts had one simple aim:
to charge people to use newly improved roads
and then the money raised from the tolls was used to pay for the upkeep of the roads.
who were sometimes more interested in making a profit than maintaining the good condition of roads for their customers. The businessmen had to get an Act of Parliament passed to build their turnpike and had to employ professional road surveyors, treasurers and reputable road engineers.
A carriage passes through the toll gate while engineers survey the road
As you can see from the illustration, the road engineers built
gates across the entrance of the roads
and then toll keepers collected tolls from people using the roads. People were charged different tolls depending on the method of transport they were using. This money was then meant to be used to maintain the roads.
Some trusts did maintain their roads and
(such as Thomas Telford) to build straighter and better roads. However, people who had always used local roads did not like suddenly having to now pay for the same route. For example, during the Rebecca Riots in Wales (1842-44) rioters dressed as women burned down toll keepers' cottages and tollgates in protest at road tolls.
out of a possible 120,000 miles were improved by Turnpikes.
and many minor roads were still in a bad condition.
Trusts began to care more about making a profit than the upkeep of road surfaces and often tried to charge
along routes to make extra money and this began to slow down people's journeys.
from roads as Britain's quickest and cheapest form of transport.
To make sure that you are clear about the changes that took place with roads look back at the diagram and then try to recreate it on a piece of paper.
As part of your revision, think about the
the toll money was meant to be spent on roads.
local people may have been upset about the new Turnpikes.

2494,"We have already looked at one aspect of language - in the section on
we saw how you could use short quotations as evidence.
We might want to say Don John is an aggressive and angry character. We can then support this view by looking at his language. He says that if he had a mouth he ""would bite"", and that he only has his unhappiness to make use of.
Here we are using two ways to provide evidence: words that are directly from the play are put in quotation marks, for example, ""I am a plain-dealing villain."" The second way is to describe what is said in your own words, for instance, Don John plans to stop Claudio's marriage to Hero. It is often good to combine these methods, perhaps quoting just one word from the play. For instance, Don John despises Claudio and calls him a ""start-up"" (an 'upstart' in modern English).
The one thing you should avoid is using a long quotation. Many students write out whole chunks of the play. This is just like retelling the story - there is no reason for it, and you will not get any marks for it.

Compounds and mixtures - Metal and non-metals oxides
Remember that metals react with oxygen in the air to produce metal oxides, like magnesium oxide.
Non-metals react with oxygen in the air to produce non-metal oxides. Here are two examples for the non-metals carbon and sulfur.
Carbon burns in air to form carbon dioxide:
Sulfur burns in air to form sulfur dioxide:
Non-metal oxides such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide are responsible for
. They dissolve in the water in the clouds to form acidic solutions. Acid rain damages rocks and buildings, and harms wildlife.
Differences between metal oxides and non-metal oxides
There are some important differences between the physical and chemical properties of metal oxides and non-metal oxides. The table shows some of these differences.

284,"> More on equations - Equations with x on both sides
More on equations - Equations with x on both sides
The same rules apply if an equation has x on both sides. Keep the equation balanced and perform the same operation to both sides.
Solve the equation 2x + 2 = x + 4
The equation 2x + 2 = x + 4 is represented by the following diagram:
As usual, the bags represent the unknown (x) and the sweets represent the numbers. Aim to get unknowns on just one side of the equation, so begin by subtracting x from each side:
Now you have the type of equation that you recognise, all you need to do is subtract 2 from both sides.
2x + 2 = x + 4
Subtract x from both sides to give x + 2 = 4

125,"Here's a brief outline of the different types of sentences (if you want more details, look at
A simple sentence generally has one main verb and communicates one idea. For example:
There can be several words in the verb, so
- has two words in the verb.
- has three words in the verb.
However, in each example there is just one main verb and idea. This is the simplest type of sentence and usually it's very easy to understand.
A compound sentence generally joins two simple sentences together. We typically use words like 'and', 'or' and 'but' to join the ideas. For example:
It was cold but we still went to town.
It was raining and we stayed indoors.
This makes the two ideas equal in the sentence - if we take away one part of it, we are left with a simple sentence again. These are very common when we are speaking and they are not difficult to understand.
A complex sentence communicates more than one idea, so it's like a compound sentence in a way. However, the ideas are not equal. This is because one part is like a simple sentence, so it can stand on its own. The other part can't - it needs something else to support it. For instance, look at this sentence:
You can't persuade me to go to town, no matter how hard you try.
We can take away the first part, but then we are left with:
Now this is not a simple sentence and it doesn't stand on its own - it needs something else to make sense.
We use complex sentences a lot when we speak, but it's important to use them in our writing too. In fact, these are the most difficult sentences to get right.
You write sentences all the time. Find out when and where to use them.

Here is a letter to a newspaper explaining why teenagers should be allowed to vote in the election. The ideas are good, but the writing is too informal. Rewrite the letter using formal language. Rollover the highlighted areas for tips.
'Dear Sir', is a more formal way to begin a letter.
This word needs to be deleted. It's far too chatty and informal.
, I think that teenagers have just as much right to vote in an election as someone who's
This should be written out in full: 'who is'.
This is a clich and sounds quite disrespectful. It would be better to just say elderly. The exclamation mark should be changed to a full stop too.
They live in the country too, you know!
'You know' is too chatty. Delete it and the exclamation mark that follows.
'In addition' would be a more formal way to begin this sentence.
This should be wirtten out in full: 'they are'
This should be written out in full: 'they are'

going to happen to the country they live in when they're grown-up. But
Avoid starting sentences with 'but' in formal writing. You could use 'on the other hand' to link the sentence to the previous idea.
some people think that teenagers are away with the fairies
This is a clich. 'Irresponsible' sounds more formal.
when it comes to important things like voting. But
Rather than 'but' you could use 'though' at the end of the sentence instead.
not all of us are. And anyway you know some grown ups are like that too
This sentence doesn't sound like a sensible argument. It starts with 'And' whilst 'anyway' and 'you know' are unnecessary. 'Like that' has no power and is unclear. 'Immature' might be a better word to use instead.
'In conclusion' is a more formal way to sum up an argument.
I think teenagers should be given a chance.
Far too informal. 'Yours sincerely' or 'yours faithfully' is the usual way to end a formal letter

Teenagers have just as much right to vote in the election as adults. As citizens of this country, many of us care deeply about what happens to it. Some people think teenagers are too irresponsible to make the important decisions involved in voting but many of us are far more mature than most adults. In conclusion, we should be given a chance to prove ourselves as the mature and responsible young people we are.

Graphs - The form y = mx + c
The equation of a straight line on a graph is made up of a y term, an x term, and a number and are written in the form of y = mx + c.
The slope of the line is known as the
All the points that lie on the blue line have a y coordinate that is the same as the x coordinate
We say that the equation of the line is
All the points that lie on the orange line have a y coordinate (the second number in brackets) that is one number higher than the x coordinate of the same line eg
In other words, the y coordinate equals the x coordinate + 1
So the equation of the line is
What is the equation of this line?
The co-ordinates of the points are (2,4), (1,2) and (-2, -4).
The equation of the line that fits these x and y values is y = 2x

576,"> Variation and classification - Continuous & discontinuous
Variation and classification - Continuous & discontinuous
Some of the features of the different organisms in a species show continuous variation, and some features show discontinuous variation.
Human height is an example of continuous variation. Height ranges from that of the shortest person in the world to that of the tallest person. Any height is possible between these values. So it is continuous variation.
For any species a characteristic that changes gradually over a range of values shows continuous variation. Examples of such characteristics are:
If you record the heights of a group of people and draw a graph of your results, it usually looks something like this:
The more people you measure, and the smaller the categories you use, the closer the results will be to the curved line. This shape of graph is typical of a feature with continuous variation. Weight and foot length would give graphs similar in shape to this.
Human blood group is an example of discontinuous variation. There are only 4 types of blood group. There are no other possibilities and there are no values in between. So this is discontinuous variation.
A characteristic of any species with only a limited number of possible values shows discontinuous variation. Here are some examples:

330,"Ducklings are able to walk almost immediately after hatching from the egg, and can even swim after a few days. They recognise their mother because of a behaviour type called
Ducklings will follow the first moving object they meet after hatching. They become socially attached to this object and treat it as their mother.
Imprinting lets young animals recognise their mother from a young age. They can follow her for food and protection.
Imprinting is useful if the first moving object they see really is their mother. But ducklings will imprint on people, balls and even cardboard boxes if these happen to be the first things they see.
Geese, chicks, and other baby birds that can walk around shortly after hatching, also show imprinting behaviour. Konrad Lorenz (1903 to 1989) was an Austrian scientist who studied animal behaviour.
He discovered that if he reared geese from when they hatched, they became imprinted on him. They followed him around and preferred to be near him even when they had grown into adult geese. Lorenz won the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine because of his experiments on animal behaviour.

Astronomy and space science - Days and nights
as they orbit the Sun. It takes the Earth 24 hours to make one complete turn on its axis, so an Earth day is 24 hours long.
Different planets take different amounts of time to make one complete turn, so they have different lengths of day.
The Sun lights up one half of the Earth, and the other half is in shadow. As the Earth spins we move from shadow to light and back to shadow and so on. It is daytime in the UK when our part of the planet is in the lit by the Sun. And it is night-time in the UK when our part of the planet is facing away from the Sun.
During the day, the Sun appears to move through the sky. Remember that this happens because the Earth is spinning on its axis. In the UK if we look south and follow the path of Sun in the sky during the day, it looks like this:
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west
. That's because the Earth is spinning towards to the east, so we see the Sun first appear there at the start of the day. The Sun 'rises' in the east and 'sets' in the west.
One way to remember which way the Earth turns is to remember ""
"", which means the Earth spins from west to east.
Star trails made by leaving the camera shutter open during the night
During the night, we cannot see the Sun. But the Earth is still spinning on its axis. This means that the stars appear to move from east to west in the sky, just as the Sun does in the day.

188,"> Food chains - Plants and photosynthesis
Before we look at food chains we will go over the way green plants capture energy from the Sun to make food. This is the start of all the food chains we will look at.
Animals eat food to get their energy. But green plants don't. Instead they make their own food, glucose, in a process called photosynthesis. We say that plants can photosynthesise.
These are the things that plants need for photosynthesis:
These are the things that plants make by photosynthesis:
We can show photosynthesis in a word equation, where light energy is shown in brackets because it is not a substance:
carbon dioxide + water (+ light energy)
Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves, and water from the ground through their roots. Light energy comes from the sun.
The oxygen produced is released into the air from the leaves. The glucose produced can be turned into other substances, such as starch, which is used as a store of energy. This energy can be released by
Photosynthesis takes place inside plant cells in small things called
. Chloroplasts contain a green substance called chlorophyll. This absorbs the light energy needed to make photosynthesis happen. Plants can only photosynthesise in the light.

Collecting and recording data - Tally & frequency charts
system to record your results is faster than writing out words or figures all the time.
If you record your findings in a tally chart, the data is already collected into groups, and you will not need to group it later on.
To investigate the most popular colour of car passing your house, it is easier to draw tally marks in one of five columns than to write red, blue, silver, silver, red, other, black etc.
If you use a tally chart, you could note down the colour of the cars as they pass, and find the total frequencies at the end of the one-hour period.
Look at the tally chart below. It shows how many CDs students in the maths class own. Fill in the frequency values in the right hand column.

Acids, bases and metals - Reactions of acids with metals
Acids react with most metals and a salt is produced. But unlike the reaction between acids and bases we don't get any water. Instead we get
This is the general word equation for the reaction:
The salt produced depends upon the metal and the acid. Here are two examples:
It doesn't matter which metal or acid is used, if there is a reaction we always get hydrogen gas as well as the salt.
There is a simple laboratory test to see if a gas is hydrogen. A lighted wooden splint goes pop if it is put into a test tube of hydrogen. This is because the flame ignites the hydrogen, which burns explosively to make a loud sound.
All acids contain hydrogen atoms. Apart from hydrochloric acid, this is not clear from their names, but you can tell they contain hydrogen from their chemical formulae. Remember that the chemical symbol for hydrogen is H.

313,"> Writer's tricks - The effect on the reader
Writer's tricks - The effect on the reader
You will now be very familiar with the idea that every text is intended to affect its readers in some way.
Every reader is, of course, different too, and sometimes a text will affect you in ways a writer didn't imagine, or you might notice depth in it that others won't. This is particularly true if the text matches your personal experience. A story about your home town might interest you more than one about somewhere else, or a text about smoking might affect you more if you know somebody who is trying to give it up.
Remember, you get marks for noticing the intended effect on the reader. Even if something doesn't interest, horrify, amuse or persuade you, you need to spot what the writer meant to do. It's usually better not to mention your personal opinion unless you are asked to.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - The text
SECTION 2 - Act 2, Scene 2, lines 1 to 157
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
, below, sees the light at the window, then realises it is
 But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
Be not her maid, since she is envious:
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
 It is my lady!  O, it is my love!
She speaks  yet she says nothing. What of that?
Her eye discourses. I will answer it.
 I am too bold. Tis not to me she speaks.
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night!
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
O speak again, bright angel!  For thou art
As glorious to this night, being oer my head,
As is a wingd messenger of heaven
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name 
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love
And Ill no longer be a Capulet.
(Aside)Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
Whats Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
Whats in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet.
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name 
And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Call me but love, and Ill be new-baptized.
What man art thou, that thus bescreened in night
I know not how to tell thee who I am.
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of thy tongues uttering, yet I know the sound.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
How camst thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb 
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls,
For stony limits cannot hold love out 
And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet
And I am proof against their enmity.
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
I have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes.
And but thou love me, let them find me here.
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogud, wanting of thy love.
By whose direction foundst thou out this place?
By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot, yet wert thou as far
As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Fain would I dwell on form  fain, fain deny
What I have spoke.  But farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay 
And I will take thy word. Yet if thou swearst
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers perjuries
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
Or if thou think I am too quickly won,
Ill frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo  but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light.
But trust me, gentleman, Ill prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheardst, ere I was ware,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discoverd.
Lady, by yonder blessd moon I vow,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops 
O swear not by the moon, th inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract tonight.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden 
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.
This bud of love, by summers ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Th exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it 
And yet I would it were to give again.
Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
But to be frank and give it thee again:
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
is heard calling from inside the house.
I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
 Anon, good Nurse!  Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little: I will come again.
O blessd, blessd night! I am afeard,
Being in night, all this but a dream,
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow
By one that Ill procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite 
And all my fortunes at thy foot Ill lay,
And follow thee, my lord, throughout the world.
I come! Anon!  But if thou meanst not well,
 To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief.

But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

Measures of average - Mean and modal class
Calculating the mean and modal class for grouped data is very similar to finding the mean from an ungrouped frequency table, except that you do not have all the information about the data within the groups so can only estimate the mean.
This table shows the weights of children in a class.
To estimate the mean weight, you know that 7 children are between 30kg and 40kg, but you don't know exactly how much they weigh, so assume that they all weigh 35kg (the midpoint of the group).
Do the same for all the other groups:
a) Estimate of mean = 1215  25 =
b) The modal class is the class that has the highest frequency. In this case the modal class is

326,"> More on equations - Equations when x is negative
More on equations - Equations when x is negative
If the value of x is negative, tackle the equation in the same way - aim to get all xs on one side of the equation.
5x - 2 = 12 - 2x
Your aim is to get all the unknown x terms on one of the equation side only, so start by adding 2x to both sides: 7x - 2 = 12
Next add 2 to both sides: 7x = 14
And finally, divide by 7 to give
As always, you can check your answer in the original equation. So substitute x = 2 back into 5x - 2 = 12 - 2x
(5  2) - 2 = 12 - (2  2)
10 - 2 = 12 - 4
This makes sense, so the value x = 2 is correct.
Add x to both sides to give 5x = 10.
To find x, divide both sides by 5 to get x = 2
Solve the equation 4x + 1 = 2x + 5
Start by subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation to give
Then subtract 1 from each side to give

Try to use quotations to support your ideas.
Very stressed and unhappy. 'Pacing back and forth' and barely surviving.

Preparing, planning and checking - Sample questions
Use the TAP technique for the question below. It will help if you read the question through several times and slowly to digest the content.
The following article has appeared in your local paper:
Ashfield Park is threatened with closure next month as a local business has applied for planning permission to turn the area into a car park. Local residents have begun a fierce campaign to save the park, which is a popular walking spot for young children and the elderly, as well as home to the War Memorial and many wildlife species.
Write to your local paper, arguing that the park should be preserved.
Have a think - what is the TAP? When you have your answer, check it with ours by pressing the 'Check ideas' button.
- it's to argue and persuade. This means you want to influence other people and tell them what you think is right
There are lots of ways of planning - some of them are fancy, some of them are simple, but the most important thing is to write your ideas down. If you don't, you could easily forget them.
Let's have a go at using the question about the park. The simplest plan is just to write down a list of all the points. Look again at the question, think of a list, then compare yours to ours.
If you are writing an argument, and we are in this question, we can make two lists - one is the positive side - which supports your view, the other is the negative side - which goes against your view. Have a go, then compare your lists with ours.
Some people like spider diagrams. These are more complicated, but they can show how points are linked, like this:
Use whichever way you find best, but don't forget that planning is something you can practise. You'll get quicker and make more detailed plans if you keep trying.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The proposal
Meanwhile, a nobleman called Paris visits Capulet to ask him if he can marry Juliet. Capulet asks him to wait two more summers, but suggest he romances his daughter and invites Paris to a party that evening. He gives his servant a list of names of people to invite.
The servant can't read. He bumps into Benvolio and Romeo and asks them to read the list for him. Rosaline's name, amongst others, is on the list. The servant doesn't know that Benvolio and Romeo are Montagues and invites them to the party, too.
Lady Capulet is sent to tell Juliet about Paris's proposal. They aren't very close so she asks Juliet's Nurse to stay and listen. Juliet will be fourteen on Lammas-eve, 31st July. Juliet tells her mother that she has never thought about marriage, but promises to take a look at Paris.

Character - First, second and third person accounts
A text can be written in the first, second or third person. This is all about who is telling the story. Here is a quick summary:
means ""I"" or ""we"". The narrator of the account will be a character in the text and we will read about events from their point of view. We will also tend to relate to and sympathise with their feelings because of this.
means ""you"". It is very rare to find a story written in the second person (why not have a go at writing a piece to see how difficult it is). Parts of adverts or leaflets are addressed directly to you, however, which can be a very persuasive way of writing.
means ""he"", ""she"", ""it"" or ""they"". The narrator of the story will usually be the writer. The text may give many different characters' viewpoints. Some stories focus on one character, the hero or heroine, and we usually relate to and sympathise with them more than others.
Take a look at these three extracts. Decide which ""person"" each one is written in and check your answers to see if you are correct.
When you arrive at Oldcastle Cottage you'll receive a warm welcome. Your every need will be taken care of by your hosts.

Mr. Fogg's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste. Each pair of trousers, coat, and vest bore a number, indicating the time of year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing; and the same system was applied to the master's shoes.

I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed (crossed) the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing.

374,"Now consider the following extract. Read through it carefully and note down three things you think it tells us about the main character. Once you've done this, compare your ideas against ours.
Stanley didn't have many friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.
What does this extract show us about the main character?
Stanley is another big male, but it is clear that the writer wants us to react differently to him than we did to Jim Wellings in the earlier extract.
Stanley is a lonely boy, because he ""didn't have many friends at home"". He is bullied and teased, even by adults. The fact that the teacher causes him ""embarrassment"" by showing him up in front of the class proves that he feels uncomfortable about his weight.

> The rock cycle - Sedimentary rocks
There are three main types of rock:
, pieces of broken rock as it flows along. When the river reaches a lake or the sea, its load of transported rocks settles to the bottom. We say that the rocks are
. The deposited rocks build up in layers, called
The weight of the sediments on top squashes the sediments at the bottom. This is called
. The water is squeezed out from between the pieces of rock and crystals of different salts form.
The crystals form a sort of glue that sticks or cements the pieces of rock together. This process is called
These processes eventually make a type of rock called sedimentary rock. It may take millions of years for sedimentary rocks to form.
These are the different processes in order:
The river transports bits of rock, and deposits them on the bottom of the river bed.
Sedimentary rocks contain rounded grains in layers. Examples of sedimentary rock are:
The oldest layers are at the bottom and the youngest layers are at the top. Sedimentary rocks may contain fossils of animals and plants trapped in the sediments as the rock was formed.

Measures of average - Mean from a frequency table
Sara wanted to know the ages (in whole years) of children on her school bus. She conducted a survey and her results are shown below:
To find the mean add all the ages together and divide by the total number of children.
If you type all those ages into a calculator it is highly likely that you would make a mistake or forget where you were up to.
It would be better if you could see these results displayed in a frequency table:
The frequency table shows us that there are six children aged 11, seven children aged 12, five children aged 13...etc.
To find the sum of their ages, calculate:
(6  11) + (7  12) + (5  13) + (7  14) + (3  15) + (2  16) = 390
The total number of children is 6 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 2 = 30
So the mean age is 390  30 =
You could also write this information into the table as shown below:
Mean = 390  30 = 13

A thermometer is used to measure the temperature of an object
Let's look at two examples to see the difference between heat and temperature.
A swimming pool at 30C is at a lower temperature than a cup of tea at 80C. But the swimming pool contains more water, so it stores more thermal energy than the cup of tea.
To boil water we must increase its temperature to 100C. It takes longer to boil a large beaker of water than a small beaker because the large beaker contains more water and needs more thermal energy to reach 100C.

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to argue
The key thing about writing an argument is that you present both sides and come to a clear conclusion. It's not like arguing with one of your friends, when you just say what you think. Instead, when you write an argument you have to show you are reasonable and can consider the different sides.
The following article has appeared in your local paper:
Ashfield Park is threatened with closure next month as a local business has applied for planning permission to turn the area into a car park. Local residents have begun a fierce campaign to save the park, which is a popular walking spot for young children and the elderly, as well as home to the War Memorial and many wildlife species.
Write to your local paper, arguing that the park should be preserved.
It would not be enough to write that you want the park to be saved - it might be how you feel, but it wouldn't be an argument..
It wouldn't even be enough if you wrote about all the good things in the park. That would be
as you haven't thought about any other views.
A good argument presents both the good and bad aspects of keeping the park. For instance, the park might protect nature, but cost a lot to keep clean. It might be a good place to walk, but few people actually go there. An argument depends on bringing these ideas together. Use connectives, like ""because"" or ""however"" or ""although"". These words give your argument a logical structure and help make the contrasts clear.
Once you have worked through these ideas, you come to your conclusion - saying whether they should keep the park or not.

> Changes in the environment - Extinction
A species becomes extinct when there are no more individuals of that species left. An extinct species has gone forever.
Here are some of the things that can cause a species to become extinct:
a change in the physical environment, such as a change in the long-term temperature or rainfall patterns
competition from another species that is better adapted, including competition from humans
For example, dinosaurs became extinct millions of years ago. This was probably due to changes in the environment. But many species have become extinct more recently because of competition from humans.
The dodo was a flightless bird found on the island of Mauritius. It became extinct in the seventeenth century because of human activities. Humans disturbed the dodo's habitat and also brought new predators to the island, like pigs and dogs.

600,"When letters in a formula are replaced by numbers, it is called substitution.
For the purpose of measuring time, the Earth's surface is divided into 24 equal wedges of 15, each called time zones and beginning at Greenwich, London (GMT). As you pass over each zone to the
1 hour to GMT, and as you pass over each zone to the
On this basis, call the time in London 'g'.
The formula for working out the time in Bangkok, Thailand is g + 7
And the formula for working out the time in Santiago, Chile, is g - 4
These formulae allow us to substitute 'g' for any time in London to find out the time in Bangkok or Santiago.
Q1. Using the formula above, find the time in Bangkok when it is 14.00 hours in London.
Q2. What time is it in Santiago, Chile, when the time in London is 20.00 hours?
A1. Time in Bangkok = g + 7.
g + 7 = 14 + 7 = 21
So at 14.00 hours in London, the time in Bangkok is
A2. The formula for working out the time in Santiago is g - 4
When g = 20, g - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16
So at 20.00 hours in London, the time in Santiago is
Here is the formula to convert the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (F) to the temperature in degrees Celsius (C)
where f represents the temperature in F.
any F temperature in for f to find its equivalent temperature in C
To find the temperature in C when it is 68F, substitute 68 for the f in the formula.
Remember to work out any calculation in brackets first: (68 - 32) = 36.
A number next to anything in brackets means the contents of the brackets should be multiplied, so 5(36) means 5  36:
What is the temperature in C when it is 77F?

The Tempest first key extract - Language
When talking about the language, the things to concentrate on are:
The part that illusion has to play
The example below is about power. Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on how the characters talk about magic and illusion
Prospero is a controlling character who seems to be obsessed with power and status. Ferdinand is a prince, but he has no status on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero pretends not to believe that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne of Naples and insists on taking him prisoner. He calls him a ""spy"", a ""traitor"", and an ""impostor"". He accuses him of lying. He threatens to ""manacle"" him and starve him. He uses his magic powers to prevent Ferdinand from defending himself. He also has control over Ariel and even talks about how his daughter will have ""control"" over Ferdinand when he falls in love with her.
Prospero is only pretending to be cruel and unwelcoming to Ferdinand as part of his plan, but it seems as though he is enjoying himself in the process. Even Miranda is alarmed at his behaviour.
The extract seems to suggest that Miranda and Ferdinand's love for each other will turn out to have a power that is stronger even than Prospero's magic.

494,"> Graphs - Plotting ax + by = c
Graphs - Plotting ax + by = c
Tables work well when you're plotting graphs of the form y = mx + c, but what happens when the equation isn't in this form?
Plot the graph of 2y - 4x = 3
in the form y = mx + c. You need to rearrange the equation into a form with just the y value on the left of the equation.
So add 4x to both sides to give
To find y divide both sides by 2 to give
Now that you have found the equation in terms of y, you can plot the graph using the usual method.

171,"> Explore, imagine and entertain - Short-stories
A short-story is easy to write if you:
Have only one or two main characters. It's a short story and you don't have time for any more.
Use people's words and actions as much as possible. Don't try to give lots of background information - let the reader use their own imagination. Remember - creative writing means creative reading too!
Make your characters and plot realistic. How do people really speak and act? Remember, most writers base some of their characters on people they actually know, so who can you use to improve your story? Would your granny make a good secret agent or your uncle a confident contract killer?
Get straight to the point. Don't worry about long openings or lots of detail. Instead, launch right in, hopefully in the middle of some action, like in the example below.
Steve held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - he was too shocked to speak. One moment he had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next he was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
You will also have to decide whether to write in the first person (using ""I""), or in the third person (typically, using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they""). Using ""I"" makes it easier to write about thoughts and feelings, but using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they"" lets you move from person to person, or from place to place. You can choose whichever you feel happiest with. For instance, we can swap the opening of the story into the first person, like this:
I held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - I was too shocked to speak. One moment I had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next I was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
The only thing you shouldn't do is swap the person - dont start with ""I"" and then switch to ""he"", or you'll spoil the story.

77,"We often make judgments as to whether an event will take place, and use words to describe how probable that event is. For example, we might say that it is likely that the sun will come up tomorrow, or that it is impossible to find somebody who is more than 3m tall.
Probabilities can be written as fractions, decimals or percentages.
You can also use a probability scale, starting at 0 (impossible) and ending at 1 (certain).
Here are some events placed on the probability scale.
Now try to order the probabilities in the activity below.

550,"> Polygons - The exterior angle of a polygon
Polygons - The exterior angle of a polygon
The exterior angle at a vertex (corner) of a shape is made by continuing one edge.
The exterior angles of a polygon add up to 360.
Imagine walking round the outside of the polygon. By the time you get back to where you started you have completed one full turn. So all the corners you turned must add to 360.
In this diagram the exterior angles have been given different colours. You can see how they can be put together to make a full circle.

249,"> Food chains - Getting carbon dioxide, light and water
Food chains - Getting carbon dioxide, light and water
Remember that the equation for photosynthesis is:
carbon dioxide + water (+ light energy)
Let's see how plants get the carbon dioxide and water they need for this process.
Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves. The carbon dioxide
through small holes in the underside of the leaf called stomata. (One of these holes is called a stoma. The plural is stomata.)
The lower part of the leaf has loose-fitting cells, to allow carbon dioxide to reach the other cells in the leaf. This also allow the oxygen produced in photosynthesis to leave the leaf easily.
A leaf usually has a large surface area, so that it can absorb a lot of light. Its top surface is protected from water loss, disease and weather damage by a waxy layer.
The upper part of the leaf is where the light falls, and it contains a type of cell called a
. This is adapted to absorb a lot of light. It has lots of chloroplasts and is shaped like a tall box.
Turgid plant that's watered regularly and a flacid plant without enough water.
Plants get the water they need for photosynthesis through their roots.
The roots have a type of cell called a root hair cell - these project out from the root into the soil. Roots have a big surface area and thin walls, which allow water to pass into them easily.
Note that root cells do not contain chloroplasts, as they are normally in the dark and cannot photosynthesise.
The water absorbed by the root hair cells passes through the plant in
tubes, and eventually reachers the leaves. If a plant does not absorb enough water, it will wilt or go floppy. Without water it may also not photosynthesise quickly enough, and it may die.

636,"> Romeo and Juliet Summary - The party
Romeo and Juliet Summary - The party
Romeo and his friends decide to gate-crash the party. Romeo has a bad feeling about the outcome of this evening, but decides to let fate take its course.
Capulet is having a great time at his party. People are dancing. Romeo and his friends arrive wearing masks. Romeo spots Juliet. He thinks to himself that he didn't really know what true beauty was until he saw her. He doesn't know that she is a Capulet. Tybalt recognises Romeo from his voice and threatens to kill him because he is a Montague, but Capulet stops him. Romeo and Juliet flirt and finally kiss. The Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet and he is dismayed. He leaves with Benvolio. Juliet is distraught when the Nurse tells her who Romeo is.
The Chorus recaps events for us: Romeo has forgotten Rosaline and is now in love with Juliet. Juliet feels the same way.
Romeo runs away from his friends. Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline.
Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom. Juliet doesn't know that he is there at first and, talking to herself, declares her love for him. She is shocked and embarrassed when he replies. They have only met that evening, but they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and what time their wedding will be! They find it difficult to part.
Romeo goes to see Friar Lawrence, the priest, who is worried that he has spent the night with Rosaline. When Romeo says that he wants to marry Juliet, Friar Lawrence tells him off for falling in love so easily, but agrees to the wedding because he thinks that it might be a solution to the rift between the Capulets and the Montagues.

If you have too little of a particular nutrient, we say that you have a

and have too few red blood cells. People with
deficiency may get a swelling in the neck called a
Although we only need small amounts of the different vitamins in our diet, we become ill if we don't get enough. For example,
deficiency causes scurvy, which makes the gums bleed, and
deficiency causes rickets, which makes the legs bow outwards in growing children.
Food is a store of chemical energy. If you look on the side of food packets you will see the food's energy content. This is usually measured in
. If we eat too little food, we will use up our store of fat and become too thin. If we eat too much food, especially foods rich in sugar and fat, we will increase our store of fat and become too fat.
It is important to balance the amount of food we eat with who we are and what we do. The amount of energy we need from our food depends on our age, our height and how much exercise we get.
For example, a one-year old baby needs 3850 kJ each day to continue to grow, whereas an adult Olympic swimmer in training needs 15,600 kJ each day. Someone who sits at a desk all day will need less food than their twin who climbs ladders all day to wash windows.

340,"Astronomers have decided that eight is the magic number when it comes to our solar system. The eight planets now include Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto belongs in a new class referred to as dwarf planets. The decision was made to create the new category because powerful telescopes have let scientists find more and more Pluto-like objects in space.
Jupiter is the largest planet. It is 88,846 miles wide.
Mercury has the fastest orbit around the sun. It moves almost 30 miles a second.
Venus is the hottest planet. Its average surface temperature is 867 degrees.
the largest asteroid, was discovered in 1801. Asteroids are rocky objects that orbit the sun. Most lie in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
the frozen dwarf, is located 4 billion miles from the sun. Charon, Plutos largest moon, was found in 1978.
2003 UB313 is a large object discovered in 2003. Nicknamed ""Xena,"" it is larger than Pluto and orbits in the Kuiper belt, an outer area of our solar system.
OK, now that Pluto is gone from the planet lineup, what memory trick will school kids use to remember the names and order of the eight planets? Heres one mnemonic device: My Very Excellent Mother Just Sent Us Nachos. Now its your turn. E-mail your ideas to ed4@weeklyreader.com and well post some entries online.

2 charts like the one below (one for you and the other for a friend)
To play, players take turns rolling the die for seven rounds, filling in their charts after each turn. To fill in your chart, write the number rolled in either the tens or the ones column. Put a zero in the other column. Keep track of your running total. For example, if you roll a 6, you can write either:

360,"If you listen to music, you are probably like millions of other kids--you turn up the volume when you hear your favorite song. Listening to loud music may be fun, but a government study shows it may also be dangerous.
According to the study, which was paid for by the U.S. government, more than 5 million kids, ages 6 to 19, have suffered some hearing loss. That's more than one out of every ten kids. Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss.
Amanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. ""It was assumed in the past that children wouldn't have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage,"" Niskar said.
Niskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a ""problem for children,"" she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems.
Hearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems.
For example, hearing loss ""can influence [a] child's ability to learn in the classroom,"" Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions.
Niskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead.
Listen Up! This diagram shows the parts of your ear. Loud noises can damage the cochlea and cause hearing loss.

368,"""This is George. He lived in Africa. He was a good little monkey and always very curious."" So begins the classic story of the inquisitive monkey Curious George, who leaves his jungle home to go with the man with the yellow hat. The book was first published in 1941 by H. A. and Margret Rey. Now the well-loved monkey stars in the animated movie
which opens in theaters on February 10.
Writer-and-illustrator team H. A. Rey and his wife Margret fled Paris on bicycles during World War II (1939-1945) with a handful of manuscripts. One was a story about a curious chimp. The couple eventually settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and wrote seven
tales in all. The books have been translated into 14 languages and describe the crazy adventures of George, whose curiosity often lands him in trouble. The man with the yellow hat helps George out of his various scrapes.
movie stars actor Will Ferrell as the voice of the man with the yellow hat. ""For years, Curious George has amused, entertained, and taught children around the world,"" Ferrell told

25,"When you read a newspaper, do you usually open it to the comics section? Many people do! That's because those cartoons are funny.
The cartoons in the comics section may make you laugh, but another type of cartoon will also make you think. It's called an
. An editorial cartoon expresses an opinion about specific people or events in the news.
Lately, many editorial cartoonists have been focusing on the presidential candidates and the election. Artist Gary Markstein created two political illustrations to express his opinions about this year's election.
The economy is one of the main issues in this year's presidential election. (The economy refers to the way a country runs its jobs and industries.) The economy is like the weather--sometimes it's good, and other times it's bad. Political polls show that many people ""vote with their pocketbook."" That is, they vote based on how the economy is doing.
to make his point about the economy. Symbols are objects that represent other things. One cartoon shows two weather maps labeled ""Economy."" George W. Bush stands in front of a weather map covered with smiling faces. John Kerry holds an umbrella as he stands in front of a map with bad-weather symbols.
A forecaster is someone who predicts the weather. Why does the artist depict Bush and Kerry as weather forecasters?
What point is the cartoonist making about the candidates and the economy?
How do the symbols help convey the message? What do the suns represent? What do the hail and thunderstorm clouds represent?
Do you think the cartoonist prefers one candidate over the other? Why or why not?
What dirt are the presidential candidates digging up about each other? Some people think election campaigning is a messy business. In one cartoon, Markstein draws attention to negative campaigning and
between candidates. In politics, mudslinging refers to speaking negatively about another person or opposing party.
To make his point, the artist shows two men talking about dirt for sale. One man says to the other, ""The Bush and Kerry campaigns each ordered 2 tons...""
Why might the Bush and Kerry campaigns be ordering mud?
What message do you think the cartoonist is sending about the election campaign?
When Gary Markstein was in the fourth grade, he dreamed of being a cartoonist and having his own comic strip. He even put out a humor magazine with a friend that lasted for one issue.
Today, Markstein's audience is much larger. He draws cartoons for the
Markstein draws five cartoons a week that focus on politics and sports. To get ideas, he reads several newspapers each morning. ""Coming up with a good idea is the hardest and most challenging part, but it's also the most rewarding,"" he told
What's the best part of his job? ""I get paid to play!"" said Markstein. ""I draw on a different topic every day. I think it's the best job in the world!""
If you think you'd like to be an editorial cartoonist, Markstein has some tips:
Draw well and write well. (Yes, there is writing in most cartoons!)
Read the newspaper to learn what is going on in the world.
Be creative, use your imagination, and have a good sense of humor!

298,"The hurricane left thousands of people homeless. Now people across America are reaching out to help the Gulf Coast rebuild.
Evacuees from areas affected by Hurricane Katrina in the Astrodome sports arena in Houston, Texas, September 6.
Will the Gulf Coast ever be the same?
back on its feet after Hurricane Katrina is going to be a challenge. It is expected to take months in some places, and in others, years.
Thousands of people who fled the storm weeks ago are still wondering when they can go homeif they still have a home. Across the country, other people are rebuilding their lives in new neighborhoods.
""The devastation is greater than our worst fears,"" says Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco. ""It's just totally overwhelming.""
Officials are now developing plans to repair the roads, bridges, houses, and buildings the storm washed away. Congress approved billions of dollars in aid. Companies in the United States have donated millions to the relief efforts.
Government officials have also been working on providing housing, schools, and jobs to those who
or fled, New Orleans. ""Our hearts go out to people, our brothers and sisters, along the Gulf Coast,"" says Mayor Bill White of Houston, Texas. ""They are welcome, and we are going to provide whatever support we need to.""
People from around the United States, along with those in other countries, are also reaching out to Katrina's victims. In Texas, schools opened their doors to students from the devastated communities.
In the city of Greenwood, Indiana, fourth-grade teacher Carol Edwards started a drive so her students at Southwest Elementary School could help those affected by Katrina. The class is collecting school supplies and clothing to send to a school that was damaged in the storm. Nine-year-old Alex Warford, a student in Edwards's class, says, ""I think it's a great idea because they lost all their things.""
A hurricane forms when warm, moist air rises from the ocean's surface. The air pressure drops, and the winds cause a mass of clouds to form around an eye. The eye is the calm center of the hurricane.
The rising air cools and condenses, and heavy rain falls. The eyewall is a solid ring of thunderstorms around the eye. The strongest winds and heaviest rains are located there.
Rescue teams in boats search a flooded street in New Orleans, Louisiana, September 7.
By the time Hurricane Katrina moved from the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico to land, it was a Category 4 storm.(""
When Katrina slammed into the coasts of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana on August 29, no one was prepared for the destruction that followed. The hurricane packed fierce winds of more than 145 miles an hour by the time it hit land. The monster winds, heavy rains, and flooding destroyed homes, peeled roofs from buildings, and toppled trees.
of nearly 30 feet destroyed communities along the Gulf Coast. A storm surge is a rise of water caused by powerful winds pushing on the ocean's surface.
After Katrina passed, 80 percent of New Orleans was flooded when levees that had protected the city collapsed. A
is a structure that prevents flooding. Thousands of people reportedly died.
""We're dealing with one of the worst natural disasters in our nation's history,"" said President George W. Bush after flying over the devastation. ""The folks on the Gulf Coast are going to need the help of this country for a long time.""
Hurricanes are rated on a scale of 1 to 5. A storm's rating is based on wind speed and the potential for destruction.

802,"North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear site, viewed from space in February 2002
In late January, officials fro South Korea traveled to North Korea. Both countries are located in eastern Asia. The reason for their visit was to try get North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Last October, officials in North Korea admitted to a U.S. official that North Korea is building nuclear weapons. That action violates a 1994 agreement to stop the spread of nuclear arms.
Tensions further increased when North Korea's leader, Kim Jong II, opened up nuclear power plants. The power plants had been closed under an agreement that North Korea made with the United States nearly ten years ago. Officials in North Korea say the power plants will only be used to generate electricity.
However, people in the United States and countries near North Korea, like South Korea and Japan, are concerned. They think that North Korea will use the plants make nuclear arms. North Korea recently kicked out U.N. weapons inspectors. That only added to the mistrust.
North Korea is an extremely poor country. Yet it spends most of its money on its army. It relies on help from other countries to feed its starving people.
Area: 46,500 square miles (about the size of Mississippi)
Economy: many children and families are starving
Area: 38,000 square miles 9about the size of Indiana)
Economy: it has the fourth largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The United States is working with countries in the region, such as South Korea, to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear crisis. South Korea was hoping to help the United States negotiate a peaceful solution. However, officials in North Korea want to discuss the issue directly with the United States.
U.S. official have said they will communicate with North Korea if it abandons its nuclear weapons program. President Bush has said that the world will respect North Korea when it is no loner a nuclear threat.
North Korea and South Korea are located on a Peninsula in Eastern Asia. Soldiers from the United States and South Korea routinely divides North Korea and South Korea.

61,"Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, homeland security has become an important issue for many people.
This week Grade 4 looks at where the two major candidates for president stand on
. Both candidates recognize that the world has changed since the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Each candidate has his own plan to make the United States more secure and keep its citizens safe.
President Bush's antiterrorism program has included removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and restoring freedom to the country. He has also worked to stop terrorist groups in Afghanistan.
In October 2001, shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush signed the Patriot Act. The law gives the government more power to investigate suspected terrorists. President Bush believes that the law should be renewed when it comes up for review in 2005.
Bush also created the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 to keep our airports, borders, and ports safe from attacks. He says that he has worked to improve national security at airports through increased screening and advanced equipment.
Senator Kerry promises to continue to track and stop potential terrorists. He voted for both the Patriot Act and the Department of Homeland Security.
Kerry supports the Patriot Act's renewal in 2005 if some changes are made to it. He argues that certain sections of the Patriot Act violate citizens' rights. Some of those parts include allowing the government to wiretap phone conversations and search business and library records.

120,"There's good news for manatees. For some time, manatees have been in danger of dying out. Now some scientists in Florida say the number of manatees has increased and the sea mammals should no longer be considered endangered.
Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.
Is it important to save manatees and other endangered plants and animals? Discuss in class and let us know at

650,"The meat-eating shark is one of the most feared creatures in the ocean. Now, the shark has reason to be afraid. Scientists have recently reported that the number of sharks in the North Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico has declined by half in the past 15 years.
, or kinds, of sharks live in the waters around the world. The researchers found that populations of some of the best-known sharks, including hammerheads and great whites, have been affected. The hammerhead suffered the steepest drop-an 89 percent decrease. The number of great white sharks declined by 79 percent.
According to scientists, the dramatic drop in shark populations is due to overfishing. The shark population is also threatened because sharks develop slowly and do not reproduce as quickly as other types of fish.
, or unwanted catch, in nets meant for tuna and swordfish. Some scientists think that tighter laws on fishing could protect sharks. For example, some sharks
, or move to another place, along set paths at certain times of the year. Some scientists say that preventing fishing during those times might help protect sharks from being accidentally killed.
Another risk to sharks are the people who kill them for their fins, which are used to make shark-fin soup. The United States prohibits that practice.
The decline in the shark population has scientists worried. All plants and animals in the ocean depend on one another for food. The link between them is called the
Sharks are predators at the top of the food chain. A predator is an animal that survives by eating other animals. Sharks hunt, or prey upon, other animals such as seals and tuna. Seals and tuna eat smaller fish. Those smaller fish feed on tiny fish and ocean plants.
""Sharks are adapted to being the predators, not the prey,"" said one scientist. Scientists say that if sharks are wiped out, it would negatively impact other marine life in the food chain.
What do you think should be done to protect sharks? Discuss in class. Then let us know in the Write On section of
The food chain links plants and animals together. They depend on one another for food. The ocean food chain begins with sea plants called phytoplankton. Tiny animals called zooplankton eat the phytoplankton. A small fish, such as a herring, eats the zooplankton. A bigger fish, such as a tuna, eats the herring.

41,"Recently, historians found an old well in Jamestown, Virginia.
Historians believe that colonists from England dug the well nearly 400 years ago. Shortly after the well was completed, it dried up. The colonists then used the well as a dump.
The historians have found a piece of old armor in the well. Studying the armor and other ""garbage"" from the well will help us learn about life in early Jamestown.
The history of Jamestown begins in England. On December 20, 1606, three ships sailed from England. The ships were bound for Virginia. After the colonists on the ships landed in Virginia, they built a fort. The colonists arrived in North America 14 years before the Pilgrims.
Most of the colonists came to Virginia to search for treasure. Most did not know how to grow crops to feed themselves. They became so hungry that they ate dogs, rats, and snakes.
Eventually, more people settled in Jamestown. They turned the fort into a town. The colonists began to grow and sell crops. The small fort became the first permanent English settlement in North America.
The ""garbage"" from the well is helping historians better understand how the colonists lived.
""When one stands at Jamestown today, it is hard to imagine how much hope, regret, fear, hatred, hunger, pain, and death were experienced at this place,"" historian Ivor Noel Hume wrote of the fort's earliest colonists.

698,"How did the universe begin? Most scientists think that it happened with a giant cosmic explosion. That idea is known as the Big Bang theory. A
is a way scientists explain how or why something happens.
In the past, scientists estimated that the universe was between 13 and 15 billion years old. Now, thanks to satellite technology, they are able to confirm its approximate age at 13.7 billion years old-give or take 100 million years. Using satellite technology, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) created a detailed picture of what the universe would have looked like shortly after the Big Bang. The snapshot provides answers to questions about the age and origins of the universe.
""We see the results as a gold mine for learning about our universe,"" said NASA scientist Charles Bennett. ""The patterns in the picture tell us all kinds of things about the universe.""
The space agency says the findings provide evidence that stars began shining about 200 million years after the Big Bang. This was half a billion years earlier than scientists had originally predicted.

341,"For climber Erik Weihenmayer, one of the hardest parts of climbing Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world, was leaping over
. A crevasse is a deep crack in a
, a huge sheet of moving ice.
""I never got used to these 4- or 5-foot crevasses that are hundreds of feet deep,"" said Weihenmayer. ""You had to jump across them. You have to be very careful when you land.""
For most climbers, jumping over a crevasse is hard enough. But for Weihenmayer, jumping over the cracks was particularly hard because he is blind.
Last spring, Erik Weihenmayer became the first blind climber to reach the peak of Mount Everest. He was part of a team of climbers that was sponsored by the National Federation of the Blind.
Mount Everest is 29,035 feet tall and sits on the border between Nepal and China, two countries in Asia. According to many climbers, Mount Everest is one of the hardest and deadliest mountains in the world to climb because of the mountain's height.
""There are a lot of things that can happen up there. You're not ever really sure that you're going to make it,"" Weihenmayer told
. Climbers can suffer from illnesses caused by many things, including the altitude.
sickness occurs when a climber does not get enough oxygen.
The team took more than two months to complete the climb. Weihenmayer spent much of his time moving the team's supplies up the mountain to a base camp, which was located at 17,600 feet. The time spent moving gear helped Erik Weihenmayer get used to the altitude. ""You're letting your body get used to the elevation, the air, the temperature,"" Weihenmayer said.
Weihenmayer, who had already climbed several of the world's highest peaks, had help getting up Mount Everest. ""[People] would walk ahead of me with a bell,"" he said. ""I tried to stay in their footsteps. I tried to stay [close] behind them so I could hear their steps, and I stepped into those places.""
For Weihenmayer, climbing Mount Everest was the toughest but most rewarding experience of his life. When he got to the top, Weihenmayer stopped to think about what he had done.
""I thought about the ground underneath me. I felt these cool flags [at the peak] that were up there in the breeze,"" Weihenmayer said. ""I thought about my family, friends, and about where I was.""
Mount Everest is located in Asia on the border between Nepal and China

519,"On September 11, the foundations of some of America's most famous landmarks were reduced to rubble by terrorist attacks. But the foundations of the United States are not as fragile as those buildings. To prove that point, millions of Americans have come together to help one another.
President George W. Bush recently recognized the heroic efforts Americans have made in the wake of this tragedy. In a speech on September 18, Bush said: ""Out of our tears and sadness, we saw the best of America. We saw a great country rise up to help. Tens of millions of dollars and thousands of hours and tons of food and clothing have all been donated to help rebuild shattered lives.""
By flying flags and holding vigils, millions of Americans shared the president's sentiments. ""As Americans, there is a bond between us, no matter how far away we are from one another,"" said Karen Bogart of Pasadena, California.
In the aftermath of the attacks, thousands of heroes offered to help. Those heroes were the volunteers, firefighters, police officers, and emergency crews at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Many of those heroes traveled thousands of miles to help out at ""ground zero,"" the site of the World Trade Center collapse, in New York City. ""We've had fire departments from Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and so many other places help us,"" said New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In addition to their usual jobs, rescue workers looked for pets trapped in deserted apartments or injured in the attacks. Many people who live near the World Trade Center in New York City had to leave their apartments quickly and were not allowed to return--even for their pets.
""Sometimes the owners feel so guilty that they abandoned their pets,"" said Jennifer Olsen of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ""But it is so gratifying to see them when they reunite with their pets after all this time.""
The rescued animals included cats, dogs, birds, and even a
, a kind of lizard. To get to the gecko, named Little Dude, rescue workers had to climb stairs to the 39th floor of a building. Despite that obstacle, Little Dude was reunited with its owner.
Whether rescue workers cleared rubble, looked for and helped survivors, or retrieved lost pets, their heroic efforts made all Americans proud to be Americans. Recently, President Bush also spoke of national pride. ""As president of this great land, nothing made me more proud.""

465,"Overfishing is harming the world's sea life.
Troubled waters are ahead for the world's fish. Those finned creatures and shellfish, such as crabs and clams, may be a rare sight by 2048, according to a fouryear study. The study, recently published in the journal
was conducted by a team of 14 researchers in four countries.
If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
The study warns that ocean life is being wiped out because of overfishing and pollution.
Global warming (a rise in Earth's temperatures) and habitat loss are also to blame for the decline in seafood.
Although the world's sea life is in serious danger, it's not too late to reverse the problem, says the study's lead author, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. The researchers have called for measures to protect current fish populations, such as reducing large-scale fishing and pollution. ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we don't change things,"" Worm told reporters.
The loss of ocean life will cause more than just a shortage of seafood. It could spell disaster for ecosystems too. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that work together as a unit to live. A declining fish population would cause a disaster up and down the food chain. Larger animals, such as seals and dolphins, depend on fish for food. Without enough fish to eat, those animals would be in trouble.

795,"Experts scramble to keep this world-famous city from sinking.
Venice attracts millions of tourists each year for its beautiful art and architecture. People weave their way through the city on boats because there are no streets. A maze of long
or waterways, takes the place of roads. In fact, there are no cars or trucks in Venice.
Venice is located in northern Italy on the Adriatic Sea. The city was built on a series of small islands in a
or an area of shallow water. During some high tides, water floods the city. For hundreds of years, people have tried to keep water out of the city to save it from sinking. Now a group of scientists has introduced a bold plan to keep the city afloat. And it means adding more water!
Venice is sinking at a rate of 1.57 inches per year, according to scientists. The Italian government has proposed the building of floodgates to control the flow of the sea.
Scientists hope to turn the tide in favor of Venice. They want to pump huge amounts of water into the ground through sturdy pipes. Scientists expect the water will expand the sand underneath and prop up the city. They hope to test the project on a small area over the next few months.
In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads.
Scientists behind the plan say that the pipes will work along with the floodgates to help save the city. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnt carried out in a careful way.
Everyone, however, agrees that saving the sinking city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose tremendous part of [history],"" Melissa Conn of Save Venice, an organization dedicated to helping preserve the city, told reporters.
Venice in Italian means ""city of canals.""
About 1.6 million people live in Venice.
The most famous building in Venice is the Basilica of St. Mark, a church dedicated to the patron saint of the city.

240,"Could you keep quiet for one day? How about for a month or a year? That's what Brett Banfe is doing. The 18-year-old believes that silence is golden, and he has promised not to utter a single sound for an entire year.
Brett is remaining silent to raise money for charity. He came up with the idea when he was talking to several friends. ""We were talking about what it would be like to stop speaking for a day,"" he explained. ""And I said I could do it for a year.""
Brett says zipping his lips will change the way he listens to people ""because I'm not going to be trying to think about what I'm going to say next,"" he explained.
Even though Brett's lips are sealed, he's keeping an online journal about his silent adventure.

279,"Thirteen-year-old Scott Cory may one day become the Tiger Woods of the rock-climbing world. Like the golf star, this eighth grader is one of the world's youngest and most accomplished athletes.H3:Record Breaker
With a Spider-Man-like ability to cling to rocks, Scott holds several records. He is the youngest person to climb to the
, or peak, of Half Dome and El Capitan in one day each. Those famous granite peaks are located in Yosemite National Park in California.Now Scott has set his sights higher. This spring, he plans to climb both mountains within 24 hours. Scaling nearly 4,900 feet of rock is equal to climbing four Empire State Buildings in a day.
Only a few experienced adult climbers have accomplished this feat in 24 hours. Climbers may take up to eight days to reach both summits. Leading Scott on his
, or journey, will be a skilled adult climber.
At 3:30 am, Scott will begin climbing a route on El Capitan called The Nose
At 3:30 pm, he will ""top out"" on the summit
At 5:40 pm, after a two hour hike down El Capitan, Scott will begin another two hour trek to Half Dome's base.
At 7:30 pm, Scott will begin climbing the Northwest Face. He will reach Half Dome's summit at 2:30am.
Scott has been climbing mountains since he was 7 years old. He first fell in love with the sport during a family vacation.
Why does Scott like the challenge of the sport so much? He sums it up this way: ""Climbing is fun for me.""
He also points out that climbing has taught him valuable lessons. ""You learn about trying over and over and not giving up.""

793,"By now, everyone knows that cigarettes are
, which means people can develop a need for them that is very hard to get rid of. However, until recently, no studies had measured how addictive.
Cigarettes contain many chemicals, including a chemical called nicotine, which studies have proved is addictive.
For many years, scientists believed it took a fairly long time for smokers to become addicted to nicotine. Last year, however, a study conducted by the University of Massachusetts showed that young smokers can become addicted to nicotine in only a few days or weeks.
The new study worries many doctors. ""This is particularly disturbing, given that each day, over 4,800 [U.S.] teens smoke their first cigarette. That's 1.7 million children annually,"" said Dr. Joseph DiFranza, who led the study. He added that those ""kids will take about 20 years on average to break this addiction. We need to take the problem of smoking and adolescents much more seriously than we have.""

559,"I [want] to bring common sense and fairness to the tax code
Governor Bush says that roughly one-quarter of the government budget
(extra money), which comes from taxes, should be returned to the people. He says his plan would promote economic growth and help people lead better lives by cutting high tax rates. The plan would lower the tax rate for married couples and families with children. He says the 6 million poorest families would pay no taxes.
I am calling for the right kind of tax relief--tax cuts that [will] help those who need them the most
Vice President Gore wants to lower taxes, but not by the amount Bush wants to. He says some of the surplus money is needed to support Social Security, a program that helps older people.

301,"Sumeyya Mamuk, 8, of Van, Turkey, fed and cared for the chickens in her backyard. As they started to get sick and die, she hugged them and kissed them good-bye. The next morning, she had a high fever, and her face and eyes were swollen.
Sumeyyas father rushed her to the hospital where she was told she had bird flu. Thanks to quick treatment with medicine, Sumeyya recovered. ""Shes gotten better,"" says her doctor.
Health officials in Turkey and around the world are alarmed by a dangerous disease called
or bird flu. The disease mainly affects birds. But the H5N1
or type, can infect people who come in close contact with sick birds. However, experts say eating cooked poultry is safe.
Turkey has experienced a recent outbreak as bird flu has raced across Southeast Asia and into Russia and eastern Europe. About 100 million chickens, turkeys, and ducks have died of the disease. Officials have killed millions more in an attempt to stop the spread of bird flu.
Sumeyya is among the very few people who have caught the disease. So far, the H5N1 virus has infected about 150 people, killing at least 85 people since 1997. The virus does not usually spread from person to person.
Health officials around the globe, however, fear that the virus could
or change, into a form that spreads among people. They are racing to prevent a
or worldwide outbreak of the disease. Scientists developed a new
but further studies are still needed. A vaccine is a medicine that protects people against a type of disease.
Although there have been no reported cases of bird flu in the United States yet, the government is working to make sure the country is prepared. In November, President Bush announced a $7.1 billion plan to purchase large amounts of vaccines and medicines and develop new treatments. The United States also recently pledged $330 million to help other countries fight bird flu.

696,"History in the Making: Three Days of Peace and Music
Woodstock was a large music festival held in the rural town of Bethel, New York, in 1969. At that time, the United States was divided over the war in Vietnam and the struggle for civil rights. Adam interviewed Michael Lang, one of the organizers of the concert.
When did you come up with the idea for the Woodstock Music and Art Fair?
In the winter of 1968. I was 23 or 24.
How did you get big stars to come to the concert?
Woodstock sounded like an event nobody wanted to miss, and the name Woodstock in those days was known. It was the home of Bob Dylan, Janice Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and other cultural icons. Initially, it was all about making everyone believe that these people were going to come and that I could get everyone to come. Soon, through word of mouth, bands were calling us.
Did you have any idea that so many people would show up?
In the beginning, we planned on 200,000, but officially we were trying to get a permit for only 50,000. In the end, we had somewhere between 500,000 and 600,000, but more than 1 million who tried to come were turned away. They had to close the [New York State] Thruway and the Canadian border.
Why did you choose Woodstock as the site, and why did you decide to keep the name Woodstock even after you ended up holding the festival 60 miles away, in Bethel?
We had to move to Bethel because we could not find a largeenough place in Woodstock. A lot of people tried to convince me to change the name [of the festival] to Bethel, but I felt the name reflected the spirit of what we were trying to do, which was to create an atmosphere of artistic community. Woodstock always stood for that.
Why are people still talking about Woodstock today?
What made Woodstock unique was how many people came and how well they treated each other. The world was shocked to discover that a crowd of more than 500,000 could live together for three days in a field and treat each other with love and respect. This was set against a backdrop of the war in Vietnam, ... a battle for civil rights and women's rights, and a yearning for peace in the world. The people who came to Woodstock accomplished all of these things, at least for that period of time, so it gave people hope for their future.
The interview taught me that a lot of musicians were activists. I also learned that no matter how prepared you are, you also have to

692,"Four hundred years after its founding, Jamestown is a historical hot spot.
Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on armor and talk to tour guides. This year, more than 2.4 million people from across the country are expected to attend Jamestown events.
Stepping into Jamestown Settlement museum in Virginia is like stepping into the past. And that's just what thousands of people are planning to do this spring. May marks the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America. Organizers are expecting nearly 90,000 visitors on the weekend of May 11 to 13, when many major events are planned.
Jamestown is a tourist destination for people who want a frontrow seat to American history. ""The whole idea is to give people an idea of Jamestown and the world in 1607,"" historian Tom Davidson told
Davidson helped put together exhibits at the Jamestown museum for the anniversary.
Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on English armor and watch experts demonstrate how to fire muskets. Tourists can also go aboard and explore
or models, of the three ships that brought the first settlers to present-day Virginia.
The story of Jamestown began on May 14, 1607, when about 100 English men and boys arrived in present-day Virginia. They came seeking gold and other treasures. The settlers, called
built a fort on the bank of a river and named their colony Jamestown, after King James I of England.
or businesspeople, of the Virginia Company to make money in North America. But the settlers faced many problems, including disease, starvation, and conflict with the area's Powhatan people (see ""
At first, settlers stayed close together for protection. ""There were hundreds of people living inside a wooden-walled fort,"" explains Davidson. Living in the fort helped the settlers defend themselves from attack, but it also made hunting for food or growing crops difficult.
Captain John Smith was one of Jamestown's original leaders. He took command of the colony in 1608. When the colony was in danger of running out of food, Smith gave an order: ""He who does not work, will not eat.""
spent five months crossing the Atlantic. The original Godspeed carried 39 passengers from England to Virginia, making two stops along the way. The new Godspeed traveled from Maine to Virginia, stopping along the way to let visitors see the ship.
By 1613, Jamestown had expanded into a successful colony. At about that time, the settlers began to grow tobacco. Tobacco was a
meaning that it could be sold in large amounts to England. In the following years, the settlers pushed the Powhatan off the land and built tobacco
or large farms. Later, the Jamestown colonists bought slaves from Africa to work on the plantations.
Over time, Jamestown grew to become the colony of Virginia. Virginia was one of the 13 colonies that joined in 1776 to rebel against England, starting the American Revolution (17751783).
Much is known about Jamestown, yet more details are being discovered. For more than a hundred years, experts thought the site of the original settlement had been destroyed by the James River. In 1994, archaeologists, or scientists who study the remains left behind by past cultures, discovered what may be Jamestown's original location.
""Visitors can see things being excavated that haven't seen the light of day in 400 years,"" Jamestown spokesperson Mike Litterst told
Scientists are currently looking for the foundation of the first church that the Jamestown settlers built. If found, it will be the oldest English church ever discovered in the United States.
The skeletons of two settlers have already been uncovered at the site. They are on display beneath a glass case, exactly as they were found. Historians believe that one of the skeletons is that of Captain Bartholomew Gosnoll, a member of Jamestown's original ruling council. Gosnoll and Jamestown Settlement will have a lot of visitors in the coming weeks for the 400th anniversary. ""It's the biggest event we've had since 1957, when the [Jamestown] museum first opened,"" says Litterst.
When the English colonists first settled in what is now Virginia, a powerful Native American group had lived on the land for hundreds of years. ""There were about 20,000 Powhatan people there when the English arrived in Jamestown,"" Virginia Indian culture expert Karenne Wood told
She hopes that the 400th anniversary of Jamestown will help shed light on the Powhatan's story.
When Jamestown began, the English and the Powhatan tried to trade with each other peacefully, but soon fighting broke out over land and resources. Beginning in 1614, the fighting stopped for eight years when Pocahontas, a daughter of the Powhatan chief, married Englishman John Rolfe. However, the fighting quickly resumed as Jamestown expanded.
Over time, the Powhatan people lost their land to the English settlers. However, Virginia is home to many Native American descendants today. ""We have changed a lot,"" says Wood, ""but we are still here.""
Organizers at Jamestown are not calling the 400th anniversary a celebration. Why might that be?

150,"Thanks to Harry Potter, kids everywhere are enchanted with magical worlds.
Muggles, beware! Harry, Ron, and Hermione have cast a spell on kids everywhere, including fifth grader Jake Lisakolsky from Naugatuck, Connecticut.
Jake and millions of other Potter fans lined up this summer for
. That is the sixth title in the seven-book series. More than 100 million Potter books are in print in the United States alone. ""The Harry Potter series is a thrilling tale,"" Jake told
. ""And Book 6 is one of the best!""
But it's not just Harry and his friends who are enchanting children around the globe. Kids are devouring other fantasy books too. Fantasy lovers are escaping into the imaginary worlds of
(ZHAN-rah), or type, of book or movie that is set in a world completely different from our own. Fantasy is nothing new, although it has become all the rage again, thanks to author J. K. Rowling's brave boy wizard.
""Hats off to Rowling,"" English professor Alida Allison of San Diego State University told
. ""She probably didn't expect this, but she started a [new] wave of fantasy reading.""
for the second timeand he is almost halfway through J.R.R. Tolkien's
. A trilogy is a series of three related books or movies that tell a story. What's the draw of fantasy? ""Fantasy is full of action and excitement,"" says Jake.
It's not surprising that fantasy has turned millions of kids into book-worms. ""Fantasy allows children to think about other worlds and contrast them to their own,"" says Allison. ""It stretches their imaginations.""
What exactly makes a story a fantasy? Traditionally, a fantasy tells the story of a single character, the hero, such as Harry Potter. Like Harry, the hero is often unaware of his or her power. After crossing into a different world, the hero is faced with a series of tests.
In a fantasy story, a teacher often shows the hero the tricks of the trade. In
, wise Gandalf protects the hobbit Frodo. Harry, too, is taught by Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts.
Fantasy books typically end with a battle between the hero and the villainand the hero ultimately wins. If Rowling sticks to the fantasy formula, will Harry defeat Lord Voldemort in Book 7 of the series?
The fantasy craze has also hit the big screen, with many books being made into films. Fans of
movies turned out in record numbers. This December, a film version of the classic C. S. Lewis book
The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
will hit theaters. It tells the story of four children who enter Narnia, a world filled with strange creatures.
On November 18, the fourth Harry Potter film
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
hopes to work its magic on fantasy fans again. Jake can't wait to see it and compare it with the book. He is especially looking forward to the Quidditch World Cup scene. He says the filmmakers had ""better not mess it up!""
caught up with Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) on the set of
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
. Daniel, now 15, plays the boy wizard on screen.
: How would you describe Harry these days?
Daniel: He's grown up quite a bit. In this story, everything is being taken away, and it's out of his hands. Harry struggles to get a grip on the situation.
: Are you shy, as Harry is with Cho Chang [his Goblet of Fire crush], in real life?
Daniel: I'm quite shy, but I'd like to think that I'm not. Sometimes I find myself not knowing what to say to [girls].
: Which scenes did you most enjoy filming?
Daniel: The underwater scenes were the most interesting and the most fun. Mike [Newell, the director] told us, ""Don't try to actually speak your lines underwater. Just move your mouth.""
: If you could have any magical power of Harry's, what would it be?
Daniel: [I would want to do] everything with the wand, like cast spells.
Is it better to read the book first or see the movie? Explain your answer.

258,"The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle's grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles.
The disease attacks an infected bird's brain and spinal cord.
At first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird.
In recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year.
Although the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased.
By the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild.
Wildlife experts are especially concerned because they don't know much about the disease, including what causes it. ""We have some ideas, but we don't have any answers,"" John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said.
Experts also don't know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. ""This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn't noticed,"" Fischer said.
While wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Scientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America's bird--the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn't true in 1782.
Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol.
""I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country"", Franklin wrote. ""He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird"".

403,"Scientists find the remains of an ancient village near the famous circle of stones.
Stonehenge is a mysterious monument that consists of a circle of stones. It was built about 4,600 years ago in southwestern England. Researchers recently unearthed an ancient village near Stonehenge. The village may have been home to the builders of the stone circle.
discovered the remains of close to 25 small houses about 2 miles from Stonehenge. (Archaeologists study the materials left by prehistoric peoples and their cultures.) The researchers say the village, known as Durrington Walls, was built at about the same time as Stonehenge. They
or guess, that Stonehenge was a memorial site or cemetery for the villagers. The village includes a wooden version of the stone monument.
""Clearly, this is a place that was of enormous importance,"" says British researcher Julian Thomas, who helped discover the village. He noted that both Stonehenge and Durrington Walls have avenues connecting them to the nearby Avon River. Villagers may have frequently traveled between the two sites.
Eight of the wooden houses have been
or dug up. The structures are about 14 feet long. There was evidence of bed frames along the walls and a dresser or storage unit on the wall opposite the door.
Two of the houses found by Thomas were separate from the others. They may have been the homes of community leaders. Stone tools, animal bones, arrowheads, and other
(humanmade objects) were also uncovered in the village.

532,"In the days following last month's deadly attacks, most Americans put aside their differences to show there is unity in the United States.
But some Americans acted differently. Instead of helping others, they attacked innocent Arab and Muslim Americans.
Some individuals vandalized mosques (the buildings where Muslims practice Islam, their religion). Others attacked anyone they thought looked to be from the Middle East.
Dr. Abdullah Khoui, of the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C., condemned the attacks while defending his religion.
""What took place, no sound mind would approve of it, and no religion at all in the world would accept it,"" Khoui said. ""Islam does not approve of what took place.""
Arshad Majid, of the Islamic Center of Long Island, N.Y., said that Islam promotes peace.
""We're concerned that the actions of a small number of extremists is likely to paint with a very broad brush the large population of God-fearing, peace-loving Muslims in America,"" Majid said after the attacks.
President George W. Bush agreed with the Islamic leaders. While visiting a mosque, President Bush commented on the attacks on Muslim and Arab Americans. ""That's not the America I know,"" he said. ""That should not and that will not stand in America.""
Muslims practice the religion of Islam. Islam was first preached by the prophet Muhammad about 1,400 years ago.
In the 600s, Muhammad had a dream in which Allah, the Arabic name for God, called him to be a prophet. Islam means ""submission, commitment, and peace"".
Islam teaches that human diversity, or difference, is a sign of the richness of Allah's mercy. In other words, according to religious experts, Islam promotes peace.
Those experts add that the September 11 attacks do not represent Muslim beliefs. The majority of the 1.2 billion Muslims worldwide practice peace and tolerance toward others.

743,"Simon is a rare red panda, like this one.
Simon, a rare red panda, now plays in the trees at a Jerusalem zoo. Jerusalem is a city in the Middle East. The small, bear-like animal likes to dine mainly on bamboo but also munches on fruits, acorns, and insects. Red pandas are excellent climbers and spend most of their time in trees.

691,"Many kids think cell phones are cool. The portable phones come in fun colors and let you chat with friends anytime and anywhere. For many kids, owning the right cell phone is just as important as wearing the coolest sneakers or latest style of jeans.
Even though cell phones are a hot fad, some scientists are ringing an alarm about them. The scientists say that cell phones might pose a health threat.
In the United States, more than 90 million people use cell phones. Many of those people are kids. For kids, cell phones are about more than phone calls, says Anne Charlton of the University of Manchester in England. ""It's all about the cool factor,"" Charlton said. She added that a cell phone is not just about making calls, it's also a fashion statement.
Most cell phone users don't think about the health risks the phones might pose. Some scientists warn that cell phones give off radiation that might be harmful to users. One recent study shows that cell phone radiation might increase a person's chance of getting some kinds of cancer.
Other medical experts say cell phones don't pose a health threat. They point to studies that have not found any link between phone use and cancer.
Scientists say that people can protect themselves from cell phone radiation. One way is to use a headset instead of talking directly into a cell phone. Or, for an even simpler solution, people can make shorter calls.
When the first cell phones were sold, they all had the same ring. Today, most cell phones can be made to ring one of several different tones. But at least one cell phone manufacturer plans to change that.
Nokia plans to start making phones that play pop tunes when they ring. Users could choose tunes by the Spice Girls, Enrique Iglesias, Lenny Kravitz, and many other artists.
By choosing pop tunes instead of the standard ringing sound, cell phone users can program their phones to match their personalities and moods, explained a company spokesperson.

801,"A group of fourth graders witnessed firsthand proof that one person's junk is another person's treasure.
joined the students on their recent visit to the Garbage Museum in Stratford, Connecticut, where a giant, multicolored dinosaur molded out of garbage towered above them.
was sculpted out of a ton of trash! That is equal to 2,000 pounds of garbagethe amount of trash each person, on average, throws away each year. Philadelphia artist Leo Sewell scoured city dumps and created
out of old junk, from false teeth and license plates to toys, tires, and tennis rackets.
""I think the dinosaur is one of the coolest things I've ever seen,"" said fourth grader Jahkwe Aquart from Park City Magnet School in Bridgeport, Connecticut. His classmate Julie Pham, 9, agreed. ""Instead of throwing away our garbage, we can reuse it.""
was made out of a ton of trash, including false teeth, license plates, and tires.
That is exactly the point. ""The museum shows what happens to our trash, how we can reduce our trash, and what we can do instead of throwing our trash away,"" said museum director Sotoria Montanari.
Today, Americans create more garbage than ever before. In the early 1900s, most items were packed in containers that could be used again. Now, most of the food we buy, from cereal to milk, comes in boxes and cartons that can be thrown away.
So what happens to trash after it is tossed out? Some trash ends up in
. In a landfill, garbage gets buried between layers of soil. Because many states are running out of room for landfills, more and more garbage goes to
(or resource-recovery) plants. At these plants, garbage is burned and converted into electricity that people use to power their lights, TVs, and video games.
Plastic bottles can be recycled at centers like this one.
Garbage is a form of solid waste. The Garbage Museum and its recycling plant, which are run by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, provide visitors with ideas to cut down on solid waste. One way is to
, or make less, trashby throwing away fewer napkins when you eat, for instance. Another way is to
, or find new uses for, old items. Paper bags, for example, can be reused to make book covers or wrap gifts.
People also help decrease their solid wastes when they
. Recycling refers to putting old objects, such as glass, plastic bottles, newspapers, and aluminum cans through a special process so they can be used again. (See ""
Recycling has many benefits. Did you know that recycled plastic soft-drink bottles can be made into park benches, carpeting, and backpacks? The more people recycle, the less garbage ends up in landfills or waste-to-energy plants.
, or materials from Earth. To make an aluminum can from scratch, for example, the metal needs to be mined from the ground. That process harms the land and pollutes the air and water. Making aluminum cans from recycled cans uses 95 percent less energy and protects Earth's natural resources. In fact, the energy saved each year from recycled cans could light Washington, D.C., for nearly four years!
What are some other ways you can protect natural resources?
As part of their visit, the fourth graders got a look at the museum's recycling center. Here, they discovered that one
, or bundle, of recycled newspapers can save 17 trees! The message seems to have stuck with 9-year-old Arron Smith. ""When you recycle, you save trees and animals' homes.""
Did you ever wonder what happens to the aluminum cans you recycle?
watched a recycling center in action at the Garbage Museum.
Trucks drop off aluminum cans that are mixed with massive loads of plastic bottles and glass. The trash travels along conveyor belts to be sorted and separated.
Machines compress aluminum cans into giant bales.
The bales are sold to companies that turn the recycled cans into something usable. From recycled aluminum cans, more cans are made. When you buy recycled products, you ""close the loop.""
Each American throws away about 5 pounds of garbage each day. Earth Day, April 22, reminds people how important it is to reduce waste. Here are some ways:
Carry a lunch box instead of a paper lunch bag, and pack food in reusable containers.
Use both sides of a sheet of paper.
Donate old clothing and toys to a charity.
pile using food scraps, leaves, and grass clippings. Composting is nature's way of recycling. Plants and other wastes
, or rot, and nourish the soil.

147,"Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will take a look at where the two candidates for president stand on important
, or problems facing the country. This week's issue is the
President Bush went to war in Iraq because, he said, the country's dictator, Saddam Hussein, had harmful, illegal weapons. Bush claimed that Iraq and its weapons threatened the United States and other nations. Bush says that the world is safer now that Saddam has been removed from power. His goal is to rebuild Iraq with its own government and establish peace there.
Senator Kerry supported a law that allowed the United States to go to war in Iraq. Since then, he has criticized Bush's handling of the war. Kerry said that Bush misled the nation by claiming that Iraq had harmful, illegal weapons. To date, none have been found.

101,"Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two major candidates for president stand on important issues. This week's issue is the
Bush wants to reduce the amount of air pollution from power plants.
President Bush says that he has worked to reduce pollution. Earlier this year, he announced a plan to improve the country's water quality.
To help Americans breathe cleaner air, Bush started the Clear Skies program. It is designed to reduce the amount of air pollution from power plants.
President Bush has allowed companies to cut down trees in some national parks. He says that will help prevent the number of wildfires.
The president favors oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He says the new oil source will reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East and will lower the cost of gasoline. He also wants car companies to use hydrogen fuel cells, a clean energy source, to power vehicles.
Kerry wants to do more to keep our waterways free from pollution.
Senator Kerry does not think President Bush is doing a good job taking care of the environment. He says that Bush has not enforced many important pollution laws.
Kerry thinks more needs to be done to keep our waterways clean and free from pollution. He plans to make the air cleaner and launch new ways to protect the country's water supply.
If elected, Kerry proposes to give more money to national parks. He says that Bush has let companies cut down too many trees.
Kerry also opposes Bush's plan to drill for oil in Alaska. Kerry wants to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil by using new forms of energy. He also supports the making of more fuel-efficient vehicles.

A company has invented a perfume for cats that their owners can also wear. The perfume is called Oh My Cat. ""It is to promote harmony between you and your pet,"" said Nick Munafo, who works for the company that makes the perfume.
""On weekends, I put it on my cats, and they really seem to like it,"" he said. He added that he also wears a little of the perfume.

725,"Take me out to the... art museum? Yes, you've heard right! Baseball is being honored with a new art exhibit. The exhibit, ""The Perfect Game: America Looks at Baseball,"" celebrates our national pastime. It is being shown at the American Folk Art Museum in New York City.
To enter the exhibit, visitors walk through a turnstile similar to one they would find at a baseball stadium. Inside, more than 100 objects from 1840 through the present are on display. The exhibit includes scorecards, baseball cards, bats, painted baseballs, artwork, and even an autographed quilt among its many items.
""It's baseball history and trivia,"" Elizabeth Warren told
when describing the exhibit she organized. ""It combines baseball and art.""
Warren says that Jackie Robinson is depicted on many objects, more than any other baseball player. In 1947, Jackie Robinson made history. He became the first African American baseball player in the major leagues when he joined the Dodgers. At that time, the Dodgers were located in Brooklyn. Today, they are in Los Angeles.
""Jackie Robinson was a hero both on and off the field,"" said Warren. ""He's such a great role model.""
The exhibit runs through February 1, 2004

416,"Residents of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, thought a 7-foot Mr. Potato Head would be a perfect gift for Belper, their sister city in Great Britain. Hasbro, a game company in Pawtucket, invented the famous spud in 1952.
But the residents of Belper were outraged at the gift. When the giant potato arrived, the locals called it a ""monstrosity."" Some residents complained to the local newspaper about the giant spud. ""We started getting letters saying, 'Why has this horrible thing appeared--stuck in the middle of town? We don't want it here,'"" said Wayne Bontoft of the Belper News. Because of the complaints, Mr. Potato Head was moved to a nearby amusement park.
Belper resident Jon Smith said, ""Surely they could have sent us something better.""
Bob Billington, a Pawtucket tourism official, said the snub ""upset a few folks out here. This is where the little guy was invented. We thought it was a nice gesture.""

294,"A sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
Wildlife officials in Florida have set up speed traps. The new speed traps, however, are not along highways. They are in the state's waterways.
The officials want to stop boaters from speeding in areas where manatees, or sea cows, live. Manatees are endangered mammals that live in water. Speedboats often collide with the slow-moving sea cows. Officials hope the new speed traps will slow down boaters.
Last year, boats injured or killed 78 manatees. During the first six months of this year, 48 manatees were injured or killed by boats.
State and wildlife officials blame the increase in manatee injuries and deaths on the number of boaters. ""There are more boats [on the water] now, so that's causing more [manatee] deaths,"" said Nancy Sadusky, an official of the Save the Manatee Club.

720,"People often take trips on our nation's roads and highways. But recently, several sections of an old road went on a trip of their own.
Last month, workers in Oklahoma loaded about a dozen pieces of historic Route 66 onto trucks. Each of the 3,000-pound pieces then made a 1,400-mile trip to Washington, D.C., where they will become part of an exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
Route 66 has been called the ""Main Street of America."" It once stretched 2,400 miles, from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California. The road connected eight states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
In the 1920s, engineer Cyrus Stevens Avery of Tulsa, Oklahoma, envisioned a road connecting the Midwest and the Pacific Ocean. During the 1930s, Route 66 was completed and was soon lined with hundreds of businesses.
The road became so popular that it inspired a 1960s TV show,
, as well as a famous song, ""Get Your Kicks on Route 66.""
In the past few decades, however, Route 66 has fallen into disrepair, and parts of the old route have been dug up. Today, drivers use faster superhighways to get where they were going.
Even though fewer people drive on Route 66 now, many people still think of the road as the Main Street of America. That's why the National Museum of American History wants to include the road in its new exhibit, ""America on the Move."" The exhibit is scheduled to open in 2003.

568,"Ten-year-old Hunter York might have a fear of snakes, but that didn't stop him from picking up the two-headed creature that he found in his father's backyard.
The Kentucky boy used a stick to pick up the two-headed black king snake.
The snake ""kind of freaked me out a bit,"" he said.
Hunter ran into the house to tell his father about the 8 1 / 2-inch reptile.
, like this snake, are cold-blooded animals that either crawl around on the ground or, like turtles and lizards, creep on short legs.
Hunter's dad left the reptile with a snake expert because they couldn't get it to eat.
""We couldn't force-feed it because we don't know which head eats,"" said his dad.

580,"It's the law. The orange is Florida's official state fruit.
Oregon has the pear. Georgia has the peach. West Virginia has the Golden Delicious apple. Now, thanks to a group of elementary school students, Florida has its own official state fruitthe orange. The students attend Southside Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida.
""We were completely surprised that the orange
the state fruit of Florida,"" their teacher, Janet Shapiro, told
. Oranges are featured on the state's license plate. Orange juice is the official state beverage, and the orange blossom is the official state flower.
Shapiro's class, fourth graders at the time, got the idea more than a year ago after they read about a class in New Jersey that made the blueberry their state's official fruit. That prompted the group of Florida students to write letters to local lawmakers. They also collected signatures and even wrote a song about the fruit.

404,"It was a clear evening on July 23 as James Mennig stood outside his home in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. As he looked up into the sky, Mennig saw something that caused him to turn and run inside.
Mennig saw a bright object streak through the sky. ""It looked like a plane that was totally engulfed in flames,"" he said.
The flaming object Mennig saw was not a burning plane. It was a meteor burning up in Earth's atmosphere.
A meteor is a piece of rock or metal from space that burns up as it streaks through Earth's atmosphere. Because meteors look like stars falling or streaking across the sky, many people call them shooting stars.
According to officials at the U.S. Department of Defense, the bright meteor, which is called a fireball, entered Earth's atmosphere above Scranton, Pa. People from Canada to Virginia saw the bright fireball.
Scientists said the meteor exploded somewhere near Williamsport, Pa. No one was hurt by the fireball and no homes were damaged. But eyewitnesses later described a layer of gray ash and damaged plants in a cornfield.
According to scientists, meteors streak through Earth's atmosphere every day, but most burn up before hitting the ground. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is now studying ways to prevent large meteors from hitting Earth.
Observers not only saw the fireball, they heard it as well. As the fireball raced through the atmosphere, it produced a loud noise.
""There were two monstrous booms followed by a long rumbling and this great shaking. It knocked pictures off walls,"" said Anna Jean Edkin, a safety official in Anthony Township, Pa.
*Meteors come from pieces of space debris called meteoroids. Meteoroids can be made of rock, metal, or both.
*A meteor is a piece of rock or metal that breaks away from a meteoroid and enters Earth's atmosphere.
*A meteorite is a meteor that falls through Earth's atmosphere and hits the planet.

531,"For most kids, the average school daysix and a half hoursis long enough. But in some states, officials want more time on students' side. Kids need more time to learn, they say.
More class time can improve test scores, according to a recent report by the research group Education Sector. As a result, schools are experimenting with tacking on an hour or more to the school day.
Elementary and middle school students at Fletcher-Maynard Academy in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have gone to an eight-hour school day. Fletcher-Maynard Academy is just one of 10 schools in Massachusetts trying out the new schedule. Lawmakers in Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, and Washington, D.C., are also debating extended school hours.
People in favor of longer school days say kids need to learn more to stay competitive in today's world. The additional hours enable teachers to spend more time on each subject. Fletcher-Maynard principal Robin Harris likes having the extra hours. ""Teachers can be a little more creative,"" she told
Students aren't just spending the extra time with their heads in a book, though. Harris explains that her students get longer recesses and more snack time. Parent Dawn Oliver says her 11-year-old daughter, Brittany, is an advice columnist for a magazine at her school in Fall River, Massachusetts. ""The kids get so involved in these things because it's not all book work,"" says Oliver.
Critics argue that extended school days could be too long for today's busy kids. And extra school time might prevent students from exploring other interests. Some students have complained about having to stay later. They are concerned that they wouldn't be able to concentrate during the last classes of the day.
Other people point out that longer school days
with, or get in the way of, after-school sports and clubs. ""The day is long enough already,"" student Cameron Villers from Ansonia, Connecticut, told
""After-school activities would be affected. Nobody wants to be at school from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m."" If schools have different schedules, planning athletic games could prove difficult.

558,"President George W. Bush and Laura Bush have settled into the White House. Even though their daughters, Barbara and Jenna, are at college, the President and First Lady are not alone. They have three pets with them.
Spot Fetcher Bush, one of the dogs, should feel right at home in the White House. She was born there in 1989. Spot's mother was Millie. Millie belonged to Bush's parents, former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara.
The Bushes' other dog, Barney, also has political connections. Christine Todd Whitman, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, gave Barney to the Bush family.

111,"Tsunemi Kubodera stands before a giant squid on Display at National Science Museum in Tokyo.
A team of Japanese scientists snapped the first photographs of one of the deep sea's most mysterious creaturesa giant squid. It was the first time a giant squid was photographed in the wild! The researchers took more than 500 pictures of the sea creature off the coast of the Bonin Islands in Japan.
How did scientists nab pictures of the 26-foot-long sea monster? They tracked down the squid by following the only creatures that feed on itsperm whales. Once they determined where the whales dined, the scientists attached a robotic camera to a fishing line with bait. Then they took pictures of the purplish-red squid attacking its prey nearly 3,000 feet beneath the ocean's surface. The squid became caught on the camera but eventually swam away after one of its tentacles broke off.

462,"Where does famous TV puppet Howdy Doody belong? That was the question that a court in Hartford, Connecticut, had to answer. The court recently decided that Howdy belongs to a museum in Detroit, Michigan.
, the first children's TV show seen across the country. The show was aired between 1947 and 1960. It featured host Buffalo Bob and his sidekick puppet, Howdy Doody.
When watching the show, kids saw Howdy on their TV screens, but they never saw the man who controlled the puppet--Rufus Rose. When the show ended, Rose kept Howdy. After Rose died, his children held on to Howdy.
However, officials at the Detroit Institute of Arts said that Rose had promised to donate the puppet to the museum. Rose's family didn't want to give up the puppet, and the two sides asked a court to decide Howdy's fate.

The music industry is causing hundreds of people to sing the blues. One of those people is 12-year-old Brianna LaHara from New York City. Brianna liked to download TV theme songs and music by Mariah Carey from the Internet onto her computer.
However, record companies said that by sharing music files online, Brianna was stealing. As a result, she was one of 261 people sued by the Recording Industry Association of America in early September. Brianna was targeted because she had swapped more than 1,000 songs online.
Approximately 60 million people download music files from the Internet. In most cases, that is against the law. The music industry has compared it with shoplifting, saying most people wouldn't steal CDs from a store.
There are laws that exist to protect the rights of musicians. The laws say it is illegal to copy songs without permission from musicians and record companies.
During the past three years, CD sales have fallen. The recording industry says it loses billions of dollars each year when people
, or steal, songs. The music industry is hoping the lawsuits will scare people away from swapping songs online.
The lawsuits have left many people stunned. Some are concerned that innocent people might be wrongly accused when their children or grandchildren download music. One 71-year-old grandfather from Texas is being sued. He didn't know that his grandchildren had copied music onto his computer.
Some people have said they didn't know they were breaking the law. Others think the record companies are bullies picking on ordinary people.
Brianna's mother didn't take any chances. Agreeing to pay $2,000, she became the first of the 261 people to settle the lawsuit and to avoid having to go to court. ""I am sorry for what I have done,"" said Brianna. ""I love music and don't want to hurt the artists I love.""

45% - all right, with a few friends
Many people don't like paying high prices for music CDs. They say they like to get their music online because it's easy-and it's free.
During the past three years, music sales have suffered a huge loss. Record industry officials blame the drop on the increasing number of people who get their songs free on the Internet.
To draw music fans back into stores, the world's largest record company announced a few weeks ago that it would lower its CD prices. Universal Music Group said its CDs would sell in stores for about $12.98 instead of the current prices ranging from $16.98 to $18.98.
For people who still want to get their music online, they can do it without breaking the law. Some music-sharing services on the Web work in a similar way to record stores. The services charge a small fee for each song that is copied.
Do you think fear of being punished will stop people from swapping music online? Why or why not?

208,"""If I had one wish, it would be to bring peace to Earth and comfort to all the families who lost friends and loved ones [in the terrorist attacks],"" fourth grader Brandon wrote in an e-mail to
Brandon and millions of other kids have come together to help the victims of the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. Those kids have been offering comfort to one another; collecting clothes, food, water, and other supplies to send to rescue workers; and raising money to help the victims' families.
As kids have reached out to help others, they've learned about what their country stands for. English teacher Nan Bartow of New Haven, Connecticut, has been teaching for more than 30 years. She said, ""Kids are more patriotic than ever before.""
Many other teachers agree with Bartow. ""The students are saying, 'We are proud to be Americans' and that they appreciate everything they have,"" said Cynthia Elwood, a principal in Arlington, Texas.
Kids have shown their appreciation by sharing what they have. Here are some of the things they have done:
In Georgia, Parker Pratt, age 10, and Mac Conway, age 9, opened a lemonade stand and collected about $60 for charity.
Teachers and students at the Academy Hill School in Wilton, Maine, declared Friday, September 21, Red, White, and Blue Day. Everyone at the school wore the colors of the American flag to school that day.
In Stow, Ohio, 7-year-old Alexa came up with an idea that enabled her class to raise $113. ""I saw people who were crying because they didn't have houses or anything and they lost their sisters and brothers,"" she said.
In Oklahoma, kids and their parents collected more than 40,000 teddy bears to give kids in 350 schools in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.
""It is especially hard for children to understand what has happened, but they know how to show love,"" said Sue Hale, who helped coordinate the donations. Many kids wrote and attached special notes to the bears they donated. They said the bears and notes would help give thousands of kids hope for a bright future.
If you are looking to help the victims and families of the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. you might contact the following organizations. Each of these organizations has a long history of helping disaster victims.
* The American Red Cross can be contacted at 1-800-HELP-NOW.
* The Salvation Army can be contacted at 1-800-SAL-ARMY.
* The United Way has set up the September 11 Fund to help victims and their families. You can learn more about the fund at
You may also have local chapters of these charities in your community. If so, you can call them and invite representatives to talk to your class about what they are doing to help.

625,"Pilot whales are members of the dolphin family.
A happy ending took place off the southern coast of Florida in August. Five pilot whales were released back into the ocean. Pilot whales are members of the dolphin family.
Rescue workers had nursed the whales back to health after the creatures had become stranded in shallow water in April. Their return to the water marked the first time in history that five whales stranded at the same time were returned to the ocean together.
Using a crane, volunteers lowered the whales headfirst into the water. The whales had been fitted with special devices for scientists to track their progress. As the whales swam away, many volunteers cheered. Some were moved to tears.
Later in the day, people in a helicopter spotted the whales swimming together. Rescuers hoped that the five would join a larger group of nearby whales.

107,"Did you ever open a bag of cookies and wonder why they were broken into so many pieces? Scientists now know why. Contrary to popular belief, it has nothing to do with the way the cookies were packaged, loaded on shelves, or transported from the store to your home.
According to scientists in England, cookies pick up moisture as they cool after coming out of the oven. The moisture causes the cookies to expand and contract, which results in cracks. The cracks cause cookies to easily break when they're moved or packaged.

737,"If you have any doubt that reading can help save lives, you haven't read about an amazing fourth grader, Brandon Lecher. On October 3, he saved a classmate from choking to death. And he did this because he had read a story in
Last year in school, Brandon read an article in
about a student who had helped his school's principal.
The student had seen the principal choking during lunch and had used the
to clear the principal's throat. The Heimlich maneuver is a quick and easy way to clear the throat of a person who is choking.
At the time he read the story, Brandon didn't think he would ever need to use the Heimlich maneuver. But what he learned from the article later helped him save a life.
During lunch on October 3, Brandon looked up and saw a classmate, Joseph Dettwiler, choking and frantically pointing to his throat.
""I saw Joseph choking on a potato chip,"" Brandon recently told
. ""His face was turning red and blue, and he was holding his throat.""
Then Brandon remembered reading about the Heimlich maneuver in
. ""It just came to my mind. When my class read about it, it sounded like an interesting subject, so I paid attention,"" Brandon said. ""That's when I did the Heimlich maneuver. I was scared, but I remembered what to do.""
Joseph doesn't remember much about the experience except being frightened and seeing Brandon jump out of his seat. ""I was really scared,"" Joseph said, but ""Brandon got up and saved my life.""
What did Joseph learn from the experience? ""I learned that you should chew your food slowly and that you should also learn about the Heimlich maneuver. You might have to use it on somebody.""
Stand behind the choking victim and wrap your arms around his or her waist.
Make a fist and hold it against the victim's stomach, about halfway between the belly button and the rib cage.

. On April 14, 1912, the luxury liner struck an iceberg on its first voyage and sank to the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean. Now the world's most famous shipwreck is rapidly falling apart, say divers.
""I was really quite shocked [by its condition],"" said one ocean scientist who recently visited the wreck. He was surprised to see how much the
wreck had changed since his dive four years earlier. ""It is just deteriorating so much more rapidly than I would have expected.""
are partly to blame for the damage. Rusticles are clusters of brown ""icicles"" made from rust. They form from tiny iron-eating organisms called

Natural causes aren't the only culprits. Tourists, filmmakers, and divers also threaten the wreck.
historians say that divers and filmmakers are contributing to the deterioration of the ship.
departed from Southampton, England, it was hailed as ""unsinkable."" The ship was traveling to New York. More than 1,500 people sank to their graves 2 miles below the ocean's surface on that fateful April night.
In 1985, ocean explorer Robert Ballard and his team discovered the wreck. They found it in two pieces about 350 miles off the coast of Newfoundland. The team was amazed at how well the ship had withstood the test of time. In fact, they believed it would remain in good condition for years to come.
But that's no longer the case. Since its discovery, the
wreck has drawn filmmakers, scientists, and even tourists. During the past 18 years, divers have recovered objects-from shoes to dinnerware to life preservers-from the wreck. Thieves have also stolen items.
Some tourists pay thousands of dollars to visit the
. They have left plastic flowers and memorial plaques behind. In 2001, a couple was married in a small submarine next to the wreck.
Each time a mini sub visits the site, further damage occurs. The propellers swirl around the rusticles and stir up the sandy bottom. ""Visitors do more damage than anybody else,"" said the president of the
In recent years, the mast, boat deck, and officer cabins have all collapsed. So has the crow's-nest where a lookout once warned, ""Iceberg right ahead!""
Ocean experts fear that the rest of the ship could fall apart within the next 50 years. Government officials in the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and France are exploring ways to save the wreck.
Historians continue to debate whether people should be allowed to visit the shipwreck. Some think it should be left as a memorial to those who sank with the ship.
Marine explorer Robert Ballard found the Titanic wreck 18 years ago. He told Weekly Reader that he had mixed feelings about the discovery. Although he felt both pride and joy, he also remembered that the site is a graveyard. ""I couldn't help but think about the [more than 1,500] lost souls who died,"" he said.
Do you think it's important to preserve the Titanic? Why or why not?
Ballard believes the wreck should be left alone. ""The site is a memorial, and it is better to bring people there through advanced technology rather than ravage the site through salvage,"" he said.

548,"Brazil protects part of the Amazon rain forest.
Jaguars and anteaters in northern South America can rest easy. A section of the Amazon rain forest as big as Illinois was recently placed under government protection. The land in Brazil links to protected areas in other South American countries, including Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana.
In total, these protected forests cover nearly 58,000 square miles. The land also contains more than 25 percent of the world's
A tropical rain forest is a dense forest in a warm region that gets at least 100 inches of rainfall a year.
Environmentalists from the group Conservation International say this area of the northern Amazon has more
than all tropical forests on the planet. Biodiversity is the variety of plants and animals in an environment. The Amazon is home to more
or types, of plants and animals than any other place in the world.
Since 1970, more than 232,000 square miles of the Amazon rain forest have been destroyed. That is nearly the size of Texas! The destruction has endangered many animal species. Experts predict that the continued
or clearing of trees, at this rate would endanger the entire region by 2050.
Officials were especially concerned about preserving the forests. Part of the area is believed to contain more than half of all bird, animal, and plant species found in the Amazon. Many endangered animals, including the giant Amazon otter, make their homes there. Under the government's plan, those parts of the Amazon will be off-limits to the public.
""If any tropical rain forest on Earth remains intact a century from now, it will be this portion of [the northern Amazon],"" says Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International.
The Amazon rain forest is the world's largest tropical rain forest. It covers about 2 million square milesroughly two-thirds the size of the United States. The map shows the location of the Amazon rain forest and its newly protected areas.

592,"Look out for your lunchboxes! Yogi Bear is at it again. In the new movie
or thief, tries to prevent Jellystone Park from closing down. Dan Aykroyd steals the scene as the voice of Yogi.
student reporter Jeffrey Burrell recently got the scoop about the film, which hits theaters December 17.
Yogi Bear and Boo Boo are ready to grab some lunch!
Jeffrey Burrell: What do you like about playing Yogi?
[Hes] such a great character. ... And what I love about [the movie] is that ... all kids can see [it]. Its a film that families can go to together.
I [like] the scene where Yogi [has] decided not to steal picnic baskets anymore. ... Its kind of funny and sad at the same time.
JB: What advice do you have for kids who want to act?

292,"Have you ever listened to the sounds that paper makes? To composer Tan Dun, paper is music. He invented instruments made of paper and wrote music to play on them.
This October, a group of fifth graders were among the first to hear musicians perform Dun's piece. The big event was held at the newly opened Walt Disney Concert Hall in California.
Dun wrote the musical piece to celebrate the art of making paper. About 2,000 years ago, the world's first fine paper was invented in China. China is the country in Asia where Dun was born.
""Using your imagination, you can find music around you, even in paper! Music is everywhere if you just look for it,"" Dun told

449,"In 1914, a group of explorers, led by Sir Ernest Shackleton, wanted to cross Antarctica. However, after two months of sailing, they never even made it to Antarctica's shore.
Their ship became trapped in floating ice blocks for nine months. Later, when their ship,
was crushed by the closing ice, Shackleton and 28 men were forced to camp on the ice.
After camping on the ice for five months, Shackleton and five men sailed 800 miles in a tiny lifeboat to get help. The remaining crew was later rescued. Amazingly, all 29 men on the
survived being stranded for 17 months on Antarctica's ice.

93,"Snails may be slow, but they are helping speed up science. People are studying the way the animals protect their eggs. Some sea snails keep their eggs in a string of pouches. It is called a mermaids necklace (right).
The necklace is made of a material that is stretchy like a rubber band. You can pull it multiple times and it wont break, scientist Ali Miserez told
A rubber band snaps back into place. But the necklace gently returns to its original shape. That protects the eggs inside.
Scientists are trying to make such a material. It could be used to

171,"Millions of Americans struggle to find work.
Do you know anyone who is out of work? Chances are you do. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs over the past few years.
or out of work. Experts say there is one position available for every four people who are looking for work.
Even children are affected by the job troubles. More than 7.7 million kids in the United States had at least one unemployed parent last year. Some families struggle to pay for food and electricity.
People wait in line at a job fair in New York.
Many people are jobless because of the U.S.
That is the system of making, selling, and buying products. In a slow economy, people do not buy as many goods. Businesses dont make as much money, so they stop hiring people and cut jobs.
The nations leaders want to help people find work. U.S. President Barack Obama recently created a plan. It is called the American Jobs Act. The purpose ... is simple: to put more people back to work, he says.
The act would give $477 billion to businesses, state and local governments, and individuals, Obama says. It would create jobs by paying money to fix roads. State officials would also get cash to pay teachers and police officers.
Not everyone thinks the plan is a good idea. Spending more government money isnt the
or answer, some lawmakers say. They say the country already owes too much money.
Lawmakers are considering the plan now. Americans are watching to see what happens. They are hoping for a happy endingthose two magic words: Youre hired!
This graph shows how the percentage of U.S. workers without jobs has changed over the past two years. When was unemployment the highest? When was it the lowest?

521,"Valentine's Day and the U.S. Postal Service have more in common than you'd think. Each year, the Postal Service issues a new ""love"" stamp for Valentine's Day.This year, the Postal Service is selling candy stamps. Although you can't eat the stamp, it is sweet looking. The stamp shows a picture of two candy hearts with a message that says ""I love you.""The NECCO candy company has been making the popular candy hearts since the 1800s.

342,"What's green, wears a crown, and is a symbol of freedom? The Statue of Liberty! Over the years, millions of people have visited this statue in New York City. However, it has been closed since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Visitors have not been allowed to climb the 354 steps to the crown.
Experts say that it might be difficult for people to make their way down from the statue's crown in an emergency. The group that cares for Lady Liberty is raising money to make the statue safer so it can reopen. Officials have not said whether people will be allowed to climb above the
, or base, of the statue again.
For third grader Nina Wade that would be very sad news. She moved to New York City almost two years ago and has never climbed the statue's steps. ""I would be disappointed if it didn't reopen,"" Nina told Weekly Reader, ""but it makes me feel good to know that [officials are] taking safety measures.""

362,"Do you ever wonder what cars will be like in the future? You can bet that they will be much different from the cars of today. They will also be better for the Earth.
President Bush is excited about cars of the future. In a recent speech, he told Americans he wants our country to lead the world in building cars that do not pollute the environment.

74,"This year, no one has been able to catch Tiger Woods on the golf course. Woods set a record this year by becoming the fourth golfer in history to win the Grand Slam.
The Grand Slam is the name given to four of golf's most important tournaments: the Masters, the U.S. Open, the British Open, and the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Championship.

516,"Theres a new croc on the block! Researchers recently announced finding an ancient crocodile in South America. They dug up the creatures remains in Colombia.
(ack-your-ON-tih-soo-cuss gwa-hee-RAH-en-siss). The croc lived about 60 million years ago.
The giant crocodile lived in a river. That surprised researchers because other types of ancient crocodiles lived mainly in the ocean.
This drawing shows how the snapper may have looked.
The finding may help explain how some crocodiles
when dinosaurs died off. To survive is to live. One of the ways they [survived] was [by] living in lots of different places, Alex Hastings told
. He wrote a study about the new croc.
Life wasnt a snap for the creature, though. It most likely had to battle with the worlds largest snake for food. It was not an easy life even for a 20-foot crocodile, Hastings says.

376,"Hair, beware! Youre sitting at your desk, when suddenly your head feels itchy. Its under attack from tiny insects that cause big troublehead lice!
Each year, 6 million to 12 million Americans get lice. In fact, that is the number-one reason that kids miss school. Now the National Parent Teacher Association is fighting back against the little pests. The group has started a national program called Keeping Our Kids Lice Free.
Lice can spread very quickly from one person to another. The bugs cant jump or fly, but they can crawl. Follow these tips from health experts to keep lice from bugging you:
Avoid touching your head to someone elses head.
Dont share personal items such as hats, combs, and headphones.
Use your own sleeping bag and pillow on sleepovers.

742,"It has been a not-so-great pumpkin season across the United States. High temperatures and lack of rain have decreased farmers' pumpkin crops.
Tennessee is one of the top pumpkin-producing states. The temperature there often reached more than 100 degrees during the summer. The dry, hot weather also damaged pumpkin patches in other states including Maryland and Kentucky.
Pumpkin plants must produce flowers, or blooms, so pumpkins can grow. ""The lack of rainfall makes it hard for plants such as pumpkins to produce blooms,"" George Killgore of the University of Tennessee told
There is no need to cancel your Halloween plans, though. Some states will
pumpkins from other states. To import means to bring in from other places.
After all, the Great Pumpkin never lets us down. Just ask Linus!

183,"Experts rush to keep historic Venice afloat.
For many, Venice is the jewel of Italy. It is famous for its beautiful buildings, art, and
The canals, or waterways, take the place of roads. People travel through the city on boats. But this city, which attracts millions of tourists each year, is in danger of sinking.
Venice is located on the Adriatic Sea. The city was built on a series of small islands in a
A lagoon is an area of shallow water.
During some high tides, water floods the city. For hundreds of years, people have tried to keep water out of the city. Now a group of scientists has introduced a bold plan to prevent the city from flooding. And it means adding more water!
In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads.
Scientists say Venice is sinking about 1 1/2 inches each year. To save the city, scientists want to pump water into the ground through pipes. The team expects the water to expand the sand under Venice and raise the city.
Scientists behind the plan say the pipes will work. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnt done carefully.
Everyone, however, agrees that saving the city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose a tremendous part of [history],"" says Melissa Conn of Save Venice, a group that is working to save the city.
Venice is known as the City of Canals.
There are about 150 canals in Venice.
About 400 bridges connect the citys 118 islands.

454,"Ten-year-old Hunter York found a most unusual creature in his father's backyard. It was a snake with two heads! It ""kind of freaked me out a bit,"" said Hunter.
Hunter ran into the house to tell his father about the 8-inch
. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. Not all reptiles crawl on their bellies the way snakes do. Turtles and lizards are reptiles that creep on short legs.
Hunter's dad gave the two-headed reptile to a snake expert because they could not get it to eat. ""We couldn't force-feed it because we don't know which head eats,"" said his dad.

411,"Nine giant panda cubs are born in China.
Giant pandas feast on bamboo at the Beijing Zoo in China. These animals, including the newborn panda (inset), live in captivity.
China is hosting a panda party! Nine giant panda bears were recently born in the Asian country. Most of them are pairs of twins. The cubs were born in
. That means they live in places controlled by humans rather than in the wild. These pandas live in special centers where animal experts care for them.
[The centers] provide a safe place for animals to ... raise their young, scientist Sarah Bexell told
Thats a good thing, because giant pandas need all the help they can get. The animals are
, or at risk of dying out completely. Only about 1,600 giant pandas live in the wild.
Pandas favorite food is bamboo, but they have trouble finding enough of it to eat. Almost all of the bamboo in their habitat, or home, has died off. The bamboo has died in part because people have built cities where pandas live.
People created the panda centers to help keep the giant pandas safe. One of the most famous centers is the Wolong Nature Reserve. It is in southwest China. More than 100 giant pandas have been born there since it opened in 1980.
The goal is for the young pandas to be able to live safely in the wild one day. Until then, some of the animals will continue to live in captivity. Scientists in China hope to raise more giant pandas within the next few years.
The future of captive giant pandas is [very] bright, Bexell says.
Chinas giant panda cubs arent the only baby animals making the news. Read to learn about other

lets people talk without speaking aloud. It is made up of hand movements that have meanings.
A few months ago, the 33-year-old gorilla used sign language to tell her teacher that she had a toothache. A team of doctors came to the rescue. The doctors removed the tooth that was causing Koko's pain and gave her a full checkup. They said that she was in good health.

The News & Observer, Robert Willett/AP Images
Crews bring up a 3,000-pound anchor from the shipwreck.
His name was Edward Teach. People called him Blackbeard. He was a cruel pirate captain with a long black beard. He robbed and hurt people along the eastern coast of North America until 1718. That year, his ship crashed. It sank near North Carolina. Blackbeard got away. He was killed soon after.

Those are goods. Pirates take billions of dollars worth of goods each year.

659,"Penguins waddle down a snow-covered hill. They dive into the cold waters off the Antarctic Peninsula. The peninsula is on the continent of Antarctica. That area is very cold.
Penguins called Adlies (ah-DEH-lees) are hunting for
. Krill are tiny, shrimplike animals. This year, there is less krill for the penguins to eat. Scientists say that is because very little winter sea ice formed this year. The ice holds the tiny food the krill eat.
Several million Adlie penguins once lived on the Antarctic Peninsula. By the late 1980s, their numbers decreased by half, scientist Wayne Trivelpiece told
Ice in that area once formed every winter and melted away in the summer. Trivelpiece said that recently winter ice has been ""forming only once every five to six years.""
Many scientists say the disappearing ice is caused by
. That is the slow increase in temperature around the world.
Most scientists say people are partly to blame for global warming. When people drive cars and use electricity, they burn
, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived long ago. The burning of fossil fuels gives off gases that add to the overheating of Earth.
""Our research teaches a lesson,"" said Trivelpiece. ""Even a small change in the environment can have a big effect.""
The burning of fossil fuels gives off carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide and other gases around Earth trap heat from the sun. That can cause a rise in temperature around the world. That rise is known as global warming.
How might people reduce their need for fossil fuels?

49,"Talk about a birds-eye view! Scientists recently built a tiny spy plane shaped like a hummingbird.
The winged wonder can travel at speeds of up to 11 miles per hour. It can fly up and down, forward and backward, and sideways. The flying machine also has a built-in camera that records images and sound.
The U.S. military plans to use the little flying tool to spy on enemies. The lifelike bird can fly
into enemy areas. Something that is undetected is not noticed. Firefighters may also use the remote-controlled aircraft to help find missing people in emergencies. It could fly into tight spaces, Matt Keennon told
Scientists are excited to see their new creation put into action. The aircraft could ... become a useful tool, says Keennon. [It could] save lives.

31,"Chew on this! In his new movie, Dwayne Johnson plays a tooth fairy.
student reporter Isabella Pea talked with Johnson about
What will it be like to watch yourself as the tooth fairy?
Ive already seen the movie, and its awesome. Never in my wildest dreams ... did I ever think I would be flying around in a powder blue outfit with fairy wings.
What was one of the most challenging scenes?
In the movie, I take this shrinking paste. ... Everything on the movie set was 100 feet high [to make] me look like I was 6 inches [tall]. ... I had to ... climb up onto the bed and get underneath a big pillow and take out a tooth.
What advice would you give a young actor?

253,"You might think twice the next time you spot a fly on the wall! The U.S. Air Force plans to design flying robots that look like insects. The buggy robots could spy on enemies in other countries. They could also take part in missions that are too dangerous for humans.
The U.S. military will use bug robots to watch bad guys.
The flying machines could be as small as bumblebees, say military experts. They would also have wings that move up and down, just like real winged bugs. The bug-like robots may be able to fly
into buildings. Something that is undetected is not noticed.
If we know theres a possibility of bad guys in a certain building, how do we find out? asks project researcher Greg Parker. We think this would [help us figure that out].
The robots could also help U.S. soldiers by taking photographs and recording enemies voices. They could even fire tiny weapons! Builders hope the robots take flight by 2030.

444,"The Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. had a dream. His dream was that all Americans would be treated fairly and equally. King worked to show that people of all backgrounds can live peacefully in the same community. Now a memorial will be built to honor King's dream.
On January 15, people all over the country will celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day. It is a day for people to celebrate his life. It is also a day for people to remember how Martin Luther King Jr. worked to make sure laws protect the rights of all Americans.
is going to be built in Washington, D.C., to honor King. A memorial is a special statue or place that honors a person or an event. King's memorial will sit on 4 acres of land. That's about the same size as three football fields.
This is a map of a section of Washington, D.C. Located in this area are several sites honoring important Americans.
Workers will probably start building the memorial this year. It will be built between the memorials to President Abraham Lincoln and President Thomas Jefferson. They plan to finish the memorial by 2003.
'I Have a Dream . . .'
A special event in American history took place near where the new memorial will be built. On August 28, 1963, King gave a speech before about 250,000 people. King and the people were in Washington, D.C., to speak out for freedom and better laws to protect all Americans. That speech is known as the ""I Have a Dream"" speech.
In the speech, King spoke about his dream of the United States becoming a country where people of all races could ""walk together as sisters and brothers.""
Martin Luther King Jr. is remembered for being a powerful speaker and a leader for peace. He taught others that problems can be solved peacefully, rather than through fighting and violence.

505,"The 2010 census is on its way to your mailbox.
How high can you count? U.S. officials are about to count to more than 300 million!
is ready to go. A census is an official count of every person who lives in a country. The United States polls its population every 10 years.
or running, a census isnt as easy as 1-2-3. In a few weeks, every household will receive a survey. The survey asks about peoples ages, races, and living situations. People must mail the form back to the government by April 1. Thousands of census workers will go door-to-door to make sure everyone takes part.
Once the forms are in, workers will crunch the numbers. Adding up the results will take monthseven with special machines that can sort thousands of surveys an hour. The data has to be finished by December 31. On that day, census workers will
the results to U.S. President Barack Obama. To deliver is to bring.
Workers pass out census information in Minnesota.
The numbers could add up to big changes. They could affect the U.S. House of Representatives. A states representation in the House is based on population. If a states population has changed, the number of representatives that state has may change too. The data could also affect how much money states, towns, and schools get from the government.
Thats why officials want to count all U.S. residents, says Robert Groves. He is in charge of the census. The most important thing is [to] fill it out and mail it back because that makes the census a great success, he told
So check the mail. The census surveys will be on their way soonyou can count on it!
In 1790, Congress made a new lawthe U.S. population had to be counted, and fast! Workers visited every house in the country. They counted about 3.9 million people. That number didnt wow President George Washington. He expected more people!
Washington would probably be happier with todays totals. Heres a look at the first and most recent censuses.
Is it important to know how many people live in the United States? Why?

596,"The Galpagos Islands are a group of islands located in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of South America. The islands are home to some of the world's
or most unusual, animals and plants. In January, those islands had a brush with disaster.
On January 16, a ship carrying oil got stuck on a
is a chain of rocks or coral near the surface of the water.) The islands are located in the Pacific Ocean about 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador. Scientists say the oil spill put many of the islands' animals in danger.
The oil spill happened near San Cristbal and Santa Fe islands, in the eastern area of the Galpagos. Cleanup workers said the oil killed two pelicans and dirtied 40 others. Workers said some sea lions, birds, and tortoises also needed to be cleaned.
Oil can make animals sick if they swallow it. When oil covers an animal's fur or feathers, it can't swim, fly, or stay warm. If the oil is not cleaned off the animal, it could die.
The oil spill also harmed life in the water. Many sea plants, such as algae (AL-jee), were also damaged by the oil spill. Sea plants are an important food source for many Galpagos animals.
Days after the accident, however, the islands were spared further damage. Ocean currents took the oil out to sea, away from the islands.
What could be done to prevent such oil spills?

340,"New NASA projects get ready to take flight.
Get ready for a birthday party thats out of this world. NASA turns 50 on October 1! The U.S. space agency has a lot to celebrate. NASA was
, or started, in 1958. Since then, the agency has
, or sent, more than 250 astronauts into space. The agency has also created robot spacecraft to explore
, or faraway, planets. There are even U.S. astronauts living and working in space on the International Space Station.
NASA officials have big plans for the next 50 years too. They plan to send humans back to the moon by 2020. U.S. astronauts first visited the moon in 1969. They stayed less than a day. This time, astronauts will live on the moon for up to six months.
NASA is designing a new spacecraft to carry the astronauts to the moon. Scientists are also redesigning the space suit. They say astronauts will need lighter suits for exploring.
Scientists hope that the moon mission will lead to an even bigger trip. NASA wants to send astronauts to Mars! The space agency has sent robot spacecraft called
to explore the Red Planet. NASA will send a new rover to Mars next fall.
Scientists want to determine whether Mars could have supported life at one time. They hope astronauts will one day be able to answer that question themselves.
Were trying to [go to Mars] as early as 2035, Jeff Hanley of NASA told
. Maybe someday in the far, far future [humans will reach] the stars.
NASAs history is a blast from the past! Read the time line to learn some important firsts in U.S. space travel and exploration.
U.S. astronaut Alan Shepard is the first American in space.
Americans become the first people to walk on the moon.
The International Space Station is under construction. It should be finished by 2010.

yesterday? the day before? If so, you may be in need of a TV time-out!
Kids are watching more TV than they watched before, researchers say. A new study found that children spend more than 28 hours per week in front of a TV. That includes time spent playing video games.
Kids ages 6 to 11 in the United States watch more than three hours of TV each day. Ten years ago, children watched only about two hours and 40 minutes of TV each day. That means kids today watch almost five hours more TV each week.
Why the increase? Experts say more TV programs today are
, or aimed, at kids. There is more ... than ever before, Patricia McDonough told

The first TVs went on sale in the United States in 1938. Read the time line to learn about some other important events in TV history.

83,"Taking those first baby steps is very excitingespecially for a robot. For years, scientists have worked to create a robot that could walk in a humanlike way. That time has finally arrived!
This February, scientists unveiled three robots that can walk like humans. The robots swing their arms for balance, as people do. The new robots require far less power than earlier versions did.
Toddler is the most advanced of the three. It learns to walk like a
, or a young child. Its balance improves with each step.

779,"Each year, 17 million people try to stop smoking. However, only 1 million quit. That's why the American Cancer Society has organized The Great American Smokeout and SmokeScream.
Mark next Thursday, November 16, on your calendars and get ready to scream. That is the day of the SmokeScream. It is a day when kids across the country can scream about the dangers of smoking.
November 16 is also the day of the Great American Smokeout. The goal of the Smokeout is to get people to stop smoking for the day--and maybe forever.
The SmokeScream and the Great American Smokeout is run by the American Cancer Society. The group helps fight
by teaching people about the illness and raising money for medical research. Cancer is an illness that can cause death. Doctors say that smoking can cause cancer and other illnesses that can kill.
The lungs are parts of the body that allow a person to breathe. There is no cure for lung cancer.

267,"There will soon be a place in Washington, D.C., fit for a King. U.S. officials recently gave the OK for construction to begin on the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial (right). The statue will be built on the National Mall.
King (19291968) was born in Georgia. At that time, people in the southern United States were separated by race. Under the law, black people could not attend the same schools as white people. They also had to use separate public restrooms.
King worked to change the rules in the South. He led peaceful marches and gave speeches. In 1963, King gave his famous I Have a Dream speech. Thanks to King and some other leaders, Congress passed
. Those laws make sure that all Americans have equal rights.
Martin Luther King Jr. gives an important speech in Washington, D.C., in 1963.
Officials hope to complete the King memorial in 2011. Christine King Farris is Kings sister. She says the memorial is important because it will remind people of the good work her brother did.

143,"Scientists are teaching whooping cranes to fly south.
Dressed in a white costume, scientist Joe Duff pretends to be a whooping crane. He may look silly, but he has an important job to do. Duff is training a flock of whooping crane chicks in Wisconsin to think he is their mother. ""It's like becoming a bird yourself,"" he told
Joe Duff is the team leader of a group called Operation Migration. Members have been teaching ""whoopers"" to
to Florida since 2001. When animals migrate, they move from one place to another.
Operation Migration workers train the young whoopers to follow very light aircraft called
. Each aircraft is flown by a pilot in a whooping crane costume. In six months, the birds will be ready to follow the aircraft and migrate to Florida for the winter.
The whooping crane is an endangered bird. Only one flock of whooping cranes lives naturally in the wild. Those birds migrate between Canada and Texas. Scientists decided that having more than one flock would keep these birds from dying out.
Whooping cranes trained by Operation Migration in the past have remembered the route. They return to Wisconsin each spring and fly back to Florida in the fall.
""We want our birds to pay attention to us for the first year, until we get them down to Florida,"" said Duff. ""After that, we hope they communicate with wild birds and become wild birds themselves.""
In October, pilots will lead the new flock of whoopers south for the winter. The migration route will take them over seven states: Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and finally Florida.
Joe Duff spends a lot of time pretending to be a whooping crane. If you could be any animal, what would you be? Why?

709,"Scientists kick Pluto out of the planet family.
By now, you know you can ignore that section on Pluto in your science books. A group of the worlds
recently decided that Pluto is no longer an official planet. An astronomer is a scientist who studies space.

launched in January. It is expected to fly by Pluto in 2015. Astronomers say it will give humans a first look at Pluto and other objects in the
The Kuiper belt is a band of objects in the outer area of our solar system.
Astronomers have long known that Pluto was different from the other eight planets. Pluto had an odd
or path, around the sun. It was also the smallest and coldest of the group.
At their meeting, the astronomers agreed on a new definition for a planet. A planet must be nearly round and must circle the sun. Its orbit should not cross the orbit of another planet. Plutos orbit crosses Neptunes. Now there are only eight ""classical"" planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
Pluto still has a place in space, though. It is one of a new group of smaller objects called
The two other members are Ceres (SIHR-eez), the largest asteroid, and a space object nicknamed ""Xena."" As many as 12 dwarf planets are expected to be announced in the coming months. The list will keep growing as new objects are discovered.
""These dwarf planets are popping up everywhere,"" astronomer Alan Stern told
Pluto was discovered in 1930, long after the other planets had been found. It was discovered by the American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh (1906-1997) using a telescope in Flagstaff, Arizona. He didnt name Pluto, though. An 11-year-old British girl named Venetia Burney did. She thought the new planet should be called Pluto, after the Roman god of the underworld.

384,"You can say that Mario Lemieux, of the Pittsburgh Penguins, owns the ice in two ways. First, he is one of the greatest hockey players to ever play the game. But he is also the only player in history to play for a team he also owns.
In his first game in three years, Mario Lemieux (le-MEW) reminded hockey fans why he is called ""Super Mario."" He scored a goal and led his team to victory.
Lemieux retired in 1997 at age 31. People usually
or stop working, when they reach age 65 or older, or because of serious illness or injury. Some people retire when they have earned enough money to live on for the rest of their lives. Lemieux came out of his retirement last December.
Since 1991, injuries and illnesses forced Lemieux to quit playing three other times. But each time he returned to play, he came back stronger and faster.
In 1991 and 1992, Lemieux led his team to two Stanley Cups. The Stanley Cup is the trophy given to the National Hockey League's championship team.
In 1999, Lemieux bought the Pittsburgh Penguins team. He is the only athlete in sports history to both own and play for a professional sports team.

137,"This is my pet parakeet, Polly. We live in Polling Place. Polly is a smart bird. In fact, she's so smart, she can count very high numbers. This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Keep reading to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's As Easy As One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart (below).
So what's the result? Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

179,"Scientists fear that monarchs may become endangered.
Catching monarch butterflies is no easy task. ""You have to sneak up behind them and then slip your net on them,"" said 8-year-old Evan Shauer from Wisconsin.
Before freeing the butterflies, Evan had a job to do. He placed a tiny numbered sticker on each monarch. Those black-and-orange butterflies were among thousands that kids across the country tagged.
Monarch butterflies do something very unusual for an insect: They
, or travel to a new location when the season changes. Each fall, millions of monarchs from North America head south. Most fly more than 2,000 miles to forests in Mexico.
Volunteers in Mexico look for the monarchs wearing tags. The tags help scientists figure out which butterflies reached Mexico and how far they flew.
, or at risk of dying out. People are cutting down trees in Mexico where the butterflies spend the winter.
""Our goal is to save the monarch migration,"" said butterfly expert Chip Taylor. ""To do this, we have to learn as much as we can about how the number of monarchs changes from year to year."" Kids like Evan are helping scientists do just that!

210,"Superman may not be the only speedster faster than a speeding bullet. A team of
, or designers, in England is building the worlds fastest car. England is a country in Europe.
The Bloodhound SSC will travel at more than 1,000 miles per hour (mph). Most automobiles reach top speeds of about 120 mph. Engineers hope that the Bloodhound will zoom into the record books. They also hope the car will get kids excited to learn about science.
How will the Bloodhound be so speedy? The vehicle will be powered by a rocket and a jet engine.
Engineers hope to finish the car by 2011. Then driver Andy Green will get behind the Bloodhounds wheel and try to set the new speed record. He set the current record in 1997, when he drove another vehicle at 763 mph.

525,"Should peanut butter be kicked out of school?
When Sam Roffwarg was 18 months old, someone on an airplane gave him a snack pack of peanuts. Sam ate a few of the nuts. Suddenly, he was throwing up and gasping for air because he couldnt breathe.
It turned out that Sam, now 8, has a peanut
. An allergy is a bad reaction to something. Today, the third grader from Jackson, Miss., is careful about what he eats. I always read the ingredients, Sam told
Staying away from peanuts is hard when Sam goes to school, though. When other kids eat peanut butter, Sam has to be sure not to sit near them. Just touching a peanut could make him sick. A
, or strong, allergic reaction could be life threatening.
To protect kids, some schools are limiting or banning peanuts. A survey of about 1,200 school districts found that 18 percent of schools had some type of peanut ban in 2007.
Some officials say the bans are needed to protect kids with allergies. About 400,000 school-age children have peanut allergies, and experts say that number is growing.
Still, most kids are not allergic to peanuts. Some people say banning peanuts is not fair. Plus, they say, keeping track of what every kid eats is impossible. You just cant monitor whats in every persons lunch pail, says Janet Mitchell, a school district representative in Georgia.
Food is not the only thing that can cause allergic reactions. Here is a
, or close-up, look at some other
, or things that may set off allergies.
Tiny dust mites live in the dust found on furniture and in carpets. They are invisible to the naked eye, but they cause asthma and breathing problems for some people.
This allergen is often found in moist, damp areas, such as basements and bathrooms. Mold gives off a type of
, or germ, that can trigger allergy symptoms.
Plants create pollen. It is carried through the air by wind and travels into peoples noses. That can cause people allergic to pollen to sneeze and their eyes to tear.

307,"Last June, photographs taken of Mars by the
spacecraft showed ditches on Mars. Scientists believe the ditches could have been made by flowing water.
Scientists think the ditches were made when water seeped from underground. There is no water on the surface now. Scientists say it probably froze or turned to a mist. No one is sure when the ditches were created. They could be as old as a million years or as young as one week.

Although coral may look like a plant, it is actually made up of tiny sea animals called polyps.
Live from Australia, its the Great Barrier Reef! Scientists are using special
known as digital skins, to monitor changes in this underwater treasure.
The sensors are devices that record changes in the ocean and send up-to-the-minute information to computers. Until now, scientists were able to monitor changes only after they had occurred. Scientists hope the new information will help them learn how to better care for coral reefs.
Coral reefs around the world are in trouble. Fishing nets and ships break off sections of the reefs and damage them. Natural disasters and pollution are also doing harm. At the same time, warmer sea temperatures cause the
Although coral may look like a plant, it is actually made up of tiny sea animals called
As polyps die, they leave behind hard shells. Other polyps grow on top of the shells. Over many years, the polyps form coral reefs.
Coral reefs play a very important role in ocean life. They supply food and shelter to thousands of different types of ocean creatures living in and around the reefs. People also depend on coral reefs for jobs, food, and medicine to treat diseases.
""Coral reefs are incredibly threatened,"" Rick MacPherson of Californias Coral Reef Alliance told
""They require, now more than ever, that people pay attention and work toward protecting them.""
The Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef in the world. It stretches 1,250 miles along the northeast coast of Australia.
What might happen if coral reefs continue to be damaged?

232,"Animals get a new home at the National Zoo.
You don't have to travel to Asia to see sloth bears slurp up insects. You can see the shaggy-coated creatures at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The zoo opened a new exhibit, called the Asia Trail, in October.
Sloth bears and six other species, or types, of animals from Asia have new homes at the National Zoo. Those animals face several threats in the wild.
Before the Asia Trail opened, the animals lived in tight spaces. Now they have twice the room. The changes are part of a 10-year plan to update the zoo.
""This is a giant leap forward for the National Zoo,"" says its director, John Berry. ""Our goal is to be the world's finest zoo by 2016.""
Giant panda cub Tai Shan (tie-SHAHN) and his parents are the stars of the show. They help draw huge crowds to the zoo. Three million people are expected to visit this year.
The giant pandas' new home includes more trees for climbing. Pandas like water, so their area has a waterfall and pools. Fog machines help make the exhibit more like their habitat, or natural home, in China.
Visitors now have closer views of the giant pandas and other animals. ""You can see, hear, touch, and even smell the zoo's science,"" says Susan Ades, head of the new design.
The National Zoo is home to 2,000 animals. Along with fishing cats, clouded leopards, sloth bears, and Japanese giant salamanders, the creatures here live on the Asia Trail.
Giant panda cub Tai Shan relaxes while chewing bamboo at the zoo.
Red pandas use their bushy tails to cover their bodies when they're cold.
Is it important for zoos to create homes that are like the animals' natural habitats? Why or why not?

108,"Will see-through frogs clear the way for frog research?
Green is out! Frogs have a new look that has some scientists jumping for joy.
Scientists in Hiroshima, Japan, have produced see-through frogs. Japan is a country in Asia. The pale frogs are the world's first see-through animals with four legs. Frogs are often used for scientific research. Now researchers can view
that are under the see-through frogs' skin. Organs are body parts, such as the heart and lungs.
Scientist Masayuki Sumida says the see-through animals provide new ways to study frogs. He says scientists can observe what happens to a frog's organs if it gets sick. ""You can see through the skin how organs grow...,"" he says. ""You can watch organs of the same frog over its entire life.""
. That means their body temperature depends on their environment. Frogs are also amphibians, which are animals with backbones that spend part of their lives in water and part on land. ""That's one of the things that makes them so interesting to study,""
. A herpetologist is a scientist who studies reptiles and amphibians.
Collins says students also could benefit from studying the see-through frogs. ""Seeing the heart actually pumping and the lungs actually working would be really important to younger students,"" he says. ""It will teach a lot about how the organs work.""
Frogs are one of more than 5,000 amphibian species! Keep reading to learn more about some of the other species.
These colorful frogs have red eyes and blue and yellow stripes. They live in rain forests in Central America.
Toads have stubby bodies with warty skin, and they walk instead of hop. Toads live in most parts of the world.
Salamanders look like lizards. Some have lungs. They live in cool areas in Europe, North America, and Asia.
What can people learn from studying frogs' organs?

173,"Talk about having all the right moves! In
, a tap-dancing penguin named Mumble tries to get his son to enjoy dancing.
Wade Robson lent his fancy footwork to the film, which hits theaters November 18. A choreographer creates the steps in a dance.
student reporter Bella Fletcher recently spoke with the man behind Mumbles moves.
Bella Fletcher: How do you create dances for animated characters?
You actually get to work with human dancers. ... The movements that the humans are doing are [used to create the movements of] the animated characters.
BF: What was the hardest part of making the dances?
There are always hundreds and hundreds of penguins [in a scene], but we only have 15 dancers. ... So I would have to imagine how a scene [would] look with hundreds and hundreds of penguins, but just create it with 15 [people].

27,"Fire Prevention Week is from October 3 to 9. That is a time for kids and their families to learn about fire safety. Here are some tips to stay safe:
Have working smoke alarms in your home. Test them once a month.
Stay away from matches, lighters, and stoves.
Practice a fire escape plan with your family. Choose a place outside where you will meet if your house were to catch fire.
If a fire starts, get out and stay out.
Stop, drop, and roll if your clothes catch fire.

53,"When you smile, people can see your teeth and your gums. Experts say you need healthy teeth and gums. Teeth help you talk and eat. People need to care for their teeth. Turn the page to learn some ways to take care of your teeth.
Brush your teeth after every meal and before you go to bed. Use a soft toothbrush and a pea-sized amount of toothpaste. Brush all parts of your teeth and even your tongue! Brush with short back-and-forth movements.
Floss your teeth once a day. Dental floss is thin thread that helps clean in between your teeth. Use it to get rid of food you might have missed with a toothbrush. Have a grown-up help you floss.
Visit a dentist once or twice a year. The dentist will clean your teeth, take X-rays, and give you fluoride. Fluoride helps keep your teeth strong.

325,"Here are four safety tips you should know.
Smoke alarms save lives. Have an alarm inside and outside each bedroom. Make sure you have a smoke alarm on every level of the home. Push the test button at least once a month. That will let you know whether the alarm is working.
Fire can spread quickly. Every family needs to be prepared. How? Have a home fire escape plan. Draw the plan, and talk about it. The drawing should show two ways out of each room. Those may be doors or windows. Then practice the plan twice a year. Practice during the day and at night.
Choose a safe place outside where everyone will meet. Get out and stay out! Never go back inside a burning building.
Once you are outside, dial 9-1-1 or the number for your fire department.
Why is it important to have a home fire escape plan? How might practicing it help you?

113,"Many people visit Hawaii each year. They admire the coral reefs that surround the islands. But those beautiful reefs have been damaged by people and ships. Recently the United States government made a law to protect the reefs around Hawaii.
is a large strip of hard sea animal skeletons that is close to the ocean's surface. More than half of the United States' coral reefs are located in the waters around Hawaii.
Coral reefs provide homes for sea animals. Reefs also protect coastlines from dangerous, pounding waves. When waves pass over reefs, they slow down and get smaller.
Hawaii's reefs are being hurt. People have polluted the water around the reefs and have taken too many fish.
Before he left office, President Bill Clinton created the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Reserve. A
is an area protected by the government. This reserve is underwater and covers 84 million acres. That is almost as big as the states of Florida and Georgia combined.
Special rules make sure the reef reserve will be protected. People are not allowed to remove coral from the reefs. The number of fish taken from the reserve area cannot go up. Hawaii's reefs are now protected from further damage.
A coral reef is built by tiny sea creatures called coral
Coral polyps have hard outer skeletons that protect them. When the polyps die, their skeletons stay. After a long time, the coral skeletons build up, forming a reef.
More than 2/3 of the world's coral reefs have been damaged by pollution and too much fishing.
Coral can be tan, orange, yellow, purple, or green.

542,"Scientists have identified a new dinosaur. It is the smallest dinosaur yet to be found in North America. The dinosaur was smaller than a house cat.
This drawing shows what the tiny dinosaur may have looked like.
The tiny dinosaur had very sharp claws and teeth. It was a carnivore. Scientists say it most likely hunted insects and small animals.
The dinosaurs fossils were actually found almost 30 years ago. They were put in a drawer for safekeeping. A scientist took the fossils out a few years ago. He decided to study them. That led him to make the discovery.

212,"What will this year's hurricane season bring?
season is here. A hurricane is a storm that forms over warm ocean water. It brings strong winds and heavy rains. The season lasts from June to November.
Experts say the 2007 season will be a busy one. They want to make sure people are prepared.

Hurricanes can damage trees, cars, and buildings. A hurricane's strong winds can also make ocean levels rise. That is called a
It happens when a hurricane travels over water. The strong winds push against the water. The water gets higher and higher. As the hurricane passes over land, the water pushes onto the shore. The rising water can cause flooding.
Hurricane Hunters are ready. They are a part of the U.S. Air Force Reserve. Their job is to fly airplanes into the
of a hurricane! The eye is the calm center.
Inside the storm, the hunters measure the amount of rain and the speed of the wind. Their work helps weather experts predict where the hurricane will go and how strong it will become.
The three pictures show how a hurricane forms.
 First, small storms begin over an ocean.
 Then strong winds make the storms spin around and come together.
 Soon, a hurricane forms. It spins around and around. Sometimes it moves over land and brings heavy rains and strong winds.

471,"Chaille Stovall is making a movie about the 2000 presidential election. His friend Zac Skipp is helping him. Chaille (pronounced shal-ee) is only 11 years old!
is the name of Chaille Stovall's latest movie. The movie is about the 2000 presidential election. For the movie, Chaille talked to the two main candidates. He talked to Texas Governor George W. Bush at the governor's home. Chaille also traveled with Vice President Al Gore on his campaign bus.
Chaille has been making films since he was 8 years old. Chaille's first movie was
. The movie explored what people think about boy ballet dancers. Chaille won two awards for the movie.
Chaille has also made movies about religion, how kids cope with pain, and musicians.
How did you get started making movies?
. Then people at HBO [a cable TV company] saw it, and they said they wanted to show the film.
How do you decide what your movies will be about?
I just take stuff that's a part of everyday issues.
It's mostly about the 2000 election. The movie asks why a kid should care about politics.
What was it like talking to Governor George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore?
Very surprising. George W. Bush said his daughters weren't so happy with him running in the election because they didn't want to leave their school or stay inside all the time. When I first went to speak to Al Gore in New Hampshire, he knelt down in the snow. It was sort of like he understood children. They both seemed like very nice men.

158,"What is life like in the Arctic?
The Arctic is cold and windy. Snow and ice cover the ground for most of the year. The
is near the North Pole. A habitat is a place in nature where a plant or an animal normally lives. Bundle up! Meet some animals that live in the Arctic.
The harp seal lives in the water. It can also be found on the ice. The harp seal has thick fur. That helps it stay warm. The seal also has
under its skin. Blubber is fat that protects an animal from the cold.
A harp seal rests with its pup. A pup is a baby seal.
The arctic fox travels on snow and ice. It has thick, white fur in the winter. The fur acts as
(KA-muh-flahzh). It helps the animal match its surroundings. The fox uses its bushy tail as a warm cover. The fox can curl its tail around its face.
The polar bear spends much of its time on the ice. It hunts for seals through holes in the ice. The polar bear can swim too. A layer of blubber keeps the bear warm. It also has thick, white fur. The fur blends in with the snow. That helps the polar bear sneak up on seals.
Why might it be helpful for an animal to match its surroundings?

256,"Do you have a fire escape plan?
That is the theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week. It lasts from October 7 to 13. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) plans the week to teach kids and their families about fire safety.
The NFPA wants to sound the alarm about the need for a home fire escape plan. They want people across the country to practice their fire escape plans this month. The group is calling the project the Great American Fire Drill.
Only one out of four Americans has planned and practiced a fire escape plan, says the NFPA. ""It's important for everyone in your family to know how to escape in case of a fire,"" says NFPA spokesperson Judy Comoletti.

Nocturnal animals can see clearly in the dark. They often have a good sense of hearing too. Bats, owls, and flying squirrels are nocturnal.
Most bats eat insects. How does a bat find an insect in the dark? The bat makes sounds. The sounds bounce off an insect in the bats path. The sounds return to the bat. That lets the bat know where to find the insect and how big it is.
Flying squirrels live in trees. Can the squirrels really fly? No! They glide in the air. The squirrel leaps up and opens its arms and legs. Folds of skin connect its wrists to its ankles. That skin acts like wings.
Owls have large eyes. How does that help? They can see better at night than most animals. An owls eyes dont move. They always face forward. An owl has to turn its head to see in any other direction. Its head can turn almost all the way around!
How might being nocturnal help animals survive?

356,"Winter is a baby bottlenose dolphin who lost her tail in an accident. Scientists want to help her by giving her a
(prahs-THEE-suss). That is a human-made part to replace a missing body part.
In spite of her injury, Winter behaves like a can-do dolphin. She has learned to swim without her tail, by moving from side to side. If the new tail works, she will be able to move up and down in the water, the way other dolphins swim.

376,"Every penny counts at Frankton Elementary School in Frankton, Indiana. Next month, students will take part in a contest called Jar Wars. Kids will drop money into jars. The grade that raises the most money will win a pizza party.
All the money will be donated to help save tropical rain forests. Why? People are cutting down rain forest trees to make room for farms and roads. Many plants and animals are in danger of dying out.
Last year, the school raised $891. This year, the goal is to raise even more.
Teacher Ken Kakasuleff came up with the idea for Jar Wars 16 years ago. He says, Earth is our home. We feel proud to protect it.

86,"Thanksgiving is about more than the food.
Thanksgiving today is much different from the first celebration of the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag (wahm-pah-NOH-ahg). The Wampanoag were Native Americans who lived in the area where the Pilgrims settled.
In 1621, a harvest feast was celebrated in October.
is food that is grown and gathered. The feast became known as Thanksgiving. Today, Thanksgiving is celebrated in November. Look inside to learn more about the differences between then and now.
A Wampanoag man showed the Pilgrims how to grow corn by placing dried fish in the ground with seeds.
Many people today help others who are in need. They collect and donate food and clothes.
Turkey, fish, and corn were some of the foods that the Wampanoag and Pilgrims ate at the first harvest feast.
Many people eat turkey, stuffing, potatoes, corn, and cranberries on Thanksgiving.
The Pilgrims were thankful for their first harvest. Their celebration lasted for three days.
Thanksgiving is a day for people to give thanks for what they have. These kids make a ""tree of thanks.""
The Wampanoag and Pilgrims played games. Here, they play a game called pitching the bar.

420,"The San Francisco Giants baseball team has several four-legged helpers. These furry friends help the team by fetching baseballs.
Six Portuguese (POR-chuh-geez) water dogs joined the Giants baseball team last summer. The dog team is known as B.A.R.K. That stands for Baseball Aquatic Retrieval Korps.
B.A.R.K.'s job is to bring back home-run balls that go out of the ballpark. But this is not as easy as it sounds. The Giant's ballpark is right next to San Francisco Bay in California. Home-run balls hit to right field usually go into the bay.
The B.A.R.K. team rides around the bay in a motorboat. When a ball lands in the bay, a B.A.R.K. dog dives into the water and brings back the ball.
The Giants founded the dog team with help from Pets In Need, a local animal shelter. During baseball games, workers from Pets In Need are at the ballpark trying to find homes for the shelter's animals. Pets In Need also sells the home-run balls to fans and uses the money to help its animals.
Besides being among America's favorite pets, some dogs have jobs.
Specially trained dogs work for the U.S. government. They can sniff out illegal drugs in suitcases.
Some dogs live in or visit nursing homes and help the people who live there feel better.
An Air Force base in Delaware became home to too many birds. The birds were getting in the way of the base's airplanes, so dogs were hired to shoo the birds away.

Your dentist will teach you how to brush and floss correctly. He or she will ask your parents to do the same. Your dentist will tell you to eat healthful foods and not to eat too many sugary snacks.
Your dentist will clean your teeth with special tools. He or she will make sure to clean the places in your mouth that are hard to reach.

36,"Polar bears need help. The number of bears is getting smaller in some parts of the Arctic. Why? Scientists say that Earth is getting warmer. That is making Arctic sea ice melt. Polar bears walk across the ice to hunt for seals. With less ice, they are having trouble finding food.
Polar bears need ice to find seals to eat, says Bruce Woods. He is a spokesperson for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Scientists are working to protect polar bears and their dens, he says. A den is a place where polar bears raise their cubs.
Polar bears are in danger as the Arctic heats up.

533,"A fisherman in Japan recently spotted a rare shark. Staff at a nearby marine park discovered that it was a frilled shark. They caught the shark and took it to the park. The staff filmed it swimming and opening its jaws.
Frilled sharks are sometimes caught in fishing nets, but they are rarely seen alive. That is because their natural home is between 2,000 and 3,000 feet underwater, in the twilight zone.
The shark died a few hours after it was caught. Scientists believe it came close to the surface of the ocean because it was sick.

581,"Football is not just for men and boys anymore. The Women's Professional Football League (WPFL) had its first game in October.
Right now, the WPFL has 14 teams. Each team will play ten games this season.

452,"Scientists in California recently explored a large inactive, underwater volcano. They were looking for ways to protect this special sea mountain that is home to many animals. Bright yellow sea sponges and 10-foot-tall pink coral live there. It is located deep below the surface of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. Its name is Davidson Seamount. The rocks there make good homes for deep-sea animals.
Scientists used a remote control vehicle to help them explore the volcano. It took photos and collected bits of rock and coral. Scientists say that we must find ways to protect this place or we will lose these sea creatures forever.

February 12, 2009, is the 200th anniversary of Lincoln's birth. Many states across the country will hold events. They will continue until February 2010.
""Many people consider Abraham Lincoln to be Americans' favorite president,"" says David Early. He is a spokesperson for the group that is planning the celebration. ""Lincoln was a great leader during the Civil War. That is when the country almost split in half.""
""Lincoln believed that all people were created equal,"" adds Early. ""He became president at a time when some people believed slavery was OK. He didn't think that it was OK for one person to own another person. He fought to end slavery.""

516,"lived millions of years ago. Scientists recently discovered something new about dinosaurs.
Scientists stumbled upon strange-looking dinosaur bones in Germany.
that are unlike any they had seen before. Fossils are remains of plants and animals that lived long ago. This is what scientists found:
The fossils were from a sauropod (SAWR-uh-pahd). Sauropods were tall, plant-eating dinosaurs. The fossils were much smaller than other sauropod fossils.
The fossils were from a dinosaur that lived on an island in Germany. The dinosaur had little food to eat and little space to roam. It never grew!
Germany is a country in Europe. Why might scientists have named the dinosaur Europasaurus?
The dinosaur shrank over time to fit on the island. Scientists named their new discovery

465,"Imagine having to quit school to help your family earn money. Or think about what it might be like to be in a class with 49 other students and only one teacher.
Kids in some countries must deal with problems like those. But a special worldwide organization is trying to help them.
UNICEF helps children around the world. One way it helps is by providing schools and supplies. Three of the countries where UNICEF helps with education are Colombia, in South America, Rwanda (ruh-WAHN-duh), in Africa, and Thailand (TIGH-land), in Southeast Asia.
Those countries are probably far from where you live. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to go to school in another country?
In Colombia, the government requires kids to go to school for at least five years. Some people are poor and must work hard to survive. Some children must quit school to help their parents earn money.
With UNICEF's help, Colombia's government is creating a special school for those children. The students learn at their own pace and attend when they can. They have a small library and a garden where they grow vegetables.
One or two teachers must teach all the students, from grades 1 through 5. Students of the same age work together in small groups, helping one another learn.
Children in Rwanda must go to school from ages 7 to 15. But there is not enough space in some schools in Rwanda to fit all the students. Some students cannot afford to buy the uniforms and notebooks they must have to go to school.
To help solve those problems, UNICEF has created a special program called Schools-in-a-Box. Each box contains school supplies, workbooks, and learning games. When teachers use the Schools-in-a-Box, kids can be taught wherever they are.
Children in Thailand must go to school for six years. Though school is free, some families cannot afford to buy the uniforms children must wear to school.
Some classrooms in Thailand have as many as 50 kids and only one teacher! Often, children of all ages are in the same grade. The children must share the few books and school supplies that are in the school.
But UNICEF is working to help these people. The organization has built Village Education Centers in parts of Thailand. At night, adults gather there and take classes. During the day, the buildings are schools for children.
UNICEF is an organization that works to help children all over the world. UNICEF tries to provide health care, nutritious food, clean water, and an education for all children. The organization raises money and talks to world governments about helping children.

189,"You probably know that cigarette smoking makes people sick. But did you know that smoking hurts the environment?
Sometimes people drop cigarette butts on the ground. Many beaches in the United States are littered with cigarette butts. When beach cleanups are held, cigarette butts are picked up more often than any other kind of trash.
Cigarette butts can be dangerous. Cigarettes have hundreds of poisons in them. Scientists worry that the poisons could pollute the ocean water.
Cigarette butts can also harm animals. Seabirds will try to eat cigarette butts. The birds think the butts are food. The butts get stuck in the birds' stomachs and make them sick.
Every day, about 3,000 kids start smoking.
The average age a kid starts smoking is 13.
About 46 million adults in the United States smoke.
Smoking-related illnesses kill about 500,000 people each year.
Smoking one cigarette takes about seven minutes off the smoker's life.
On November 16, kids across the United States will scream their lungs out. That's when the Great American SmokeScream will happen. The kids will tell people not to smoke.

246,"When snow first falls, it is usually soft and fluffy. But tightly packed snow is very strong, and it is almost as hard as ice. Tightly packed snow is so strong that some people use it to build homes called igloos. Some Inuit (IN-oo-it) people in Canada use blocks of snow to build igloos.
Snow is a good insulator. An insulator holds heat inside. Sometimes people, such as campers and hikers, dig a hole in the snow or make a snow cave to stay warm.
The largest snowflake ever measured was almost a foot across.
Stampede Pass, Washington, is called the snow capital of the United States!

539,"is being built to honor Martin Luther King Jr. A memorial is a statue or a place that honors a person or an event. We started building this past fall. The memorial will be finished in 2010, says spokesperson Rica Orszag.
The King memorial will be built on the National Mall. That is a park in Washington, D.C. Memorials for some U.S. presidents are also on the National Mall. With the King Memorial, the National Mall will now better reflect the different people that make up our country, says Orszag.

570,"So much traffic is zipping around Earths
. An orbit is a path a space object travels around another object. Scientists have to keep an eye on all that traffic to make sure it flows smoothly.
People have sent hundreds of satellites into Earths orbit. A satellite is an object that orbits a planet. Some travel as close as 100 miles above Earth. Others are thousands of miles away. The satellites have different jobs. Some track the weather. Others send signals to radios, televisions, cell phones, and computers.
The Hubble Space Telescope is a well-known satellite. It was launched into space in 1990. It is in orbit 380 miles above Earth. Hubble takes photos of our solar system and faraway
. A galaxy is a huge group of stars, dust, and gas. Over the years, Hubble has taught scientists a lot about space.
The International Space Station is a special type of satellite. It is a giant research lab in space where astronauts live and work. The station is in orbit 220 miles above Earth. Work on the space station began in 1998. It is expected to be finished in 2010. At that time, it will be about the size of a five-bedroom house.

242,"People in the United States will celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day on January 15. That day is King's birthday. He will be honored for the important work he did. Soon, a monument will be built in Washington, D.C., to honor King.
A Memorial for Martin Luther King Jr.
will soon be built for Martin Luther King. A memorial is a special statue or place meant to remind people of a person or event. The memorial will honor the work King did for all Americans.
The memorial will sit on the shore of the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. It will cover an area of land about the size of three football fields. Visitors will be able to walk along a path lined with large stone panels. Each panel will show words from King's important speeches. There will also be a 20-foot-high stone statue of King.
Workers will probably begin building the memorial this year. They plan to finish the memorial in 2003.
On August 28, 1963, King gave an important speech in Washington, D.C., to more than 200,000 people. King asked that all people be treated
or the same. That speech is often called the ""I Have a Dream"" speech.
For many years, African Americans were not treated equally in the United States. King worked hard to solve that problem. He told people to work out their problems by talking, not fighting.
