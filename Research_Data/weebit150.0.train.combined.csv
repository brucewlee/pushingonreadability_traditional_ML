1,439,"Last November, doctors operated on a clouded leopard named Joe. Joe had not been eating and had trouble walking. A disease was causing fluid to press on Joe's brain. This disease can also happen to cats, dogs, and humans. A two-hour operation saved Joe's life.
Joe is special because he is an endangered species. He is one of only a few hundred clouded leopards in the world.
Joe lives in Texas at the Fort Worth Zoo. He is often taken out of the zoo to visit people at schools and churches. A

4,210,"What is the difference between the two groups?
A reptile is an animal that has hard, dry skin. Turtles are the only reptiles that have shells.
Most reptiles have clawed feet and walk on four legs. Can you name a reptile that has no legs? A snake! Other reptiles include alligators, crocodiles, and lizards.
Most reptiles lay eggs on land. Baby reptiles hatch from the eggs. A leaf-tailed gecko, like the one shown on the cover, lays two eggs at a time. The corn snake lays up to 30 eggs at once! The boa constrictor is a snake that does not lay eggs. It gives birth to baby snakes.
An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Most have smooth, wet skin. Frogs, toads, newts, and salamanders are amphibians.
Most amphibians hatch from eggs. The eggs are usually in or near water. Young amphibians breathe through gills. When they get older, they breathe with lungs. Most adult amphibians live on land.
For example, you young frogs that hatch from eggs are called tadpoles. Tadpoles live in water and move like fish. After they grow legs, they can hop on land.
If you could be any reptile or amphibian, what would you be? Why?

6,349,"November 11 is Veterans Day. On that holiday, Americans honor U.S. veterans. Veterans are men and women who have served in the military for our country.
Many cities will hold events to honor veterans. The oldest and largest celebration is held in Birmingham, Alabama, each year. Veterans from all over the country attend. Events include an awards dinner and a parade. We want to thank our veterans for their service, says event planner Bill Voigt.
Why is it important to honor our veterans?

8,546,"About 47 million American kids went back to school in September. Some live in cities that do not have big enough schools for all the kids. Some of those cities do not have space or money to build new schools.
That is why some cities are turning empty shopping malls into schools. Stores become classrooms, and restaurants become lunchrooms. Making a mall into a school is faster and costs less than building a new school.

and the chicken have in common? A team of scientists say the two animals are related. Recently, the scientists studied a
of that. Proof is anything that can be used to show that something is true.
bone was part of a dinosaur's leg. It is 68 million years old. Scientists found it in Montana in 2003. They cut into the bone and were surprised to find
inside. Protein is a living material that makes up muscle. It is also found inside bone.
Lewis Cantley is a scientist on the research team. ""We were very excited,"" he says. ""No one thought that protein could survive that long.""
Scientists used a special machine to study the protein. They compared it to the proteins in other animals. Chickens were the closest relatives.
Many scientists have long thought that dinosaurs and birds are related. The recent discovery is more proof. ""Previous proof was based on the way the bones looked. This proof is based on protein,"" says Cantley. ""It better supports our beliefs that chickens came from dinosaurs.""
This year, scientists plan to look for more dinosaur bones to study. ""We want to find other dinosaur bones that contain protein,"" says Cantley. ""That would give us even more proof.""
and the chicken were the same size. Would they look related? Take a look at the photos to see for yourself. How are they alike? How are they different?

about 18 feet (or about 17 chickens)
about 40 feet (or about 37 chickens)

Why might people want to learn more about dinosaurs?

10,42,"You cant see them, but millions of pieces of junk are flying around Earth. The junk is called
(deh-BREE). It includes parts of old satellites. The largest piece of debris is part of a rocket about the size of a car. The tiniest pieces are flecks of paint.
The debris can damage working satellites. It can also hit old satellites and break them apart. That creates more space trash.
Scientists are tracking the pieces of debris in space. However, that is not easy. All working satellites and debris are moving very fast, and in all different directions, says NASA scientist Nicholas Johnson. NASA is the U.S. space agency.
Can scientists solve the space junk problem? Countries around the world have agreed to reduce the amount of new space junk, says Johnson. We are working on getting rid of the old stuff, but we havent figured out how yet. The good news is that we caught this before it started to get out of hand.
The dots show objects in Earths orbit that are being tracked by scientists.
How might people solve the space junk problem?

The Arctic is cold and windy. Snow and ice cover the ground for most of the year. The
is near the North Pole. A habitat is a place in nature where a plant or an animal normally lives. Bundle up! Meet some animals that live in the Arctic.
The harp seal lives in the water. It can also be found on the ice. The harp seal has thick fur. That helps it stay warm. The seal also has
under its skin. Blubber is fat that protects an animal from the cold.
A harp seal rests with its pup. A pup is a baby seal.
The arctic fox travels on snow and ice. It has thick, white fur in the winter. The fur acts as
(KA-muh-flahzh). It helps the animal match its surroundings. The fox uses its bushy tail as a warm cover. The fox can curl its tail around its face.
The polar bear spends much of its time on the ice. It hunts for seals through holes in the ice. The polar bear can swim too. A layer of blubber keeps the bear warm. It also has thick, white fur. The fur blends in with the snow. That helps the polar bear sneak up on seals.

15,454,"The Arctic is feeling the heat. Its sea ice is melting. The ice has been shrinking for more than 30 years, says scientist Mark Serreze. Over the past five years, it has been melting faster and faster.
Serreze works at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, which keeps track of how much snow and ice is on Earth. He predicts, We could be looking at an ice-free Arctic in 2030.
Why is the ice melting? Earth is getting warmer. Scientists say that is because of pollution in the air. As Earths temperature rises, sea ice at the Arctic melts. The animals there will have a hard time, says Serreze.

are related to rabbits. Some kinds of pikas live on the rocky slopes of mountains. These animals prefer cool weather. As Earth heats up, they must move to cooler places higher in the mountains.
make their nests in the holes of rain forest trees. People are cutting down those trees and using the land for farms. Macaws are running out of trees in which to make their nests.
live in the Arctic. They live on large pieces of sea ice. As Earth's temperature rises, the large pieces of sea ice begin to melt. If the ice keeps melting, polar bears will have nowhere to live.

talked to Marc Brown about his work. Here's what he had to say.
Telling bedtime stories to my son was one of my favorite things to do. So I decided to write and draw kids' books.
Why did you decide to write about an aardvark?
My son wanted to hear a story about a weird animal.
How do you decide what each book will be about?
I try to make the stories fun to read. But I also write about things that are important to kids.
Did you have a favorite book as a kid?
Do you have any advice for a kid who wants to become a writer?

24,5,"Some ants live in special plants known as ant plants. Those plants have
parts where the ants can live. Something that is hollow has empty space inside. The ants help the plants by killing insects that eat the plants.
Scientists recently found that some ants can harm plants. The ants attack plants that do not have hollow parts. The ants dig tunnels in the plants to make nests. Why? Scientists say that when the ants run out of space in ant plants, they make room in other plants.
This ant and plant get along well. The ant lives inside the plants hollow parts. The ant kills insects that eat the plant.

27,214,"2008 is the Chinese Year of the Rat.
February 7 is Chinese New Year! The celebration lasts 15 days. Each Chinese year is named after one of 12 animals. This is the Year of the Rat.
People prepare for the holiday before the actual day. They clean their homes and decorate them with flowers and poems. The poems are happy messages of good luck. People also put out bowls of tangerines, oranges, dried fruits, and candy to wish visitors a sweet new year.
On the first night of the celebration, families and friends gather for a special meal. Many people wear new red clothing. They eat foods such as dumplings, fish, and long noodles. Sweet, sticky rice cakes are a favorite treat.
The Chinese New Year celebration ends with the Lantern Festival. It includes music, dancing, and fireworks. Kids carry lanterns in a parade under the light of a full moon. The highlight of the parade is the dragon dance. Dancers carry a long dragon made of silk, paper, and bamboo through the streets. The dragon may stretch more than 100 feet!

30,356,"Winter is a baby bottlenose dolphin who lost her tail in an accident. Scientists want to help her by giving her a
(prahs-THEE-suss). That is a human-made part to replace a missing body part.
In spite of her injury, Winter behaves like a can-do dolphin. She has learned to swim without her tail, by moving from side to side. If the new tail works, she will be able to move up and down in the water, the way other dolphins swim.
""Theres never been a dolphin like her,"" says Dana Zucker, an officer of the Clearwater Aquarium in Florida, where Winter lives.

31,622,"Our national anthem is ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Did you know that the song is about a 200-year-old flag? Workers from a museum in Washington, D.C., are trying to make the flag look new again.
Fixing the flag is a big job. The flag is 42 feet long and 30 feet wide! Workers lie on their stomachs on a platform above the flag.
The workers have removed material that covered the back of the flag. The workers had to cut 1.7 million stitches!

32,580,"Astronauts travel into space on a space shuttle. Most space trips take about ten days. During that time, astronauts work, eat, sleep, and have fun. Many things in the space shuttle are different than they are on Earth.
Eating in space can be hard because everything floats. Juice poured into a cup will float away and crumbs can get into air vents. So astronauts drink and eat in special ways. Astronauts drink with special straws and pouches. The pouch closes around the straw so juice doesn't leak out. Astronauts eat foods that don't make crumbs, like tortillas instead of bread.
On Earth, people usually sleep in beds. But most astronauts sleep in sleeping bags. The sleeping bags are in little cubbies. That way, a sleeping astronaut won't lose his or her pillow or float into something!
Astronauts have to work hard in space. Astronauts make sure that the space shuttle is in good condition. They clean air vents and check the engines and computers. The astronauts also do research and tests. Their work helps people learn about space.
A space shuttle does not have much room inside. But astronauts can still have fun. Astronauts like to watch Earth from the windows. They also like to use exercise bikes or float around the shuttle together.
What would you do for fun while in space?

39,198,"Learn about a woman who followed her dream
Amelia Earhart loved to fly. She was a famous American pilot.
Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, in 1897. As a child, she liked adventure. She dared to play games that some people thought were just for boys. She climbed trees and played sports. She liked to hunt for rats.
Amelia Earhart sits at the controls of her airplane.
In 1920, Earhart was given her first ride on an airplane. That is when she decided to learn how to fly. She had her first flying lesson the next year. Soon after, she bought her first airplane. It was painted yellow. She called it the Canary. A
is a small bird that is usually yellow.
Earhart set many flight records and won awards. She made the news often and gained fame. In 1932, she became the first woman to fly
A crowd cheers for Amelia Earhart after she flies solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
At that time, many people believed that flying airplanes was a mans activity. Earhart tried to change that belief. She gave speeches and wrote books. She encouraged other women to learn how to fly.
In 1937, Earhart attempted to set another record. She wanted to become the first woman to fly around the world. During that trip, she disappeared and was never seen again. Experts say that her airplane might have run out of fuel.
Amelia Earhart wore a helmet and goggles when she flew.
Over the years, many people have tried to find Earharts airplane. To this day, the Amelia Earhart story remains a mystery.
A giant balloon of Amelia Earhart is touring the country. The balloon is 45 feet long. It shows Earhart in a red airplane she once flew.
Most balloon characters are male. No one has ever made a balloon of a historical woman before, says Lynette Long. She is the president of Equal Visibility Everywhere (EVE). The group wants more women to be shown in symbols across the country.
An Amelia Earhart balloon takes its first flight in a parade in Indiana.
Why did the group choose Amelia Earhart? She is a great role model for young girls, says Long. She was fearless. We want young girls to say, Hey, I can do anything!
The Amelia Earhart balloon is just the start. EVE hopes to make more balloons of famous American women. Our hope is to make one each year, Long says.
What kind of person was Amelia Earhart? Why might so many women look up to her?

40,395,"Christopher Columbus was an explorer. Explorers travel to places to learn more about them. Columbus sailed the ocean on a ship called the Santa Maria. Look inside to learn about his travels.
Columbus lived long, long ago. People had to go to faraway places to get spices and gold. Those trips were long and hard. Columbus wanted to find a shorter way to get to those lands. He had an idea to cross the ocean. He found people to help pay for his trip. Look at the map above to see where Columbus first sailed.
Columbus and his crew left Spain in August 1492. They sailed on three ships, called the
. The trip was long and stormy. Just when the crew was ready to give up, they saw land!
Columbus didn't find a shorter way to those faraway lands. Instead, he landed on an island near what is now the United States. He named the island San Salvador.
Columbus began to explore that island. He met people who already lived there. They were called the Taino (TIGH-noh). Later, Columbus left the island. He continued to explore other places. After some time, he returned to Spain.
Why might Columbus's trip have made him famous?

Polar bears are large bears that have special fur. Each strand of their fur is shaped like a straw. The straw-shaped fur holds in warmth from the sun. Polar bears also have a layer of blubber, which keeps them warm when they swim in icy ocean water.
Walruses are huge, noisy animals that live on or near ice sheets in the Arctic Ocean. Under their skin, walruses have a thick layer of blubber. The blubber helps them stay warm. Walruses also spend a lot of time lying in the sun. The sun helps keep walruses warm too.
Walruses live on or near ice sheets.
Musk oxen are large, long-haired animals that live in the Arctic area. Their long, shaggy fur helps keep them warm. When it is really cold outside, musk oxen huddle next to one another and share body heat to stay warm.

45,246,"When snow first falls, it is usually soft and fluffy. But tightly packed snow is very strong, and it is almost as hard as ice. Tightly packed snow is so strong that some people use it to build homes called igloos. Some Inuit (IN-oo-it) people in Canada use blocks of snow to build igloos.
Snow is a good insulator. An insulator holds heat inside. Sometimes people, such as campers and hikers, dig a hole in the snow or make a snow cave to stay warm.
The largest snowflake ever measured was almost a foot across.
Stampede Pass, Washington, is called the snow capital of the United States!

46,472,"Scientists from the United States are studying elephants in Africa. They say elephants make sounds that cannot be heard by humans. Now those scientists have found a way to study the sounds and what the sounds mean.
In a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear.
Scientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help.
Scientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled.
Scientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest.
The African elephant is the largest animal that lives on land. African elephants can weigh up to 16,000 pounds.
An elephant's trunk contains more than 40,000 muscles. The trunk is used to smell, breathe, touch, eat, drink, and bathe.
An angry or frightened elephant can run about 25 miles per hour.
Move over Backstreet Boys, something bigger is now on music store shelves. The Thai Elephant Orchestra released its first album last December. The orchestra is made up of six Asian elephants from the Thai Elephant Conservation Center. The center is located in Lampang, Thailand. Thailand is a country in Southeast Asia.
The elephants play many instruments, including drums and a xylophone. The money raised from album sales will be used to care for baby elephants. Workers will buy milk to feed elephants that have lost their mothers.

47,523,"Veterans Day is November 11. It is a time to
brave Americans. To honor is to show great respect.
Veterans are men and women who have served in the
. The armed forces are five groups that keep our country safe. They are the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps (KOHR), and Coast Guard.
About 25 million veterans live in our country today. Many of those people have fought in wars. They have also served in times of peace.
Many cities have parades on Veterans Day. Bands play music and march down the streets. Veterans march too.
People wave American flags. The flag is a
of our freedom. A symbol is an object or a sign that stands for something else. What other symbols of our country can you name?

55,16,"More animals live in cold waters near the South Pole than people once thought. Scientists recently found more than 1,000 types of ocean animals around a group of Antarctic islands! Until now, most people believed cold waters didnt contain as much life as warmer waters.
A diver studies ocean animals near the cold South Pole.
How did scientists make the discovery? They wore scuba gear and dived into the freezing waters. They also used nets to catch marine animals nearly a mile down in the water. This is the first time scientists have managed to make a list of all the animal types living at a place near the South Pole, says scientist David Barnes.

59,597,"On September 15, a runner will carry a torch into the Olympic stadium in Sydney, Australia. When the runner arrives, the 2000 Summer Olympic Games can begin!
The torch traveled for 128 days from Greece, a country in Europe. It was carried by more than 13,000 people. The torch was carried on an airplane, in a helicopter, and on a camel's back. It was even carried by a diver underwater!
The torch is special because the smoke from the torch's flame does not pollute the air. Empty fuel cans and leftover fuel will be used again.
The torch also has a built-in safety system. If the torch is turned upside down or left lying on the ground, the flame goes out.
The torch will light the Olympic flame in Sydney. The flame will burn until the Games are finished on October 1.
More than 100 countries will send their best athletes to compete in the Olympics. The United States will send at least 200 athletes to the Games.
The top three finishers in each event win a medal. First-place finishers win a gold medal, second-place finishers win a silver medal, and third-place finishers win a bronze medal.
The first Olympics took place long ago in Greece. The Olympics helped keep peace among different groups of people.

64,378,"Many children are in need of winter coats. Operation Warm is a group that wants to make sure those kids are cozy. The group gives away new coats to kids whose families dont have enough money to buy coats. The new coats bring smiles to kids faces, says Cydney Irving-Dasent. She is a spokesperson for the group.
Two girls receive new winter coats from Operation Warm.
Operation Warm started in 1998. The group expects to give away its millionth coat this winter! We are really excited about reaching this important milestone, says Irving-Dasent. Our goal is to serve as many children as possible. A million is a really big number. After that, we are looking forward to giving away the next million.

65,416,". Mammals are animals that drink milk from their mothers. Whales live in oceans. There are many kinds of whales. Whales are some of the biggest animals alive.
. Krill are tiny animals that look like shrimp. The humpback opens its mouth and takes in water and krill. Grooves in the whale's throat stretch to help it hold a lot of water and food. Then it pushes the water out and eats the krill.
All whales, like blue whales, breathe air through
. A blowhole is an opening on top of a whale's head. The blowhole is closed when the whale is under the water. When the whale comes to the top, its blowhole opens. The whale breathes out, making water spray into the air. Then the whale breathes in and goes under the water again.
Killer whales breach, or jump out of the water.
. A breaching whale jumps up out of the water. Then it comes down and makes a huge splash!
No one is sure why whales breach. Some people say that they do it just for fun!

68,367,"This year, Memorial Day will be celebrated on May 28. On this holiday, we honor the American men and women who have served in past wars. A special animal cemetery in New York honors dogs that helped soldiers in wars.
Dogs helped locate people injured in wars. When specially trained dogs brought a soldier's helmet to rescue workers, they knew the soldier needed help. Dogs also carried messages and supplies during wars.
The Hartsdale Pet Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York, built a memorial to war dogs in 1923. Since then, the cemetery has held a special ceremony each Memorial Day to honor the dogs.

69,38,"April 22 is Earth Day. On Earth Day, millions of people will think of ways to stop pollution. They will talk about recycling and planting trees. People will look for ways to save energy and water.
People have been celebrating Earth Day since 1970. Earth Day was started by a man named Gaylord Nelson. Nelson was a United States senator from Wisconsin. He was worried about the damage being done to the planet.
To celebrate Earth Day, people get together once a year to think about ways to protect Earth. But many people think that every day should be Earth Day. They say people should always work to to stop pollution and clean up the land and water.
Here are a few ways that you can help make every day Earth Day!
Don't litter! Be a good example for other kids. If you see litter, pick it up and put it in trash cans or recycling bins.
. That means these objects are put through a special process so they can be used again.
Start a can recycling program at your school. Use the money you earn from returning the cans to buy new playground equipment or to have an Earth Day party.
Paper is made from trees. You can save a tree by not wasting paper. Use both sides.
Celebrate National Arbor Day on April 27 by planting a tree. This holiday encourages people to plant and care for trees.
, or save, water. Turn the faucet off while brushing your teeth and washing your face.
Save electricity by turning off the lights when you leave a room. Do not leave a radio or TV on if you aren't using it.

76,340,"Scientists recently studied black bears in Alaska. The bears hibernated for about six months. During that time, the bears breathing slowed down. Their heartbeats slowed too.
What barely changed? The bears body temperature! It dropped only a few degrees. That surprised scientists. Most animals that hibernate have a large drop in temperature.
As body temperature drops, the body slows down and uses less energy. It was surprising that hibernating bears were able to save so much energy without a large drop in body temperature, says Oivind Toien. He is the scientist who led the study.
A black bear hibernates in a den.

77,114,"What do birds and people have in common? Dreaming, scientists say. People often dream of events that happened during the day. Scientists say birds dream about singing.
Scientists attached a special device to the head of a bird called the zebra finch. Scientists watched how the bird's brain acted while it was singing. Then they watched how the bird's brain behaved while it slept. The bird's brain acted the same way!

81,386,"In Harlem, a section of New York City, playing hockey and doing well in school go hand in hand.
A program called Ice Hockey in Harlem teachers kids how to play hockey. They learn the rules of the game and about hockey equipment. Then, one night per week, kids practice hockey at a local skating rink.
To play hockey, the kids have to go to tutoring sessions. The sessions use hockey information as learning tools. For example, the kids practice math skills by comparing hockey teams' scores.

82,189,"You probably know that cigarette smoking makes people sick. But did you know that smoking hurts the environment?
Sometimes people drop cigarette butts on the ground. Many beaches in the United States are littered with cigarette butts. When beach cleanups are held, cigarette butts are picked up more often than any other kind of trash.
Cigarette butts can be dangerous. Cigarettes have hundreds of poisons in them. Scientists worry that the poisons could pollute the ocean water.
Cigarette butts can also harm animals. Seabirds will try to eat cigarette butts. The birds think the butts are food. The butts get stuck in the birds' stomachs and make them sick.
Every day, about 3,000 kids start smoking.
The average age a kid starts smoking is 13.
About 46 million adults in the United States smoke.
Smoking-related illnesses kill about 500,000 people each year.
Smoking one cigarette takes about seven minutes off the smoker's life.
On November 16, kids across the United States will scream their lungs out. That's when the Great American SmokeScream will happen. The kids will tell people not to smoke.
You need healthy lungs to breathe and to scream loudly. Keep your lungs healthy by not smoking. Use your healthy lungs to tell other people not to smoke.

Scientists look for monarchs with the tags. They want to keep track of them. Why? The number of monarchs is getting smaller. People are cutting down plants and trees where the butterflies live. We want to learn about monarchs so we can save them, says scientist Chip Taylor.

91,7,"The MacPherson family left their home in Washington, D.C., last July. They will travel around the world for one year. The MacPhersons will visit South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia.

95,52,"Lava is flowing out of a volcano in Hawaii. The volcano is named Kilauea (kee-lah-WAY-ah). It is one of the worlds most active volcanoes. It has been erupting for more than 25 years!
Scientists are keeping a close watch on Kilauea. They want to make sure people living nearby are safe.
The lava from Kilauea goes into the Pacific Ocean. The lava cools. Then, it hardens into rock. The rock forms new land over time.
Many people visit Kilauea each year. This is one of the few places in the world where you can get really close to an actively erupting volcano, says scientist Jim Kauahikaua (koh-wah-hee-KOH-wah). Its really cool.

104,248,"Some students in Nebraska think of veterans as lifesavers. The kids attend Dakota City Elementary School. They decided to have a candy sale. What did they sell? Life Savers!
The students made more than a thousand dollars. They donated the money to help build a park. The park will honor veterans. It will be called Siouxland Freedom Park.
It will be a living memorial that will honor veteranspast, present, and future. We look forward to groups of students coming to visit, says Mike Newhouse. He is the president of the Siouxland Freedom Park project. He is also a veteran.

105,589,"Every February, we celebrate Presidents' Day. We honor presidents by putting their pictures on money. Whose picture is on the new dollar coin?
New dollar coins showing George Washington will soon be at a bank near you. This month, the
(the place where money is made) began making one-dollar coins that show the faces of our presidents in the order they served in office. The George Washington dollar coin will be first, followed by coins showing John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. Would you rather carry a dollar bill or a dollar coin?
or arguing, about whether the penny should still be made. A penny is worth 1 cent. The U.S. Mint says it costs more to make the penny than the coin is worth. Some people want to keep the penny. They say the coin is a part of American history.

108,594,"Can you imagine a pizza box that turns into serving plates? a fan without spinning blades? a garden growing on a wall? Well, get ready to learn about those great
! Inventions are new things. They can solve problems and make life easier.
The Green Box is a pizza box that can be
means to use again. That makes less trash. The top half of the box divides into four plates. People dont need paper plates. The bottom of the box folds in half and can be used to hold leftovers.
Cameron, age 6, holds the Green Box.
A man named William Walsh invented the Green Box. His friends often ate pizza, but they never used plates. One day, a friend spilled hot cheese on his shirt. Walsh tore off a piece of the box and gave it to him to use as a plate. What a good idea!
The electric fan was invented more than 120 years ago. It has blades that spin and move the air. A company called Dyson has invented a new type of fan. It is called the Air Multiplier. The new fan does not have blades. It is safer to use and can be easily cleaned.
How does a fan without blades move air? It has a motor that pulls air in through holes in the bottom of the fan. The air is pushed out over a circle-shaped ramp. It lets out a stream of air. Cool!
How does your garden grow? Gardens by Patrick Blanc climb the walls. They are called
means straight up and down. The gardens grow on buildings around the world. One of his newest gardens is growing on a hotel in London, England. It has about 260 types of plants.
Blancs gardens are unusual. The plants do not grow in soil. Their roots are attached to a type of cloth called felt. Water is pumped through the garden to keep plants healthy.

The spider lived 165 million years ago. Dinosaurs ruled Earth at that time. Spider fossils that old are
That means people have found very few of them.
This spider belongs to a family of spiders that is still alive today, says scientist Paul Selden. He studied the fossil. They are found in the United States and Mexico.
The spider fossil (above) is in great condition, says Selden.

113,300,"More than 100 spiders are crawling around a museum in California. The Natural History Museum created a world just for those spiders in its greenhouse. A
Visitors can see many different kinds of spiders, such as the golden silk spider. That is one of the largest spiders in North and South America. Golden silk spiders build strong webs.

118,620,"The United States government recently said it will clean up the Everglades. The Everglades are
in southern Florida. A wetland is an area of wet and spongy soil. Both pollution and construction have hurt the Everglades. A new law will now clean up and protect the Everglades. Over the next 36 years, the government will spend $8 billion to clean up pollution in the Everglades.
 The Everglades take up about 2,344 square miles. That's about the size of Delaware.
 The Everglades are the only place in the world where both crocodiles and alligators live.
 Other animals that live in the Everglades are snakes, turtles, birds, fish, deer, and the rare Florida panther.

120,82,"Whiskers's class went to the museum for a field trip. But, oops, the story of their trip is in the wrong order. Use the clues to put the story in order.
Fourth, Whiskers and his class went to see the train display. They saw an old locomotive--a train's engine. The first locomotives used steam to move. This steam locomotive could pull many train cars, or parts of a train.
First, the students went to see the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs lived long ago. Dinosaurs are now extinct, or all gone. Scientists use dinosaur fossils, old bones or marks made by body parts or plants, to learn about dinosaurs.
Fifth, Whiskers saw real moon rocks and pictures of astronauts, the people trained to visit space. Astronaut Neil Armstrong was the first man to step onto the moon. He put an American flag up on the moon. He brought moon rocks back to Earth.
Second, Whiskers's class went to see an Egyptian mummy, or a dead body that has been kept in a special way. Egyptians buried their pharaohs, or kings, as mummies. The bodies were wrapped and put in fancy boxes. The boxes were decorated with paintings and writing.
Sixth, Whiskers's class met by the main door. They looked at a statue,or form of something or somebody. The statue is a copy of one called The Thinker. Whiskers was thinking, too. He was thinking about his day. He was glad he had visited the museum!
Third, Whiskers went with his class to see knights, or soldiers from long ago. Knights wore armor, or metal clothing, for protection. They used shields and swords to fight off enemies.

125,229,"The map shows some volcanoes located in Mexico.
Popocatpetl means ""smoking mountain"" in a language once spoken in Mexico. It is also the name of a Mexican volcano, which people have nicknamed ""Popo."" Mexico is a country just south of the United States.
Late last year, a volcano called Popo erupted. Gases and ash filled the air. No one was hurt by the eruption. Scientists studying Popo knew it was going to erupt. About 50,000 people live in the villages and towns that surround Popo. The scientists warned those people. Many of the residents left their homes before the eruption.
Inside Popo and below Earth's surface, temperatures were about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit before Popo popped. Scientists from Mexico and the United States used special tools to keep track of what was happening inside Popo. One tool detected that
, or melted rock, was rising inside the volcano.
During eruptions, magma can spill out of openings in volcanoes. The hot, flowing magma is called
when it is outside the volcano. When Popo erupted, only heat, gas, and ashes burst out.
After the eruption, the residents were able to return to their homes. But they are watching for future eruptions.
Lava and ash from volcanoes can harm people. What else might these substances harm?
Popo is almost 18,000 feet high. Last Year's eruption was its biggest in 1,200 years.
About 550 volcanoes have erupted on Earth's surface since people began recording history.
A volcano erupts somewhere on Earth about once a week. Not all eruptions are big, however.

People have been inventing things for years. Paper was invented about 2,000 years ago. The wheel was invented more than 5,000 years ago. What would life be like without paper to write on or bikes to ride? Those inventions have made life easier.
The Wright brothers invented the first airplane in December 1903. That makes 2003 the 100th anniversary! Before the airplane was invented, most people traveled by cars, boats, and trains. Today, airplanes help people travel faster. How do airplanes help you?
Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876. Before the telephone was invented, people kept in touch by writing letters or talking in person. Today, the telephone makes it easier for people to talk to one another. How do telephones help you?
The first four-wheeled gas-powered car was invented by Karl Benz in 1891. Before people had cars, they couldn't travel easily. They walked or rode horses for short trips. They took trains or boats for long trips. Today, cars are one of the main ways people travel. How do cars help you?
What are some other inventions that have changed our world?
People worked for years to make the first computer. It was built in 1946. The first computer was called ENIAC. Today, computers are an important part of many people's lives. People use computers as tools to write, get information, and much more. How do computers help you?

They are active at night. They sleep during the day.
Many owls, bats, and snakes are nocturnal. They have special ways to find
in the dark. Prey is an animal that is hunted by another animal for food.
Owls can see well at night. They also have great hearing. The feathers on the edge of their wings are soft. That lets owls fly quietly. They can sneak up on their prey. Owls hunt mice and other small animals.
Bat: Delpho M/Photolibrary; Moth: Michael Durham/Minden Pictures
Most bats eat insects. Bats have a special way of finding food. They make high-pitched sounds. The sounds bounce off insects and return to the bats. That lets the bats know where to find the insects.
Pit vipers are snakes. They sense the heat of other animals. Their heat sensors are inside holes on their faces. The holes are called pits. They help the snakes find their prey in the dark. Pit vipers eat frogs and other small animals.
How might being nocturnal help animals survive?

129,281,"When kids get flu shots, everyone may end up healthier. That is what a new study shows. Almost 50 farming
in Canada took part in the study. A community is a group of people living in an area.
Kids in half the communities were given flu shots. Kids in the other half were not given flu shots. No adults were given flu shots.
What did scientists learn? Fewer adults and kids in the flu shot group got the flu. The scientists say that giving flu shots to kids can protect the whole community.

A memorial for Martin Luther King Jr. is being built in our nation's capital.
Martin Luther King Jr. was a leader. He lived from 1929 to 1968. Americans honor him in January with a national holiday. This year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is January 21.
King grew up in the southern part of the United States. At that time, laws treated African American people differently from white people. African Americans were forced to sit in the back of buses. They also had to use separate bathrooms and water fountains.
When King was older, he worked to change those laws. As a result, equal rights laws were passed. Those laws provide the same rights to all Americans.
King will soon be honored with a
. A memorial is a statue or a place that honors a person or an event. The King memorial is being built on the National Mall. That is a park in Washington, D.C., our nation's capital. Memorials for some U.S. presidents are also on the Mall.
The King memorial is scheduled to be finished this year. It will have a 30-foot statue of King. Sentences from some of his speeches will be carved into a stone wall.
The cost of the memorial is $100 million. Most of that money has been raised. A concert was held in September in New York City to raise the rest of the money. Many famous singers performed. The singers included Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, and Garth Brooks.

139,269,"The Pilgrims landing on Plymouth Rock, December 1620.
landed at the place that is now Massachusetts. There were 101 Pilgrims aboard the ship. After some time, the Pilgrims built a town called Plymouth. Read below to learn more.
The Pilgrims landed near the area where the Wampanoag (wahm-pah-NOH-ahg) people already lived. The Wampanoag people knew how to stay safe during cold winters. They made homes called
(weh-TOOZ) to protect themselves from the cold. They also made warm clothing from deerskin.
The Pilgrims arrived close to wintertime. That winter was very cold, and many Pilgrims died. When spring came, a Wampanoag man named Squanto helped the Pilgrims. He showed them where to hunt, and he taught them how to grow corn. This helped the Pilgrims get food to eat.
When the fall harvest came, the Pilgrims had plenty of food to eat! They were very thankful for Squanto's help. Together, the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag people had a harvest celebration. For three days, people ate, played games, and told stories to celebrate and give thanks.
Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division [reproduction number LC-USZC4-4961]
That harvest celebration helped start the American tradition of Thanksgiving. Today, people still share food with their families and friends on this holiday. People also play games, tell stories, and spend time together to show they are thankful. Many people travel to be together on Thanksgiving too.

142,428,"Kids are helping keep track of monarchs. The kids are putting tags on the butterflies. The tags are tiny stickers. Each tag has a number on it. The number shows when and where each monarch was found.
Scientists look for monarchs with the tags. They want to keep track of them. Why? The number of monarchs is getting smaller. People are cutting down plants and trees where the butterflies live. Scientists want to learn more about monarchs so they can save them.
Why might scientists want to save monarch butterflies?

143,69,"How can you be ready in case of a fire at home? Learn safety tips and practice! Here are four safety tips you should know.
Smoke alarms save lives. Have an alarm inside and outside each bedroom. You should also have a smoke alarm on every level of the home. Push the test button at least once a month. That will let you know whether the alarm is working.
Fire can spread quickly. Every family needs to be prepared. How? Have a home fire escape plan. Draw the plan and talk about it. The drawing should show two ways out of each room. Those may be doors or windows. Then practice the plan twice a year. Practice during the day and at night.
Choose a safe place outside where everyone will meet. Get out and stay out! Never go back inside a burning building.
Once you are outside, dial 9-1-1 or the number for your fire department.
Why is it important to have a home fire escape plan? How might practicing it help you?

144,342,"Many animals hide in a special way called
Some animals, like chameleons, have skin color that can change. Those animals change their skin color to hide from their enemies. The animal's skin color changes to blend into its setting, such as a tree's bark.
Some animals, like gecko lizards, have colors that match their settings. Those animals use matching color to hide from their enemies. The animal's color matches its setting, such as snow or rock.
Some animals, like katydids, have special body shapes. Their bodies can look like leaves or sticks. The animal's body shape helps it hide from its enemies.
Why might some animals use more than one kind of camouflage?
Some animals, like tigers, have special patterns in their fur that match their settings. The special pattern helps the animal hide from its enemies. The patterns can look like grass. Can you find both tigers in the tall grass?

145,434,"What sounds do you hear right now? You may hear a fan blowing, kids talking, or a bell ringing. All the sounds you hear travel in waves. Those waves enter your outer ear. They travel through your middle ear and inner ear. Your inner ear sends a message to your brain. Then you hear sound. Study the ear below to learn more.
That means it moves quickly back and forth. When people speak, their vocal cords vibrate. When you pluck a guitar string, it vibrates and makes sound.
Did you know that sounds can travel through solid materials? Try this experiment with a partner to find out. Place a plastic ruler on a table. Make sure one end is hanging over the edge. Hold the ruler down with one hand. Ask your partner to place his or her ear against the surface of the table. With your other hand, gently snap the end of the ruler that is hanging over the floor. What did you and your partner see, hear, and feel?

148,467,"Students recently planted trees in Brechtel Park. It is in New Orleans, Louisiana. The park lost thousands of trees in 2005. A big hurricane hit the area then. Its name was Hurricane Katrina.
The students worked hard. They raised money to buy the trees. How? They sold T-shirts and had an art fair. The group planted about 100 trees.
The event was a great success, says Brad Philipson. He is a teacher at Metairie Park Country Day School. One day, these kids will come back and see how the trees have grown.

Although coral may look like a plant, it is actually made up of tiny sea animals called polyps.
Live from Australia, its the Great Barrier Reef! Scientists are using special
known as digital skins, to monitor changes in this underwater treasure.
The sensors are devices that record changes in the ocean and send up-to-the-minute information to computers. Until now, scientists were able to monitor changes only after they had occurred. Scientists hope the new information will help them learn how to better care for coral reefs.
Coral reefs around the world are in trouble. Fishing nets and ships break off sections of the reefs and damage them. Natural disasters and pollution are also doing harm. At the same time, warmer sea temperatures cause the

As polyps die, they leave behind hard shells. Other polyps grow on top of the shells. Over many years, the polyps form coral reefs.
Coral reefs play a very important role in ocean life. They supply food and shelter to thousands of different types of ocean creatures living in and around the reefs. People also depend on coral reefs for jobs, food, and medicine to treat diseases.
""Coral reefs are incredibly threatened,"" Rick MacPherson of Californias Coral Reef Alliance told
""They require, now more than ever, that people pay attention and work toward protecting them.""
The Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef in the world. It stretches 1,250 miles along the northeast coast of Australia.
What might happen if coral reefs continue to be damaged?

154,635,"The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center is located in Cincinnati, Ohio.
One at a time, visitors take turns crawling into a wooden box at a new museum in Cincinnati, Ohio. The museum is the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. The box is like the one in which a slave hid in the 1840s so he could be shipped to freedom.
The museum teaches visitors about the Underground Railroad. It was not actually a real railroad. It was a secret system of routes used to help slaves in the South escape to freedom in the North.
Most runaway slaves traveled hundreds of miles. They hid during the day and fled at night. Along the way, they stopped at safe homes called
. People at the stations provided slaves with food, clothing, and a place to rest.
""The Underground Railroad wouldn't have existed if it weren't for brave people who took a risk to stand up for freedom,"" museum official Stephen DeVillez told

157,632,"Change is on the way for some school vending machines. Candy bars, sugary drinks, and other sweet snacks are no longer being offered in many schools.
Those foods and drinks are being replaced with more healthful choices. Some of those choices include bottled water, salads, granola bars, and dried fruits and nuts.
School vending machines offering soda and candy may soon be a thing of the past.
New York City has the largest school system in the country. That school system recently decided to
, or not allow, junk food in its vending machines. Schools in Texas, California, and many other states are doing the same.
Do you think schools should ban junk food from vending machines? Why or why not?
Why are vending machines getting a makeover? Poor nutrition habits and a lack of exercise have caused many kids to become overweight. School officials hope the changes to vending machines will help students make better nutrition choices.

158,239,"You were fine a moment ago. Now you're tired and achy. The school nurse takes your temperature. You have a fever. Bad news-those are all symptoms of the flu, or
Hang in there; you are not alone. This flu season started early, and the virus spread quickly. The good news is that flu season appears to have slowed down.
Some health experts say this flu season was most harmful to kids. Doctors' offices and hospitals have been flooded with sick kids.
Schools in several states have closed for ""sick days"" because so many kids had the flu. To keep the virus from spreading, many teachers have asked students to wash their hands often. School officials want to make sure healthy students don't get sick.
Along with washing your hands, what else can you do to stay healthy?
The best way to stay flu-free is to get a flu
(vak-SEEN), or shot, say experts. ""If you get the flu, don't panic. Most kids will recover just fine,"" Dr. Carol Baker of Houston, Texas, told
. ""Taking medicine to lower the fever and drinking lots of liquids will help. Plenty of rest will also help fight the nasty flu virus.""

159,362,"Do you ever wonder what cars will be like in the future? You can bet that they will be much different from the cars of today. They will also be better for the Earth.
President Bush is excited about cars of the future. In a recent speech, he told Americans he wants our country to lead the world in building cars that do not pollute the environment.
Auto companies are currently designing cars that will not run on gasoline. They will use other fuel sources that do not pollute the environment. Those cars may be on the road by the time you are old enough to drive.

161,359,"Look out, Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys! Here comes the next hot musical act: the animals!
Scientists recently announced that the music made by several kinds of birds and humpback whales shares some of the notes, rhythms, and harmonies found in music created by people. Scientists say that these animals may also pass songs along to one another, which means animals may be able to learn music.
Roger Payne, one of the scientists studying animal music, says his study ""proves that musical sounds can be enjoyed by all living things.""
Because animals cannot sing in a human language, however, Britney Spears and other pop stars have nothing to worry about!

162,384,"You can say that Mario Lemieux, of the Pittsburgh Penguins, owns the ice in two ways. First, he is one of the greatest hockey players to ever play the game. But he is also the only player in history to play for a team he also owns.
In his first game in three years, Mario Lemieux (le-MEW) reminded hockey fans why he is called ""Super Mario."" He scored a goal and led his team to victory.
Lemieux retired in 1997 at age 31. People usually
or stop working, when they reach age 65 or older, or because of serious illness or injury. Some people retire when they have earned enough money to live on for the rest of their lives. Lemieux came out of his retirement last December.
Since 1991, injuries and illnesses forced Lemieux to quit playing three other times. But each time he returned to play, he came back stronger and faster.
In 1991 and 1992, Lemieux led his team to two Stanley Cups. The Stanley Cup is the trophy given to the National Hockey League's championship team.
In 1999, Lemieux bought the Pittsburgh Penguins team. He is the only athlete in sports history to both own and play for a professional sports team.

With the help of a special camera, scientists recently met unusual creatures. They saw a squid with crooked eyes. They also met the scary-looking viperfish. It has teeth like ice picks!
Scientists uncovered hundreds of underwater species. A species is a type of plant or animal. The discoveries were made in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. That is a
, or underwater, mountain range. It is beneath the Atlantic Ocean.
The Mid-Atlantic Ridge has not been explored much. Scientists often search waters closer to land. The scientists sent vehicles into the water. The vehicles searched waters up to two miles deep. They included cameras that took pictures of the animals. The cameras found that the ridge has a high level of
, or variety of plants and animals in an environment.
The team may have found a new species of ostracod, says lead scientist Monty Priede. An ostracod is a shrimplike animal. ""Usually you do not realize it is a new species until some time later,"" Priede, a science professor from Europe, told
The Mid-Atlantic Ridge still holds secrets to be uncovered. ""The main thing we want to find out is what lives out there and in what quantity,"" Priede says.

Scientists use a robot to study lava near the volcano.
The spewer is called Axial Seamount. It rests at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The peak is about 250 miles from Oregon.

Researchers recently sent a robot down to the volcano to take pictures. They saw that the area was covered in lava. Scientists say the spewer erupted in April.

172,581,"Orangutans have babies only once every eight years.
Orangutans (aw-RANG-oo-tanz) eat and sleep high in the treetops of rain forests. However, these great apes are not safe.
When she was 8 years old, Misha liked to jump up and down on her nest. She played with her food. Sometimes she needed her mothers help to cross from one tree to another.
Misha is one of thousands of orangutans that live in Asia. They are found on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra.
Scientists are worried about the survival of these red-haired apes. They are in danger of becoming
, or dying out. Scientists say orangutans could be extinct in the wild within ten years.
Why are orangutans in such danger? Their
is being destroyed. A habitat is the area where an animal makes its home.
People are the main threat to these apes. Some people cut down trees in the areas where orangutans live. The trees are sold as lumber. In addition, people steal baby orangutans from the forest and sell them as pets.
Do you think it is important to save orangutans? Why?
""Help is needed to save these amazing creatures,"" scientist Cheryl Knott told
. ""As humans, it is our job to protect other animals. If we can save the rain forest for orangutans, we will save it for other animals as well.""

173,778,"So long, mystery meat! School lunches are about to get a lot more
U.S. President Barack Obama recently signed a new law. It requires schools to provide more nutritious food. The law is called the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Its purpose is to help kids be healthier.
This act is about doing whats right for our children, Obama said before signing the law.
So, what will the new law serve up? School officials have to remove sugary drinks and junk food from vending machines. They have to make meals healthier, as well. For example, instead of hot dogs, cafeterias might dish out whole-wheat spaghetti with meat sauce. There will also be more fruits and vegetables on the menu.

174,516,"Theres a new croc on the block! Researchers recently announced finding an ancient crocodile in South America. They dug up the creatures remains in Colombia.
(ack-your-ON-tih-soo-cuss gwa-hee-RAH-en-siss). The croc lived about 60 million years ago.
The giant crocodile lived in a river. That surprised researchers because other types of ancient crocodiles lived mainly in the ocean.
This drawing shows how the snapper may have looked.
The finding may help explain how some crocodiles
when dinosaurs died off. To survive is to live. One of the ways they [survived] was [by] living in lots of different places, Alex Hastings told
. He wrote a study about the new croc.
Life wasnt a snap for the creature, though. It most likely had to battle with the worlds largest snake for food. It was not an easy life even for a 20-foot crocodile, Hastings says.

175,347,"Popcorn is the official state snack food of Illinois.
Its light. Its fluffy. It pops. What is it? Popcorn! And now, it is also the official state snack food of Illinois.
The idea to honor popcorn came from a group of second and third graders. They called themselves the ""Kernel Kids.""
The kids invited a state senator to their school to tell him about their idea. The senator thought it was good and told other officials about the idea. In August, the governor of Illinois signed the popcorn bill. At the ceremony, the guests ate popcorn. The students wore popcorn hats that they had made.

176,674,"Fourth graders at C. A. Farley Elementary School are taking a stand! The students in Hudson, Massachusetts, act out plays to stop bullying.
These kids are acting out against bullies.
The students write skits. Then they perform the scenes for their classmates. One skit focuses on a group of kids that
a student because he wears glasses. To exclude is to leave out. Another is about a kid who stops a boy from sitting at a certain table in the cafeteria.

180,78,"Inauguration Day is filled with events from morning to night. Some are serious, and others are just plain fun! Here are some of the day's top events.
George W. Bush taking the Oath of Office on January 20, 2001, after his first election.
George W. Bush first took the Oath of Office in 2001. That is when he became the 43rd U.S. president. The oath is the only part of the day's events that is required by law. Every president since George Washington has taken this oath.
In 1961, John F. Kennedy gave one of the most famous inaugural addresses. Kennedy was the 35th president of the United States. He said, ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."" What do you think his message meant?
In 1977, Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. president to walk in the inaugural parade. The parade starts at the Capitol and ends at the White House. The White House is the president's home for the next four years. Every president except George Washington has lived there.
An inaugural ball is a formal dance. The first official ball was held in 1809 for President James Madison. So far, no president has attended more inaugural balls than President Bill Clinton in 1997. He and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton attended 14 in one night!
George Washington's inaugural address in 1793 was the shortest. His speech lasted only eight minutes. In 1841, William Henry Harrison gave the longest inaugural address. It lasted almost two hours!
Cold weather caused quite a problem at the inaugural ball for Ulysses S. Grant in 1873. The ball was held in a tent, which wasn't heated, and the valves on the band's musical instruments froze!
In 1981, guests at Ronald Reagan's inaugural balls received a sweet treat. Forty million jelly beans--one of Reagan's favorite candies--were eaten to celebrate!

181,761,"Kids are giving Earth a big hand. They have joined other volunteers in a tree-planting celebration in 10 large cities across the United States. The events are organized by the National Arbor Day Foundation. About 100 trees are being planted in each location.
""I had a fun time planting trees,"" says Jenelle, a thirdgrade student at Wilshire Elementary School in San Antonio, Texas. ""[Trees] are important to animals.""
or clean, the air. They take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. People could not survive if the air had too much carbon dioxide or too little oxygen. The trees are also being planted because they add beauty to city neighborhoods and provide shade.
Arbor Day traces its roots to Nebraska. In 1872, J. Sterling Morton started the holiday in that state because Nebraska was almost treeless. Today, National Arbor Day is celebrated each year on the last Friday in April. This year, it takes place on April 27. Many states, however, celebrate Arbor Day on different dates based on their best tree-planting times. The holiday encourages people to plant and care for trees.
To find out when your state observes Arbor Day and whether the tree-planting project is coming to a city near you, visit

184,723,"Fifty years ago this month, four African American college students took a stand by sitting down. They tried to order food at a store lunch counter that served only white people. Workers at the store in Greensboro, North Carolina, wouldnt take the students orders. At that time, many restaurants in the South refused to serve black people.

caught on. A protest is a public stand against something that people disagree with. Thousands of people started similar protests in other states.
The students actions worked. A few months later on July 26, 1960, the stores lunch counter opened to all people. The protest also helped pave the way for a new law in 1964. That law said businesses had to serve people of all races.
Skip Alston says its important to remember what the students achieved. He is the cofounder of the International Civil Rights Center & Museum in Greensboro. They proved that you can do whatever you set your mind to do, he says.

187,552,"Hundreds of jumbo jellyfish are invading the Sea of Japan. Each creature weighs about 450 pounds and is 6 feet wide!
Scientists arent quite sure what has caused the jellyfish boom, but it is a huge problem. It is affecting the fishing industry in Japan, China, and South Korea.
The jellyfish break fishing nets. They also poison fish caught in the nets.
The three countries recently held a meeting to find ways of dealing with the problem. In the meantime, some people are making the best of it by eating the giant jellyfish! In parts of China, they are a prized food.

188,249,"You may see fewer bats flying around this Halloween. Thousands of them are dying in the northeastern United States. Experts dont know why.
. That is a sickness in which white mold-like patches grow on the bats noses, wings, and tails. It was first spotted on bats in New York in 2007. White-nose syndrome has since spread to bats in four other states.
Spooky! Could these bats white noses be making them sick?
, or strange, things. Bats like to fly at night. However, some of the sick bats have been seen taking wing in daylight.
Scientists are not sure whats killing the bats. They are on a mission to learn more. This fall they will journey into some of the bats caves. They will attach radio transmitters to many of the creatures. That will allow scientists to study their movements and body temperatures. They might learn why bats are dying.
Something is killing the bats, and we dont know what it is, scientist Susi von Oettingen told
. This is just the biggest mystery.

189,507,"Animal experts are worried that cheetahs are in danger of disappearing from parts of Africa.
A mother cheetah rests with her cubs in the tall grass. Their spotted fur helps them stay hidden. The mother cheetah does not know it, but animal experts are tracking her every move.
Most wild cheetahs live in Africa. Animal experts are worried that cheetahs are in danger of disappearing from parts of Africa. One wildlife group in South Africa is trying to protect these big cats.
The group is working to find out how many cheetahs are left in South Africa and where they roam. To track the animals, they use radio collars, cameras, and aircraft. Experts will use what they learn to find ways to save cheetahs.
The biggest threat to cheetahs comes from people. They have built farms on land where the animals live. As farming areas spread, cheetahs often have trouble finding food. In addition, farmers who want to protect their animals sometimes kill cheetahs.
The good news is that there still is hope for cheetahs. The group is helping to move cheetahs away from the farms to other areas in the wild.
""Cheetahs are very, very special,"" said the group's director. ""It would be a great shame if a time came when our children and our children's children were not able to see the cheetah.""
Cheetahs can run 65 miles per hour. That is about as fast as a car driving on a highway!
In one second, cheetahs can run about 92 feet.
Cheetahs can run fast for only a short distance about a quarter of a mile.

196,266,"Colin Carlson may be young, but hes got a big message: Save energy to save the world.
The 12-year-old from Coventry, Conn., runs the Cool Coventry Club. The club teaches people how to
, or save, energy. More than 600 families have joined Colins club. The student recently won a Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes for his work.
Each member of the Cool Coventry Club has to promise to use less energy in at least three ways. The changes can help people save money and Earth at the same time, Colin says.
Turn off the light when you leave a room. Turn off the water when youre brushing your teeth, Colin told
. Its little things like that that really make a big difference.

197,519,"This discovery will knock your socks off! Scientists recently found footprints that are more than a million years old.
The footprints are in Kenya. That is a country in Africa. An early human
, or relative from the past, may have made the prints. The feet that made the prints had rounded heels and big toes that point forward, just like people have today.
U.S. scientist John Harris helped discover the special prints. He and his team found four sets of adult footprints in the area. They also found tracks of animals such as lions.
The footprints could teach people a lot about what Earth was like a million years ago. Figuring that out is like a giant jigsaw puzzle, Harris told reporters.

198,65,"Imagine staring into the face of a 3,300-year-old king. That is what scientists in Egypt recently did. Egypt is a country in Africa. Scientists displayed the
of King Tutankhamen (too-tahn-KAH-mun) for the first time in history. A mummy is a body that has been prepared to last for a long time.
King Tut became the ruler of Egypt when he was 9 years old. He ruled for 10 years. Tut died at age 19. His
, or burial place, was discovered in 1922.
Tut was buried wearing a gold mask. Scientists removed it to show the king's blackened face. The team also moved the mummy into a special glass case to protect it. ""The face of the golden boy is amazing,"" spokesperson Zahi Hawass said inside the tomb. ""It has magic, and it has mystery.""

199,596,"The Galpagos Islands are a group of islands located in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of South America. The islands are home to some of the world's
or most unusual, animals and plants. In January, those islands had a brush with disaster.
On January 16, a ship carrying oil got stuck on a
is a chain of rocks or coral near the surface of the water.) The islands are located in the Pacific Ocean about 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador. Scientists say the oil spill put many of the islands' animals in danger.
The oil spill happened near San Cristbal and Santa Fe islands, in the eastern area of the Galpagos. Cleanup workers said the oil killed two pelicans and dirtied 40 others. Workers said some sea lions, birds, and tortoises also needed to be cleaned.
Oil can make animals sick if they swallow it. When oil covers an animal's fur or feathers, it can't swim, fly, or stay warm. If the oil is not cleaned off the animal, it could die.
The oil spill also harmed life in the water. Many sea plants, such as algae (AL-jee), were also damaged by the oil spill. Sea plants are an important food source for many Galpagos animals.
Days after the accident, however, the islands were spared further damage. Ocean currents took the oil out to sea, away from the islands.
What could be done to prevent such oil spills?

202,684,"Scientists put on their detective hats in search of giant pandas.
Scientists were on the case! They collected clues. The scientists saw paw prints in the mud and fur on the bark of trees. What were they doing? Counting giant pandas!
After four years, the detective work is done. During that time, scientists figured out how many pandas live in China. All wild giant pandas live in that country.
""Pandas are very hard to see in the wild,"" scientist Colby Loucks told
. ""They hide in the thick bamboo forests."" That is why scientists used clues to do the count.
The result of the panda count was a surprise to scientists. They learned that hundreds more pandas exist than experts once thought! ""We found pandas living in areas we didn't know had any,"" said Loucks.
Is it important to protect endangered animals? Why?
Although the news is good, pandas remain
. That means they are in danger of dying out.
A Panda spends 14 hours a day eating up to 83 pounds of bamboo.
A Newborn panda weighs 3 to 4 ounces. That is about the size a hamster.
A panda's front paws have a wrist bone. The bone works like a thumb. The panda uses it to grasp bamboo.
loss. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal lives. Panda habitat is lost when people cut down parts of the forest for wood and farming.
Currently, China has more than 40 giant panda nature centers. People are not allowed to cut down trees there. Scientists want to create more nature centers to give pandas a better chance for survival.

. A carnivore is a meat eater. A herbivore is a plant eater.
Like other carnivores, this dinosaur had sharp claws and could move fast. At the same time, it had teeth shaped for eating leaves, and a long neck to reach tall trees.
The fossils are an important discovery, say scientists. They hope it will help them understand how the dinosaurs changed from a diet of meat to one of plants.

205,503,"Do you spend a lot of time watching television or surfing the Internet? While you may be having fun, you may also be missing out on something else-staying fit!
The American Heart Association (AHA) recently reported that many U.S. kids are not getting enough exercise. The AHA recommends kids get at least 30 minutes of exercise three to four times each week.
The AHA report says that about 15 out of every 100 kids ages 6 to 11 are overweight. Being overweight can lead to health problems like heart disease and diabetes later in life.
To help kids stay fit and have fun, some schools are adding a new twist to gym class. In some elementary schools, students are really climbing the walls-indoor rock-climbing walls! Other schools are offering activities such as dancing, in-line skating, and kite flying.
Teachers want kids to develop good fitness habits that will last a lifetime. ""We're hoping that students find activities that they enjoy doing and that they'll continue doing for the rest of their lives,"" said gym teacher Reid Chase.

208,72,"Tough Talkin'!: Discussing Bullies and Other Problems
It's not easy being a kid. That's what a recent national survey of kids and parents revealed. Bullying and violence at school are just some of the problems facing many kids today. How can kids cope with such tough issues?
""Tough issues are facing kids at younger ages,"" said Tina Hoff of the Kaiser Family Foundation. The group is a children's health organization. The foundation, Children Now (a children's research group), and Nickelodeon asked children ages 8 to 15 and parents to point out the tough issues kids deal with every day.
The survey, called Talking With Kids About Tough Issues, found that
about seven out of ten kids say bullying and teasing are problems at their school.
about four out of ten kids say kids at their school face threats of violence.
about seven out of ten kids in the survey say they are too embarrassed about their problems to talk to parents.
Other issues children say are problems at school include smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and using drugs.
The survey found that when parents talk early about tough issues, kids learn to trust them more. Those kids who learn to talk to parents learn how to deal with problems that bother them.
What are some problems that kids at your school face?

210,100,"Overfishing and melting ice spell trouble for penguins.
Life is good for penguins in Antarctica at the end of the movie
Real-life penguins, though, have little to celebrate.
Twelve of the world's 19 penguin species face major threats, according to wildlife experts. They are in danger of becoming
or dying out completely. This list includes emperor penguins.
""Many of the world's penguin species are in big trouble,"" penguin expert Kassie Siegel told
Her wildlife group is asking the U.S. government to protect the 12 threatened species of penguins.
Overfishing is partly to blame for the problem. Penguins eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called
Fishing boats are catching large amounts of krill. That leaves less food for penguins to eat.
Another reason for the decline in the number of penguins is global warming. Global warming is the slow increase in average temperature around the world. It is causing sea ice to melt. Penguins need the floating sea ice as a place to rest while they search for krill.
Scientists say people contribute to global warming when they drive cars or use electricity. That burns
such as coal, oil, and natural gas. The burning of fossil fuels gives off gases that add to the overheating of Earth. ""We can and must reduce gas emissions to keep penguins safe in the future,"" says Siegel.
What can people do to reduce their use of fossil fuels?

211,788,"Trained rats may soon be used to find survivors who are trapped after disasters.
Meet the soon-to-be members of rescue teams--rats! Scientists are training the rodents to help find people who are buried in buildings after earthquakes and other disasters.
Rats have a strong sense of smell, which can help them sniff out people. The rodents are also tiny enough to crawl just about anywhere. They can get into places that are too small for people and other animals, such as dogs.
Scientists trained the rats to search for the scent of people. They attached tiny electronic devices to the brain of each rat. Signals from the rat's brain are sent to a radio that is strapped to the animal's back. Rescue teams will be able to track the signals and follow the rat's path. That will help them figure out where to start digging. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next six months.

What happened to them? Are the creatures still out there, or are they
? Something that is extinct is gone completely.
Those are questions that scientists hope to answer. They recently set out around the world in search of those and other long-missing
An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Frogs, toads, and salamanders are amphibians.
Where in the world is this green frog?
The experts are looking for about 100 species. They are searching at least 14 countries on five continents. They will look for the salamander in North America. They hope to find the scarlet frog in South America. Theyre also looking for species in Africa, Asia, and Australia.
Scientists are hopeful that theyll find the amphibiansand soon! If the creatures are out there, they may need help. Many amphibians are
Something that is endangered is at risk of becoming extinct. The animals face dangers including pollution and diseases. Loggers cut down the forests where they live.
If researchers can find the missing critters, they might be able to figure out how to save them, explains expert Robin Moore. He began searching for the amphibians earlier this month.
This search will tell us a lot about how amphibians are doing, Moore told
I dont know what we will find, but that makes the search even more exciting.
Scientists hunt for missing amphibians is under way. Read about some of the species they hope to find.
This salamander is a mystery to scientists. Experts found a few of the critters more than 100 years ago, but none have been seen since.
Experts first discovered this frog in 1914 in eastern Australia. It may be extinct because of disease and habitat loss.
Scientists hope to find this spotted toad in rivers and rain forests in Ecuador. The animal faces threats including pollution and disease.
Why might scientists want to keep track of the worlds animal species?

213,689,"Some projects take longer than others. The Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota is one of them. Workers started carving the giant rock sculpture in 1948. They are still working on it today.
The memorial honors Chief Crazy Horse. Native American leaders chose to honor him because he was one of their heroes. Chief Crazy Horse was a Native American who fought for his people's right to their land and traditions.
When will the sculpture be finished? No one knows for sure. All that matters is that it's going forward, said the project manager.

214,355,"Aw, nuts! The price of peanut butter is on the rise. A jar that cost $3.25 a few months ago could now cost about $4.50.
Whats behind the pricey peanut butter? In a nutshell, there arent enough peanuts to go around. Fewer farmers in the United States are planting them. Peanuts ... are more expensive to grow [than some other crops], peanut expert David Jordan told
Americans eat about 1.5 billion pounds of peanuts each year.
peanut crops. To harm is to hurt. Some Southern states had very little rain this past summer.
The peanut butter jam doesnt have to spread, experts say. The high prices could encourage more farmers to plant peanuts next spring. More peanuts could mean cheaper peanut butter. Thats one way to get the peanut gallery cheering!

215,335,"Asian elephants are running out of space and time. Their
or the place where they usually live, has been shrinking. Scientists warn that Asian elephants could disappear if nothing is done to help them.
In Asia, humans and elephants are fighting over land. The forests where many elephants live are being cut down by loggers. The land that elephants live on is also being turned into farms. Many elephants have been killed when they cross into farms looking for food.
Scientists say the fight for land between elephants and humans is hurting both sides. Elephants kill around 300 people each year in India. In the last ten years, the elephant population in Vietnam has dropped from about 2,000 to fewer than 100.
Scientists for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) say there are about 35,000 to 50,000 Asian elephants left in the wild. That is a
or drop, from the 100,000 Asian elephants that were in the wild in 1900.
The map shows Asian countries. Elephants in these countries, scientists warn, are in danger of becoming extinct, or dying out.

9 to 10 feet tall at the shoulder (male)
9 feet tall at the shoulder (female)
8 feet tall at the shoulder (female)
Most males have tusks. If present, female tusks are small.
The WWF is an organization that works to save endangered animals. According to a recent WWF report, many Asian elephants are being killed for their meat, skin, and ivory tusks.
Elizabeth Kemf, a WWF scientist, says that world governments should set aside land for Asian elephants. Efforts to save the Asian elephants are important, she says, because the elephants belong ""not only to Asia, but all the world's people.""
More people live in Asia than on any other continent. How might that affect the Asian elephant population?

Talk about hide-and-seek! Scientists in Asia recently discovered more than 350 plant and animal species. The species were found in the Himalayas (hi-muh-LAY-uhss). Those are mountains in southern Asia.
One of the species has researchers hopping for joy. It is a flying frog. The bright green animal was found in India. It uses its long, webbed feet to
Another discovery is the leaf deer. It is the worlds smallest deer. Its only about 25 to 30 inches tall. Researchers found the animal in the nearby country of Myanmar.
The scientists made the discoveries from 1998 to 2008. Besides India and Myanmar, they looked in

The researchers uncovered flowers and a snake. They also found a monkey. It is the first new type of monkey to be discovered in more than 100 years.
Experts are excited about the discoveries, but they are also worried. The species
, or home, is in trouble. Loggers are cutting down trees in the Himalayas. To protect the mountains, nature groups are asking countries to guard the land from people trying to destroy it.
In the meantime, scientists are continuing to search the Himalayas for more plants and animals. There will be close to 3,000 to 5,000 species that [could] be discovered ... over the next five years, says wildlife expert Bittu Sahgal.
Heres a look at some of the plants and animals that caught scientists attention while they were studying the Himalayas.

(an-TE-nee)! Those are organs that help butterflies smell and find food. But thats not all they do.
Butterfly: AP Images; Antenna: Photo Researchers, Inc.
This is what a butterflys antenna looks like close-up.
A new study shows that antennae help monarchs find their way during
That is the movement from one place to another when the seasons change. Every fall, millions of monarchs fly from Canada and the United States to Mexico.
The insects use the sun to make their way south. Their antennae track the suns location. That helps the butterflies stay on the right path.
Butterflies without antennae dont fly in the correct direction, Steven Reppert told
. He was the leader of the study. That was a real surprise to us.
The discovery may help monarchs. People are cutting down trees in their habitat in Mexico. We might be able to guide the butterflies to ... different areas, Reppert says.

219,264,"Why do some plants and animals die out?
Venice is a famous city in Italy. It is built on small islands. To get around the city, people travel by boat. Over the years, Venice has been sinking slowly into the sea. Water levels are rising and causing flooding. The city needs help to stay above water.
The government of Italy has a plan to save the city from floods. Government officials want to build a system of gates. The gates would block the seawater from flooding the city.
The gates would take about ten years to complete. If the plan is a success, Venice will be saved from being swallowed by the sea.

Coral reefs are important to ocean life. The reefs are home to thousands of
, or kinds, of sea creatures. ""If you didn't have the reefs, you wouldn't have the fish or the pretty sponges or soft corals that wave back and forth,"" said scientist Richard Dodge.
Coral polyps create hard skeletons around themselves. The skeletons form coral reefs. The skeletons are made of calcium. Calcium is the same thing that makes up your skeleton! When coral polyps die, they leave behind their skeletons. Young polyps attach themselves to the old skeletons.
A recent report says many coral reefs in U.S. waters are in bad health. The polyps that make the reefs are in danger of dying. Scientists, such as the ones in Florida, are trying to save the reefs.
Coral reefs face many threats. Millions of tourists visit coral reefs every year. People kill corals by simply touching them. Ships that drop anchors on the reefs can damage them. Other threats include storms, pollution, and disease.
Scientists want to make the public aware of the threat to coral reefs. They are using the report on coral reefs to do just that. ""It's a valuable tool for raising public awareness about the global decline of these unique treasures,"" said government official Craig Manson.
Why might it be important to protect coral reefs?

224,196,"A new food program helps kids cook up healthy habits.
If you are what you eat, then students at MacGregor Elementary School are fresh fruits and vegetables!
Kids at the school in Houston chow down on everything from strawberries to sweet potatoes. They grow all the food themselves in a school garden. Then they
the fruits and veggies and turn them into healthy meals. To harvest is to collect.
The students got their green thumbsand their appetites for fresh foodfrom the Recipe for Success Foundation. That group teaches kids about the food they eat. We make good food fun, says Gracie Cavnar, the groups founder.
, or working, chefs help students to make a
of meals. A variety is many different types. Some recipes call for foods that the kids may not have had before, such as tofu. But the students promise to try everything that they cook.
Travoyie McCardell, 9, ended up loving the chicken masala pizza that he made with his classmates. It tastes like chicken and vegetables and spices and herbs all mixed into one big meal, the third grader told
The program doesnt just get kids eating healthy at school. It also can change the way their families eat. Students get to bring home recipes to try with their parents. We used to eat out 24-7, Travoyie says. Now we just eat out a few times a month.
What does it take for a tiny seed to turn into a leafy plant? Lets take a look to find out.
 Seeds need water and oxygen to grow. Most seeds grow best between 65 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
 After a seed takes in water, a root pushes out from the seed. The root collects water and minerals from the soil.
 A stem and leaves come out of the seed and grow upward. The stem brings water and minerals to the leaves.
 The leaves use sunlight to make food for the plant. That process is called
Why might some kids be more willing to eat foods that they grow themselves?

225,154,"Adriana Valencia has a new look--a short haircut! The fifth grader from Montrose, California, donated her long hair to Wigs for Kids. Wigs for Kids is a charity that helps children who have lost their hair because of illnesses.
recently talked to Adriana about her donation.
Adriana, what made you decide to donate your hair?
I grew my hair out to 12 inches. I wanted to do something for kids who had lost their hair. My cousin had leukemia, so I know what it's like for some kids [who lose their hair].
How can kids help other kids who have lost their hair besides by donating their own hair?

231,591,"Look, Mano hands! A van recently traveled from Europe to Asia without a driver. It used
to get around. Sensors are instruments that can notice heat, light, and sound. The vehicle also used electricity instead of gas.
The driverless van takes a passenger for a spin.
The van journeyed 8,077 miles. It made the trip in three months. Two scientists stayed in the van in case anything went wrong. One time, they had to take control when the vehicle was stopped by a police officer. The officer almost gave the experts a ticket because there was no driver! Once they explained that the drive was an experiment, he let them go.
We are happy we made it to the finishing line without any real problems, says Alberto Broggi. He works for the company that created the van. The company hopes that one day, robotic cars will make driving safer. Now if only they could make a robot to clean your room!

234,557,"A rocket, with the orbiter on top, was launched in August from Cape Canaveral, Florida.
A spacecraft speeds toward the Red Planet. Scientists hope the trip will lead to answers.
In many books and movies, little green aliens from Mars invade Earth. In real life, Mars is the planet being invadedby strange-looking machines from Earth.
In August, NASA, the U.S. space agency, launched a spacecraft to Mars. It is called an orbiter because it will
, or circle, the fourth planet from the sun. Right now, the orbiter is speeding toward Mars. Scientists expect it to reach the Red Planet in March.
The orbiter will join two robots, called rovers, that are already there. They have been rolling around on the surface of the planet for more than two years. They are searching for signs of water.
Mars is cold and dry. Scientists think the planet was once a warmer and wetter place. Evidence of water can mean that life once existed on Mars.
The orbiter will look for signs of water. It is expected to spend at least two years studying Mars. It will scan Mars with the largest telescope camera ever sent to a planet. The orbiter's radar will look for water beneath the planet's surface. It will also search for landing spots to prepare for future human missions to Mars.
This is an artists depiction of the spacecraft as it nears Mars.
""This orbiter is going to look much farther and with more detail than what the rovers could do,"" NASA's Ramon DePaula told
. ""We are going to bring back more data than all other missions to Mars combined.""
Mars is called the Red Planet because its soil is a reddish color.
Like Earth, Mars has mountains and valleys.
The largest volcano in the solar system, called Olympus Mons, is on Mars.
Even in the summer, the temperature on the planet's surface is below zero.
Why is water needed for life to exist?

235,252,"Scientists find a pyramid buried in sand in Egypt.
Scientists digging in Egypt recently found a big surprisea pyramid! They uncovered the
, or very old, structure under 65 feet of sand. Egypt is a country in Africa.
There was so much sand dumped here that no one had any idea there was something buried underneath, says Zahi Hawass, an Egyptian
. That is a person who studies people and cultures of the past.
, or guesses, that the monument is 4,300 years old. It might be the burial place for an Egyptian queen named Sesheshet.
Sesheshets pyramid was bigger when it was built, experts say. It probably stood 45 feet tall, and each side was 72 feet long. Wind and sand have worn away the top of the pyramid. The remains are only 16 feet tall.
A worker cleans an ancient scene painted on one of the pyramids blocks.
Hawass and his team are busy digging to find more of the pyramid. They hope to get inside the structure to the
That is a room where a persons body was put after he or she died. Markings inside the room might say for sure who was buried there.
Scientists dont expect to find much else inside the burial chamber. That is because robbers most likely found the pyramid long ago. They probably took any gold or other treasures that were inside.
Still, finding the pyramid is important, scientists say. To find a new pyramid is always exciting, Hawass explains. And this one is magical. It belonged to a queen.
People have lived in Egypt for about 5,000 years. Early Egyptians invented forms of math and writing. They had the first national government.
The Sahara is the worlds largest desert. It covers most of the country. The Nile River runs through Egypt. It is the longest river in the world.
The Great Pyramid is the worlds largest pyramid. The Great Sphinx is located nearby. It has the body of a lion and the head of a human.

Tornado in Union City, Oklahoma, May 24, 1973
season in the United States. A tornado is a powerful, spinning wind. It travels quickly and can destroy everything in its path. Tornado season, which lasts for several months, is the time these twisters are most common.
The National Weather Service recently said it will change the tornado rating system next year. The strength of a tornado will continue to be rated on a scale from 0 (weakest) to 5 (most powerful). However, the new rating system will be more exact.
Under the old system, tornadoes with wind speed of about 300 miles per hour were given the rating 5. Studies have shown that slower winds can cause as much damage. The new system rates a tornado 5 if wind speed is at least 200 miles per hour.
Adverbs are words that describe verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. They tell where, how, or when. Examples are

, or dug up, fossils of the worlds largest snake. Colombia is a country in South America.
(ty-ta-noh-BOH-uh sai-rah-HOH-nen-siss). It weighed 2,500 pounds and measured about 42 feet long. Its
, or huge, body was at least 3 feet wide.
This thing ... [was] longer than a city bus, says Jack Conrad, a snake expert.
lived between 58 million and 60 million years ago, experts believe. So far, a team of scientists has found about 180 fossils from more than 20
snakes. The fossils include backbones and ribs. The scientists plan to return to Colombia to look for more bones.
Experts also hope to learn whatand how much

241,275,"One kissed a yak. One jumped from a plane. One ate fried worms. Do you think thats insane? Possibly, but it was all for a need. School principals were challenging students to read!
Those crazy stunts by school principals were all for Read Across America Day. The celebration takes place each year on March 2. That date is the birthday of childrens book author Dr. Seuss (19041991). Millions of kids have learned to read through his silly and clever rhymes.

247,504,"You are playing outside when it begins to rain. The rain gets heavier. You run for cover. Thunder roars overhead. Giant streaks of lightning flash across the sky.
When people think of lightning, they generally picture it as a single bolt. However, scientists have recently reported that one flash of lightning often strikes in more than one place. It is common for lightning to fork, or split, and strike in two or more places, scientists say.
Lightning is a flow of electricity. A flash of lightning can heat the air around it to up to 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun!
When lightning heats the air around it, the air expands and makes a loud crashing sound-thunder. If you hear thunder, you are within striking distance of lightning. ""Anytime you hear thunder, you should immediately move to a safe area,"" said scientist E. Philip Krider. Safe places include a school, house, or car.
While it is unusual for people to be struck by lightning, it does happen. According to the National Weather Service, lightning causes nearly 300 injuries and 100 deaths in the United States each year.
Watching a lightning storm may be exciting, but it can also be dangerous. Just keep in mind the power of nature and watch from a safe place indoors.
Whether you are outdoors or indoors during a thunderstorm, it is important to stay safe.
Try to find shelter in a car or building.
Avoid water, high places, and open spaces.
Do not use a corded telephone. Lightning can strike phone lines.
Avoid using the sink or shower. Lightning can travel through water pipes.

249,392,"Scientists are developing a sticky tape based on the hairs on a gecko's foot.
Move over, Spider-Man! Now you don't have to be a comic-book superhero to creep up walls. Scientists have recently invented a powerful tape. Someday, people may be able to use it to climb walls.
To make the tape, scientists studied gecko lizards. The little lizards are great climbers. They can cling to smooth walls and hang from glass ceilings.
What is the secret to the gecko's power? A gecko has millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of its feet. The hairs create a natural force between the gecko's feet and the wall.
Scientists modeled the new tape after the feet of geckos. The tape is covered with billions of tiny plastic hairs. ""It's like Velcro,"" said one scientist.
It will be a long time before the sticky tape is ready for people to use. One scientist believes it may be ready in five years. Until then, the little lizards are still the climbing champions!

The current wind conditions are also perfect for storms, he says. Stronger hurricanes form when the speed and direction of wind is the same along much of the East Coast of the United States.
The worst of the storms may be over soon. Usually by mid-October, [they] dont really affect the United States anymore, Bell says.

251,1,"People who live in poverty do not have enough money, food, and medical care for a healthy life.
Fifteen-year-old Matthew Hector called on a crowd of20,000 people to fight world poverty. He was one of many people who spoke out at a recent

The rally launched a worldwide campaign called ""Make Poverty History."" The goal is to challenge world leaders to end poverty.
do not have enough money, food, and medical care for a healthy life. More than a billion people around the world are poor. About half of those people are children. Many of the poorest countries are in Africa.
One of the most famous speakers at the rally was Nelson Mandela. He is the former president of South Africa. Mandela urged people to help those in need. He said, ""While [there is poverty], there is no true freedom.""
Many of the world's poorest countries are in Africa.
If you wanted to inspire others to help poor countries, what would you say?
In his speech, Mandela challenged world leaders not to ""look the other way"" from the problem of poverty. In July, leaders of the eight wealthiest countries, including the United States, will meet in Scotland. They have promised to take action to end poverty. Mandela and other supporters of ""Make Poverty History"" hope that world leaders keep their promise.

252,339,"A rover like this one is making its way across the surface of Mars in search of life.
Is there life on Mars? Was there once life on Mars? People have been trying to answer those questions for years. Since 1960, scientists have sent spacecraft to explore the Red Planet.
NASA* recently launched two rovers into space. Scientists chose the launch date carefully. In August, Mars and Earth were closer than at any time in the past 60,000 years.
The rovers are on a mission. They are looking for signs that water once existed on Mars. Scientists say that water is the key to life. If they find evidence of water, that could mean there was once life on Mars.
The rovers each have a parachute and an airbag to help them bounce to a safe landing. Once the rovers land, they will drill into rocks and take photos of them. Then, the rovers will send the photos back to Earth.
Distance from Earth on August 27, 2003:
Mars is more like Earth than any other planet in our solar system. Mars has mountains, valleys, and ice caps. It also has seasons.
Scientists are hoping the rovers will provide clues to the Red Planet's past. The mission may also give scientists clues to Earth's future. ""We think Mars used to be more like Earth,"" said one scientist. ""Now look at it: It's harsh and cold. We know Earth is changing; this might help us understand how it has changed, and will [change] in the future.""
The names of the rovers are Spirit and Opportunuty. They were named by 9 year old Sofi Collis of Arizona. She was the winner of a rover naming contest.
Why are people interested in finding out of there is, or once was, life on Mars?

253,289,"Some students in Pennsylvania recently made a hair-raising find. The kids at Landisville Intermediate Center discovered a
hair. Mastodons were furry, elephant-like animals. The creatures lived until about 10,000 years ago.
The students uncovered the hair while working on the Mastodon Matrix Project. That project allows volunteers to study material from sites where the remains of mastodons were found.
The class used paintbrushes to comb through the dirt. It felt like I was a scientist, Katie Minnich told
Students (above) found a hair that belonged to a mastodon.
Buried within the soil was the 8-inch-long hair. Each student studied the strand using a magnifying glass. They knew it did not come from a human, a dog, or a cat. It felt like a wire, explains Cameron Aksu.
The students were amazed at their brush with history. It was really cool, says Allee Glinsky. We knew [the hair was] a part of something really old.

257,561,"You may think of your cat as just a pet, but if you lived in ancient Egypt, you might consider the animal a god! Egypt is a country in Africa. Cats were considered
or holy, in that country long ago. In fact,
there recently found a building dedicated to a cat goddess. An archaeologist is a person who studies ancient people and cultures.
The building is 200 feet high and 49 feet wide. It is more than 2,000 years old and is filled with about 600 cat statues. Many are of the cat goddess Bastet (below). Ancient Egyptians prayed to her to protect women and children.

259,553,"The King memorial takes shape on the National Mall.
A piece of the nation's capital will honor an important leaderDr. Martin Luther King Jr. A memorial for King is being built on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. It will be the first memorial on the Mall to honor an African American.
A ceremony was held on November 13 to mark the start of construction. President George W. Bush and other leaders were among the thousands of people who gathered for the event.
""When the work is done, the King memorial will be a fitting tributepowerful and hopeful and poeticlike the man it honors,"" Bush said at the ceremony.
If all goes as planned, the memorial will be finished in 2008. It will have trees, flowing water, and a 30-foot statue of King. Quotes from King's speeches will be carved into a stone wall.
King (19291968) grew up in the U.S. South. At that time, the South was
or separated by race. Under the law, black people were not allowed to attend the same schools as white people. They were forced to sit in the backseats of buses. They also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains.
King worked to change the laws by giving speeches and leading peaceful marches. Thanks to King and other leaders,
were passed. Those laws make sure that all Americans are treated equally.
On August 28, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech in Washington, D.C. A crowd of more than 200,000 people came to hear him. In his speech, King said, ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.""

260,638,"Scientists are testing Columbus's bones to settle a dispute over where he is buried.
Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492. He made four trips to the part of the world that later became known as North America.
When Columbus died in 1506, his remains were placed in a box. The box was first buried in Spain. It was later moved to the Dominican Republic. That is an island in the Caribbean Sea. It is where Columbus wanted to be buried.
The Dominican Republic was once under Spanish rule. When Spain lost control of the island, officials moved the box again. Spain claims to have the explorer's remains. But so does the Dominican Republic. People have been arguing about it for 100 years!
Scientists recently opened the box in Spain where Columbus is thought to be buried. They are now doing tests on the bones found there. The scientists hope to finally settle the argument.

261,476,"There was a time when all a backpack was used for was to carry school books and papers. But today, backpacks are being weighed down by many things, such as laptop computers, sneakers, CDs, and video games.

263,107,"The worlds great apes are in danger. Many countries are working together to help them. Can these animals be saved in time?
Like all great apes, chimpanzees are in danger of losing their habitat.
Time is running out for the great apes. If no action is taken, they may soon be extinct, say experts. The great apes include gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, and bonobos. Orangutans live in Indonesia, a country in Asia. The other great apes live in Africa.
More than 20 countries, mostly in Africa, recently signed a
to save the great apes. A pledge is a promise. At one time, millions of these animals lived in the wild. As few as 350,000 of them exist today.
Saving the great apes from dying out is no easy task. The animals face many threatsmost of them from humans. One of the biggest threats is the loss of habitat. Some people illegally cut down trees in the areas where great apes live.
Another threat to great apes is illegal hunting. People have eaten meat from wild animals for thousands of years.
""We have not treated [the great apes] with the respect they deserve,"" says Kofi Annan. He is the secretary-general of the United Nations. That is a group of countries that work together to solve world problems.
Although saving the great apes will not be easy, experts think the pledge is a step in the right direction. ""The great apes still have a chance,"" says Annan, ""but their fate lies entirely in our hands.""

264,135,"Almost 1 billion people dont have clean water, a report finds.
What do you do when youre thirsty? Chances are you get a glass of water from the sink. Not everyone can do that. In fact, almost 1 billion people around the world dont have clean drinking water.
A boy in Africa stands near a water pump. It is the only source of water in his village.
Thats the finding of a new report by world aid groups. The study looked at the living conditions of people around the globe. Many have to walk hours each day to collect water from rivers. Often that water is not safe to drink, because its dirty.
About 2.6 billion people dont have safe places to go to the bathroom, the report says. Lakshmi, 11, lives in a poor village in India. That is a country in Asia. For a long time, her school did not have bathrooms. She and her classmates had to use bushes outside.
World leaders say its important for kids such as Lakshmi to have good
or cleanliness. Drinking clean water and washing your hands after using the bathroom can help prevent diseases.
pipes around the world. To install is to set up. The pipes give people water in their homes. Aid workers also teach people how to
or clean, rainwater. They are even building bathrooms. Thats made a difference for Lakshmi. My school has toilets now, she says.
Still, there is a lot more to do, aid worker Clarissa Brocklehurst says. We must act now as one ... community to [supply] water and [good hygiene] for all.
How much water do you use? A lot! On average, each American goes through about 100 gallons of water a day. Thats enough to fill 1,600 drinking glasses! Here are some tips to
Keep your pearly whites clean, but be sure to shut off the faucet while you brush. That can save about 8 gallons of water a day.
Put away that rubber ducky. Taking a bath can use up to 70 gallons of water, while showering uses just 10 to 25 gallons of water.
In one day, a faucet can drip more than 20 gallons of water, and a leaky toilet can waste 200 gallons! Ask an adult to stop the drips.
How would your life be different without running water in your home?

265,528,"Holy cow! Some kids are trading in hamburgers for foods that dont have meat. About 367,000 children in the United States are
, according to a recent study. A vegetarian is a person who does not eat meat. That includes beef, pork, chicken, and fish.
Researchers talked to thousands of parents about their kids diets. Some families think its healthier to eat more fruits and veggies instead of meat. Other young vegetarians dont want to eat meat because it comes from animals.
Some health experts, though, are worried about children being vegetarians. They say kids might not get all the vitamins their growing bodies need. Meat provides iron and protein.
Others think young people can be healthy without meat. Food scientist Amy Lanou says kids should eat many different types of healthy meals.
Look for a variety of whole, colorful foods, Lanou told
. They will help you get all the nutrients you need.

266,137,"This is my pet parakeet, Polly. We live in Polling Place. Polly is a smart bird. In fact, she's so smart, she can count very high numbers. This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Keep reading to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's As Easy As One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart (below).
So what's the result? Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

267,606,"Knock, Knock? Who's there? The ivory-billed woodpecker, that's who!
The ivory-billed woodpecker has bird lovers cheering. They thought the bird was extinct. Now scientists say they have proof that the woodpecker still lives in Arkansas. They have a videotape of the bird in flight.
Why did the rare bird disappear? Between 1880 and the 1940s, loggers cut down the forests where the bird lived. The last sighting of the bird was in 1944.
The ivorybill is the largest woodpecker in the United States. Its call sounds like the toot of a tin horn. The bird is also known for its
or one-of-a-kind, tapping sound. It makes a double knock when its beak strikes a tree.
Some people didn't think the videotape was enough proof, so the scientists recorded the bird's double knock. The recording made believers out of everyone. Hear the bird's double knock at

268,301,"Would you believe a nickel could be worth a million dollars? That's how much a coin dealer recently offered to pay for one.
The coin is rare. It's a 1913 Liberty Head nickel. Only five of them were made at the U.S. Mint. The nickel had been missing for more than 40 years.
The last owner of the nickel was a man from North Carolina. When he died in 1962, he left the rare coin to his family. However, they thought it was a fake and kept it in a closet.
A few months ago, the coin dealer announced a million-dollar reward for the nickel. That's when the family took it to the dealer and learned it was the real thing!
The family decided not to sell the nickel right away. If they do sell it, experts say the coin could go for more than 2 million dollars. ""It's like holding a winning lottery ticket,"" said the coin dealer.

failure. A power grid is a system that controls the flow of electricity. In many places, the electricity was out for 48 hours.
The power came back on, but the problem is not over. Experts say a future blackout is possible. They say that the grid is carrying more electricity than it can handle.
President George W. Bush called the power failure a ""wake-up call."" He said that the power system is old and needs to be fixed.
Officials are trying to come up with ways to solve the problem. One idea is to build new power lines. Another idea is to update the old system. The goal is the same: to prevent future blackouts.

? A scavenger is an animal that feeds on dead animals.
For years, scientists have been debating that question. Now a new exhibit at the Natural History Museum in London, England, gives evidence for both sides.
""Everything says this dinosaur lived on dead meat,"" said American scientist Jack Horner. He helped the museum prepare for the exhibit.
Scientists once believed that T. rex was a fast runner. But recent studies have shown that might not be true. Horner says that
was not fast enough to catch other dinosaurs. He also says that its arms were too small to use for grabbing prey. Prey is an animal hunted by another animal for food.
means ""tyrant lizard king."" Tyrant means ""cruel ruler.""
Other scientists don't agree with Horner. They argue that
wasn't fast, they say, it could have hunted slower dinosaurs. Scientists also say that
did not need its arms to hunt. Animals without arms, such as sharks and snakes, hunt prey.
have been both a hunter and a scavenger? One museum official thinks ""the truth lies somewhere in the middle."" It is up to visitors to think like scientists and decide for themselves. What do you think?
Why is it important to study both sides of an argument?

In 2005, Danny Way became the first person to jump over the Great Wall on a skateboard. Over the years, many tourists have climbed the famous wall. Others have jumped over the wall on motorcycles.
Parties and stunts have caused serious damage to the Great Wall, say officials. The Chinese government has now issued new rules to protect the famous landmark.
The Great Wall is the longest structure ever built. It twists and turns for more than 4,000 miles through China. Parts of the wall are more than 2,000 years old.

272,138,"Spiders may not like to eat sweet treats, but they sure know some tricks! Scientists recently learned that certain spiders build
of themselves. A decoy is something used to trick or trap something or someone.
The spiders live in Taiwan. That is part of China, which is a country in Asia. The spiders build the decoys in their webs. They make the fake crawlers to protect themselves from wasps. The spiders use dead insects and other materials to make the decoys. The decoys are about the same size and shape as the spiders.
Spiders may be the only creatures other than humans to make life-size models of their own bodies, according to researchers. Our study seems to be the first to [show] animal-made decoys, scientist I-Min Tso told reporters.
The spiders plan to trick wasps works, researchers say. The insects often think the decoys are real. When wasps attack the fake spiders, the real critters quickly crawl away.
Not even Spider-Man could come up with such a great escape!

273,83,"Taking those first baby steps is very excitingespecially for a robot. For years, scientists have worked to create a robot that could walk in a humanlike way. That time has finally arrived!
This February, scientists unveiled three robots that can walk like humans. The robots swing their arms for balance, as people do. The new robots require far less power than earlier versions did.
Toddler is the most advanced of the three. It learns to walk like a
, or a young child. Its balance improves with each step.
The walking robots are more than just toys. In the future, robots like these may be used to perform dangerous space missions. The discoveries could also help scientists develop better robotic limbs for people who have lost their arms or legs.

274,526,"What is colorful, plastic, and nearly 100 feet tall? The worlds tallest LEGO tower!
, or built, in Vienna, Austria. Austria is a country in Europe. The plastic creation broke the
world record for the tallest LEGO building. Something that is previous came before.
The tower was made up of about 460,000 LEGOs. More than 3,000 people helped build it in four days.
Most of the builders were children. Each young helper made a part of the tower. The designs were different, says LEGO spokesperson Kate Sutch. Some kids built their sections in patterns.
Breaking the record feels amazing, Sutch told

276,387,"A military dog missing in Afghanistan returns to her troops.
Sabi is one smart pup. The dog knows how to sniff for bombs and protect soldiers. Recently, the black Labrador learned another skill: how to live on her own in Afghanistan for more than a year.
Afghanistan is a country in the Middle East. U.S. troops are at war in Afghanistan. They are fighting people who supported the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
About 70,000 U.S. troops are currently fighting in the war in Afghanistan. President Barack Obama recently announced that hes sending 30,000
The United States is not the only country fighting. Soldiers from more than 40 other countries are involved in the war. Sabi is part of a
of soldiers from Australia. A unit is a group. The military dog helps troops by
, or finding, bombs with her nose.
In September 2008, Sabis unit was fighting in Afghanistan. During the battle, she became separated from the soldiers. For months, Sabis unit searched for her without any luck.
Finally, a U.S. soldier spotted Sabi in November 2009. With the soldiers help, Sabi was
with her Australian unit. To reunite is to bring back together.
The troops will probably never know what their furry friend was up to all that time on her own. Theyre just glad to have found her. Says Australian leader Kevin Rudd, Sabi is back home in one piece.
The dog probably wouldnt mind lending another helping handor pawif soldiers need it.
251,827 square miles (slightly smaller than Texas)
28.4 million; about half are kids younger than 15
mostly mountains and deserts; only about 12 percent of the land can be farmed
What are some other ways dogs might help troops serving overseas?

Bamboo plants go through a cycle of dying and regrowth. First the plants flower. Then they produce seeds before they die. They do that every few decades. The plants take 10 to 20 years to fully grow.

That is an organization that helps wild animals. ""It's really hard for [giant pandas] to move from place to place now,"" she told

. The Super Bowl is the National Football League's championship game.
The big game is on February 3 in Glendale, Ariz. I will interview players from both teams before the Super Bowl. I will ask them when they started playing football and what they like most about the sport. Then I'll watch the game live. I will sit with other reporters in a special section of the stadium.
I am mostly looking forward to meeting some players and seeing a professional football game in person. I cannot wait for the Super Bowl!

281,342,"What's green, wears a crown, and is a symbol of freedom? The Statue of Liberty! Over the years, millions of people have visited this statue in New York City. However, it has been closed since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Visitors have not been allowed to climb the 354 steps to the crown.
Experts say that it might be difficult for people to make their way down from the statue's crown in an emergency. The group that cares for Lady Liberty is raising money to make the statue safer so it can reopen. Officials have not said whether people will be allowed to climb above the
, or base, of the statue again.
For third grader Nina Wade that would be very sad news. She moved to New York City almost two years ago and has never climbed the statue's steps. ""I would be disappointed if it didn't reopen,"" Nina told Weekly Reader, ""but it makes me feel good to know that [officials are] taking safety measures.""

282,116,"Whoa! Dont look down! The newly opened Mike OCallaghanPat Tillman Memorial Bridge is the second-highest bridge in the United States. The bridge rises 890 feet above the Colorado River. It connects Arizona and Nevada.
The arch took nine years to build. The bridge is made from 16 million pounds of steel and 2 million feet of cable.
David Goodyear helped design the bridge. He cant get enough of the archs views. Its just such a fabulous setting, he says.
The bridges backdrop is the Hoover Dam. It was completed in 1935. The dam is considered a construction
or something that causes wonder. The dam stores water from the river. That water is used to make electricity.

In the study, a human researcher yawned in front of 29 dogs. Most of the pooches yawned back. Until this study, scientists thought people could make only other people and chimpanzees yawn.

Those are Americans who trace their roots back to Spanish-speaking countries.
The museum might hold objects from important Hispanic Americans. For example, it might show Roberto Clementes uniform. Clemente (above) was the first Hispanic American in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. He played for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1955 to 1972. He spent most of his life helping others.
Sonya Sotomayor might also be honored. In 2009, she became the first Hispanic American judge on the U.S. Supreme Court. That is the highest court in the country.
Eva Longoria (center) explains why a museum should be built.
Actor Eva Longoria is trying to get the museum built. All Americans benefit from a greater understanding of [Hispanic American]

289,682,"Attention, Barbie and Elmo: It's time to muscle up! The U.S. Congress is considering a bill to strengthen toy safety laws. Millions of toys were
last year in the United States. To recall is to ask people to return something they already bought.
Sixty-one different types of toys were recalled last year. Some toys were made with poisonous lead paint. Others had breakable parts that could be swallowed accidentally. The toys were
, or made, in China for U.S. companies. China is a country in Asia.
The new laws would reduce the amount of lead allowed in toys. There would also be more safety tests for toys.
""We're taking [steps] to make sure this ... never happens again,"" Peter Sandel, of the Toy Industry Association, told reporters.

290,28,"Too much chocolate may be unhealthy for you, but researchers have found a way to make the treat good for the environment.
This veggie vehicle can reach 135 miles per hour!
in England are using chocolate to power the worlds first Earth-friendly race car. An engineer is a person who designs and builds things. England is a country in Europe.
The vehicle is named WorldFirst. Engineers built the car with
parts. Something that is renewable can be used again.
WorldFirst can run on fuel made from chocolate and vegetable oils. The car zooms from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds.
The fuel isnt the only part of the car that can be bought at a grocery store. WorldFirsts steering wheel is partly made from carrots and other vegetables. The cars mirrors are part potato, and the seat is made with soybean oil. Does that sound nutty? You bet! WorldFirsts brakes will be made with cashews.

291,464,"Scientists find great surprises in the Great Barrier Reef.
Brightly colored fish dart in and out of the Great Barrier Reef. That is a
a continent. A coral reef is a large underwater structure full of plants and animals. Coral is made of tiny sea animals called
. When polyps die, their hard shells become part of the reef.
Scientists recently explored the worlds largest coral reef. They also looked at another reef near Australia. Their search turned up hundreds of animal species. Some of the species may have never been seen before.
Scientists used netted bags to search the reef. They spied big-clawed shrimp and worms shaped like pine trees. They also found about 130 new types of soft coral.
The researchers left behind 36 plastic houses on the ocean floor. The scientists hope the creatures will move into the houses. That will make it easier to study them.
Learning about the creatures may help people protect them. One-third of the worlds coral reefs are threatened by pollution and fishing. Its important to find out whats in the Great Barrier Reef, says scientist Patricia Hendriks. She took part in the
, or trip with a specific goal. If we dont know what is present in the first place, how are we ever going to protect it properly?
What species did scientists spy in the Great Barrier Reef? Here are a few that made a splash.
This green-banded snapping shrimp has a large claw on one side. It looks like a tiny lobster.
This Christmas tree worm rests on a coral reef. It uses its branches to breathe and eat.
The cuttlefish is a boneless animal related to squid. It has eight arms that it uses to catch food.
This gorgonian fan won the hearts of researchers. The soft coral fan stretches more than 3 feet tall.
In what ways can people help protect the Great Barrier Reef?

292,640,"Lily Thorpe from Colorado is one busy 11-year-old! She recently started a group called Kids Campaign. Lily meets with
and speaks with them about kids' causes. (Elected officials are people who are voted into office.)
Why did Lily start Kids Campaign? She noticed that many of her school library books were very old. To help schools in Colorado get money for books and other supplies they need, she decided to take action.
In the name of children everywhere, Lily is making her voice heard. ""Kids weren't getting enough of a say in politics,"" Lily told

294,728,"The Hispanic American population tops 50 million.
eres looking at you! The countrys population is becoming bigger and more
or different, than ever before. There are now more than 308 million people
or living, in the United States. Many of them come from different countries and backgrounds.
More than 50 million of those people are
Those are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. Only about 35 million Hispanic Americans lived in the United States 10 years ago.
The new numbers are from the nations
That is an official count of a countrys population. The U.S. census takes place every 10 years. U.S. officials recently announced the 2010 census results.
The Asian American population grew the fastest of all races, the count showed. That group increased by 43 percent from 2000 to 2010. There are now about 14.7 million Asian Americans in the nation.
Kids are a big reason the country is getting more diverse, officials say. Nearly half of all children [are] something other than non-Hispanic white, Stacy Vidal told
She is a spokesperson for the U.S. Census Bureau.
The census didnt just track who lives in the United States. It also showed
people live. California, New York, and Texas still have the biggest populations. About one-fourth of Americans live in those three states, the count found.
States in the South and West saw most of the population growth over the past 10 years. Nevadas population grew the fastest. It went up by 35 percent since 2000.
The census can teach us a lot about the United States, Vidal says. It paints a picture of who we are as a nation.
The United States has seen a big jump in the Hispanic American population over the past 40 years. This graph shows how that groups numbers have grown. What do you think its population will be in 2020? Why?
Why might U.S. officials want to know how many people live in the country?

295,166,"The results are in! At the beginning of the school year, we asked kids: How much weight are you carrying in your backpack? More than 2,000 kids responded to our online poll.
Carrying packs that are too heavy may cause injury. Doctors say most third graders' packs should weigh no more than 8 pounds. The good news is that most of you are following that advice. More than 1,300 kids replied that they carry 8 pounds or less.
Still, some kids are very overloaded. Of the kids polled, 465 told us they lugged around more than 12 pounds! If that is true for you, it may be time to clean out your backpack and lighten up!

296,282,"Third grader David Bates won the Weekly Reader American Values Contest. Nearly 14,000 students in grades 3 through 6 entered the contest.
To enter, kids had to write an essay on which American value is most important in daily life. David chose to write about selfless service. He wrote, ""It is most important in my everyday life because it incorporates all the other values.""

follows astronauts on a mission to repair Hubble.
student reporter Peter Brosnan interviewed Massimino about the mission.
How would you describe Hubble to kids?
Id say its as big as a school bus.
How did you feel saying good-bye to the Hubble Space Telescope?
We were happy that we didnt break it! ... We had done our job correctly, and it was on its way.
I think the best thing is the view of the Earth. ... Its as close as you can [get] to actually seeing it [from space]. Youll see how beautiful the Earth is.
Hubble stars in a movie thats out of this world!

298,744,"Write a letter to the next president!
What advice would you give to the next president of the United States? Hundreds of kids had a lot of ideas. They wrote letters of advice to George W. Bush and John Kerry.
The letter program is taking place at a library in Massachusetts. Kids who can't go to that library can write letters online.
The kids had many things to say. ""Please make world peace and stop world hunger,"" wrote Luke, 9, from Florida. Eight-year-old Megan from Georgia wrote, ""I hope you try your hardest to help our country.""

299,267,"There will soon be a place in Washington, D.C., fit for a King. U.S. officials recently gave the OK for construction to begin on the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial (right). The statue will be built on the National Mall.
King (19291968) was born in Georgia. At that time, people in the southern United States were separated by race. Under the law, black people could not attend the same schools as white people. They also had to use separate public restrooms.
King worked to change the rules in the South. He led peaceful marches and gave speeches. In 1963, King gave his famous I Have a Dream speech. Thanks to King and some other leaders, Congress passed
. Those laws make sure that all Americans have equal rights.
Martin Luther King Jr. gives an important speech in Washington, D.C., in 1963.
Officials hope to complete the King memorial in 2011. Christine King Farris is Kings sister. She says the memorial is important because it will remind people of the good work her brother did.
[Future people] need to know about Martin Luther King Jr., Farris explains.

300,739,"When it comes to youth sports, parents and coaches are dropping the ball. The Citizenship Through Sports Alliance (CTSA) recently issued the first report card for childrens sportsand the grades need some improvement.
Parents got Ds for poor behavior and for not caring enough about their childs experience playing team sports. Coaches and youth sport programs overall received bad grades for focusing too much on winning and not enough on learning the game and having fun.
Many parents treat childrens sports like the professional leagues, according to the report card. Parents often pressure kids to train and win, rather than to have fun, stay fit, and develop strong character. They also focus on one sport instead of encouraging kids to try different ones.
""Sports are great for kids,"" CTSA official Ron Stratten told
""Sports help keep kids healthy and teach teamwork and hard work. The problem is with parents who dont understand that sports are for fun, friends, and fitness.""
The panel that issued the report card includes childrens sports leaders, coaches, parents, and other professionals. The CTSA has developed parents guides and community report cards to help teach parents and coaches better sportsmanship.
refers to fair play and reasonable behavior when playing a sport.

301,625,"Pilot whales are members of the dolphin family.
A happy ending took place off the southern coast of Florida in August. Five pilot whales were released back into the ocean. Pilot whales are members of the dolphin family.
Rescue workers had nursed the whales back to health after the creatures had become stranded in shallow water in April. Their return to the water marked the first time in history that five whales stranded at the same time were returned to the ocean together.
Using a crane, volunteers lowered the whales headfirst into the water. The whales had been fitted with special devices for scientists to track their progress. As the whales swam away, many volunteers cheered. Some were moved to tears.
Later in the day, people in a helicopter spotted the whales swimming together. Rescuers hoped that the five would join a larger group of nearby whales.
""Walt Disney couldn't write a story better than this,"" said one animal-care worker.

303,733,"A group of college students has given new meaning to the words road trip. Beginning in mid-May, the students traveled from the East Coast to the West Coast aboard a bus that left the smell of fries and onion rings in its wake.
They weren't riding in an ordinary bus. They were traveling aboard a pollution-free vehicle that used recycled vegetable oil as fuel.
is the process of turning an old item into something new. Vegetable oil from cafeterias and restaurants powered the bus.
The students' college in Vermont provided about 200 gallons of vegetable oil to get the bus started. The vegetable oil had been used to fry chicken, potatoes, and other foods served in the cafeteria. As the students traveled across the country, they stopped at fast-food chains instead of gas stations to refuel the bus.
About a month later, the students completed their trek in Washington state. They hope to spread a message about protecting the environment.
Vegetable oil creates less pollution than diesel fuel, said one of the students. ""It's using some resource that was going to be thrown away and reusing it.""

304,175,"Firefighters usually use water and chemicals to fight wildfires. But this summer, firefighter battling a wildfire near Jackson, Wyoming, fought the fire with a new weapon a chemical used in disposable diapers.
The firefighter sprayed homes that were in the fire's path with a special gel nicknamed ""green slime"". The slime, which doesn't burn, is made from the same absorbent chemicals that are used in disposable diapers.
The firefighter sprayed the gel on nearly 200 houses. Because the green slime doesn't burn, it protects the houses from the fire.

307,49,"This greeting wishes others good fortune and happiness in the Chinese New Year. People kick off the holiday on February 18 this year.
The Chinese calendar is split up into months based on the
or moon, cycle. The Chinese New Year begins on the first new moon falling between January 21 and February 20. It ends on the full moon 15 days later, when the moon is brightest.
People in Chinese communities around the world celebrate the holiday with music, dancing, fireworks, feasts, and parades. At celebrations, people wear red clothes and give children red envelopes with money for good luck. Red is considered a color that wards off bad luck.
The Chinese New Year ends with the Lantern Festival. On that night, children carry lanterns in a parade under the light of the full moon. The highlight of the Lantern Festival parade is the traditional dragon dance, when dancers guide a long, colorful dragon made of silk, paper, and bamboo through the streets.
Each year in the Chinese calendar is named after one of 12 animals. Legend has it that people born in each animal's year inherit some of that animal's qualities. This year is the Year of the Pig. People born in pig years are considered honest, kind, and well informed.

the first paper was made in China.
Muslims in the Middle East learned the Chinese art of papermaking.
the first paper mill in Europe was built in Spain.
the first paper mill in the United States was built in Pennsylvania.
What shakes, pops, cracks, crumbles, tears, puckers, slaps, whistles, and sings? Give up? Those are just some of the many sounds that people can make with paper.
In mid-October, fifth graders watched as rolls of paper were released from the ceiling at the new Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Waving the paper, tapping on it, or blowing on it were some of the many ways musicians made sounds.
The paper instruments were part of a special performance called
. Chinese composer Tan Dun wrote the piece. He also invented and made the paper instruments used in the performance.
Dun's piece honors the art of papermaking and pays tribute to his Chinese heritage. Paper as we know it today was invented about 2,000 years ago in China.
The paper instruments allowed schoolchildren to hear how the shape of the concert hall affects sound. One 10-year-old girl from Los Angeles said that the concert hall sounded ""like a giant stereo.""
Dun says that the performance shows children that music can come from everyday objects. ""Using your imagination, you can find music around you, even in paper,"" Dun told
. ""Music is everywhere if you just look for it.""

An expedition to the Arctic has uncovered a giant sea reptile.
Scientists have discovered the skeleton of a sea monster near the North Pole. Researchers from Oslo, Norway, recently announced that they have found a complete
skeleton. A plesiosaur is a prehistoric marine reptile about the size of a bus. The recent discovery is believed to be the first complete plesiosaur skeleton ever found.
during an expedition to the Svalbard islands, 300 miles off the coast of Norway, in August. Fossils are the remains of plants or animals from millions of years ago preserved in rock.
The meat-eating reptile lived more than 150 million years ago, during the Jurassic Period. Some scientists call it the
of the sea. ""We think it is [a 26-foot] skeleton from snout to tail,"" team leader Jorn Hurum told
He described the plesiosaurs long teeth as being ""the size of bananas.""
The expedition also uncovered fossils from 27 other marine reptiles on the islands. ""We hope to find lots more in the years to come,"" says Hurum. ""We have just scratched the surface.""

Election fever hit more than the United States this year. People in Afghanistan elected a president for the first time in their country's history in early October. Afghanistan is a landlocked country located in southwestern Asia.
Many people braved long lines and snow and rain to cast their votes. Not even the threat of violence
, or prevented, them from voting. More than 8 million of 10.5 million registered voters cast ballots.
living in Pakistan and Iran also voted. Refugees are people who are forced to leave their homelands because of war.
Afghans consider the election an important step in working toward
. A democracy is a type of government in which people vote for their leaders in elections. The United States is an example of a democracy.
Now that the counting is over, Hamid Karzai was declared the official winner, out of eighteen candidates. Karzai will serve a five-year term. He has been the acting president of Afghanistan since the fall of the
The Taliban are an extreme religious group that had strict control over Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power for protecting terrorists after September 11.
Area: 250,000 square miles (slightly smaller than Texas)
Most of the people in Afghanistan are Muslims. They follow the religion of Islam. There are many different groups of people in Afghanistan with their own languages and traditions. The two largest groups are the Pashtuns and the Tajiks. The Pashtuns live in southeast Afghanistan. The Tajiks live in northeast and central Afghanistan.

An independent committee investigated the problem. They determined that the ink problems were too minor to affect the election results. Officials pointed out that a larger victory had been achieved. People had overcome their fear of violence to vote.
World leaders praised the election but also voiced caution. A leader from Germany said that it is the beginning of ""a surely long path into democracy.""

316,677,"Imagine having a twin that you didn't know existed. For Tamara Rabi and her sister, Adriana Scott, it was like a fairy tale come true.
The twin girls, now 20, were adopted in Mexico by different sets of parents in the United States. As luck would have it, the girls grew up in the same area in New York and went to different colleges near each other.
A common friend insisted the girls were twins and put them in contact. The girls exchanged
e-mail messages. Tamara had to do a double take when Adriana e-mailed a picture of herself.
The girls were stunned to learn that they each had a sister. Tamara's adoptive mother was surprised, too. Adriana's adoptive mother was aware that her daughter had a twin, but that was all she knew.
Besides looking alike and being the same height, the girls have a lot in common. They love to dance, and both started lessons when they were young. Upon meeting her sister for the first time, Adriana said, ""It was a shock. I saw me.""

317,185,"As the clock ticks down toward Thanksgiving, the Macy's Parade Studio buzzes with activity. The sounds of saws, drills, and hammers echo through the former Tootsie Roll factory in New Jersey.
The workers have no time to spare. I'm getting a sneak preview as they prepare for the 77th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.
More than 2 million people will line the parade route. Another 60 million people will watch on TV. I meet with John Piper and his talented team, who produce every detail of the huge parade.
Piper is in charge of the studio. His crew designs and builds the floats and giant balloons that appear in the parade.
The 2003 Macy's parade lineup features 15 giant helium balloons and 27 smaller balloons. Also included will be 29 floats, some of which contain cold-air balloons called ""falloons."" Ten marching bands and 30 groups of clowns will spice up the festivities.
""We don't do anything small,"" Piper tells me.
The first giant balloon to fly in the Macy's parade was Felix the Cat, in 1927.
The parade has featured 170 giant balloons in its history. No more than 15 balloons are used each year.
Kermit the Frog stretches 78 feet, making it the longest balloon in this year's parade.
A record six different Snoopy character balloons have appeared in the parade over the years.
In 1957, a massive downpour caused the Popeye balloon to dump gallons of water on spectators below.
To prove his point, Piper leads me up two flights of stairs. Here, Macy's balloon experts-called ""balloonatics""-work their magic. In one area hang models of the parade's newest giant balloons. The balloons include ""Strike
Up the Band"" Barney, Sesame Street's Super Grover, and an all-new Garfield.
Garfield has flown in 15 Macy's parades, but this year he will have a friend-his teddy bear, Pooky.
In a large room next door, I watch as Piper checks the 49-foot-long Garfield balloon for leaks. On Thanksgiving morning, more than 50 Macy's ""handlers"" will steer the balloon 2.5 miles along the skyscraper-lined streets of New York City.
Downstairs, head painter Beth Lucas puts the final touches on an 8-foot-tall eagle. The giant bronze bird will be at the center of the ""Spirit of America"" float.
Nearby, other workers hammer away from atop a wooden frame that will become the ""Bridge to the Future"" float. The float will feature the newest Hess toy truck and race cars.
All the Macy's floats are weatherproof. When folded, they must be no more than 12.5 feet tall and 8 feet wide. That size allows them to fit through the Lincoln Tunnel on their way from the New Jersey studio to New York City.
Piper tells me that working on the parade is a dream come true. ""When I was a kid, my two favorite things in the world were cartoons and things that fly,"" he adds. ""The Macy's parade puts both of them together.""

318,330,"Wild Weather: Is Global Warming Causing Unusual Storms?
Residents of Barrow, Alaska, are stunned when a severe thunderstorm roars through town. The storm shocks the town; it is the first thunderstorm they have ever seen.
For over 36 hours, a wild blizzard dumps about 100,000 tons of snow on a ski course in Austria. When even the ski lifts stop working, the storm puts a world championship skiing competition on hold.
Those are just two of the many cases of wild weather, such as blizzards, tornadoes, hurricanes, and heat waves, that have been taking place around the world. A recent report from the United Nations (U.N.) says that wild weather may become increasingly common worldwide.
The U.N. report blames the unusual weather on
, or a rise in temperature worldwide.
Certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, settle in Earth's atmosphere. Those gases act like the glass windows in a greenhouse, trapping heat from the sun and causing a rise in temperature.
According to the report, during the next century, global warming will cause average temperatures worldwide to increase by 2 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit.
World temperatures have been slowly increasing at least since 1850, when scientists began keeping records of world temperatures. The 1990s were the hottest ten years on record.
Scientists aren't sure what is causing global warming. Most scientists agree that burning gasoline, oil, and coal as fuel is the most important cause. Burning those fuels releases lots of carbon dioxide.
Some scientists, however, say global warming is mainly caused by forest fires, volcanic eruptions, and other natural events that release carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere.
Craig Idso, from the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, said he doubts that worldwide temperatures will increase much more than they have already. According to Idso, an increase in carbon dioxide may be a good thing, since plants need carbon dioxide to grow. By taking in more of the gas, plants ""will grow like gangbusters,"" he said.
The effects of global warming will vary from place to place, scientists say. In the United States, global warming could cause warmer weather in Alaska, more forest fires in California, crop failures in the Midwest, and longer growing seasons in the Northeast.
In the meantime, many companies are working to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere. For example, automobile manufacturers are developing new fuels that could replace gasoline and limit carbon dioxide emissions.
Michael Glantz, from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that people will learn how to live with global warming. ""Society is more robust than we give it credit for,"" he said. ""People may learn to live more comfortably in a new, warmer world.""

321,556,"Scientists are thrilled about some tiny, furry finds. They have discovered two new species of lemurs on Madagascar, an island located off the southeast coast of Africa.
The endangered animals are found only in Madagascar and a few of the country's nearby islands. Madagascar is home to some of the world's most
, or unusual, plants and animals. Lemurs live mainly in forest trees and are
One of the newly discovered creatures has wide eyes, is small enough to fit in a hand, and bounces from tree branch to tree branch in the dark. Its name in Malagasy means ""good man."" Malagasy is the official language of Madagascar. The animal was named after scientist Steve Goodman. He has been studying the tiny creatures in Madagascar for 20 years. It is truly an honor to have an animal named after me,"" says Goodman.
The other species is a giant mouse lemur with a bushy tail. It was named in honor of Madagascar's children. Its name in Malagasy means ""child."" The scientists chose that name to remind Madagascar's children to care for the many plants and animals in their country.
Finding a new lemur species is rare because many of the tiny creatures have become extinct. The recent find means that there are now 49 known species of lemurs in the wild.

322,215,"Brothers Kenneth Galeano, 12, and Branden Galeano, 7, were the first students to walk through the doors at Benjamin Franklin Elementary School. They were greeted with welcome signs and big smiles. Ben Franklin is the first public school in New Orleans to reopen since Hurricane Katrina hit four months ago.

323,441,"Fourth graders in the United States can give themselves a pat on the back. A recent report card for the nation shows that they are better readers than fourth graders were just four years ago!
Teachers can take some of the credit for the good scores. ""We know what works to teach youngsters to read, and we know that all children can learn,"" said an education official.

324,446,"One Missouri family finished a yearlong history lesson. The family visited all 50 capitol buildings in the United States.
Fred and Ginger Gall and their three sons--ages 13, 11, and 6--wrapped up their adventure in early August. Their final stop was at their home state's capitol building in St. Louis.
It took them a little more than a year to complete their journey, covering a total of 48,000 square miles. They traveled across the country in a mobile home.
Although the kids attend school in Missouri, they were home-schooled during their trip. Their parents said the trip was a chance to teach their sons about the history of the United States. As part of their schooling, the kids used their textbooks from their school.
They had many field trips to add to the mix. In addition to visiting all the capitol buildings, the family stopped at science and history museums and national parks along the way.
What sent them packing? ""Our friends from another country had seen more of [the United States] than we had,"" said Ginger Gall. ""There was something wrong with that picture.""

325,438,"A new sports car is making waves. With the touch of a button, this convertible turns into a boat. It recently went for a test-drive, jetting along the Thames River in London, the capital of England.
Named the Aquada, the car can reach speeds of 100 miles per hour on land and about 30 miles per hour on water. The wheels pull into the car as soon as it hits water.
To avoid leaks, the car has no doors. Like a boat, the car requires drivers and passengers to climb over the side to get into it.
The new cars aren't cheap. One hundred are being built and will sell for $235,000 each at the end of the year.

326,70,"Weeks before Election Day, Michigan teen Michael Sessions would race home from school, finish his homework, and hit the streets to persuade people to vote for him. His mom tried to make him wear his coat To City Hall out in the cold, but he didnt listen and got sick.
His persistence paid off, however. At just 18 years old, Sessions was elected the mayor of Hillsdale. The town of 8,200 people is located southwest of Detroit. Sessions is one of the youngest mayors ever in the United States.
Since his four-year term began in November, the young politician is juggling school with work. What made him want to run for mayor? ""Ive just watched the city decline,"" he told
""I thought, well, maybe I could be a spark plug who goes in here and says, Look, were going to lose this town. ""

328,151,"or the NBA playoffs? The TV-Turnoff Network wants you to do just thatand imagine what you can do instead of watching TV.
As a result, the theme of TV-Turnoff Week is ""Imagine."" The celebration takes place from April 24 to April 30. During the weeklong event, TV-Turnoff officials hope to raise awareness about the harmful effects of too much television.
Each American watches, on average, more than four hours of television per day, according to RealVision and the TV-Turnoff Network. In fact, kids spend more time in front of the television (1,023 hours per year) than in school (900 hours per year)!
Experts say that too much time in front of the TV can have a negative effect on children. Kids dont do as well in school and dont get enough exercise to stay in shape.
Robert Kesten, executive director of the TV-Turnoff Network, hopes that kids will turn off the television and get involved with other interests. ""Turning off the television allows children to see the real world,"" Kesten told
""We think kids will be surprised with the new discoveries they will make if they choose to shut off the TV for a week.""

329,645,"A new fashion trend has hit some public schools across the country. More schools are requiring students to wear uniforms or are enforcing stricter dress codes.
Students at Lakeside Elementary School in Cincinnati, Ohio, said good-bye to jeans, T-shirts, and oversized, baggy clothes this school year. Instead, they must wear tan, navy, or black pants and shirts with a collar. Girls are also allowed to wear jumpers or skirts.
The students in Ohio are not alone. From California to New York, an estimated 11 million public schools
, or require, dress codes for students.
Some people support the idea of dress codes. School officials say that dress codes often improve discipline and lessen teasing and bullying. Students focus on schoolwork instead of fashion.
""I like uniforms,"" Brittany, a student at Lakeside, told
. ""No one judges you, because you are wearing the same thing that they are.""
Some parents say that another benefit of wearing uniforms is that it saves money. They think uniforms are less expensive than designer clothes.
Not all people are in favor of dress codes. Some parents say that dress codes
, or go against, kids' freedom of expression. That right is guaranteed in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
These students do not have to follow a dress code.
Others argue that dress codes take away their kids' creativity by preventing them from choosing what to wear. Maggie, a student at Lakeside, told
that she doesn't like to wear a uniform, because ""all the outfits are the same.""
Some parents don't agree that buying uniforms is less expensive. They say it can be costly to purchase clothes to meet dress codes.
Should public schools have dress code policies?

330,670,"News Shorts: New Rings and Moons for Uranus
Astronomers have discovered new rings around Uranus with the Hubble Space Telescope.
Astronomers have made an out-of-this-world discovery. New images from the Hubble Space Telescope show a previously unknown pair of rings around Uranus. They also reveal two additional small moons circling the seventh planet from the sun. The latest find brings the total number of known rings to 13 and moons to 27.
A ""second ring system"" has been found circling Uranus.
It is the first time new rings have been discovered in 20 years. In 1986, the
2 spacecraft flew past Uranus and sent back thousands of images of its dazzling rings and moons. At that time,
2 found two new rings, in addition to the nine rings previously seen from Earth, along with numerous moons.
After looking at the new photographs, scientists reexamined
2s images. The scientists spotted the new rings and new moons in the older photos. The rings are so far from Uranus that they are being called the planets ""second ring system.""
The newly discovered rings were probably missed earlier because of their faintness. Sometimes you find things you arent looking for,"" says astronomer Mark Showalter.
Uranus is one of the solar systems giant planets made of gas, which also include Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune. The planet was discovered in 1781.

331,496,"It's hatching time. About every three years, female rattlesnakes lay eggs. Those eggs hatch between August and October, when the baby snakes break through their soft shells and start to slither around.
Baby rattlesnakes don't have rattles until weeks after they hatch. The rattles form over time as the snakes repeatedly shed their skin.
A baby rattlesnake sheds its skin for the first time about two weeks after it hatches. A rattlesnake shakes its rattle to warn other animals that it is nearby.
Many baby rattlesnakes don't live to become adults. Because of the babies' small size, other animals
on them, or eat them. Raccoons, hawks, and many other animals eat baby rattlesnakes. If a rattlesnake lives to become an adult, it can grow to be 6 feet long and live for 20 to 30 years.

332,559,"I [want] to bring common sense and fairness to the tax code
Governor Bush says that roughly one-quarter of the government budget
(extra money), which comes from taxes, should be returned to the people. He says his plan would promote economic growth and help people lead better lives by cutting high tax rates. The plan would lower the tax rate for married couples and families with children. He says the 6 million poorest families would pay no taxes.
I am calling for the right kind of tax relief--tax cuts that [will] help those who need them the most
Vice President Gore wants to lower taxes, but not by the amount Bush wants to. He says some of the surplus money is needed to support Social Security, a program that helps older people.

333,115,"Who gets burger bragging rights? A meaty battle is sizzling among three states over the history of the hamburger. In Texas, lawmaker Betty Brown proposed a bill declaring Athens, Texas, the home of the hamburger. Wisconsin has also jumped into the food fight. State Representative Tom Wilson argues that Seymour, Wisconsin, is the place where the famous sandwich was invented.
Not so fast, say the owners of Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut. Established in 1895, the restaurant is maintaining its claim as the burger birthplace. ""It's a well-known and established fact that New Haven is the home of the hamburger,"" says New Haven Mayor John DeStefano Jr. ""In fact, New Haven's claim to the hamburger is even supported and documented in the Library of Congress.""

335,294,"A sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
Wildlife officials in Florida have set up speed traps. The new speed traps, however, are not along highways. They are in the state's waterways.
The officials want to stop boaters from speeding in areas where manatees, or sea cows, live. Manatees are endangered mammals that live in water. Speedboats often collide with the slow-moving sea cows. Officials hope the new speed traps will slow down boaters.
Last year, boats injured or killed 78 manatees. During the first six months of this year, 48 manatees were injured or killed by boats.
State and wildlife officials blame the increase in manatee injuries and deaths on the number of boaters. ""There are more boats [on the water] now, so that's causing more [manatee] deaths,"" said Nancy Sadusky, an official of the Save the Manatee Club.

337,427,"A NASA Spacecraft Lands on an Asteroid for the First Time.
On February 12, scientists on Earth fired rockets on the
spacecraft, turning it toward Eros. Eros is an
, or space rock that is orbiting the sun. As the spacecraft slowly descended, it bounced and scientists were afraid the craft would crash.
Shown is the location of the asteroid belt in our solar system, and the orbit of Eros.
: The planets and their orbits are not drawn to scale.
began its incredible space odyssey five years ago. NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) launched the spacecraft in 1996. For the next four years,
sped toward Eros, covering nearly 2 billion miles.
After studying a few other space objects, the spacecraft settled into orbit around Eros on February 14, 2000. During the following year, the craft took more than 160,000 photos of the potato-shaped asteroid.
completed its mission orbiting Eros, NASA scientists decided to try to land the car-sized spacecraft on the asteroid. If the craft succeeded,
would become the first craft to land on an asteroid. Scientists knew that the odds were against a safe landing, but they thought it was worth trying. ""Chances [were] less than 1 percent for [
] to land intact,"" said scientist Helen Worth.
NASA scientists on Earth guided the spacecraft toward the surface of Eros by remote control. Descending at 4 miles per hour, the spacecraft landed after bouncing once.
Thinking that the spacecraft had crashed, scientists were surprised to learn that it was sending information from the asteroid's surface. ""It's working, and we are getting good information,"" said NASA scientist Jacob Trombka shortly after the landing. As a result of the successful landing, NASA continued the mission for an additional ten days.
Scientists already know that most asteroids orbit the sun between Mars and Jupiter in an area called the
. Eros, however, is a kind of asteroid that comes closer to Earth than most asteroids. Such asteroids are called
. Scientists believe that Eros may be similar to the near-Earth asteroid that slammed into Earth 65 million years ago, probably killing the dinosaurs.
About 350 near-Earth asteroids have been found. Scientists carefully map the orbits of those asteroids. They say those asteroids will not hit Earth anytime soon. However, one might hit someday, scientists say.
There may be another 1,000 near-Earth asteroids scientists haven't discovered. Scientists worry that one of the unknown asteroids might threaten Earth. Scientists will use the information they gathered from Eros to protect Earth from asteroids that come too close to the third rock from the sun.
Eros is about twice the length of Manhattan, New York.
Eros orbits the sun once every 21 months.
Eros has so little gravity that a baseball hit on its surface would fly into space.
A person weighing 200 pounds on Earth would weigh 2 ounces on Eros.
The daytime temperature on Eros is about 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

338,359,"Many Americans are flying and hanging the flag today. U.S. law and custom tell us how the flag should be displayed. For example, a flag should never touch the ground andcshould not be flown at night unless it is illuminated. Here are some other rules governing how the flag should be displayed.
The flag can be displayed vertically or horizontally. The union, or blue corner, should be displayed to the upper left of an observer.
The flag should be placed to the right of the speaker. Other flags should be placed to the left.
When a flag is suspended over a street, it should hang with the stars to the north or east.
The flag should be flown at half-staff only during periods of official morning. The flag should be raised to the top of its pole and then lowered to half-staff. At the end of the day, when the flag is lowered, it should be raised to the top before it is lowered.
The American flag should fly above a state flag.
When the American flag is flown with other national flags, the other flags should be of equal size and flown on separate polls at the same height as the American flag.

340,217,"An Iowa class heads into high-tech tests.
Every student in class has a remote control, and the kids are clicking away at the screen. But they aren't changing channels. They're taking a test! Terry Rex's fourth graders at Wings Park Elementary School in Oelwein, Iowa, are using a new kind of classroom technology. Instead of writing with pencils on exam papers, the students use remote controls to take tests.
""It's more fun,"" Courtney Ricchio, 9, told
""I don't have to write, and my hand doesn't get tired."" The remote controls are part of the Classroom Performance System (CPS). When students use CPS to take a test, the questions appear on an electronic screen. Students key in their answers on the remote-control response pad.
Rex is one of the first teachers in Iowa to use CPS. His students use the technology for more than taking tests. They also play learning games with the system. Sam Myott, 9, says his favorite CPS activity is a football game. ""It's a math game with multiplication and subtraction,"" he told
""Since it's on the computer, it's more fun than a worksheet on your desk.""
Some teachers think using CPS to grade a test is more
or a better use of time, than grading a written test. The computer keeps track of the students' answers and prints out their grades at the end of the day. The computer also reports which questions the class found most difficult to answer, so Rex can review them with the group.
Classrooms across the country are trying out new teaching gadgets.
Sixth graders Marina Gagliano and Kerry O'Conner of Wellwood Middle School in Fayetteville, New York, label parts of a microscope on an interactive whiteboard. The whiteboard allows students to use their fingers to click and tap answers on the projected image.
Fourth and fifth graders at Elton Hills Elementary School in Rochester, Minnesota, are on the move. Their classrooms have no chairs! Tiny desks hold high-tech gadgets, such as laptops and iPods, with different lessons. Researchers say this setup may be healthier for students than sitting at desks all day.

341,465,"Overfishing is harming the world's sea life.
Troubled waters are ahead for the world's fish. Those finned creatures and shellfish, such as crabs and clams, may be a rare sight by 2048, according to a fouryear study. The study, recently published in the journal
was conducted by a team of 14 researchers in four countries.
If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
The study warns that ocean life is being wiped out because of overfishing and pollution.
Global warming (a rise in Earth's temperatures) and habitat loss are also to blame for the decline in seafood.
Although the world's sea life is in serious danger, it's not too late to reverse the problem, says the study's lead author, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. The researchers have called for measures to protect current fish populations, such as reducing large-scale fishing and pollution. ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we don't change things,"" Worm told reporters.
The loss of ocean life will cause more than just a shortage of seafood. It could spell disaster for ecosystems too. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that work together as a unit to live. A declining fish population would cause a disaster up and down the food chain. Larger animals, such as seals and dolphins, depend on fish for food. Without enough fish to eat, those animals would be in trouble.

342,409,"More bears are alive and well, but are they ready to come off the endangered species list?
The bears are back after being on the brink of extinction in and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is located in the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana.
Now the U.S. government may remove the grizzly from its list of endangered species in this area. ""The future of the Yellowstone grizzly bears is bright,"" says Chris Servheen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
That wasnt always the case. The numbers of grizzlies began to shrink in the early 1900s largely because ranchers hunted the animals and farmers destroyed their
By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears still lived in the Yellowstone area. That year, the grizzly was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which offers special protection to animals facing extinction. Today, wildlife experts estimate that more than 600 bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone.
Grizzly bears live in other parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as well as Washington state and will remain on the list in those areas. Grizzlies in Alaska, which number about 30,000, have never been on the list because that population is healthy.
Its Not Time Yet Not everyone thinks its a good decision to remove grizzlies from the list. Some wildlife officials fear that if the bear is removed from the list, its habitat around Yellowstone could be used for logging, oil drilling, and development. Others worry that the bears will be hunted again. ""We would love to see the grizzly bear delisted, but its not ready,"" says wildlife supporter Louisa Wilcox. ""If you want to protect bears for future generations, you have to protect the habitat they need. This plan doesnt do it.""
Should grizzlies no longer be listed as an endangered species? Why or why not?
The grizzlys return isnt the only species success story. Take a look at some other animals that are being saved, thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists.
In 1963, only 417 pairs of bald eagles nested in the United States. There are now more than 6,400 pairs, and the national symbol may soon be removed from the list of endangered species.
Hawaiians used to hunt this reptile for dinner. Now they swim alongside the turtles near some islands. The number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400 a year. There were only 67 in 1973.
Pollution and habitat loss have made it hard for sea otters to stay afloat. In 1938, there were only several hundred otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500.

343,422,"Toy companies are always looking for the latest toy craze. One toy maker thinks it has a jump on the competition. It has just come out with a high tech pogo stick called the Airgo.
Unlike other pogo sticks, the Airgo doesn't have squeaky springs that help kids jump up and down. Instead, it has an air pump that will give users some extra lift.
According to an official at Razor USA, which makes the toy, the newly designed pogo stick is ""really cool looking"". It has adjustable handlebars and folds down to 22 inches.
Even though the Airgo may be cool looking, safety experts say that users should always wear helmets and knee and elbow pads.

344,193,"Children find open arms in new schools after Hurricane Katrina.
as she watched heavy rains and high winds rip through her hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana. The 9-year-old had been getting ready to start fourth grade. Her brother, Terren, had arranged his school supplies in his backpack to prepare for his first day of second grade. But Hurricane Katrina prevented schools in New Orleans from opening.
When New Orleans flooded, Tenisha and her family headed 350 miles west to Houston, Texas. They spent five days in a Houston hotel until a local family provided them with shelter. Now Tenisha and her brother are getting used to a new school in Houston. ""I've started making new friends already,"" Tenisha told
Tenisha and Terren are not alone. An estimated 372,000 children from Louisiana and Mississippi have found themselves in new schools, since the hurricane caused damage and flooding in those states. Schools from Maine to California have embraced students like Tenisha and Terren with hugs, smiles, and welcome signs.
Schools in Texas expect to enroll as many as 60,000 new kids. Houston schools alone enrolled almost 2,000 students in the few days following the devastating hurricane.
Two schools in Houston that had closed last spring have reopened. The two schools are now devoted entirely to
children. An evacuee is a person forced to move from a place of danger. School principals are also hiring hundreds of new teachersmany are evacuees from Louisiana and Mississippi.
Being the new kid at school is never easy. Experts say that it's even harder for children
because of the hurricane. Displaced people have been forced to flee from their homes.
Students who have left their homes have to
or get used to, new schools, teachers, and friends, say officials. Schools also play an important role in helping kids from the stricken areas cope with the disaster of Katrina.
Tenisha and Terren are adjusting well to their new schoolMacGregor Music and Science Magnet School in Houston. So far, MacGregor has accepted more than 12 displaced students. ""We want each one of the new children to feel this is home for them,"" the school's principal, Patsy Brown, told
Students at MacGregor have welcomed the new faces. ""We want to make our new classmates feel good because we know they've gone through so much,"" fourth grader James McKethen told
James's sister, third grader Tiye McKethen, agrees. ""It's cool to have new friends. And they get to have fun in a new school and stay in a safe place.""
After just two days, Tenisha and Terren were settling in at MacGregor. ""Our new school is great!"" Tenisha told
But the siblings know that life has changed. Despite the warm welcome, Terren misses playing basketball with his friends in New Orleans. Tenisha, too, misses her old teachers. What's next for the family? They will likely settle down in Texas. Tenisha says, ""I want to stay in Houston.""
I live in Desoto, a town outside Dallas, Texas. My school district has taken in roughly 188 students from New Orleans. I must hand it to the kids; they are adapting pretty fast. It is cool because our school is doing everything to make the new students feel at home. We call it ""Southern hospitality.""
I have seen many acts of kindnesswhether it's letting a kid from New Orleans go to the front of the lunch line or giving a new student a personal tour of the school.
I wonder if I could be as strong if my city went through a disaster such as Katrina. What happens to New Orleans from here, we don't know. But what we do know is that we need to appreciate our family and friends. We need to be thankful for the things that we have because we do not know what tomorrow will bring.
Christopher Ray Clark is a sixth grader from the DallasFort Worth area. He and his family have been volunteering to help Katrina evacuees.

345,485,"Photography did not exist in George Washington's lifetime. So how do we know what he looked like? Recently, a team of experts led by scientist Jeffrey Schwartz used historical
or clues, to build a statue of Washington at age 45. Here's how the team did it.
 The team began by scanning this mold of Washington's face into a computer. A sculptor had made the mold of the 53-year-old Washington's face in 1785. Washington's
or false teeth, showed the shape of his mouth.
 Once the team had an idea of what Washington's face looked like at age 53, sculptors re-created the face to show what it would have looked like at age 45. The nose and ears continue to grow during adulthood, so those features were sculpted smaller.
 Painters added color to the statue based on historical documents that depict Washington with pale skin and grayish blue eyes.
 The statue was placed in an exhibit that shows Washington leading his troops during the long winter at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in 1777.
If you could join a team of scientists in re-creating a historical figure, which person would you choose? Why?

346,322,"Scientists are going ape over orangutans (o-RANG-oo-tanz). They are working to help save these endangered tree dwellers before they disappear from the wild.
In recent years, the red-haired apes have found themselves out on a limb. Wildlife experts warn that they may die out, or become
, within the next 20 years. Scientists estimate that only 30,000 orangutans are left in the wild.
Today, orangutans can be found only in tropical rain forests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, in Southeast Asia. They are
creatures, which means they eat, sleep, and travel mainly in trees.
To search for food, orangutans swing from branch to branch. They like to dine on leaves, flowers, bark, and sometimes insects.
""Orangutans spend most of their time in the trees and won't cross open grounds, so the only way they can [move]... is through the trees,"" said one wildlife expert. ""We need to maintain these forest [areas] so that orangutan populations of the future have the opportunity to continue to survive.""
What is causing the numbers of orangutans to decrease at an alarming rate? The main reason is the destruction of their rain forest
Humans pose the greatest threat to orangutans for a number of reasons, say experts. People cut down trees for lumber. This illegal logging is destroying much of the animals' homes. Many countries, including the United States, buy the lumber. It is often used in shelves, picture frames, and floors.
Forest fires and farming are also to blame. As forests are cleared to make way for plantations, orangu-tans lose parts of their habitat.
In addition, orangutans have fallen victim to the recent boom in the illegal pet trade. People steal baby orangutans from the forest to sell them as pets.
To help bring these animals back from the brink of extinction, wildlife groups are working to protect orangutans and stop illegal logging. The government in the area is also involved in the effort to help orangutans. Police go into national parks to prevent illegal loggers from cutting down trees.
""Help is needed to save these amazing creatures,"" orangutan expert Cheryl Knott told
. ""If we can save the rain forest for orangutans, we can save it for other animals as well.""
The average life span for orangutans is about 50 years. Experts hope that orangutans born today will still be swinging through the trees at that age.
The orangutan got its name--which means ""person of the forest""--for a reason. Orangutans are remarkably intelligent. In the wild, scientists have spotted these clever creatures using sticks as tools to open fruit. Orangutans have been observed using large leaves as umbrellas to shelter themselves from heavy rains. Sometimes, the apes even use leaves as cups, from which they drink water.
Are there any endangered animals in the area where you live? What can people do to help them?

347,787,"Condoleezza Rice is the first African American woman to become secretary of state.
After the November election, President Bush nominated Condoleezza Rice to become secretary of state. That is the highest job in the president's
Rice will make history as the first-ever African American woman secretary of state. ""The secretary of state is America's face to the world, and in [Condoleezza Rice] the world will see the strength, grace, and decency of our country,"" Bush told reporters.
Being a leader is nothing new to Rice. In 2001, Rice was the first African American woman to become national security adviser. In that position, she worked closely with President Bush and advised him on defense matters.
As secretary of state, Rice will advise President Bush on U.S. foreign affairs. She will serve as a top
. A diplomat is a person who represents his or her country abroad. Rice will also work with leaders of other countries on important issues, such as the war in Iraq and the rebuilding of South Asia after the tsunami.
Rice has overcome odds to make it to one of the country's top jobs. She was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1954, during a time when black people were
, or separated, from white people in the South.
Rice says her parents taught her that education was the best way to overcome segregation. At 15, she attended college at the University of Denver in Colorado.
Bush believes that Rice, a classical pianist and former competitive ice skater, is up to the challenge. ""It is an honor to be asked to serve ... my country once again,"" said Rice.
The president's Cabinet is made up of a group of leaders who are in charge of the 15 departments in the executive branch of the government. The president heads up that branch.
The Senate must approve President Bush's Cabinet choices. Not everyone agrees with the president's choices for those positions.
The chart shows the Cabinet departments in the order in which they were created.

348,89,"Fingerprint technology has a new home  in the cafeteria.
Talk about easy money! Students in Rome, Georgia, can now pay for cafeteria food with a touch of the finger. The Rome City School District has a new, high-tech payment system that reads students fingerprints instead of asking students to punch in codes or swipe their ID cards.
""The finger scan system is faster,"" Rome superintendent Gayland Cooper told
""This is the kind of thing that technology should help us with.""
Before the new system, students often lost their lunch cards or forgot their codes. In addition, the cafeteria lines moved slowly, often cutting into students mealtimes.
The new fingerprint scanner has sped things up. ""Our students have really enjoyed the new system,"" Narkissa Ware, principal of Anna K. Davie Elementary School, told
""When the lines move faster, the students have more time to enjoy their meal.""
Getting a students fingerprints into the new system takes 10 minutes. After that, the student can touch the scanner at the cashier counter. The students picture and account information then appear on the computer screen.
Although fingerprints are an easy way to pay for lunch, some parents arent happy with the new system. Some students dont use the fingerprint scanner because their parents dont like the idea that their childrens fingerprints are being scanned daily.
Cooper says that students still have the option of punching in their codes. He adds, however, that students fingerprint information is secure.

349,786,"Heather Lindaman from upstate New York won't be playing dodgeball anytime soon. In 2001, Heather, then 7 years old, was playing dodgeball in gym class when she fell, slamming into a hardwood floor and breaking her elbow.
After Heather's injury, her parents brought a case to court against the school. They argued that dodgeball is too dangerous for young kids to play in school. A New York court is currently hearing the case. Based on the court's decision, the school may decide whether the game should be
To play dodgeball, one team's members must hit opposing players with a large rubber ball to eliminate them from the game. The team with players left in the game wins.
Some schools in Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, New York, Virginia, Texas, and Utah have already banned dodgeball or versions of the game. Some of those versions include war ball, monster ball, and kill game.
The National Association for Sport and Physical Education agrees that dodgeball does not belong in schools. That organization is made up of 20,000 gym teachers, coaches, and trainers. ""Dodgeball is not an appropriate activity for K-12 school physical education programs,"" the group told reporters.
Members of the association argue that dodgeball promotes violence and is unfair. They say that the game encourages bullying because stronger kids target weaker ones.
Don't toss dodgeball to the sidelines, say others. Nick Troy is a director with the National Amateur Dodgeball Association. Although his group is not connected with schools, he points out that the game has benefits.
""Dodgeball develops hand-eye coordination, strengthens muscles, and builds concentration skills,"" Troy told
. ""It is also a good form of exercise.""
Should dodgeball be thrown out of school?
Troy and others argue that dodgeball is no more dangerous than other school sports that kids play. Troy also disagrees that smaller kids are at a disadvantage. ""The goal isn't necessarily to get the weakest player out,"" he said. ""It's to get the best player out.""

350,84,"Leaping lizards! Harry Potter is about to fly onto movie screens across the United States. The new movie is called
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
At the beginning of the movie, Dobby the house elf warns Harry that if he returns to Hogwarts, disaster will follow. Real problems begin when someone starts turning Hogwarts students into stone.
Recently, Daniel Radcliffe, the actor who plays Harry Potter, took time out from filming to talk to
. Here's what he had to say.
: How is Chamber of Secrets different from the first movie?
: Harry changes a lot in the second film. In the first film, Harry learns about hate. In the second film, he learns how to deal with hate and has to explore his own emotions. He learns that he has something in common with Lord Voldemort, and he has to cope with that.
: Did you learn any new skills?
: I learned how to sword fight. But Rupert [another child actor in the movie] learned how to drive a car for the flying-car scene. Unfortunately, I didn't get to learn to drive because I was in the passenger seat. We try to make it look realistic.
: How did you film the movie and go to school at the same time?
: I go to school three hours a day, every day. I have a fantastic teacher.
: How have your friends and family reacted to your fame?
: They don't treat me any differently. They see me as Dan. I wouldn't want my friends to see me as Harry.
: In what ways has your life changed since the first movie came out?
: It really hasn't changed that much. I am often recognized as Harry Potter. But I don't mind that.
: When you grow up, do you want to continue acting?
: I think I will take it one film at a time. After this film, I will do the third [Harry Potter] film. After that, we will see how it goes.
If you could play a role in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which role would you play? Why?
: What have you learned about making movies that you didn't know before you played Harry Potter?
: It's hard work. It is a lot of fun, but at the same time it's really a challenge.

351,389,"Smack Down! Is Pro Wrestling Bad for Kids?
""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

352,111,"Tsunemi Kubodera stands before a giant squid on Display at National Science Museum in Tokyo.
A team of Japanese scientists snapped the first photographs of one of the deep sea's most mysterious creaturesa giant squid. It was the first time a giant squid was photographed in the wild! The researchers took more than 500 pictures of the sea creature off the coast of the Bonin Islands in Japan.
How did scientists nab pictures of the 26-foot-long sea monster? They tracked down the squid by following the only creatures that feed on itsperm whales. Once they determined where the whales dined, the scientists attached a robotic camera to a fishing line with bait. Then they took pictures of the purplish-red squid attacking its prey nearly 3,000 feet beneath the ocean's surface. The squid became caught on the camera but eventually swam away after one of its tentacles broke off. Squid have eight arms, two tentacles, and two huge eyes that can each grow to the size of a volleyball!

353,184,"Textbooks in China are getting a makeover. For years, schoolchildren in that Asian country have learned that the Great Wall of China could be seen from space.
Education officials recently ordered school textbook publishers to stop printing the
, or falsehood. In October 2003, Yang Liwei, China's first person in space, reported that he could not see the wall when he orbited Earth.
Liwei's comments contradict the last man on the moon. In 1972, a U.S. astronaut reported that the famous monument was visible from space.
More than 2,000 years old, the Great Wall is the longest structure ever built. Experts estimate that the Great Wall of China is about 4,000 miles long.

354,518,"About 140 years ago, the Pony Express delivered mail to some parts of the United States. Today, mail is delivered to most communities by cars, trucks, trains, and planes. But in Supai, Arizona, mail carriers still deliver the mail the way carriers did 100 years ago--by mules.
About 600 Native Americans live in Supai. The town is located at the bottom of a canyon near the Grand Canyon.
Letter carrier Charlie Chamberlain loads packages on mules. The mules deliver mail to Supai, Arizona.
Before being delivered in Supai, mail arrives in the post office in Peach Springs, Arizona, about 70 miles from Supai. From Peach Springs, delivery trucks take the mail to the rim of the canyon. Letter carriers then use mules to carry the mail to Supai.
Letter carriers who deliver to Supai don't just carry letters and small packages; they deliver almost everything that goes to Supai.
""It's amazing what people can do when they put their minds to it,"" said Charlie Chamberlain, a letter carrier. ""They can pack things that you never would have thought of."" A washing machine is the most unusual item Charlie has delivered.

355,260,"A new U.S. law requires that schools provide healthier choices for students.
Public schools across the country are going on a health kick. Thanks to a new federal law, students are saying farewell to fatty foods and hello to better eating habits in school. They are also exercising more during the school day.
Its up to schools to decide how they will comply with the law. Many districts are
or requiring, that schools provide healthier choices for lunch. In Tennessee, most schools have removed sugary snacks and soft drinks from vending machines. In their place are more nutritious choices, such as granola bars, nuts, water, and juices.
In Florida, Missouri, and Texas, some schools have new rules that restrict desserts such as cupcakes and lollipops from parties. Instead, school officials are encouraging teachers and parents to provide more nutritious treats.
To get kids to exercise more, the northwestern Minnesota district of Perham Dent has added more physical activity to the school day. Many school districts are also making sure that kids have recess every day.
The goals of the new law are to promote good health and to combat
Obesity is the condition of being very overweight. Experts say the percentage of young people who are overweight has tripled since 1980. Being obese can lead to serious health problems later in life.
""We know that adults who are very overweight get sick more often and lose time at work,"" Julia Lear, the director of the Center for Health and Health Care in Schools, told
""The best thing to do is get kids in the habit of getting lots of exercise and eating healthy meals.""
The food pyramid helps people make good food choices. A rainbow of stripes represents the five food groups. The thin yellow stripe stands for fats and oil. A healthy diet consists of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and calcium-rich foods, such as milk and cheese. The climber is a reminder to be active for at least 60 minutes each day.

356,254,"When thousands of baseball fans head to ballparks this summer, chances are theyll have trouble reciting the words to our national anthem. Two out of three Americans dont know the words to ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" according to a recent Harris Poll.
As a result, the National Anthem Project, spearheaded by music educators, is dedicated to reteaching people the words to Americas official song. A crosscountry campaign kicked off in January and is currently touring cities in the West from Los Angeles to Seattle.
The tour includes interactive exhibits and a singing contest. In each location, the singer who belts out the best version of the national anthem wins a $1,000 donation to a school music education program of his or her choice. In Richmond, Virginia, an 11-yearold boy took home the top prize.
Why dont people know the words to our countrys most famous tune? ""We see it as a consequence that music education programs are being diminished in schools,"" project spokesperson Elizabeth Lasko told
""[People who do] know the words say they learned them in school.""
or end, in Baltimore, Maryland, at Fort McHenry on September 14. That date and that place are when and where Francis Scott Key penned the poem that later became the national anthem.
According to the National Anthem Project, the song represents our countrys history and culture. Many people sing it at community events.
""We want people to know the words so they sing it together,"" says Lasko. ""If youre taught as a young person to sing it, youll always be able to sing it."" For more information on the National Anthem Project and tour cities, visit
During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote the poem that later became the national anthem.
On September 13, 1814, Key watched British ships bomb Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. The next morning, he spotted the American flag still flying over the fort. The sight inspired him to write the poem. In 1931, Congress made it the national anthem.
Here is the first verse of the four-verse song:
O say, can you see, by the dawns early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilights last
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through
     the perilous fight,
Oer the ramparts we watched, were so
     gallantly streaming?
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting
     in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was
     still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
Oer the land of the free, and the home of the

358,96,"Eleven-year-old Tilly Smith was recently honored at the United Nations in New York City for her courage during last years tsunami. Two weeks before the December 26, 2004, disaster, she had studied tsunamis in her geography class at her school just outside London, England. Her teacher showed the class a video of a tsunami. Tilly paid very close attention.
When her family was vacationing on a beach in Phuket, Thailand, Tilly immediately recognized the warning signs of a tsunami. Her quick thinking saved the lives of about 100 people in the area.
""I saw this bubbling on the water, right on the edge, and foam sizzling just like in a frying pan,"" Tilly says. ""The water was coming in, but it wasnt going out again.""
Tilly knew the waves would pound the shore within minutes. With the help of a security guard and a chef, Tilly spread the warning. People
or fled, the beach just minutes before the tsunamis devastating waves struck.

359,745,"William Jefferson Clinton is the 42nd president of the United States. He has been the president since 1993. He will leave office when the next president takes the oath of office on January 20, 2001. Recently, Bill Clinton answered questions from
What were the most important accomplishments of your presidency?
I think that one of the most important things I've accomplished was helping to strengthen our economy so that more Americans have jobs and more families can afford to buy homes and send their kids to college.
I'm particularly proud of a new program created in 1993 called AmeriCorps, which gives young people a chance to serve their communities while earning money for college.
What advice would you give the new president?
A president has tremendous responsibilities-- from keeping our economy growing to working with foreign leaders and commanding our armed forces. The president is the leader, but he or she can't do the job alone. So my advice is build a strong team, stay focused on your priorities, and make every day count.
Why should kids be proud to be Americans?
We should all be proud to be Americans because this truly is a land of opportunity. Regardless of your background, you can work hard and achieve your dreams. You may face challenges or obstacles along the way, but if you set your sights high, work hard, and stick to your priorities, you can achieve your goals.
What has been the best part of being president?
The best part of being president has been having the opportunity to make America a better place. Every day, I have the chance to make a difference in people's lives.
After being president for eight years, what will you do now?
The first lady and I recently bought a new home in Chappaqua, N.Y., and I look forward to spending more time there. I also plan to spend time in Arkansas putting together my presidential library and launching a new public policy center. I'm sure I'll be very busy, but I also hope to spend more time with my family and friends and to simply relax after what has been eight of the most incredible years of my life.
William Jefferson Blythe IV was born on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas.

Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on armor and talk to tour guides. This year, more than 2.4 million people from across the country are expected to attend Jamestown events.
Stepping into Jamestown Settlement museum in Virginia is like stepping into the past. And that's just what thousands of people are planning to do this spring. May marks the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America. Organizers are expecting nearly 90,000 visitors on the weekend of May 11 to 13, when many major events are planned.
Jamestown is a tourist destination for people who want a frontrow seat to American history. ""The whole idea is to give people an idea of Jamestown and the world in 1607,"" historian Tom Davidson told
Davidson helped put together exhibits at the Jamestown museum for the anniversary.
Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on English armor and watch experts demonstrate how to fire muskets. Tourists can also go aboard and explore
or models, of the three ships that brought the first settlers to present-day Virginia.
The story of Jamestown began on May 14, 1607, when about 100 English men and boys arrived in present-day Virginia. They came seeking gold and other treasures. The settlers, called
built a fort on the bank of a river and named their colony Jamestown, after King James I of England.
or businesspeople, of the Virginia Company to make money in North America. But the settlers faced many problems, including disease, starvation, and conflict with the area's Powhatan people (see ""
At first, settlers stayed close together for protection. ""There were hundreds of people living inside a wooden-walled fort,"" explains Davidson. Living in the fort helped the settlers defend themselves from attack, but it also made hunting for food or growing crops difficult.
Captain John Smith was one of Jamestown's original leaders. He took command of the colony in 1608. When the colony was in danger of running out of food, Smith gave an order: ""He who does not work, will not eat.""
spent five months crossing the Atlantic. The original Godspeed carried 39 passengers from England to Virginia, making two stops along the way. The new Godspeed traveled from Maine to Virginia, stopping along the way to let visitors see the ship.
By 1613, Jamestown had expanded into a successful colony. At about that time, the settlers began to grow tobacco. Tobacco was a
meaning that it could be sold in large amounts to England. In the following years, the settlers pushed the Powhatan off the land and built tobacco
or large farms. Later, the Jamestown colonists bought slaves from Africa to work on the plantations.
Over time, Jamestown grew to become the colony of Virginia. Virginia was one of the 13 colonies that joined in 1776 to rebel against England, starting the American Revolution (17751783).
Much is known about Jamestown, yet more details are being discovered. For more than a hundred years, experts thought the site of the original settlement had been destroyed by the James River. In 1994, archaeologists, or scientists who study the remains left behind by past cultures, discovered what may be Jamestown's original location.
""Visitors can see things being excavated that haven't seen the light of day in 400 years,"" Jamestown spokesperson Mike Litterst told
Scientists are currently looking for the foundation of the first church that the Jamestown settlers built. If found, it will be the oldest English church ever discovered in the United States.
The skeletons of two settlers have already been uncovered at the site. They are on display beneath a glass case, exactly as they were found. Historians believe that one of the skeletons is that of Captain Bartholomew Gosnoll, a member of Jamestown's original ruling council. Gosnoll and Jamestown Settlement will have a lot of visitors in the coming weeks for the 400th anniversary. ""It's the biggest event we've had since 1957, when the [Jamestown] museum first opened,"" says Litterst.
When the English colonists first settled in what is now Virginia, a powerful Native American group had lived on the land for hundreds of years. ""There were about 20,000 Powhatan people there when the English arrived in Jamestown,"" Virginia Indian culture expert Karenne Wood told
She hopes that the 400th anniversary of Jamestown will help shed light on the Powhatan's story.
When Jamestown began, the English and the Powhatan tried to trade with each other peacefully, but soon fighting broke out over land and resources. Beginning in 1614, the fighting stopped for eight years when Pocahontas, a daughter of the Powhatan chief, married Englishman John Rolfe. However, the fighting quickly resumed as Jamestown expanded.
Over time, the Powhatan people lost their land to the English settlers. However, Virginia is home to many Native American descendants today. ""We have changed a lot,"" says Wood, ""but we are still here.""
Organizers at Jamestown are not calling the 400th anniversary a celebration. Why might that be?

362,109,"Last month in New Jersey, two soccer teams were locked in a tied game. The game finally ended in a dramatic finish.
The game did not end with a tie-breaking shoot-out, however. It ended because of a fight between parents and coaches.
The fight started because one coach wanted the other coach to move from behind the goal during a shoot-out kick. Soon the coaches were yelling at each other. Then parents ran onto the field, and some of the adults threw punches.
No one was hurt and no kids were involved in the fight. But many towns across the United States are wondering what can be done to stop these kinds of ugly scenes from happening.
Many of the fights at kids' sporting events start because of decisions made by referees. ""There are going to be bad calls, and refs have been called names. But that's part of the game,"" Barry Mano told
. Mano is the president of the National Association of Sports Officials.
In kids' sporting events today, bad calls can result in a lot worse than name-calling, Mano said. ""We are seeing between 50 and 100 attacks a year on referees.""
that fighting at kids' sporting events is a national problem. ""We need to have long-term education"" to teach people how to behave at sporting events and solve the problem, Mano said.
Mano said that parents must keep in mind that they are important role models for kids. He also said the quality of referees at kids' sporting events needs to be improved.
""Sports are a great place for kids to learn. We just have to make sure that kids can have fun while playing,"" said Fred Engh. Engh is president of the National Alliance for Youth Sports. The group promotes good sporting behavior among kids, parents, and coaches involved with youth sports.
that there is one important thing kids can do to help prevent bad scenes at sporting events. ""Kids can remind their parents that this is just a game and that it's a time to have fun,"" Engh said.
What are some other ways to prevent fights at sporting events?

363,484,"A new leopard species is found in Indonesia.
Scientists have ""spotted"" a new jungle cat. The previously unknown species of clouded leopard has been roaming the rain forests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra in Southeast Asia. The secretive leopards are the latest of at least 52 new plant and animal species found in the rain forests on Borneo within the past year.
Scientists compared Borneo's clouded leopards with similar cats found on Southeast Asia's mainland. They paid special attention to the marks on the animals' skin. ""The moment we started comparing the skins on the mainland clouded leopard and the leopard found on Borneo, it was clear we were comparing two different species,"" says scientist Andrew Kitchener. Unlike the mainland clouded leopard, the Borneo cat has a double
(back) stripe and distinct spots within its small cloud markings. The Borneo leopard also has darker fur than that of the mainland species.
The newly discovered leopard is Borneo's largest
or hunter. It can grow as large as a small panther and has the longest teeth relative to body size of any cat.
There are about 5,000 to 11,000 Borneo clouded leopards living on Borneo, according to scientists. The Sumatra population is likely to be between 3,000 and 7,000.
Habitat destruction threatens Borneo's wildcats. Scientists have called for increased conservation or protection, of the rain forest habitat on Borneothe world's thirdlargest island. ""Provided this forest can be preserved in the long term, you can expect more discoveries in the years to come,"" Olivier Van Bogaert from the World Wildlife Foundation told

364,784,"North and South Korea are countries in eastern Asia.
Two brothers crept carefully through the mountains in China. The boys, along with their mother, sister, and aunt, had fled their home in North Korea. They hoped to find a better life in South Korea.
Like China, North and South Korea are countries in Asia. If the Chinese police had found the family, they would have sent them back to their country to be punished or even killed.
The brothers, Young Hoon* and Young Jun, and their family members walked, rode in cars, and flew on an airplane to reach South Korea. Their journey took about a year.
They were lucky. There are about 200,000 to 300,000 North Koreans now hiding in China. But only about 2,000 of them are expected to make it to South Korea this year.
Young Hoon, Young Jun, and their family members risked their lives to reach South Korea. Why? If they had stayed in North Korea, they faced starvation. Many North Korean children are hungry because their families cannot find food. In fact, over the past ten years, about 2 million people in North Korea have starved to death.
About a year after their arrival, the brothers tell me they are happy in Seoul, the busy capital city of South Korea. I visited Young Hoon and Young Jun at the Hannuri School, an after-school program for teens who have left North Korea and come to South Korea to start new lives.
Teachers at Hannuri help the North Koreans with their schoolwork. Many of the teens did not go to school regularly in North Korea, so they are behind in their lessons.
Even though North and South Korea are neighbors, the two countries are very different. North Korea is very poor. Its leader spends most of the country's money on the army, not on food for the people.
South Korea is more like the United States. The country has enough food for everyone, and most people drive cars, go to work, and eat at restaurants.
Young Hoon, 18, and Young Jun, 15, say that in North Korea they lived in a hut and ate mostly corn and potatoes. In South Korea, their lives are much different. The brothers live in an apartment and eat well. They love movies and video games.
North and South Korea are countries in eastern Asia. Korea used to be one country. It was divided in half after World War II (1939--1945). In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, starting the Korean War (1950--1953). After the Korean War, the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, was set up to divide the two countries. I visited the South Korean side of the DMZ. Everywhere I looked there were soldiers. I wasn't allowed to talk to them because they were on duty.
The brothers tell me about their plans for the future. Young Hoon wants to be a pilot. Young Jun wants to help people. They also hope to do something they never could have even dreamed of while living in North Korea--they want to visit the United States.
Young Jun is already prepared to visit. An American he met on his way to South Korea gave him a U.S. dollar. Despite plenty of opportunities to spend the money in South Korea, Young Jun has kept it. After all, he tells me, he's going to need it when he gets to the United States.

366,172,"Joseph DAngeli lives with vampiresvampire bats, that is. He feeds bats and studies their habits. DAngeli is a
(kigh-rop-TAH-luh-jist), or a scientist who studies bats.
This man is not a superhero, but he knows a lot about bats.
The weekend before Halloween, DAngeli is bringing his bats to the Chiller Theatre Toy, Model, and Film Expo in Secaucus, New Jersey. Its the countrys largest horror and science-fiction convention.
""The convention gives me a chance to talk to true bat lovers and people who havent experienced bats up close,"" DAngeli told
""Where else can you see a bat with a 3- to 4-foot wingspan in front of your face?""
A reputation refers to the way people think of something. But DAngeli says there is a lot to like about the
(active at night) animals. Bats, for example, help the environment. ""Many valuable bat species eat cropdamaging insects,"" he says.
DAngeli has been studying bats since he was a teenager. Whats his advice for students interested in studying the winged creatures? ""Get some rest. Youre going to be up late if you want to study bats.""
There are more than 900 known species of bats.
A brown bat can eat as many as 1,000 mosquitoes in an hour.
Contrary to popular belief, bats are not blind. To navigate in the dark, some bats use echolocation. That is a process in which sound waves bounce off objects and return to the bats ears.

The music industry is causing hundreds of people to sing the blues. One of those people is 12-year-old Brianna LaHara from New York City. Brianna liked to download TV theme songs and music by Mariah Carey from the Internet onto her computer.
However, record companies said that by sharing music files online, Brianna was stealing. As a result, she was one of 261 people sued by the Recording Industry Association of America in early September. Brianna was targeted because she had swapped more than 1,000 songs online.
Approximately 60 million people download music files from the Internet. In most cases, that is against the law. The music industry has compared it with shoplifting, saying most people wouldn't steal CDs from a store.
There are laws that exist to protect the rights of musicians. The laws say it is illegal to copy songs without permission from musicians and record companies.
During the past three years, CD sales have fallen. The recording industry says it loses billions of dollars each year when people
, or steal, songs. The music industry is hoping the lawsuits will scare people away from swapping songs online.
The lawsuits have left many people stunned. Some are concerned that innocent people might be wrongly accused when their children or grandchildren download music. One 71-year-old grandfather from Texas is being sued. He didn't know that his grandchildren had copied music onto his computer.
Some people have said they didn't know they were breaking the law. Others think the record companies are bullies picking on ordinary people.
Brianna's mother didn't take any chances. Agreeing to pay $2,000, she became the first of the 261 people to settle the lawsuit and to avoid having to go to court. ""I am sorry for what I have done,"" said Brianna. ""I love music and don't want to hurt the artists I love.""

45% - all right, with a few friends
Many people don't like paying high prices for music CDs. They say they like to get their music online because it's easy-and it's free.
During the past three years, music sales have suffered a huge loss. Record industry officials blame the drop on the increasing number of people who get their songs free on the Internet.
To draw music fans back into stores, the world's largest record company announced a few weeks ago that it would lower its CD prices. Universal Music Group said its CDs would sell in stores for about $12.98 instead of the current prices ranging from $16.98 to $18.98.
For people who still want to get their music online, they can do it without breaking the law. Some music-sharing services on the Web work in a similar way to record stores. The services charge a small fee for each song that is copied.
Do you think fear of being punished will stop people from swapping music online? Why or why not?

368,61,"Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, homeland security has become an important issue for many people.
This week Grade 4 looks at where the two major candidates for president stand on
. Both candidates recognize that the world has changed since the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Each candidate has his own plan to make the United States more secure and keep its citizens safe.
President Bush's antiterrorism program has included removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and restoring freedom to the country. He has also worked to stop terrorist groups in Afghanistan.
In October 2001, shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush signed the Patriot Act. The law gives the government more power to investigate suspected terrorists. President Bush believes that the law should be renewed when it comes up for review in 2005.
Bush also created the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 to keep our airports, borders, and ports safe from attacks. He says that he has worked to improve national security at airports through increased screening and advanced equipment.
Senator Kerry promises to continue to track and stop potential terrorists. He voted for both the Patriot Act and the Department of Homeland Security.
Kerry supports the Patriot Act's renewal in 2005 if some changes are made to it. He argues that certain sections of the Patriot Act violate citizens' rights. Some of those parts include allowing the government to wiretap phone conversations and search business and library records.
If elected, Kerry has a plan to protect the country's borders, ports, and airports. He also says that he will work to give police officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel the information and equipment they need to perform their jobs safely and effectively.

369,798,"One night in March, Daniel Calderone, age 12, was doing his homework in his California home. Then the lights went out, and he knew he wouldn't finish his assignment.
Many Californians have had similar problems. Since December, power companies have had trouble meeting the demand for electricity in the Sunshine State. In January and March, more than a million Californians sweated through
, which happen when power companies turn off electricity in an area for a short time.
Several factors contributed to the shortage, said Lawrence J. Makovich, a scientist who studies energy use. One problem is that California doesn't have enough power plants to supply all the electricity the Sunshine State needs. In addition, prices have risen for the fuels used in power plants to produce electricity, Makovich said.
The energy crisis may become worse this summer as Californians turn on air conditioners. According to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the state will probably be 10 percent short of the amount of electricity it needs.
This summer, the electricity crunch may spread to other parts of the country. In some areas, prices for electricity have been on the rise.
Many states are taking steps to solve the shortage. In California, Gov. Gray Davis is urging people to save energy.
""Yes, we have a power shortage, but we are far from powerless,"" Davis said. ""By reducing our electricity demand by even a small amount, we can reduce the price, avoid shortages, and lower energy bills.""

370,336,"On her TV show, Judge Judy Sheindlin makes difficult decisions concerning the cases she hears. Now the judge has written a book that aims to help kids make tough decisions.
You Can't Judge a Book by Its Cover
, the judge presents situations that kids might find themselves in at school. She then offers some solutions but lets kids make their own decisions.
talked with Judge Judy. Here is what she had to say about her TV show and her book.
: How did you come up with the situations in your book?
Judge Judy: I developed them from real-life situations. I'm a grandmother. I asked my grandkids about the situations. I also tried to relate to kids and let them know that what they do now will affect them in their adult lives. This advice will, I hope, help them make the right choices.
: Compared to the past, are things different for kids today?
: Today, we live in a society that has both parents working. Working parents don't always spend enough time with their kids. Kids need parents who talk to them.
: How did you come up with the title for your book?
: Titles say a lot. You can't judge life by its cover. You shouldn't judge people by their covers--how they look or how they dress. You wouldn't want people to do that to you.
: What's the one piece of advice you would give to fourth graders?
: You should always think about what the right thing to do is--not what feels good, not what your friends are doing. If you think about what the right thing to do is, then eventually the right thing happens, and you sleep better at night.
: Your dog is pictured on the cover of your book. What's its name?

371,648,"Coins were available for buying and selling at the World's Fair of Money.
Collectible coins and currency worth about $1 billion were on display at the World's Fair of Money. The fair was held this August in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
During the five-day event, money was displayed for looking at, buying, and selling. Some coins were worth as little as half a cent. Other coins were worth millions.
The event drew thousands of coin lovers from around the world. That's not surprising--coin collecting is one of the world's most popular hobbies.
, or a way to make money in the future. Most collectors, however, are not in it for the money. They participate in the hobby because of each coin's story. One coin expert referred to money as ""history that you can hold in your hand.""
Among the fair's most valuable coins were two Liberty Head nickels. The nickels were worth between $2 million and $3 million each.
A 1794 coin couldn't be missed at the fair either. Experts say the coin, believed to be the first silver dollar in the United States, is worth about $10 million.
Coin hobbyists point out that just because a coin is old doesn't necessarily mean it's valuable. A coin's worth depends on how many exist, on how many people want it, and on its condition.
Coin collectors are used to paying more for a coin than its original value. They say their hobby is worth every penny.
Each day, the government prints 37 million bills, worth about $696 million.
About 18 tons of ink per day go into printing those bills.
If you had $10 billion and you spent $1 every second of every day, you would go broke in 317 years.

Fifth graders at Carolina International School (CIS) have a goal this Earth Dayto throw away as little trash as possible during lunch. To get their message across, students will encourage their peers to recycle. ""I celebrate Earth Day every day,"" Nirvanna Madho, 10, told
. ""I really don't throw anything away.""
Participating in a zero-waste lunch is just one of many ways students at the school in Harrisburg, North Carolina, work to better the environment. Each April, the school organizes an Earth Day event. Students rotate through stations set up across the school's 36-acre campus, which includes forests and
Wetlands are moisture-rich lowland areas such as swamps or marshes. Students take part in hands-on environmental activities from testing water quality to checking out the latest models of battery-operated cars.
This year, Earth Day at CIS kicks off a season of change. The school is preparing to go ""green"" with a major construction project, set to begin early next year. Being green means protecting the world and its resources. The school's Earthfriendly makeover will include outdoor
or sun-powered, lighting and rooftop gardens. A water recycling system and other features to protect natural resources will also be built. The lobby will include a flat-panel touch screen on which students can watch how energy is being
""It's very important to educate children about environmental issues,"" says principal Deanna Duncan. ""If we don't take care of [Earth], there isn't another one.""
CIS is just one of hundreds of schools in the United States that are going green. A
is built with recycled and environmentally friendly materials. Green schools are designed to use less energy than traditional school buildings.
The majority of the energy supply in the United States comes from the burning of
such as oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels were formed from the remains of prehistoric animals and plants. People use fossil fuels when they drive their cars, heat their homes, and power farms, factories, and cities.
Though people depend on fossil fuels, those energy sources have their drawbacks. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air and releases gases that contribute to global warmingthe gradual rise in Earth's average temperature.
Hoover Dam generates clean energy by using water to spin turbines.
Fossil fuels are gradually being used up. To conserve them, scientists are looking to
sources. Renewable energy is power from sources that can't be used up and do not pollute the environment. Water, wind, and solar power are types of renewable energy.
President George W. Bush announced an energy plan that calls on lawmakers to ensure that ecofriendly fuels are developed and made easily available to Americans. Gas is a fossil fuel used in cars, and the price to fill up a gas tank is rising. Gas costs about $3 a gallon in some parts of the United States.
At CIS, students are excited for construction to begin on their new school building. ""I think the school is going to be a lot better,"" Drew Barsody, 10, told
""I'm looking forward to seeing the solar panels.""
These wind turbines convert wind into electricity.
Here are some common environmentally friendly energy alternatives.
Solar Power: Solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat and electricity. California and Arizona are two states that use solar power. One drawback of solar power is that energy can't be collected if the sun isn't shining.
Energy produced from windmills is used to generate electricity. The amount of electricity generated from wind has been growing in recent years, tripling since 1998 in the United States. Electricity is produced from wind in 30 states, including California, Texas, and Iowa.
is one of the oldest sources of energy. Hydropower often comes from dams or waterfalls. Of all renewable energy sources, it is most often used to generate electricity. In 2004, it accounted for 7 percent of all the electricity generated in the United States.
Ethanol is a clean-burning fuel that can power cars. It is created from several sources, such as corn crops. Typically, a small amount of ethanol is combined with gasoline to fuel vehicles. That helps decrease the fuel's cost and harmful emissions.
Turning off the lights when you leave a room is one way to conserve energy. What are some other ways to save energy?

373,102,"Wispy lights danced through the night sky in October. Observers worldwide saw the lights.
People saw green, blue, and red lights. The lights formed different patterns. Some looked like rings. Others looked like curtains. And still others looked like pillars. The lights continually changed shape and color.
are also called the northern lights and southern lights.
Usually, only people living close to the North Pole and South Pole see auroras. But auroras were unusually active this fall. Even people in Arizona saw the lights.
Auroras are caused by the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The solar wind is made of tiny particles that stream away from the sun. Earth's magnetic field is similar to the field that surrounds a magnet. When the solar wind strikes Earth's magnetic field, gases in our atmosphere glow. Those glowing gases form an aurora.
The kind of glowing gas determines an aurora's color. Glowing oxygen makes red, yellow, and green auroras. Glowing hydrogen and helium make blue and purple auroras.
Don't worry if you missed the colorful auroras in October. An aurora can form at any time of year. If the solar wind continues to be as strong as it was in the fall, you may see the northern lights on any clear night.
The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth. You could line up more than 1 billion hot dogs end to end between Earth and the sun.
If you could drive to the sun in your family's car, it would take you nearly 2 million years. That's if you drove 55 miles per hour and didn't take any rest stops.
Light from the sun travels a lot faster than you can in your car. A beam of light travels at about 186,000 miles per second. It takes sunlight a little more than 8 minutes to reach Earth.

374,137,"Standing atop a hill this summer in the dense jungles of Guatemala, a country in Central America, scientist Arthur Demarest felt his feet sink into the jungle vines.
Demarest plunged into a deep, tangled snake hole up to his armpits. Hearing snakes slithering around him, Demarest froze. For half an hour, the scientist didn't move, waiting for the snakes to settle down so he could climb out safely. While stuck in that snaky situation, Demarest looked around and realized the pit was actually part of a jungle-covered three-story building.
As soon as he got out of the hole, Demarest and his team of scientists explored the hill. They found that it was an ancient palace built by the Maya people. The Mayan civilization covered parts of Mexico and Central America, and reached its greatest power between the years 250 and 900.
Demarest's team also discovered a city surrounding the palace. The Maya people called the city
, which means ""place of serpents."" The palace at Cancun was built more than 1,300 years ago by the Mayan king Tah ak Chaan.
So far, Demarest and his team have counted 170 rooms in the palace, which has 11 courtyards and covers an area the size of two football fields. Because of its sturdy limestone walls, the palace is in extremely good condition, Demarest said.
Demarest said Cancun is different from other Mayan cities. Unlike the other Mayan cities, Cancun doesn't have temples or evidence that there was warfare. ""The basis of power among the Mayan [kings] was religion and warfare,"" explained Demarest. ""Apparently, Cancun needed neither.""
The drawing shows an artist's idea of what the Cancun palace might have looked like.
Demarest said the city must have been very powerful. But its leaders were more focused on
, or widespread buying and selling, than on religion or warfare.
Located near the Pasin River, Cancun was a thriving trading center for the Maya. ""That river,"" Demarest said, ""was really the superhighway of the Mayan world.""
Jade, a semiprecious stone, is everywhere at the site, Demarest said. Scientists even uncovered the remains of a woman who had jade false teeth! Finely carved jade statues were found in the graves of workmen.
Demarest estimates that it will take about 10 to 15 years to
, or dig out, Cancun. In his 20 years of uncovering Mayan ruins, he said, Cancun is ""by far the most spectacular.""
The snakes must think so, too. ""A buried palace is exciting to us,"" said Demarest, ""but it's even more exciting to snakes. They love it! This place is full of snakes.""
Why might studying ancient cities be important?

375,223,"A new study shows that kids who have a TV in their bedrooms get less sleep than other kids. Sleep experts at Brown University say about 30 percent of kids have a TV in their bedrooms.
According to sleep experts, kids who have TVs in their bedrooms go to bed later, have problems going to sleep, and are more likely to wake up during the night than kids who don't have TVs in their rooms.
One of the experts said the best way to help kids sleep better is to ""clear the bedroom of TVs and make the bedroom a place for relaxation and sleeping.""

376,401,"The Ancient Pueblo cliff city gets ready for its 100th birthday finale.
Park rangers are bringing history to light. On December 9, they plan to
or light up, an ancient cliff city in southwestern Colorado.
Mesa Verde has been a national park for more than 100 years.
A century ago, the U.S. government set aside Mesa Verde (MAYsuh VER-day) as a national park. The park protects the ancient Native American city known for its multistoried cliff dwellings built into canyon walls on a large
(A plateau is an area of high, flat land.)
(100th anniversary) throughout the year, park officials have organized various festivities. Events include Native American dances, music, and tours of sites never before open to the public. There are also craft demonstrations, such as pottery making and basket weaving.
(fih- NAH-lee), or big ending, park rangers will light up two of the biggest cliff dwellingsCliff Palace and Spruce Tree House. The rangers will use about 100 lanterns. ""Visitors [will] see what it may have looked like 800 years ago,"" Mesa Verde park ranger Dan Puskar told
The centennial celebration honors the Ancient Pueblo (PWEH-bloh) people, formerly known as the Anasazi (ah-nuh-SAH-zee). The word
means ""town"" in Spanish. The Ancient Pueblo, who constructed Mesa Verdes cliff dwellings, are the ancestors of todays Pueblo people of the U.S. Southwest.
The Ancient Pueblo were an agricultural people who
or lived, in the area more than 1,000 years ago. They mainly farmed corn, beans, and squash.
From 600 until the 1100s, the Ancient Pueblo lived primarily on the
top. (A mesa is a plateau with steep sides.) They later moved down to the sides of the cliffs and built homes there. After 1300, they
or traveled, south to New Mexico and Arizona.
Why did the Ancient Pueblo abandon the region? ""We dont know the exact reason,"" says Puskar. Some possibilities are climate change, drought, or overuse of the areas soil and other resources.
In the late 1800s, explorers found the ancient dwellings and removed pottery, baskets, and other
from the site. An artifact is any object made or used by people in the past.
On June 29, 1906, Congress passed a bill to establish Mesa Verde National Park. The bill, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt, protects the cultural treasures at this historic Native American site. It is a federal crime to remove or destroy any historic object or monument on land owned by the U.S. government.
""Its not often that you come across a hundred years of something special,"" Puskar says about the park. ""It was worthwhile to celebrate the past that comes from the Pueblo people as well as our nations past. [The centennial] provides us the chance to look forward to the next 100 years and make sure this place stays preserved and enjoyed by the public.""
is Spanish for ""green table."" Spanish explorers named the region for its high, tree-covered plateaus.
Mesa Verde National Park protects more than 600 cliff dwellings built by the Ancient Pueblo. The two largest dwellings contain about 160 rooms each.
By building their dwellings out of stone, the Ancient Pueblo could construct homes on top of one another. By 1100, their structures were as large as some modern-day apartment buildings.

377,421,"Shaquille O'Neal is happy, and it's not because he made a free throw. The basketball star is thrilled that the National Basketball Association (NBA) brought back the leather ball on January 1.
The NBA has brought back its old ball after trying out a new ball covered in synthetic material.
For the past few months, players had to use a ball covered with a synthetic, or human-made, material. Many players, including O'Neal, complained the plasticcoated basketball was a bad decision. They said the new ball didn't bounce as well as the leather ball. The new ball also cut their hands. ""The new ball is terrible,"" O'Neal, the Miami Heat center, says.
Scientists at the University of Texas at Arlington ran experiments comparing the synthetic and leather balls. The biggest difference they found was in the way the new ball absorbs moisture.
The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture than the leather ball does. That means the synthetic ball doesn't become heavier when it comes in contact with players' sweat. It also means the synthetic ball can become slippery because moisture stays on its surface, scientist Kaushik De, who helped conduct the study, told
The return of the leather ball has many NBA players jumping for joy. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us.""

378,245,"First built more than 2,000 years ago, the Great Wall of China is one of the greatest wonders of the world. Recently, Chinese officials announced that the Great Wall is greater than ever.
Officials had believed that the Great Wall was 4,160 miles long. But they recently discovered another 310-mile section of the wall at its western end. The wall now measures 4,470 miles long. That's equal to the distance from Miami, Florida, to the North Pole!
Most of the wall is made of brick. The newly discovered section, however, is made of sandstone and branches.

381,451,"The 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, will be a place of many firsts. The Games, which start on September 15, are the first Olympic Games to take place in the 21st century. And, for the first time in Olympic history, people will hear such words as
People will hear those words because the sports in which those terms are used--trampoline and tae kwon do (TIGH KWAHN DOH)--are being played for the first time officially at a Summer Olympics. Another sport, triathlon, is also making its first Olympic appearance this year. The triathlon is a race that includes swimming, bicycling, and running.
Although new to the Olympics, tae kwon do, trampoline, and triathlon are not new sports. In fact, tae kwon do, which is similar to karate, has been around for more than 1,000 years. (In Korean,
The athletes who compete in the newly admitted Olympic sports are very excited about going to Sydney. ""It is an awesome feeling, and I don't even know how to explain it."" said Barbara Kunkel. Kunkel is a member of the U.S. tae kwon do team.
A sport must meet certain rules to become a part of the Olympic Games. Leaders of a sport must apply to be a part of the Olympics seven years before the sport can be included in any Olympic Games.
In addition, a men's sport must be ""widely practiced in at least 75 countries,"" and a women's sport must be practiced ""in at least 40 countries and on three continents.""
The United States is sending more than 200 athletes to the Games in Sydney. Those athletes are competing against athletes from more than 190 nations.
Other Summer Olympic events include track and field, swimming, baseball, and sailing.
The last Summer Olympics took place in the United States in 1996. The 1996 Games were held in Atlanta, Georgia, and the United States won 101 medals, the most won in the 1996 Games. This year, U.S. athletes, including Barbara Kunkel, are trying for a Olympic repeat.

383,86,"Plans for an African-American history museum in Washington, D.C., have been in the works for more than a year. Recently, several African-American leaders were appointed to help manage the project. They include talk-show host Oprah Winfrey and Robert Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television (BET).
The museum will be part of the Smithsonian Institution. Although its exact location has not yet been determined, officials hope that it may find a home on the National Mall. The U.S. government is paying for about half the museum's $400 million cost. The museum's leaders will help raise the rest of the money.
President George W. Bush authorizes the creation of a Smithsonian museum dedicated to African-American history and culture.
The museum will celebrate the contributions of African Americans in the United States. It will highlight African-American history and culture from the Civil War (1860-1865) to the present.
""I look forward to the day the National Museum [of African-American history] opens and I can take my children and grandchildren to not only see history but be part of it,"" said one of the committee members. The museum is expected to open in 2013.

384,632,"Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a group of tiny people inhabited caves on a remote tropical island in Indonesia. That is a country that lies between Asia and Australia. The little people made stone tools to spear giant rats and hunted large lizards and tiny elephants in packs.
Believe it or not, this is no fairy tale. Inside a cave on the Indonesian island of Flores, scientists discovered the bones of seven people who belonged to a new
, or type, of human. The most intact skeleton was that of a child-sized adult female.
""If you told me an alien spacecraft had landed on Flores, I would have been less surprised than by this discovery,"" said Peter Brown, one of the scientists behind the rare find.
The miniature humans had bulging eyes and brains that were no bigger than those of newborn babies. Standing barely 3 feet tall, an adult was about the size of a 3-year-old child today.
Their tiny size earned them the nickname ""hobbits."" That name comes from the dwarflike creatures that appear in books by
What is even more amazing about the scientists' discovery is that the small humans lived as recently as 13,000 years ago. That may seem very long ago to you, but modern humans existed at the same time.
Did the newly discovered hobbits and modern humans live on Flores together? Scientists estimate that modern humans reached the island more than 35,000 years ago. Whether the two groups interacted remains a mystery, but scientists hope the discovery will teach them more about the history of humans.

385,150,"Thanks to Harry Potter, kids everywhere are enchanted with magical worlds.
Muggles, beware! Harry, Ron, and Hermione have cast a spell on kids everywhere, including fifth grader Jake Lisakolsky from Naugatuck, Connecticut.
Jake and millions of other Potter fans lined up this summer for
. That is the sixth title in the seven-book series. More than 100 million Potter books are in print in the United States alone. ""The Harry Potter series is a thrilling tale,"" Jake told
. ""And Book 6 is one of the best!""
But it's not just Harry and his friends who are enchanting children around the globe. Kids are devouring other fantasy books too. Fantasy lovers are escaping into the imaginary worlds of
(ZHAN-rah), or type, of book or movie that is set in a world completely different from our own. Fantasy is nothing new, although it has become all the rage again, thanks to author J. K. Rowling's brave boy wizard.
""Hats off to Rowling,"" English professor Alida Allison of San Diego State University told
. ""She probably didn't expect this, but she started a [new] wave of fantasy reading.""
for the second timeand he is almost halfway through J.R.R. Tolkien's
. A trilogy is a series of three related books or movies that tell a story. What's the draw of fantasy? ""Fantasy is full of action and excitement,"" says Jake.
It's not surprising that fantasy has turned millions of kids into book-worms. ""Fantasy allows children to think about other worlds and contrast them to their own,"" says Allison. ""It stretches their imaginations.""
What exactly makes a story a fantasy? Traditionally, a fantasy tells the story of a single character, the hero, such as Harry Potter. Like Harry, the hero is often unaware of his or her power. After crossing into a different world, the hero is faced with a series of tests.
In a fantasy story, a teacher often shows the hero the tricks of the trade. In
, wise Gandalf protects the hobbit Frodo. Harry, too, is taught by Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts.
Fantasy books typically end with a battle between the hero and the villainand the hero ultimately wins. If Rowling sticks to the fantasy formula, will Harry defeat Lord Voldemort in Book 7 of the series?
The fantasy craze has also hit the big screen, with many books being made into films. Fans of
movies turned out in record numbers. This December, a film version of the classic C. S. Lewis book
The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
will hit theaters. It tells the story of four children who enter Narnia, a world filled with strange creatures.
On November 18, the fourth Harry Potter film
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
hopes to work its magic on fantasy fans again. Jake can't wait to see it and compare it with the book. He is especially looking forward to the Quidditch World Cup scene. He says the filmmakers had ""better not mess it up!""
caught up with Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) on the set of
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
. Daniel, now 15, plays the boy wizard on screen.
: How would you describe Harry these days?
Daniel: He's grown up quite a bit. In this story, everything is being taken away, and it's out of his hands. Harry struggles to get a grip on the situation.
: Are you shy, as Harry is with Cho Chang [his Goblet of Fire crush], in real life?
Daniel: I'm quite shy, but I'd like to think that I'm not. Sometimes I find myself not knowing what to say to [girls].
: Which scenes did you most enjoy filming?
Daniel: The underwater scenes were the most interesting and the most fun. Mike [Newell, the director] told us, ""Don't try to actually speak your lines underwater. Just move your mouth.""
: If you could have any magical power of Harry's, what would it be?
Daniel: [I would want to do] everything with the wand, like cast spells.
Is it better to read the book first or see the movie? Explain your answer.

386,222,"Part of Hawaiis coastline collapses, pouring lava into the Pacific Ocean.
Lava from the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii hits the sea.
Tourists watched in awe as a huge chunk of Hawaiis coastline broke off and fell into the ocean. More than 44 acres of coastline collapsed and sent a glowing swirl of red-hot
bursting from a cliff. Lava is liquid rock that comes from a volcano.
The lava waterfall from the Kilauea volcano spilled into the Pacific Ocean. Steam shot into the air as the lava hit the water.
""The cliff just caved away like a glacier,"" Hawaii Volcanoes National Park spokesperson Jim Gale told reporters. ""It just sheared off that old wall."" Park officials let tourists watch the spectacular scene well away from the danger zone.
Kilauea, the worlds most active volcano, on Hawaiis Big Island has been erupting continuously since 1983. The November collapse was the largest in 23 years. It took about four hours for the cliff to tumble into the ocean. As the lava hardened, it began to form new land. All the Hawaiian Islands formed that way.
The recent collapse didnt surprise scientists. They had issued a warning months earlier because the cliff had formed cracks. Land collapses are not uncommon in the area. In 1996, a 26-acre area collapsed into the ocean, and in 1999, 25 acres of unsteady land fell into the water.
Thin strands of wiry volcanic glass, called Peles hair, were found about 2,000 feet away. Peles hair is a type of
which forms from lava that cools and hardens. According to myth, Pele was the Hawaiian goddess of fire.

387,368,"""This is George. He lived in Africa. He was a good little monkey and always very curious."" So begins the classic story of the inquisitive monkey Curious George, who leaves his jungle home to go with the man with the yellow hat. The book was first published in 1941 by H. A. and Margret Rey. Now the well-loved monkey stars in the animated movie
which opens in theaters on February 10.
Writer-and-illustrator team H. A. Rey and his wife Margret fled Paris on bicycles during World War II (1939-1945) with a handful of manuscripts. One was a story about a curious chimp. The couple eventually settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and wrote seven
tales in all. The books have been translated into 14 languages and describe the crazy adventures of George, whose curiosity often lands him in trouble. The man with the yellow hat helps George out of his various scrapes.
movie stars actor Will Ferrell as the voice of the man with the yellow hat. ""For years, Curious George has amused, entertained, and taught children around the world,"" Ferrell told

Workers began by shaping and laying the wooden frame.
As more pieces were set, the ship's hull, or body, took shape.
The outer boards were sealed with pitch, a sticky tar from plants.
Once the hull was seaworthy, workers slid the ship into the water.

389,144,"Nine-year-old Ben Duskin is reaching out to kids who have a serious disease called cancer. Ben invented a video game for kids about fighting cancer.
Ben, who is from California, is no stranger to the disease. He learned that he had a type of cancer called leukemia when he was five years old.
Why did Ben invent the video game? When he was in the hospital, he relied on video games to take his mind off being sick. That inspired him to help other kids who have cancer.
The result is ""Ben's Game""--named after its creator. The game takes place inside the body and stars a boy hero who moves around the screen on a skateboard. The boy is modeled after Ben. The object of the game is to blast cancer cells.
Thanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Ben's idea became a reality. The foundation helped Ben work with a software designer to create his video game. Ben's game is now available free online. To play, visit

390,628,"Drinks like soda have caffeine and lots of sugar.
Soft-drink companies are in fizzy competition. Many people in the United States are overweight. In the face of the nation's growing health and nutrition problems, many schools have banned soft drinks and other high-sugar snacks from vending machines.
As a result, the pressure is on for soft-drink companies to find new ways to stay in school. Some companies, such as Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, are introducing new milk-based drinks in different flavors to be sold in schools.
Some experts claim, though, that the milk-based drinks are still too high in sugar. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration won't allow the makers of those products to use the word
in their names. That's because the beverages don't have enough calcium and other minerals in them.
is a mineral found in milk and other dairy products that helps build strong teeth and bones.
Soft-drink giants aren't the only beverage companies trying to find their place in school districts. As part of a deal with New York City, Snapple will be the only drink company to have vending machines in the city's schools. To meet the city's rules banning high-sugar foods from schools, Snapple had to create four new 100-percent juice drinks.
Not good enough, say some nutrition experts who claim the new Snapple drinks have more calories and sugar in them than soft drinks have. Unlike orange juice and grapefruit juice, the new juices contain only small amounts of nutrients and vitamins. ""The fact is... they are pretty much the same as a [soft drink],"" said one expert.
Why is it important to read food labels carefully?
Other nutritionists disagree. They say the new juices and milk products are an improvement over previously available choices.

391,590,"Hawaiian monk seals may be headed for extinction.
Scientist Ken Longenecker is on a missionto figure out what is killing the Hawaiian monk seal. ""These guys are on the brink, honestly,"" he recently told reporters while sorting through a pile of stinky fish bones. The bones were all that remained from the meal of a monk seal.
The 600-pound animals are fast disappearing from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, their main
or natural home. Longenecker and other researchers think the seals are not getting enough food, and they are desperately trying to figure out why. ""The clock is ticking,"" says scientist Jen Palmer.
Between the 1950s and 1970s, the monk seal population plummeted. The major threats were habitat loss and deadly runins with fishing gear. Today, there are about 1,200 monk seals, but experts fear that the population will dip below 1,000 in the next five years. Although the seals habitat is now protected by law, their numbers have failed to rebound.
However, scientists are now looking at the seals diet in the hopes it will give them clues about how to save the animals. Part of Longeneckers job is to figure out what the animals are eating. Other scientists are also tracking monk seals and monitoring their habitat for pollution.

392,662,"Chinese New Year kicks off on January 29. The date marks the beginning of the year in the Chinese calendar.
People in China and in Chinese communities around the world will celebrate the holiday with fireworks, dancers in dragon costumes, and parades. In Chinatown in San Francisco, California, for example, thousands of people will line the streets to watch a parade with dragon dancing, floats, and marching bands.
The Chinese calendar is divided into months based on the cycles of the moon. The Chinese New Year begins on the first new moon between January 21 and February 20. The festivities last for 15 days.
At the New Years Eve meal, people remember their favorite relatives and eat traditional foods, such as whole fish, dumplings, and noodles. The last day of the Chinese New Year is called the Lantern Festival. It is celebrated at night, and children carry lanterns in parades.
Each year in the Chinese calendar is symbolized by one of 12 animals. This year is the Year of the Dog.

This has been a record-breaking year for wind power. Power companies in the United States have built thousands of new
Those are windmills that produce electricity as they spin. By the end of the year, power companies will have built enough wind turbines to power Rhode Island! With this years additions, wind power will create enough electricity to light more than 2.5 million homes in the United States, according to the American Wind Energy Association.

395,352,"Fourth grader David Casey likes to surf the Internet. He finds information that helps him do his homework. He listens to music and plays games on the Web. He even talks with friends in chat rooms-at least he used to.
After David started getting e-mail from strangers, his parents limited what he could do on the Web. His parents wanted to protect David.
Now the federal government is trying to protect David and other kids. ""Kids need a safe place to go on the Internet. This [bill] is the nation's best chance to guarantee kids an online experience that is fun and age-appropriate from start to finish,"" said Sen. Byron Dorgan.
These tips should help you surf the net more safely:
Tell your parents if anyone asks personal questions.
Never meet with someone you know only through the Web.
In November, Congress passed a bill that created a special domain name for kids. The new domain name is
A domain name comes at the end of a Web site address. A domain name tells you about the people who run a Web site. For example, a domain name can tell you whether a Web site is run by a business, an organization, or the government.
Web sites that use the new domain name must be appropriate for kids younger than 13 years old. Web sites with the
domain name will not link to sites that have different domain names. The sites will not have instant messaging or chat rooms unless they are safe for kids.

396,687,"While surfing, Matt Kraskiewicz, age 17, felt something tug on his leg. ""It was like someone dropped a weight on my foot,"" he said. That weight was a shark taking a bite out of Matt's leg.
Eleven-year-old Taylor Holley was standing in waist-deep water when a shark suddenly bit his leg, leaving a 2-inch gash.
Should humans be afraid of sharks, or should sharks be afraid of humans? Debate this issue.
The above incidents took place in Florida during October. After reading such stories, many people might think that they should not swim in Florida's waters. But shark experts say that would be an overreaction. As scary as they are, shark attacks are rare.
The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) says you are more likely to be hit by lightning than be bitten by one of the more than 350 shark species. In fact, each year about 500 people are hurt by lightning in the United States. In 1999, only 58 shark attacks occurred
Scientists say some species of sharks can live up to 50 years.
The largest shark, the whale shark, can be 50 feet long.
Shark skeletons have no bones. The skeleton is made of a tough substance called
Not all sharks are meat eaters. Basking sharks, for example, eat
, tiny plants and animals that float in water. As a result, basking sharks don't have teeth.
Shark Expert Rodney Fox explained, ""Sharks do not like humans; we are too bony. A lot of people who have been bitten by sharks have survived because the shark spat them out.""
One reason that shark attacks may seem more common than before is that more people are using shorelines for recreation, said George Burgess of ISAF.
Sharks that do bite humans have often mistaken people for other kinds of animals. For example, ISAF officials say sharks attack surfers wearing dark-colored wetsuits more often than they do anyone else. To a shark, the wetsuits make surfers look like seals, a favorite food.
Some shark experts say sharks should fear people, not the other way around.
One of the biggest threats to sharks, said Burgess, is
. Finning happens when a fisher catches a shark, cuts off its fins, and tosses the dead fish overboard. The fins are used to make delicacies such as shark fin soup.
Conservation groups are urging governments to protect sharks. During the summer, the U.S. House of Representatives acted to protect sharks when it passed a bill that could prevent finning in U.S. waters. In order for that bill to become law, the U.S. Senate has to pass it, and the president must sign it.
U.S. Rep. Randy Cunningham introduced the bill. ""We must end the harmful and wasteful practice of shark finning,"" Cunningham said.

Griswold, who is a radio traffic reporter by day, runs a ""bat hospital"" in her Connecticut home. While you wont find these little creatures stretched out on hospital beds, you might find one or two of them snuggling up to Griswold.
At her home, Griswold cares for bats that are sick, injured, or orphaned. She has taken care of bats with injuries, such as a broken wing, as well as babies that have lost their mothers.
She has also cared for bats that were stranded in the winter because they had forgotten to travel south during the colder months. With the help of a
, or animal doctor, Griswold helps nurse the winged mammals back to health. Then she sets them free.
But Griswold is no stranger to bats. She grew up on a farm where they were a common sight. So it was no surprise how quickly she took to an orphaned baby bat she found squeaking on the ground outside her house ten years ago. She took the bat in and fed it milk from a goat on her farm.
To her delight, the little creature survived the night. Today, the bat--which she named Poppy--still lives with her. She did not release Poppy back into the wild because it identifies more with humans than with bats.
This bat lady, however, doesnt keep Poppy all to herself. Poppy is one of the winged creatures that Griswold brings with her on school visits. In fact, this Halloween she is speaking at a Connecticut school. Griswold, who teaches kids about bats, is on a mission to change their reputation.
. Many people, she says, are afraid of bats, but theyre actually gentle, shy creatures that are important to the environment.
Bats pollinate plants, spread seeds, and, most important, eat insects. ""There is no animal worldwide that eats more bugs at night than bats do,"" said Griswold, who is full of bat trivia.
However, the number of bats worldwide is in serious decline. They often lose their homes when people cut down trees.
But Griswolds message seems to be spreading. After she spoke to a Brownie troop, the members built bat houses in their town. The project turned into a community effort. ""The kids are making such a huge difference,"" she said.
There are almost a thousand species of bats worldwide. Bats come in different colors, shapes, and sizes. Some have huge ears and unusual faces. In fact, a bats face can teach you about its habits. Read on about some of these creatures.
Vampire bats can be found in Mexico, Central America, and South America. They drink blood, but its usually from cattle and horses--not people. A heat sensor on its nose helps it find blood close to the surface of its victims skin.
Egyptian fruit bats live mainly in Asia and Africa. They eat fruit and nectar. Their long noses help them locate ripe fruit. Fruit bats use their sharp teeth to chew fruit.
This bats ears are almost as long as its head and body. It uses its ears to detect insects. This bat, which is found in parts of North America, feeds mainly on moths.
(EHK-oh-loh-kay-shun) to navigate in the dark and to find insects. The bats make sounds that cant be heard by humans. A bat knows where an insect is because the bats sounds echo, or bounce off, an insect and return to the bats ears. A bat can actually hear the footsteps of a tiny mosquito!

398,415,"Thunder provides a wake-up call to head indoors.
""When thunder roars, go indoors,"" says meteroologist Ron Holle.
Scientists say lightning strikes the surface of Earth about 100 times each second. Thunderstorms are most frequent during the spring and summer. During those seasons, experts warn people to be especially aware of the dangers of lightning.
is the flash of light that occurs when electricity moves between clouds or between a cloud and the ground. The huge spark of electricity is like the tiny kind you get when you run a comb through your hair or scuff your feet on a carpetonly much stronger.
A lightning bolt that crackles through the air can reach a temperature of 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun! The intense heat from lightning causes the surrounding air to expand, resulting in the loud sound known as
Thunder is nature's warning to head indoors. As meteorologist Ron Holle from Tucson, Arizona, told
, ""When thunder roars, go indoors."" A
Holle also recommends following the 30-30 rule. If you hear thunder less than 30 seconds after you see lightning, head indoorsthe storm is only about 6 miles away. After the storm ends, wait 30 minutes before going outside. To determine how far away lightning is, count the seconds between the flash and the thunder. Every 10 seconds equals 2 miles.
Lightning strikes the ground in the United States about 25 million times each year! Although getting hit by lightning is unlikely, it is important to stay safe. In the United States, about 60 people are killed each year by lightning.
To stay safe, follow the golden rulehead for cover. ""There is no place outside that is safe from lightning,"" Holle said firmly. ""There are two safe placesinside a [permanent] building or a metal-topped vehicle.""
Lightning expert Ron Holle shared the following tips with
Find shelter in a building or a metal-topped vehicle (not a convertible), and close the windows.
If you're caught outdoors, stay away from open spaces and avoid standing near tall objects, such as trees.
Avoid using electrical equipment, such as computers, TVs, and phones. (Cell phones are safe to use.)
Stay away from sinks and showers. Lightning can travel through water pipes.
Wait 30 minutes after the last sound of thunder or flash of lightning before going outside.

2 charts like the one below (one for you and the other for a friend)
To play, players take turns rolling the die for seven rounds, filling in their charts after each turn. To fill in your chart, write the number rolled in either the tens or the ones column. Put a zero in the other column. Keep track of your running total. For example, if you roll a 6, you can write either:
The player whose total is closest to 100, without going over, wins. Be careful! Use the tens column wisely, or you'll go over 100!

401,303,"This summer, when 'N Sync took the stage at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Morgan Oseiki was there. The 9-year-old told
that the group did more than ""Bring in' Da Noise."" The members of the band talked about the dangers of illegal drugs.
Justin Timberlake, Chris Kirkpatrick, Lance Bass, JC Chasez, and Joey Fatone have joined forces with the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. The drug policy office designs programs to help kids stay away from drugs.
Because 'N Sync is one of the best bands today, the White House office asked the group to bring its anti-drug message to kids. ""We think having ['N Sync] as part of our team is really going to raise the volume on our message to kids,"" said Edward H. Jurith, who is head of the White House office. Together, the White House office and 'N Sync are promoting the National Youth Anti-Drug Campaign.
As part of their summer tour, the boys talked about their ""anti-drugs,"" the things they do instead of drugs. The group also invited kids to send their anti-drugs to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
Here's what some kids said their anti-drugs are:
Grace Chen, 11, of Glen Dale, Maryland, said it's music. She plays the violin.
Rachel Acevedo, age 10, of Altamonte Springs, Florida, said it's swimming.
Dipo Adedeji, age 11, of Glen Dale, Maryland, said it's basketball.
Abigail Tang, age 12, of Brooklyn, New York, said it's writing.
Diana Barrientos, age 11, of Alexandria, Virginia, said it's drawing.

402,523,"Gordon Zwicky knows how to tell a tall tale. He is a champion liar. Zwicky recently beat 299 contestants from the United States and Canada to win the Burlington Liar's Club contest.
To win the contest, Zwicky, who lives in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, told a tall tale about a trip he took to Florida with his wife.
He said that he had won the lottery and decided to drive to Florida. A friend had warned him to read traffic signs carefully and he wouldn't have any problems.

About 40 years ago, the number of bald eagles in the United States was declining rapidly. Today, however, the bald eagle is returning to the skies. Wildlife officials hope to remove the bird from the list of threatened species by the end of the year.
In the early 1700s, bald eagles were a common sight. There were about half a million of those birds living in the United States.
Over time, their population fell dramatically. In the early 1960s, very few bald eagles remained.
What caused the number to drop? Hunting and the use of harmful chemicals sprayed on crops were largely to blame. Those chemicals poisoned the birds and their eggs.
Pollution also contributed to the problem. Bald eagles often became sick after eating fish from polluted waters.
was being destroyed as people cut down trees to build roads and homes. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal makes its home.
Although some threats still exist, the future looks hopeful for bald eagles. Today, there are about 20,000 bald eagles living in the United States. Thanks to laws that helped protect bald eagles and banned harmful chemicals, the birds are making a comeback.
, or protection, efforts have helped their survival. ""There is no doubt that it is the single best conservation story the United States has had,"" bald eagle expert Bryan Watts told
In 1782, the bald eagle was made the national bird of the United States. The nation's founders chose the bird because it symbolized freedom, strength, and courage. At the time, some people disagreed about the choice for the national bird. Benjamin Franklin, for example, thought the turkey would make a better choice because it was ""a much more respectable bird.""

1960 - More efforts are made to protect
2002 - the Old Man from collapsing.
One of New Hampshires most famous faces recently became history. In May, the Old Man of the Mountain crumbled to the ground.
The Old Man, of course, wasnt a person but a rock formation that nature carved out thousands of years ago. With its pointed nose, sharp chin, and heavy forehead, the mountainside looked like the profile of an old mans face. A
is a side view of a face.
Located on Cannon Mountain, the Old Man was a popular tourist spot and a favorite among the people of New Hampshire. In fact, the jagged rock face was considered the state symbol. It appeared on state quarters, road signs, and many souvenirs.
The famous landmark stretched 40 feet high and 25 feet wide. Long concerned that it would collapse, officials made several efforts to save the mountain face. However, the heavy snow and strong winds of this past winter finally caused the cliff to collapse.
Now a special state committee has been set up to decide if the stone profile should be replaced with a man-made face. ""He was part of our history, and he can still be a part of our history if we rebuild him,"" said a New Hampshire man who recalled learning about the famous face in the fourth grade.
Do you think the Old Man should be rebuilt? Why or why not?
However, other people dont necessarily feel the same way. ""Mother Nature put him there, and Mother Nature took him,"" said one committee member. ""To put it back up, to rebuild, wouldnt be the same.""

405,710,"Alhaji Babah Sawane was only 10 years old when a rebel group kidnapped him in his African country of Sierra Leone. Taken from his family, he was forced to learn how to fire a rifle. He fought in an army for the next two and a half years.
Peacekeepers from the United Nations (U.N.) helped to free Alhaji. In 2001, he addressed the U.N., asking that organization to help children around the world who are forced to fight in war zones.
""We ask this body on behalf of Sierra Leone to do all they can to bring our sad story to an end,"" he said. ""We want to be able to move about freely in all parts of the country.""
Sierra Leone is just one of an estimated 41 countries around the world that use child soldiers. While the most offenses occur in Africa and Asia, the problem also exists in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East.
Most children who become soldiers come from very poor countries. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers estimates that 300,000 children are fighting as soldiers. In some countries, boys and girls as young as 8 years old are being recruited, or called upon, to fight.
Protecting children in war and conflict zones has become a top job for the United Nations. And the U.N. has made significant progress. In a report issued in December 2002, the U.N. named 28 governments and armed groups that use children to fight their battles.
International law prohibits countries from using children who are younger than 15 years old in combat. However, several U.N. conventions condemn, or do not approve of, having anyone under 18 serve as a soldier. If a country recruits child soldiers, it is violating, or breaking the rule of, international agreements.
Why us it important for governments around the world to protect children?
The U.N. wants to save children like Alhaji Babah Sawane from suffering. The report sends a strong message to governments everywhere: They will be held accountable for their actions.

406,701,"Imagine ordering an ice cream cone and knowing that it's improving your health. That might be possible in the future. Scientists are experimenting with ways to add extra nutrients to ice cream. Nutrients are the parts of food that the body uses for growth and energy.
One type of nutrient that scientists want to add to ice cream is the group of fatty acids called omega-3. They are found in fish such as tuna, salmon, and sardines. Omega-3 fatty acids are good for circulation and help prevent heart disease.
The challenge for scientists is developing a final product that tastes more like ice cream and less like fish. ""It's easier to get people to eat what they're used to than to get them to change their eating pattern,"" said food scientist Bob Roberts.
Roberts wants to provide people with more types of foods from which they can get their omega-3s. Ice cream may just be one fun way to do that!

407,253,"Saturn is known for its rings. But scientists now say the planet has another claim to fame. It has more moons than any other planet in our solar system.
, scientists who study space, have been studying the space near Saturn. They recently discovered a dozen moons that had never been seen before, increasing the number of known moons orbiting Saturn to 30. The newly discovered moons range in size from 4 to 19 miles across.
At one time, the tiny moons were probably large rocks traveling through space. When they passed by Saturn, the planet's gravity pulled them in and captured them. The rocks have been orbiting the planet ever since. Over time, the large moons broke apart to form the smaller moons.
""We think that most of [the tiny moons] are the shattered remnants of captured moons,"" explained astronomer Brett Gladman.
Some astronomers wonder whether Saturn will hold on to its title as the moon king. Jupiter has 28 known moons. Some astronomers think they will find more undiscovered moons orbiting Jupiter, making Jupiter the moon king.

408,107,"Did you ever open a bag of cookies and wonder why they were broken into so many pieces? Scientists now know why. Contrary to popular belief, it has nothing to do with the way the cookies were packaged, loaded on shelves, or transported from the store to your home.
According to scientists in England, cookies pick up moisture as they cool after coming out of the oven. The moisture causes the cookies to expand and contract, which results in cracks. The cracks cause cookies to easily break when they're moved or packaged.
Bakers can use that information to adjust the temperature during the cooling process. Scientists hope the discovery will help keep cookies from crumbling during normal handling.

A new discovery has surfaced surrounding the worlds most famous shipwreck. The Titanics plunge to the ocean floor might have been faster than previously thought, say researchers.

The discovery of more wreckage suggests that the

On April 14, 1912, the luxury liner struck an iceberg on its very first voyage and sank to the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean. Before the ship departed from Southampton, England, on its way to New York, it was hailed as ""unsinkable."" On that fateful April night, more than 1,500 people sank to their watery graves 2 miles below the oceans surface.
In 1985, explorer Robert Ballard and his team discovered the wreck in two pieces. The wreck was found about 1,000 miles east of Boston, Massachusetts.
were found about a third of a mile from the wreck. The hull is the main part of the ship.
Undersea explorers say these pieces make up the bottom section that was missing when the ship was discovered nearly 21 years ago. It wasnt until after the bottom section of the hull broke off that the bow and the stern split.
expert David Brown estimated it took 20 minutes for the ship to sink. Now he says it likely plunged to the bottom of the ocean within five minutes. ""It was over more quickly,"" says Brown.

410,208,"""If I had one wish, it would be to bring peace to Earth and comfort to all the families who lost friends and loved ones [in the terrorist attacks],"" fourth grader Brandon wrote in an e-mail to
Brandon and millions of other kids have come together to help the victims of the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. Those kids have been offering comfort to one another; collecting clothes, food, water, and other supplies to send to rescue workers; and raising money to help the victims' families.
As kids have reached out to help others, they've learned about what their country stands for. English teacher Nan Bartow of New Haven, Connecticut, has been teaching for more than 30 years. She said, ""Kids are more patriotic than ever before.""
Many other teachers agree with Bartow. ""The students are saying, 'We are proud to be Americans' and that they appreciate everything they have,"" said Cynthia Elwood, a principal in Arlington, Texas.
Kids have shown their appreciation by sharing what they have. Here are some of the things they have done:
In Georgia, Parker Pratt, age 10, and Mac Conway, age 9, opened a lemonade stand and collected about $60 for charity.
Teachers and students at the Academy Hill School in Wilton, Maine, declared Friday, September 21, Red, White, and Blue Day. Everyone at the school wore the colors of the American flag to school that day.
In Stow, Ohio, 7-year-old Alexa came up with an idea that enabled her class to raise $113. ""I saw people who were crying because they didn't have houses or anything and they lost their sisters and brothers,"" she said.
In Oklahoma, kids and their parents collected more than 40,000 teddy bears to give kids in 350 schools in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.
""It is especially hard for children to understand what has happened, but they know how to show love,"" said Sue Hale, who helped coordinate the donations. Many kids wrote and attached special notes to the bears they donated. They said the bears and notes would help give thousands of kids hope for a bright future.
If you are looking to help the victims and families of the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. you might contact the following organizations. Each of these organizations has a long history of helping disaster victims.
* The American Red Cross can be contacted at 1-800-HELP-NOW.
* The Salvation Army can be contacted at 1-800-SAL-ARMY.
* The United Way has set up the September 11 Fund to help victims and their families. You can learn more about the fund at
You may also have local chapters of these charities in your community. If so, you can call them and invite representatives to talk to your class about what they are doing to help.

412,429,"The $10 bill is the latest in the series to get a new design.
The $10 bill is getting a new look! To outsmart counterfeiters, the U.S. government is rolling out a newly redesigned $10 bill that has splashes of red, yellow, and orange.
are people who try to make fake bills that look like the real ones. Counterfeiting is a crime.
""The new $10 note design continues the U.S. government's efforts to make our currency safer, smarter, and more secure,"" says Dawn Haley of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which produces all U.S. paper money.
The $10 bill is the latest in the series to get a new design. The $50 bill was updated last year, and the $20 bill was given a makeover in 2003.
There are several colorful changes on the new bill. A red image of the Statue of Liberty's torch appears next to the portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the treasury. On the portrait's other side is the phrase ""We the People,"" also in bright red ink. The background is light orange, and small yellow 10s surround the torch. A new ink makes the numeral 10 in one of the corners change color from copper to green when the bill is tilted.
But don't expect to find the new $10 note in your wallet just yet. In January 2006, the U.S. government will begin to circulate the new bills. The government plans to redesign the currency every seven to 10 years to stay ahead of counterfeiters.

413,196,"Calling all kids! LEGO Systems wants children to dig into their toy chests and donate some of those famous toy bricks. The company will collect the bricks and make a brick-for-brick matching donation to schools in New Orleans, Louisiana. The city continues to recover from Hurricane Katrina.
Some of the LEGO bricks will be used to construct a large model of a rebuilt New Orleans as imagined by kids across the country. The sculpture will be donated to the city as artwork. LEGO bricks will be collected through August 15, 2006. Each child who makes a donation will receive a LEGO-studded rubber bracelet.
Children are also encouraged to send drawings, photos, or notes describing something they think would help New Orleans become a strong city again. For more information on where to send bricks, visit

to thank. The rovers--each the size of a golf cart--successfully touched down on opposite sides of the Red Planet in January.
Now NASA scientists have even more reason to celebrate. They recently announced that
found hard evidence that Mars' dry surface was once ""soaking wet.""
""We have concluded the rocks here were once soaked in liquid water,"" said NASA scientist Steve Squyres. The finding is important to scientists because clues of water could mean that life once existed on Mars.
Both rovers are equipped with instruments to help scientists study the rocks. Each rover has a robotic arm that drills into the rocks and cameras that snap photographs.
detected minerals called sulfates in the rocks. Sulfates form in the presence of water. The rover also found ""blueberries"" scattered throughout the rock.
Blueberries are what NASA calls small balls of mineral that can form in water or be created by a volcano. Because Mars' blueberries are mixed in the rock instead of sprinkled on top, scientists believe that the blueberries were formed by water, not volcanoes.
Now that scientists have received postcards from the Red Planet, when will the care package arrive? NASA has tentatively planned an unmanned mission to Mars about ten years from now that will bring back rocks for scientists to study.

415,472,"Experts hope 2006 will be the year the world is polio-free.
Will polio be declared a disease of the past?
World health groups are fighting a war
with a crippling and sometimes deadly diseasepolio. Their efforts are paying off. Polio has been wiped out in 10 African countries, according to a recent report.
Since mid-2003, nearly 200 children in those 10 western and central African countries were
for life, but no new cases have been reported since last June. When people are paralyzed, they are unable to move different parts of their bodies and may be unable to walk.
The disease raced across Africa and into Asia after people in Nigeria refused the polio
mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think well get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told
She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria.""
Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly
disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havent been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims.
With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world. On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government approved the use of a vaccine that stopped people from getting the disease. Jonas Salk was the doctor who invented the first polio vaccine.
A boy in Africa receives an oral polio vaccine from a WHO (World Health Organization) worker.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world thanks to Salk, it still threatens children in Africa and Asia. Major efforts were recently under way to
or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been
Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door.
To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November.
After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Its uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives.""
Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization.
Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why?
Jonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.
From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Roosevelts death, Salks vaccine was declared officially safe.
In October 2005for the first time in 26 years in the United Statesfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnt at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.

416,683,"Lily Thorpe is showing kids that they really can make a difference in politics even though they may not be old enough to vote yet. The 11-year-old from Grand Junction, Colorado, recently started an organization called Kids Campaign.
""Kids weren't getting enough of a say in politics,"" Lily told
. ""Grown-ups who vote are making the decision for us. Kids can have a voice.""
. Political action committees bring awareness of various causes to elected officials. In Lily's case, Kids Campaign focuses on bringing children's issues to the attention of politicians.
Kids Campaign grew out of a concern that Lily had about her school library. She noticed that many of her school library's books and encyclopedias were outdated. To help schools in Colorado get the education funds and supplies they need, Lily founded Kids Campaign.
In the name of kids everywhere, Lily is making her voice heard and is hoping that politicians are listening. She is busy meeting politicians and speaking with them about kids' causes.
Lily has some advice for grown-ups. She encourages them to talk to kids about their voting choices. That way, she says, it helps make voting ""a family decision.""

. In that speech, he will speak to all Americans about his plans for the country's future.
After the speech, huge crowds will line the streets as the president makes his way along Pennsylvania Avenue in a parade from the U.S. Capitol to the White House. That night, the president and his wife, Laura Bush, will attend festive parties called
The oath is the only Inauguration Day event required by law. Every president since George Washington has taken the oath. On April 30, 1789, Washington was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City, which was then the country's capital.
In 1801, Thomas Jefferson was the first president to be inaugurated in Washington, D.C. In 1809, the first organized inaugural ball was held in Washington, D.C., for James Madison. In 1817, James Monroe's inauguration was the first to be held entirely outdoors. Over the years, inauguration traditions have evolved from simple events to elaborate ceremonies.
Since George Washington's time, presidents have used inaugural addresses to unite the country and inspire people. Abraham Lincoln gave his second inaugural speech in 1865, not long before the Civil War ended. He used his speech to draw the country together.
Other presidents' inaugural words are still quoted today. When Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural speech in 1933, the United States was at the height of the Great Depression. That was a time when many people were out of work. He brought promise with his words ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.""
When John F. Kennedy took office in 1961, he encouraged people to help their country. His speech challenged Americans: ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.""
What message will President Bush convey? He will likely continue the message expressed in his victory speech. ""A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation,"" he said. ""We have one country, one Constitution, and one future that binds us. And when we come together and work together, there is no limit to the greatness of America.""
George Washington's second inaugural speech, in 1793, was the shortest on record. At only 135 words, it lasted just eight minutes.
In 1841, William Henry Harrison gave the longest inaugural address. At 8,445 words, it lasted almost two hours!
In 1925, Calvin Coolidge's inaugural speech was the first broadcast on the radio.
Harry S. Truman's speech in 1949 was the first to be shown on television.
After Jimmy Carter was sworn in as president in 1977, he became the first president to walk the parade route instead of riding in a car.
In 1997, Bill Clinton's inauguration was the first to be transmitted over the Internet.

Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two major candidates for president stand on important issues. This week's issue is
In 2002, President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act. This education law provides states with government money so they can help improve their school systems.
The law is meant to ensure that schools are doing enough to help students who are struggling learners. Bush says that the law helps students perform better in reading and math. Under the law, schools are required to measure students' progress through testing. Schools in which many students don't perform well on the tests have two years to improve. Otherwise, students have the option to transfer to different schools.
Senator Kerry voted for the No Child Left Behind Act. If elected, he will continue to support this law. However, Kerry wants the government to give states more money to enforce the education law and make sure schools receive the money they need.

423,156,"talks to actor Elijah Wood about playing a penguin.
Penguins are back on the big screen! The new movie
hits theaters on November 17. Elijah Wood stars in the animated movie as a tap-dancing penguin. Wood began his acting career when he was 9. He is known for his role as Frodo in the
caught up with Wood to find out what its like to become a cartoon penguin.
Did you think your first animated movie role would be as a penguin?
[laughs] No, definitely not. Getting to meet and work with George Miller, who directed
was pretty amazing. Im a big fan of his films.

It was an idea developed by George. Apparently, emperor penguins can recognize each other in a group based on their songs. Mumble is born without the ability to sing. In its place, he has an odd ability to dance.
Ultimately, at the end of the film, the larger penguin community is taught a lesson that having a difference is all right. Everybody feels as though they have to change to fit in sometimes.

425,407,"Admiral Richard Byrd was one of the first people to explore Antarctica. Beginning in 1928, the U.S. explorer led several expeditions across the frozen continent. Sometime between 1939 and 1941, Byrd or one of his group buried a Hershey chocolate bar in the ice near the South Pole. The candy bar remained buried for 60 years.
Then, in January 2001, explorer Douglas Stoup found the candy bar buried in 2.5 feet of ice. Stoup donated it to the Hershey Museum in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
After 60 years, the candy bar, which weighs about 4 ounces, probably doesn't taste very good. In fact, it was never meant to. The U.S. Army had asked Hershey to make special candy bars, called Field Ration Bars, as a test. The bars were made to give soldiers lots of energy and not melt easily. The Army told Hershey the bars should taste ""just a little better than a boiled potato,"" so that soldiers wouldn't eat too many of them.

426,34,"Five California condors died last summer in Arizona's arid backcountry.
A condor's wingspan is 9.5 feet across. That's about as wide as two kids lying down head to toe.
Wildlife experts say the condors did not die from the heat. Instead, the experts believe the huge birds died from lead poisoning. They say the condors had swallowed lead shotgun pellets.
, which means they eat the remains of dead animals. The condors probably ate the remains of an animal that had been shot by a hunter. As they ate the dead animal's flesh, the birds ate the deadly pellets.
If swallowed, lead can make an animal sick or cause death. Lead stops the body from making red blood cells. It can also damage an animal's organs, including the brain and liver.
The five poisoned birds were among 35 condors that have been released in Arizona since 1996. The release program has cost millions of dollars.
After the dead condors were found, wildlife experts recaptured and tested the 16 birds left in the Arizona group. All the birds were healthy and were soon released.
Members of the Peregrine Fund have been releasing and watching the condors set free in Arizona. Jeff Cilek, of the Peregrine Fund, told
that saving California condors is important. ""Condors are good for the environment. They [eat] dead animals,"" Cilek said.
California condors are among the world's largest birds. A hundred years ago, the birds were found in many parts of the United States. Today, the condor is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's list of endangered species. That means the number of California condors is so low they all could disappear someday.
Why are scavengers an important part of the food chain?
Peregrine Fund officials say there are 150 California condors left on Earth. Forty-eight of those birds are living in the wild; the rest are in zoos.
Although the loss of five birds is a ""serious setback,"" Cilek said his group is looking to the future. Peregrine Fund officials recently announced plans to release 12 more California condors in Arizona this winter.

427,345,"Benjamin Franklin once said, ""A penny saved is a penny earned."" For the people of Boston and Philadelphia, Franklin's pennies have come to mean a lot.
When Franklin died in 1790, he left money to both cities. Franklin chose those two cities because he was born in Boston and lived most of his life in Philadelphia.
Franklin left the money to help people who need it. ""I wish to be useful even after my death,"" Franklin wrote. He knew that his money would grow in value over time if it was invested right.
Before he died, Franklin made sure that the money would not be wasted. He left specific instructions on how the money should be used.
For the first 100 years, the money was used for loans to young people who wanted to learn technical skills. After the first 100 years, the money was used for education and public works. After 200 years, most of the money was given to the state governments that support each city.
Today, the money Franklin left in his will is worth millions of dollars. It has helped pay for education, equipment for fire departments, and the building of a museum.

428,713,"National program is launched to erase head lice from schools.
An adult head louse is about the size of a sesame seed.
Spiders and bats may spook you, but nothing will make your skin crawl more than head lice. Each year, 6 million to 12 million Americans get lice. Many of those affected are school kids.
Head lice outbreaks are the number-one reason that kids miss school. Now the National Parent Teacher Association is fighting back against lice. The group is launching a program called Keeping Our Kids Lice Free.
The tiny bugs, each about the size of a sesame seed, spread quickly from one person to another. The bugs cant fly, but they can crawl.
Experts say the most common way to catch lice is through head-to-head contact. Lice can also be spread through the sharing of personal items such as hats, scarves, headphones, barrettes, and combs.
Head lice dont discriminate. They like everybody equally. It doesnt matter how often a person showers or bathes. Health experts say to follow these tips to keep the bugs from making your head their home.
Avoid touching your head to someone elses head.
Dont share personal items with your friends or classmates.
Use your own sleeping bag and pillow on sleepovers.

429,758,"Talk about a bird's-eye view of an ostrich farm!
visited the Westcoast Ostrich Show Ranch near Cape Town, South Africa. South Africa is a country in Africa.
Ostriches are the world's biggest birds. They have plump, round bodies covered with feathers, and long, skinny necks covered with soft fluff. Male ostriches weigh up to 350 pounds and can grow up to 8 feet tall. That's a foot taller than basketball player Shaquille O'Neal!
Ostriches don't fly. Instead, they use their wings to attract mates, alert other ostriches to danger, and keep their balance. Being stuck on the ground doesn't slow ostriches down, though. They can run as fast as a car can travel--up to 50 miles an hour for about 30 minutes.
At the farm in South Africa, the ostriches roam an area of flat land almost the size of 200 football fields. The workers at the farm take care of the ostrich eggs--the biggest of all bird eggs. At almost 3 pounds, each egg is about the size of a football. Even though an ostrich egg looks fragile, it is very strong. You could put a 300-pound weight on the egg without cracking its shell. Believe it or not, even a baby elephant could sit on an ostrich egg!

430,681,"Iraq's new government prepares for the future.
Women line up to vote in the southern Iraqi city of Basra January 30, in the country's first freely contested elections since 1954.
The government in Iraq has started the process of choosing leaders and drafting a constitution, now that the election is over. On January 30, millions of Iraqis voted, braving violence and threats of attack in the country's first national election in 50 years.
On that historic day, voters elected 275 leaders to the National Assembly, Iraq's lawmaking body. The assembly recently chose a president and two vice presidents. At press time, those leaders were selecting a prime minister, the most powerful position in Iraq.
Bringing peace and lasting democracy to Iraq will be a challenge for the country's temporary government. Different ethnic and religious groups in Iraq want a voice in the government. The assembly is made up of three groups: Shiites (SHEE-ights), Sunnis (SOON-eez), and Kurds.
The majority of Iraqis are Muslims, who practice the religion Islam. The Muslims are divided into two groupsShiites and Sunnis. The two groups have a long history of tension. Most Muslims in Iraq are Shiites, but the Sunnis were in control when the former dictator Saddam Hussein was in power. Many Sunnis did not vote in the recent election as a way to
Shiites hold the most seats in the National Assembly, and a Shiite leader is expected to be named prime minister. A Kurdish leader was elected as the nation's president. Both a Shiite and a Sunni were elected as vice presidents.
Despite the challenges, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the first meeting of the assembly ""an important step"" for Iraq. The assembly's main task is to write a new constitution by August 15. Once that is approved by the Iraqis, a permanent government will be elected.

431,567,"The theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week is ""When Fire Strikes: Get Out! Stay Out!""
Here's one message you never want to forget: ""When Fire Strikes: Get Out! Stay Out!"" That's the theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week, which runs from October 5 through October 11.
For the past 81 years, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has used Fire Prevention Week to teach people how to prevent fires and how to protect themselves all year long. The NFPA has the following safety tips for you and your family:
. Every family should have a home escape route planned. As part of the plan, identify two ways out of every room, such as a door or window exit. Be sure your plan includes a meeting place outside that is a safe distance from your home. Practice the plan at least twice a year.
. Smoke alarms are often the first signal of a fire. Your home should have a smoke alarm on every level and in or close to each bedroom. Be sure an adult tests alarms monthly and replaces batteries once a year.
. Whenever the stove is on, make sure there is an adult in the room. Keep a ""kid-free zone"" about 3 feet around the stove.

432,209,"Pilots follow monarchs on the move from Canada to Mexico.
Each fall, the skies between eastern Canada and the mountains of central Mexico fill with orange-and-black monarch butterflies. Along their journey, millions of butterflies fight fierce winds and flee predators. Once they reach their destination, monarchs cover trees with their bright, shimmering wings.
This year, the monarchs will not be flying alone. Butterfly lovers are accompanying them on their 3,415-mile journey. They are riding in a light aircraft called an
Their aircraft is painted to resemble the orange, black, and white wings of the monarch.
or move from one place to another. Beginning in early August, the butterflies head south for the winter months.
Most monarchs travel from Canada to Mexico. Others travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north. They are the only insects to make such a long round-trip migration.
Mexican pilot Francisco Gutierrez and a crew of other pilots from Canada and the United States departed from Quebec, Canada, on August 15. The group plans to arrive in Mexico on November 2.
The crew hopes to raise awareness about the monarchs' fragile habitats. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning the forests that protect the butterflies from rain and cold.
No one has ever followed the butterflies in the air for their entire journey. Doing so can teach scientists how the winged insects deal with wind patterns and difficult weather. Gutierrez says, ""It's going to be an adventure.""

433,201,"Saying you're sorry or apologizing when you hurt someone is always the right thing to do. In fact, scientists say that even some fish apologize when they accidentally hurt other fish.
Cleaner fish are fish that clean tiny plants and animals off other fish. Every so often, a cleaner fish accidentally nibbles on the fish it is cleaning. According to scientist Redouan Bshary and Manuela Wuerth, to apologize for biting the fish, the cleaner fish rubs the other fish's fins.

434,122,"In October, a colorful object blazed through the sky over several states. Hundreds of people in Colorado, Utah, and Idaho saw the bright light. Many of them called local authorities to report what they saw.
""We've gotten several reports of [a] brilliant white light the size of a basketball with blue flames turning to orange,"" said one police official.
The people had seen an unidentified flying object, or UFO. Many people think that UFOs are spacecraft from other planets. Actually, a
is anything that you see in the sky and cannot identify. Usually, even the most mysterious UFOs are eventually explained.
Experts say the UFO seen in October was most likely a meteor, or space rock streaking through Earth's atmosphere. Other UFO sightings, however, remain a mystery.
For years, the U.S government has been studying UFO sightings. Much of the information that the government has gathered on UFOs is top-secret.
Now a new group wants the government to tell everyone what it knows about UFOs. The group is called the Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFI).
""It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the real nature of this phenomenon,"" said John Podesta. Podesta is a former White House official and a CFI member.
The members of CFI asked the government to release information about specific UFO sightings. One such sighting happened in December 1965.
On that cold night, people in western Pennsylvania saw a bright light streak through the sky. The light looked liked it crashed behind some hills.
The mysterious object might have been a rock from space. A space rock that crashes into Earth is called a meteorite. However, several witnesses claimed that soldiers searched the area where the object ""crashed."" They say the soldiers loaded a car-sized object onto a truck, placed a tarp over the object, and drove it away-never to be seen again.
The members of CFI claim that the U.S. government has never released information about the sighting and the object. ""We can't come up with a reason why this information is being withheld. The government won't even acknowledge that the incident took place, but we know that it did,"" said one CFI member.
For now, the exact nature of some UFOs remains a mystery. CFI members hope that the answer lies in secret government papers. They say they are only searching for the truth and they want everyone to know the truth.

435,132,"Aquarius: An Underwater Lab With A View
Many U.S. kids share their bedrooms with a brother or sister. Sharing a room can be a pain. In October, six scientists squeezed into a small underwater laboratory to study a coral reef. They worked and slept in the tiny space for ten days. They, too, found that sharing space isn't easy.
""I've been on missions where people snored,"" said Celia Smith, who led the mission in October. ""You just kind of kick their bunk and try to get to sleep before they do.""

says the best part of living there is the view. They can see colorful fish swimming in the nearby reef. Smith said it's hard to tell, though, whether the aquanauts are watching the fish or the fish are watching the aquanauts.
The aquanauts spend as much time as they can on the reef studying sea life. They can spend up to nine hours at one time outside the laboratory.
Smith likes to remind people that humans have barely begun to explore the oceans and need to learn more about life in the deep. ""The really important thing for us to realize is how much we don't know about the oceans,"" she said.
Coral reefs have been called the rain forests of the oceans. Just as many of the world's land plants and animals live in rain forests, many sea creatures live in coral reefs.
Coral reefs are in danger. One-fourth of the world's coral reefs have already been destroyed, and the remaining reefs could be destroyed within the next century, scientists say.
Overfishing, pollution, and global warming are destroying many coral reefs, scientists explain. For example, global warming has gradually warmed the shallow ocean waters where coral reefs usually form. The warmer water has killed many

Scientist Valerie Paul worries that all the world's coral reefs will be destroyed early this century. ""It is like losing the rain forests all at once,"" she said.

439,568,"Ten-year-old Hunter York might have a fear of snakes, but that didn't stop him from picking up the two-headed creature that he found in his father's backyard.
The Kentucky boy used a stick to pick up the two-headed black king snake.
The snake ""kind of freaked me out a bit,"" he said.
Hunter ran into the house to tell his father about the 8 1 / 2-inch reptile.
, like this snake, are cold-blooded animals that either crawl around on the ground or, like turtles and lizards, creep on short legs.
Hunter's dad left the reptile with a snake expert because they couldn't get it to eat.
""We couldn't force-feed it because we don't know which head eats,"" said his dad.
One scientist said that Hunter's find was very rare. Only about one of every 10,000 snakes has two heads!

The cabs are popular with Hello Kitty fans, who don't have to pay more for their fun ride. The fares are about the same as those for a regular cab ride. The cabs also come equipped with free umbrellas, ponchos, and tissues featuring the cartoon cat.
Hello Kitty celebrates her 30th birthday next year. Japan-based Hello Kitty has made her mark around the world, appearing on everything from cabs to cellphone accessories to jewelry.

442,719,"There is good news for rhinos. Wildlife experts recently discovered the tracks of 13 Sumatran rhinos in Borneo, an island in Southeast Asia. The number thrilled scientists because the animals are on the verge of extinction.
Sumatran rhinos have been hunted illegally for their horns, which are prized in traditional Asian medicine. Wildlife groups are working to stop illegal hunting and protect the endangered creatures. The Sumatran rhino is one of three species of endangered Asian rhinos left in the wild.

443,646,"Recently, Judy Leden strapped a pair of wings on her back. Then she ran as fast as she could down a hill. As she ran, the wings slowly lifted Leden off the ground. Soon she was soaring through the sky.
The 30-foot-wide wings carried Leden about 35 feet into the air. Her flight lasted for 17 seconds.
The plans for Leden's flight were 500 years in the making, but she was airborne for a fraction of a minute.
The story of Leden's flight begins in Italy in the late 1400s. Italy is a country in Europe. At the time, Italy was caught up in the Renaissance. Many great artists lived during the Renaissance.
One of the greatest artists of the Renaissance was Leonardo da Vinci. Though da Vinci is best known for his art, he was also an inventor. He drew many machines that wouldn't actually be built for centuries. For example, he drew pictures of an armored car, a helicopter, a hot-air balloon, and a submarine.
Between 1490 and 1505, da Vinci made several drawings of a glider. A glider is an aircraft that doesn't have an engine. It glides on air currents. The wings that Leden used were based on da Vinci's glider.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
A glider based on drawings made by Leonardo da Vinci recently flew.
Leonardo da Vinci was an artist during the Renaissance.
A glider does not have an engine.
Aircraft experts worked to turn da Vinci's drawings into reality. They carefully followed the drawings. ""In its early stages, it looked like a bird's skeleton, and that's how Leonardo's drawings showed it,"" Leden said. When completed, the birdlike glider weighed 110 pounds.
No one knew whether the glider would actually fly. Some people worried that if it did fly, the glider might also crash. ""It was the most dangerous flight of my life,"" Leden said after she flew the glider.
Leden flew da Vinci's glider a total of 20 times. Each flight was short, but she didn't crash. Later, Leden said the glider flights were ""very, very thrilling. It shouldn't have worked, but it did!""

444,605,"Soaring high above California's coastline stand the magnificent redwood trees. Redwoods are the world's tallest known trees and are also some of the oldest. Some scientists are concerned about a disease that is threatening the ancient giants. It is called sudden oak death.
The disease has scientists alarmed. First identified in 1995, sudden oak death has spread along hundreds of miles of California's coastline and jumped into southern Oregon. In addition to attacking oak trees, it has spread to redwoods, Douglas firs, and other types of trees and shrubs. One of the worst outbreaks of the disease has occurred at California's Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park.
Scientists recently discovered the organism responsible for the disease. It is a fungus that causes oozing red blobs to grow on diseased oak trees. On younger redwoods, it dries up leaves and kills sprouts. According to scientists, redwoods are hosts for the disease. A host is an organism on or in which another organism lives.
The disease first showed up in rhododendron plants in the Netherlands in 1993. Scientists are concerned because the spread of the disease could pose a threat to the redwoods' ecosystem, an environment where plants and animals coexist. Scientist David Rizzo said that anytime you have a strange organism, there is cause for concern.
Coastal redwoods can grow upwards of 360 feet. Some are taller than the Statue of Liberty, which stands about 300 feet.
The diameter of redwoods can measure about 20 feet.
Named California's state tree, the redwood can live more than 2,000 years.
In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Muir Woods a national monument dedicated to protecting and preserving the mighty redwoods.
In 1904, a fungus from Asia began killing chestnut trees in New York. Over the next 50 years, the disease killed about 3.5 billion trees and almost wiped out an entire species. Scientists want to prevent this from happening in California or elsewhere in the United States.
Studies show this disease spreads rapidly during the wet months of spring. The coming months could be vital in tracking the disease. Current weather forecasts predict that this spring will be rainier than the last two springs. ""We have to get familiar with the symptoms and the treatments,"" said another scientist, ""because we don't know how much farther it will spread.""

445,413,"Assur was once one of the greatest cities in the world. About 30,000 people lived there. A huge temple tower, or ziggurat, stood about 200 feet above the city streets. Assur (or Ashur) was one of the leading cities of Assyria, the center of a great empire.
Today, ancient Assur is in ruins. Desert sand has covered over much of the 3,500-year-old city. Now Assur faces a new threat: water.
Assur is located in what is now Iraq, a country in the Middle East. Many parts of Iraq are covered by desert. Water is hard to find in the desert areas. To increase the amount of water, Iraqi officials are building a dam on the river Tigris.
The dam will trap the river's water. As the water rises, it might flood Assur and many other nearby ancient ruins.
Scientists worry that floodwaters will destroy artifacts hidden beneath the desert sand. Assur has already been the site of some amazing discoveries.
Scientists recently discovered four hidden tombs at Assur. They found ancient coffins, gold, jewelry, and gems. They also dug up the remains of two ancient Assurian queens.
Scientists used modern medical equipment to study the queens' bodies. They learned about some of the medical problems the ancient queens suffered from. The bodies showed evidence of dental cavities, sinus infections, and poor nutrition.
Michael Mller-Karpe, a scientist who studies ancient Assyria, said, ""The Assyrian queens have just begun to speak to us, and we are looking forward to more answers.""
Mller-Karpe and other scientists worry that the new dam may keep them from getting more answers. Even if the new dam doesn't flood Assur, the rising water could damage the ancient city. Moisture could cause the artifacts to crumble.
""You can't save Assur if it's [near] a dam,"" said scientist Peter Miglus. The soil beneath the ancient city would soak up water like a sponge. The water in the soil would destroy what's left of ancient Assur.
For now, scientists are scrambling to uncover the secrets hidden for centuries in Assur and other nearby communities. Meanwhile, some people are looking for ways to save the ancient cities. ""We don't want the slightest damage to Assur,"" one Iraqi official said.

446,458,"Making the Great Barrier Reef Even Greater
The Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia is the largest marine park in the world. It covers about 135,100 square miles. Recently, the Australian government added another 386 miles to the park.
The Great Barrier Reef is a series of coral reefs that were formed by billions of tiny creatures called
. As polyps die, they leave hard shells behind. Other polyps then live on top of the polyp shells. Over thousands of years, the polyp shells form a reef.
The Great Barrier Reef acts as a barrier for the northeastern coast of Australia. The reef prevents waves from slamming into the coastline and
, or washing away, too much land. It also provides a home for fish and other animals, including the dugong, a large mammal.
A colony of coral polyps can grow as much as 4 inches in a year.
Reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef are under stress. Pollution and disease are killing the polyps, and tourists take pieces of coral. Reefs are also damaged by ships and fishing nets, which break off sections of coral.
The damage is widespread, experts say. According to one report, by the World Resources Institute, more than half the world's reefs are at risk.
Australian government officials hope by expanding the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, they will help protect the reef and its inhabitants.
The expansion of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park will protect both the reef and an endangered marine animal called the
The plant-eating dugong is a cousin of the manatee, or sea cow, which is found in the warm waters of Florida. The dugong lives in the Pacific and Indian oceans. The average dugong is about 9 feet long and weighs up to 600 pounds.

447,371,"Why is one of America's most historic areas endangered?
One of the most historic regions in the United States is in trouble. The 175-mile-long area of land stretches through Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
The area is home to more American history than any other slice of land in the country, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. George Washington built his estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison also built their homes in that state. The region at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains includes many battlefields from the Civil War (18611865).
As people construct new houses, roads, and buildings, they are destroying acres of history. Officials say the region has lost more than 150,000 acres of farmland in the past 20 years. That is an area slightly smaller than New York City.
To call attention to the problem, the Trust placed this region on the 2005 list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. The trust works to
""This is where the Civil War was fought,"" says Richard Moe, president of the trust. ""This is where our Founding Fathers lived. ... There are African American sites. There are Native American sites. Our whole nation's history is, in one way or the other, [in this area].""
The following places are in the region between Pennsylvania and Virginia that was added to this year's list of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in the United States.
In 1863, the Battle of Gettysburg was fought in and around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The battle was the turning point of the Civil War.
Monticello was the home of Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States.
Dobbin House was used as a ""station"" for hiding runaway slaves on their dangerous journey to freedom along the Underground Railroad.

On average, kids ages 4 to 12 receive $18 a week. Here's how kids get that money:
Many adults think that kids spend their money as soon as they get it. That may be true for some young people, but not for 9-year-old twins Gabriel and Dylan Greene.
For the past three years, Gabriel and Dylan have taken part in Save for America. Save for America is a program that teaches kids the importance of saving money. The program also teaches kids
Last year, 750 schools and 90,000 kids took part in Save for America. Combined, those kids saved $1 million. Since the program began 12 years ago, kids have saved nearly $50 million!
One of the schools that takes part in the Save for America program is Setauket Elementary School, Setauket, New York. Every two weeks that school has Banking Day. Nearly 200 kids from the school deposit money on Banking Day, including Gabriel and Dylan.
Each boy deposits about $5 in his bank account on Banking Day. So far, Gabriel has saved $350, and Dylan has saved $340.
The kids who participate in Save for America save money and learn valuable lessons that they will use for the rest of their lives. Dylan explained that he has learned that saving money for the future can help him obtain the things he wants and lead a better life as an adult.
Save for America also helps kids sharpen their math skills. Gabriel said the program has improved his skills, especially in addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
The kids who take part in Save for America can use their money for a variety of things. Gabriel recently withdrew some of his savings to buy a new scooter. However, he's saving most of his money for college.

449,19,"The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States. It has nine justices. They are appointed for life by the president and approved by the Senate.
The Supreme Court rules whether federal, state, and local governments are following the written laws of the U.S. Constitution.
The Supreme Court hears only certain cases. Once the Court rules on a case, the decision is final. All other courts in the United States must follow the Supreme Court's decision in similar cases. This helps make sure that all Americans receive equal justice.

Quadratic sequences - Finding the nth term
Look again at the sequence of square numbers:
Whenever a sequence has a second difference of 2, it will be connected to the sequence of square numbers and the n
term will have something to do with n
term of the sequence 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, ... ?
The second difference is 2, so the n
term has something to do with n
The sequence of square numbers is: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
Our sequence is: 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, ...
Each term is 2 bigger than the corresponding term in the sequence of square numbers, so the rule for the n
term of the sequence 0, 3, 8, 15, 24, ... ?
The second differences are 2, so the formula has something to do with n2.
The sequence of square numbers is: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
Our sequence is: 0, 3, 8, 15, 24, ...
Each term in our sequence is 1 less than the corresponding term in the sequence of square numbers, so the rule for the n

Astronomy and space science - Gravitational forces
All objects are attracted towards each other by a force called
. Gravity only becomes noticeable when there is a really massive object like a star, planet or moon. You can find out more about gravity in the Revision Bite called
Gravitational forces between the Sun and planets keep the planets in
around the Sun. Without these forces, the planets would fly off into deep space.
Their orbits are slightly squashed circles called
. Diagrams often show the orbits as very squashed, but this is just to get a sense of perspective and to fit the diagrams onto the page.
The planets furthest out are also the coldest because they receive the least heat energy from the Sun.
take more time to complete an orbit
For example, Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, takes just 88 Earth days to complete an orbit. But Neptune, the furthest out, takes 164 Earth years to complete an orbit.
The graph shows the distances of the planets from the Sun and the time it takes them to orbit once around it. The shape of the curve shows that the further out a planet is the longer it takes to orbit the Sun.

456,89,"> Measures of average - The mode
The mode is the only average that can have more than one value.
When finding the mode, it helps to order the numbers first.
Find the mode of each of the following sets of numbers:
a) 3, 7, 1, 3, 4, 8, 3
b) 2, 7, 2, 1, 4, 7, 3
a) Start by placing the numbers in order:
1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 8
The number 3 occurs most often so the mode is
b) Start by placing the numbers in order:
1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 7
The numbers 2 and 7 occur more often than all other numbers so the modes are
In this frequency table, the mode is the value with the highest frequency:
In this example the modal shoe size is 7, because more people take size 7 than any other size.

Astronomy and space science - The Moon
The Moon orbits the Earth, so it is called a
. No-one built it or launched it into space.
Gravitational forces between the Moon and the Earth keep the Moon in orbit. The Moon does not produce light. But it does
light from the Sun, which is how we are able to see it from Earth. (Only stars produce light and they are called luminous for that reason.)
It takes the Moon 28 days to make a complete orbit of the Earth. As it orbits, we see the Moon lit from different angles. This is why we see
Sometimes the Moon looks like a full circle. That is called a 'full Moon'. At other times we see a crescent shaped Moon, because we can only see the edge of the part that is lit by the Sun.
Remember that we can only see the part of the Moon that reflects the Sun's light. How much of that we can see depends upon the position of the Moon in its orbit.
This slideshow shows the phases of the Moon, as seen from the Earth.
A common mistake is to think that the phases of the Moon happen because the Earth gets in the way, and casts its shadow onto the Moon. That is not how the phases are caused.
However sometimes it does happen that the Earth's shadow falls on the Moon. Then we get an
of the Moon. The whole Moon goes from full, to dark, and back again to full, in the course of a few hours.

460,493,"> Introduction to formulas - Like terms
Algebraic terms that have the same letter are called like terms. Only like terms can be added or subtracted.
So 9b, -7b and 13b are like terms, but 6t, 5x and -11z are not like terms.
When like terms are added and subtracted it is called
The Khan family and the Norman family visit the zoo together - there are 8 children and 7 adults in the group. Because there are more than 10 people, the families can take advantage of a special offer - 1 child can be admitted free of charge.
for the cost of child admission, and
3g + 3k + 5g + 4k - g
Simplified = 3g + 5g - g + 3k + 4k =
A term, like a number, belongs with the
that sits in front of it. So in the expression 2k - g, g belongs with the - sign that sits in front of it, so it is - g; and 2k belongs with the + sign that sits in front of it, making it + 2k.
Collect all the like terms together, eg, re-write the expression 3g + 2k + 5g + 4k - g with all the g s and all the k s together: 3g + 5g - g + 2k + 4k
When you add or subtract terms, keep each term with their + or - sign.
Simplify 4x + y - 2x + 6y.
Re-write the expression by putting the like terms next to each other. remember to keep the plus or minus signs with the terms they belong to.
4x + y - 2x + 6y
= 4x - 2x + y + 6y

Behaviour of matter - Pressure in gases
If you ride your bike over a bump in the road, you will be pleased that gases exert
on the walls of their container. A pumped-up tyre cushions the rider against bumps, but a flat tyre does not. The pressure of the air inside a flat tyre is just too low to do this.
The particles in a gas move quickly in all directions, but they don't get far before they bump into each other or the walls of their container. When gas particles hit the walls of their container they cause pressure. The more particles that hit the walls, the higher the pressure.
This is why the pressure in a tyre or balloon goes up when more air is pumped in.
Gas particles hit the walls of their container and cause pressure
. They hit the walls of their container harder and more often. This increases the pressure. Sometimes the pressure gets so great that the container bursts.
This is why balloons and tyyres burst if you blow them up too much. It's also why deodorant spray cans carry warning signs to tell you not to leave them in the sunshine. If they get too hot they explode.
Under pressure? See what happens when you cool down.

The advert says that the cost of a party is 50 plus 5 per person, so what would be the cost of a party for 10?
50 + 10  5 = 50 + 50 = 100
What would be the cost of a party for 20?
50 + 20  5 = 50 + 100 =
How do you work out the cost if you don't know the number of people who will attend the party?
The cost for 10 people is 50 + 5  10 = 100
The cost for 20 people is 50 + 5  20 = 150
So the cost for n people is 50 + 5  n = (50 + 5n)
With this formula you can work out the cost of a party for any number of people.
Have a go at the next question to see if you can use
Alexa is 12 years old. How old will she be in n years time?
years time her age will have increased by n. So her age will be n more than it is now.
Check your answer. In 1 years time she will be 13. If we put 1 in for the value of
we get 12 +1 = 13. So that is correct.
In ten years she will be 22, and putting n=10 gives us
age = 12 + 10 = 22

Collecting and recording data - Stem and leaf diagrams
A stem and leaf diagram is one way of grouping your data into classes and
A maths test is marked out of 50. The marks for the class are shown below:
This is all the information you need, but it is very hard to interpret. For example, is it easy to tell whether more children got marks in the 20s than the 30s? Can you tell at a glance what the highest mark was, or whether more than one person achieved the same result?
One way to represent the data so that you can answer these questions is in a
. This diagram shows exactly the same results as in the example above:
The stem and leaf diagram is formed by splitting the numbers into two parts - in this case tens and units.
This information is given in the Key.
The numbers are usually ordered, so the row:
shows the numbers 21, 23, 24, 24, 25, and 27 in order.
Using the stem and leaf diagram above, answer the following questions.
Q2. What was the most common score?
A1. You can work this out by looking at the 3 column in the 10s:
A2. You can work this out from the stem and leaf diagram below:

465,112,"> Drama - Working from a script
There's much more to acting than just reading a script out loud. If you're nervous, it's tempting to read the lines really quickly, using the same tone of voice all the way through, but this isn't very interesting for your audience.
Try to think of the punctuation as musical notes telling you when to pause for a breath (or for dramatic effect!). Don't be tempted to take a little break at the end of each line - the piece might not make sense.
To understand this, first read the script below, pausing at the end of each line. Then try again using the punctuation as your guide for when to pause.
Juliet is waiting for the nurse to come home and tell her whether the wedding with Romeo is still on. Time is ticking and she's pretty fed up.
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood
She would be as swift in motion as a ball:
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
But old folks, many feign as they were dead -
Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.
Which way worked better? Using the punctuation as your guide makes it sound like a real person thinking aloud.
Don't be such a drama queen! Try this activity.
Talk your way out of trouble using your English skills.
Get creative, go backstage and find drama tips and inspiration.

466,482,"A sentence is made up of words put together to do a certain job.
Let's take a look at what those pieces are and how they fit together to make a sentence.
First, we have words. Words are the smallest meaningful bits of sense.
Each of these words does a different job.
is a verb - it tells us what happens in a sentence.
is a noun - it names things in a sentence.
is an adjective - it gives us more detail about a noun.
We put words together to make a
A phrase is a short, single piece of information:
We use phrases to make a clause.
A clause is a larger word group that includes a little more information. It consists at least two phrases - one is a noun phrase known as the subject, and the other is the verb.
In this clause, the noun phrase is
This now takes us to the sentence.
If we put a capital letter at the beginning of the clause we've used, and a full stop at the end, we have a sentence.
. A simple sentence consists of one clause that has a subject and a verb. A simple sentence puts across one simple idea.
A complex sentence is used to put across more
ideas. A complex sentence contains one main clause that can make sense on its own, and one or more minor clauses that are linked to it.
The main clause is the 'big dog barked' because it has a subject and a verb and makes sense by itself.
The minor clause is 'When I arrived'. Although it is a clause with a subject and a verb, it doesn't make sense on its own, it needs a main clause.
We can add more minor clauses to make a more complex sentence.
We can even split the main clause with a minor clause and still have a complex sentence.

467,161,"The meeting starts at two. The meeting is in the usual room. The speaker is arriving at half past one. She will need an overhead projector for the meeting. Our overhead projector is broken. Get another one from Sally. John will start the meeting. You will introduce the speaker. The speaker is going to talk for about half an hour. You need to register any guests. Someone from staffing will do the displays. John will organise coffee and biscuits for afterwards.
Q1. Each sentence is good on its own.
Q2. Each sentence has something wrong with it.
Q3. It has too many complex sentences.
Q4. It has too many simple sentences.
A2. No. They are all good sentences on their own.

The meeting, which starts at two, is in the usual room, but the speaker is arriving at half past one. She will need an overhead projector so get one from Sally because ours is broken. John will start the meeting and you will introduce the speaker, who's going to talk for about half an hour. Someone from staffing will do the displays but you need to register any guests and John will organise coffee and biscuits for afterwards.
Don't worry if yours isn't exactly the same. The main point is to join ideas together and make it interesting to read.

Offers a balanced examination of an issue or text
Investigates an issue or text's key points
Unlike a review, it's not solely focused on pros and cons or good and bad
is more subjective and personal. Personal knowledge and authority will make your conclusions count. However, you will still need to support your points with valid reasons. A review
Draws a conclusion, saying whether something works for its audience and purpose
gives purely subjective and personal views on a topic. If you're asked to give one in class, you should still be authoritative providing support for your views. A comment:
Uses the first person narrator  I think, In my opinion, I really like this
Although other comments may not, you should support your ideas with evidence when you comment in class.
Make all that writing make sense. Try this!

. Think of a playground see-saw. The pivot is the thing in the middle of it. When no-one is on the see-saw it is level, but it tips up if someone gets onto one end. Turning forces around a pivot are called
It is possible to balance the see-saw again if someone else gets onto the other end and sits in the correct place. This is because the turning forces are balanced. We say the moments are equal and opposite.
, we need to know two things:
the distance from the pivot that the force is applied.
This is the equation for working out a moment:
Imagine that a force of 10 N acted on a see-saw 2 m from the pivot. This is how we would work out the moment:
Notice that the unit of moment is
(newton metre). Don't get confused with a 'newton meter', which is another name for a forcemeter.
Here is an example of balanced moments. 10N at 2m from the pivot is balancing 20N at 1m from the pivot. The objects create moments of 20Nm that are equal and opposite, so the see-saw is balanced.
A see-saw will balance if the moments on each side of the pivot are equal. This is why you might have to adjust your position on a see-saw if you are a different weight from the person on the other end.
If a nut is difficult to undo with a short spanner, a longer spanner will help. This is because there will be a bigger moment on the nut, when the same force is applied further from the pivot.
Using the same principle you can increase the moment applied by a lever or a crowbar, and this can help you move heavy objects more easily.

Fiction texts are written mainly to entertain the reader - they usually tell a story, but they can often be thought-provoking. Some may help you to make sense of, or understand, life better; some are a way for the writer to give their views and opinions of the world.

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to advise
Once you can argue and persuade, it should be easy to advise. The trick is to be gentle - it's no good pushing your ideas at your readers, or trying to impress them. Instead, you should come across as friendly, as someone who just wants to help.
For instance, imagine you're writing to advise someone in Year 9 who is moving house and has to change schools. We know that it won't be easy - they'll have to make new friends and cope with all sorts of changes. So you need to be sympathetic and give some ideas you think could help.
The first thing might be to plan each main idea in a separate paragraph because it's easier to follow like this. Then think about how you want to present your ideas. It might be fine to give some information as an order, such as:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone.
You can add information to this - perhaps explaining why and giving an example of what to do, so now your paragraph looks like this:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone. Most people will be glad to help and it's the quickest way to make friends. You can ask a teacher, but it might be better to ask one of the other pupils. Choose a friendly face if you can, and don't be shy - it might be their first day too.
It is not just the information that makes this a good piece of advice, it's also the style. It includes words like ""might"" and ""can"". These make the ideas softer - they are not in your face and pushing you to agree, they just guide you. And they are very simple to use, so make sure you include words like ""should, can, could, might, ought to and may"" - each one turns an idea into a piece of advice.

472,577,"> The Tempest Summary - Drunken clowns
Ariel brings Ferdinand (the King's son) to Prospero's cave. Ferdinand thinks he's the only survivor from the shipwreck. Miranda, who has seen no other man but her father during her time on the island, sees Ferdinand and thinks he must be a spirit - while Ferdinand thinks Miranda is a goddess. The two young people fall in love, but Prospero is not pleased, and makes Ferdinand his prisoner.
On another part of the island we discover one of the groups of shipwreck survivors. They begin to wake up. They're surprised that their clothes seem fresh and new.
Ariel's magical song puts them to sleep again - all except Sebastian (the King's brother) and Antonio (Prospero's brother). Antonio convinces Sebastian that they should kill the King (Alonso) so that Sebastian can take his place. Fortunately everyone else wakes up again, before they can carry out their plan.
Elsewhere on the island, Trinculo, a jester who was on board the ship, comes across Caliban. Trinculo's drunken friend Stephano turns up, and gives Caliban strong alcohol. This makes Caliban believe that Stephano is more powerful than Prospero (who Caliban hates).
Meanwhile, Ariel, who has made himself invisible, watches the three drunken clowns. He causes havoc by whispering the accusation ""thou liest"" in Caliban's ear, then Stephano's. They become confused and fight.
Caliban reveals his plans to destroy Prospero and take over the island. Stephano drunkenly agrees. Caliban is delighted that Stephano has agreed to his plan and they sing to celebrate. Ariel plays a tune to accompany their singing which frightens both Trinculo and Stephano.
Caliban tells them not to be afraid in a moving speech that describes the beauty and magic of the island. Stephano, Trinculo and Caliban follow the sound of the music.

473,617,"This Revision Bite will give you a general summary of The Tempest.
You need to know the basic plot then work out what the people in the play are like, and how they get along. You should also think about how actors should perform the play to an audience, and the main 'big' topics - such as love, time, truth - that it deals with.

474,235,"> Tone and style - Style tips
Another top style tip is to avoid being boring. It sounds obvious, but many writers put in far too much information. In fact, some even write most of the question out again when they start their answer. So what should you do?
At the beginning, don't waffle, get straight to the point. Don't just repeat things in your conclusion. Put yourself in the reader's shoes - which of these two starts to a school magazine article do you prefer?
Do you know someone who is being bullied right now? Don't know what to do? Well we decided to send Stuart Smith (Year 8) around the school to find out just how bad bullying is, and to come up with some ideas about what we can do to stop it.
Bullying is when people are cruel to other people. It can be hurting them, like kicking them, or hurting them using horrible names. It could be other things too. My article for the school magazine is about bullying. I am going to start by saying what the problem of bullying is and then...
The first one is much better - it gets straight to the point and you want to read on. The second version repeats parts of the question, but for no reason. People who are reading the school magazine don't have to be reminded in each article that it is the school magazine. We also know the article is about bullying from the first sentence, but Stuart's definition is poor and the whole article is slow to get started.

Energy transfer and storage - Energy transfer diagrams
Energy transfer diagrams show the locations of
. For example, consider the energy transfers in the simple electrical circuit below.
We can show the transfers like this:
the energy to the surroundings by light. These are the
energy transfers - we use electric lamps to light up our rooms.
But there are also energy transfers that are not useful to us. In the example above, the lamp also transfers energy to the surroundings by
. If we include this energy transfer, the diagram looks like this:
Sankey diagrams summarise all the energy transfers taking place in a process. The thicker the line or arrow, the greater the amount of energy involved. This Sankey diagram for the lamp shows that it transfers most of the energy by heating, rather than by light:
Notice that the total amount of energy transferred to the surroundings is the same as the amount of electrical energy. We say that the energy has been conserved. Energy is always conserved, it is never ""lost"" or ""wasted"", although some energy transfers are useful and some are not.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The end
Meanwhile, in Mantua, Romeo waits for news. A servant called Balthasar arrives and tells Romeo that he has heard that Juliet has died. Romeo decides to buy some poison. He plans to go to see Juliet's body where he will take the poison and die next to her.
Meanwhile, Friar John explains to Friar Lawrence that the letter he wanted him to take to Romeo explaining the truth about Juliet didn't get delivered. Friar Lawrence decides to go to the tomb and wait for Juliet to wake up while he sends another letter to Romeo.
That same evening, Paris goes to Juliet's tomb with some flowers. He hears a noise and decides to investigate.
Romeo pays Balthasar off and breaks into the Capulet tomb. Paris tries to stop him. Romeo begs him to leave him alone, but Paris thinks he is vandalising the tomb. They fight. Romeo kills Paris. Just before Paris dies he asks Romeo to place him next to Juliet's body. Romeo is sad that he had to kill Paris and takes him into the tomb to be near Juliet.
When Romeo sees Juliet lying in the tomb, he can't believe that she is dead because she looks so beautiful. He hugs her and kisses her. He takes the poison then kisses her again and dies.
Friar Lawrence finds the bodies of Paris and Romeo just as Juliet is about to wake up. Juliet wakes up and asks the Friar where Romeo is. He hears a noise and begs Juliet to come away with him, but when she finds out that Romeo is dead, she refuses to go with him. Friar Lawrence runs away.
Juliet tries to kiss the poison off Romeo's lips. His lips are still warm, but there is not enough poison left on them to kill her. She takes his dagger and stabs herself.
Some watchmen discover the bodies outside the tomb. They also find the Friar who is crying and shaking. Prince Escalus and Juliet's mother and father arrive with Romeo's father. Friar Lawrence tells them all the truth about the wedding and their children's deaths. He feels so guilty that he asks the Prince to punish him, but Prince Escalus won't because the Friar is a holy man. Prince Escalus blames Montague and Capulet, but he also blames himself for not doing enough to stop the violence. Capulet and Montague decide to end their rift. Montague offers to have a statue of Juliet made. The play ends as the Prince says that this is the saddest story ever told.

Diet, drugs and health - Absorption and egestion
These are the processes that happen in the digestive system:
We've already looked at how foods are broken down by enzymes in digestion. Now we will look at how the products of digestion are absorbed into the body.
. This means that they pass through the wall of the small intestine and into our
. Once in the bloodstream, the digested food molecules are carried around the body to where they are needed.
Only small, soluble substances can pass across the wall of the small intestine. Large insoluble substances cannot pass through. Study the slideshow to check your understanding of this.
The inside wall of the small intestine needs to be
. This allows absorption to happen quickly and efficiently. If the small intestine had a thick wall and a small surface area, a lot of digested food might pass out of the body before it had a chance to be absorbed.
To get a big surface area, the inside wall of the small intestine is lined with tiny
). These stick out and give a big surface area. They also contain blood capillaries to carry away the absorbed food molecules.
Excess water is absorbed back into the body in the large intestine. What is left then is undigested food. This is stored in the
, the lower part of the large intestine, until we are ready to go to the toilet. It then comes out of the rectum through the

481,382,"> Magnets and electric current - Electromagnets
When an electric current flows in a wire it creates a magnetic field around the wire.
we can strengthen the magnetic field. Electromagnets are made from coils like this.
We can make an electromagnet stronger by doing these things:
The magnetic field around an electromagnet is just the same as the one around a bar magnet. It can, however, be reversed by turning the battery around.
Unlike bar magnets, which are permanent magnets, the magnetism of electromagnets can be turned on and off just by closing or opening the switch.

483,145,"Ratios are used in everyday life and can help you work out problems including scale drawings and reading maps.
In a scale drawing, all dimensions have been reduced by the same proportion.
A model boat is made to a scale of 1:20 (1 to 20). This scale can be applied to any units, so 1mm measured on the model is 20mm on the actual boat, 1cm measured on the model is 20cm on the actual boat, and so on.
a) If the 1:20 model boat is 15cm wide, how wide is the actual boat?
b) If the boat has a mast of height 4m, how high is the mast on the model?
The scale is 1:20. This means that every cm on the model is equivalent to 20cm on the boat.
a) 1cm on the model = 20cm on the boat, so:
b) 20cm on the boat = 1cm on the model
so mast height on real boat  20 = mast height on model
400cm (4m) on the boat = 400cm  20 =
Maps scales can be written in ratios and tell you how many units of land, sea etc are equal to one unit on the map.
If you are travelling from Manchester to Newcastle, for example, and need to know how far it is, it would be very difficult to work this out if the map does not have a scale.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. A distance is measured as 3cm on the map.
How many cm, m and km is this equivalent to in real life?
1 cm on the map represents 50 000cm. Therefore, 3cm on the map represents 150 000cm.
To convert from cm to m, divide by 100.
To convert from m to km divide by 1000.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. What distance on the map will represent 5km?
5km = 5000m = 5000  100 cm = 500 000cm
We want to know what distance on the map represents 500 000cm in real life.
The map scale is 1:50 000, so we divide by 50 000
500 000  50 000 = 10

486,598,"> Electric current and voltage - Introduction
Electric circuits can be series or parallel. You need to know the symbols we use to draw circuit diagrams.
An ammeter measures electric current, in amps, by measuring how much charge is flowing in the circuit. A voltmeter measures, in volts, the difference in electrical energy between two points of a circuit.

We get energy from many different types of energy resources, including fuels, food and stores of energy such as batteries or the wind. We can divide energy resources into two categories:
Non-renewable energy resources cannot be replaced once they are all used up.
Renewable energy resources can be replaced, and will not run out.
On the this page we'll look at non-renewable resources.
are called fossil fuels. They formed millions of years ago from the remains of living things. Coal was formed from plants. Oil and natural gas were formed from sea creatures.
The energy stored in the fossil fuels originally came from
. Plants used light energy from the Sun for
to make their chemicals. This stored chemical energy was transferred to stored chemical energy in animals that ate the plants. When the living things died, they were gradually buried by layers of rock. The buried remains were put under pressure and chemical reactions heated them up. They gradually changed into the fossil fuels.
When the remains of the plants and animals became fossil fuels, their chemical energy was stored in the fuels. The energy is transferred to the surroundings as
Once we have used them all up, they will take millions of years to replace, if they can be replaced at all. For this reason we call fossil fuels

499,391,"> Forces - Weight, mass and gravity
People often confuse mass and weight. Remember that weight is a force, and is measured in newtons. Mass is measured in kilograms (kg).
The mass of an object is the
or ""stuff"" it contains. The more matter an object contains, the greater its mass. An elephant contains more matter than a mouse, so it has a greater mass. Mass is measured in
A 100 kg object has a greater mass than a 5 kg object. Remember an object's mass stays the same wherever it is.
All objects have a force that attracts them towards each other. This is called
. Even you attract other objects to you because of gravity, but you have too little mass for the force to be very strong.
Gravity only becomes noticeable when there is a really massive object like a moon, planet or star. We are pulled down towards the ground because of gravity. The gravitational force pulls in the direction towards the centre of the Earth.
""Down"" is towards the centre of the Earth, wherever you are on the planet
Weight is a force caused by gravity. The weight of an object is the
between the object and the Earth. The more mass the object has the greater its weight will be.
Weight is a force, so it's measured in
. On the surface of the Earth an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 10 N.
The mass of an object stays the same wherever it is, but its weight can change. This happens if the object goes somewhere where gravity is stronger, or weaker, such as the Moon.
The Moon has less mass than the Earth, so its gravity is less than the Earth's gravity. This means that objects weigh less on the Moon than they do on the Earth.
The Moon's gravity is one sixth of the Earth's gravity. A 120 kg astronaut weighs 1200 N on Earth. On the Moon they would weigh only 200 N. The astronaut's
The weight of an object changes if the strength of gravity changes
Remember: a mass of 1kg has a weight of about 10N on Earth.

Diet, drugs and health - Digestion and enzymes
Our teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. Enzymes are needed so that this break-down happens quickly enough to be useful.
Take care - enzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients:
. Carbohydrase enzymes break down starch into sugars.
The saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough, the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet.
. Protease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. Digestion of proteins in the stomach is helped by
, which is strong hydrochloric acid. This also kills harmful micro-organisms that may be in the food.
Lipase enzymes break down fat into fatty acids and glycerol. Digestion of fat in the
, made in the liver. Bile breaks the fat into small droplets that are easier for the lipase enzymes to work on.
are already small enough to be absorbed by the body without being broken down, so they are not digested.
, which is why it cannot be absorbed by the body.

505,171,"> Explore, imagine and entertain - Short-stories
A short-story is easy to write if you:
Have only one or two main characters. It's a short story and you don't have time for any more.
Use people's words and actions as much as possible. Don't try to give lots of background information - let the reader use their own imagination. Remember - creative writing means creative reading too!
Make your characters and plot realistic. How do people really speak and act? Remember, most writers base some of their characters on people they actually know, so who can you use to improve your story? Would your granny make a good secret agent or your uncle a confident contract killer?
Get straight to the point. Don't worry about long openings or lots of detail. Instead, launch right in, hopefully in the middle of some action, like in the example below.
Steve held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - he was too shocked to speak. One moment he had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next he was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
You will also have to decide whether to write in the first person (using ""I""), or in the third person (typically, using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they""). Using ""I"" makes it easier to write about thoughts and feelings, but using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they"" lets you move from person to person, or from place to place. You can choose whichever you feel happiest with. For instance, we can swap the opening of the story into the first person, like this:
I held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - I was too shocked to speak. One moment I had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next I was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
The only thing you shouldn't do is swap the person - dont start with ""I"" and then switch to ""he"", or you'll spoil the story.

Fractions - Mixed numbers and improper fractions
A whole number can be written as
, because it is made up of a whole number and a fraction.
, because the top number is bigger than the bottom number.
Converting from a mixed number to an improper fraction
You can write the whole number part as a fraction, then add the fractions together.
Converting from improper fractions to mixed numbers
You can separate out the fraction into smaller fractions, like this:
Another way to convert an improper fraction is to find how many whole numbers you get, by using a division.
We start by dividing the top number by the bottom number.
17 divided by 5 is 3 remainder 2.
So the whole number part is 3, and the remainder 2 means there are
= 20  7 = 2 remainder 6, so
If your calculator has a fraction button you can use this to convert from improper fractions to mixed numbers. Type in the improper fraction, press '=', and the calculator will convert it to a mixed number.

515,36,"> Compounds and mixtures - Chemical formulae
Remember that we use chemical symbols to stand for the elements. For example,
stands for sodium. For a molecule we use the chemical symbols of the atoms it contains to write down its
For example the formula for carbon monoxide is
. It tells you that each molecule of carbon monoxide consists of one carbon atom joined to one oxygen atom.
Take care when writing your symbols and formulae. Be careful about when to use capital letters. For example
means a molecule of carbon monoxide but
The word 'formulae' (""form-u-lee"") is the plural of 'formula'. If we have more than one formula, we don't say formulas, we say formulae.
If the molecule contains more than one atom of an element we use numbers to show this. The numbers are written below the element symbol. For example, the formula for carbon dioxide is
. It tells you that each molecule has one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.
Take care when writing these formulae. The small number go at the bottom. For example CO
Some formulae are more complicated. For example, the formula for sodium sulfate is
. It tells you that sodium sulfate contains two sodium atoms (
All compounds have a definite composition. Let's look at water as an example. A water molecule always has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom - it cannot be a water molecule if it has different numbers of these atoms. Its formula is always

516,297,"When all the food chains in a habitat are joined up together they form a food web. Here is an example of a food web:
Although it looks complex, it is just several food chains joined together. Here are some of the food chains in this food web:
grass  insect  vole  hawk
grass  insect  frog  fox
grass  insect  vole  fox
Notice that the frogs, voles and insects have more than one predator, but the rabbits and slugs have just one predator.
This leads to some interesting effects if the population of a particular organism in the food web decreases. Some animals can just eat more of another organism if food is in short supply, while others may starve and die. This in turn can affect the populations of other organisms in the food web.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - Issues and ideas
The two extracts deal with some deep issues. You will need to discuss how these are brought out. Some of the 'big' themes are:
If the question asks you to comment on how the theme of time is explored, consider these points:
Montague and Benvolio discuss the ""ancient quarrel"" and how it escalated so swiftly because of the quick tempers of servants from each opposing family along with Tybalt's ""fiery"" reaction.
Time passes slowly for Romeo whilst he is in a bad mood. He hides himself away during the daytime.
Romeo is impatient to have a physical relationship and does not want to wait for Rosaline.
Romeo gets over Rosaline quickly and falls for Juliet suddenly. Juliet falls in love just as quickly with Romeo.
Having spent one evening together they are planning their wedding for the next day.
Can love happen so quickly? Maybe Romeo and Juliet have not considered the consequences of their relationship so it was bound to go wrong from the start. Or maybe this a classic example of love at first sight: sudden, powerful, and beyond the control.

Compounds and mixtures - Metal and non-metals oxides
Remember that metals react with oxygen in the air to produce metal oxides, like magnesium oxide.
Non-metals react with oxygen in the air to produce non-metal oxides. Here are two examples for the non-metals carbon and sulfur.
Carbon burns in air to form carbon dioxide:
Sulfur burns in air to form sulfur dioxide:
Non-metal oxides such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide are responsible for
. They dissolve in the water in the clouds to form acidic solutions. Acid rain damages rocks and buildings, and harms wildlife.
Differences between metal oxides and non-metal oxides
There are some important differences between the physical and chemical properties of metal oxides and non-metal oxides. The table shows some of these differences.

Writer's tricks - The effect on the reader
You will now be very familiar with the idea that every text is intended to affect its readers in some way.
Every reader is, of course, different too, and sometimes a text will affect you in ways a writer didn't imagine, or you might notice depth in it that others won't. This is particularly true if the text matches your personal experience. A story about your home town might interest you more than one about somewhere else, or a text about smoking might affect you more if you know somebody who is trying to give it up.
Remember, you get marks for noticing the intended effect on the reader. Even if something doesn't interest, horrify, amuse or persuade you, you need to spot what the writer meant to do. It's usually better not to mention your personal opinion unless you are asked to.
Use your knowledge to help Spherox find his way home.

Changes in the environment - Climate change
Some heat energy from the Earths surface escapes into space. If too much heat energy escaped, the planet would be very cold. However some gases in the atmosphere can trap escaping heat energy, causing some of it to pass back to the surface.
, and they keep our planet warm, which is a good thing.
such as oil, coal and natural gas. The energy released is used to power cars and other machines, to generate electricity, and to keep buildings warm. The burning fuel releases waste gases, including carbon dioxide. As the human population increases, more fuel is used, and more carbon dioxide is released.
The extra carbon dioxide increases the greenhouse effect. More heat is trapped by the atmosphere, causing the planet to become warmer than it would be naturally. The increase in global temperature this causes is called
The amount of carbon dioxide in the air has increased a lot in recent years
The average temperature of the planet has increased in recent years
Global warming is beginning to cause big changes in the environment. These include:
ice melting faster than it can be replaced in the Arctic and Antarctic
the oceans warming up  their water is expanding and causing sea levels to rise
changes in where different species of plants and animals can live

525,262,"When using trial and improvement guess what the answer might be, then improve on it until you get close to the correct answer.
A square has an area of 20 cm
. Use a method of trial and improvement to find the length of its side, correct to 1 decimal place (1 d.p.).
4 is too small, so try 5:
4 is too small, and 5 is too big, so the answer lies between 4 and 5.
between 4.4 and 4.5, but it is closer to 4.5
The question asked us to find the length of the side correct to 1 d.p., so you only need to try values with 1 d.p.
If, however, the question had asked for values correct to 2 d.p. you would have got a more accurate answer. For example:

526,141,"> Measures - Speed, distance and time
Speed is worked out by dividing the distance travelled by the time taken:
If you travel at 70 km in 2 hours. What is your average speed?
Speed = 70  2 = 35 km/h
The distance in km and the time in h, so the units for speed are km/h.
If you know the speed, you can work out the time or the distance by re-arranging the equation.
hours at an average speed of 4 miles/h. How far will you have walked?
Distance = 4  1.5 = 6 miles

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - Characters
In the First Key Extract, Romeo claimed to be in love with a girl called Rosaline. By the early hours of the very next morning, in the Second Key Extract, Romeo is exchanging ""love's faithful vows"" with Juliet.
It could be said that when it comes to relationships, Romeo isn't very faithful. On the other hand, perhaps he has found his soul mate in Juliet.
Romeo seemed to be in love with the idea of love, perhaps even more than he was in love with Rosaline. Apart from saying that she was beautiful, he wasn't very complimentary about her personality.
Romeo is besotted by Juliet; the fact that she is beautiful plays a big part.
Romeo loves the language of love. His speeches are full of confusing imagery as he tries to work out just exactly what love is.
Romeo tries to impress Juliet with his poetic descriptions about love. Juliet's words somehow seem more heartfelt than Romeo's clever poetry.
Montague and Benvolio discuss how moody Romeo has been lately. When he enters the scene, the audience can see for themselves how his mood can swing from despair to humour and back again.
Juliet is a deeply emotional person and is open about her feelings from the start. Romeo seems to get caught up in that wave of her emotion. They go from being complete strangers to committed lovers in a matter of hours.
Romeo stubbornly swears that he could never love anyone other than Rosalinebut as we see in the Second Key Extract, by the very next morning he is planning his wedding to Juliet.
Both characters make decisions quickly and take risks lightly. Romeo and Juliet could both be described as impulsive in their actions.

To work out pressure, we need to know two things:
the area over which the force or weight works.
This is the equation for working out pressure:
A force of 20 N acted over an area of 2 m
(two square metres). What is the pressure?
Notice that the unit of pressure here is N/m
(newtons per square metre). Sometimes you will see another unit being used. This is called the
, so in the example above the pressure is 10 Pa.
Drawing pins make good use of pressure
Drawing pins have a large round end for you to push. The round end has a large area, so it applies a low pressure to your thumb. The sharp end has a very small area. The same pushing force produces a high pressure there, so it pushes into the notice board.
If you swing round on one leg of a chair, you put four times as much pressure on one point of the floor as you do if you sit properly. This is because four chair legs spread the pressure over four times more area than one chair leg can.

530,441,"We can see why variety is important by looking at this list below. It is taken from a story called ""You are now entering the human heart"", by Janet Frame, and is actually one of her paragraphs broken down into simple sentences:
None of them had ever touched a live snake.
They were waiting for the drama to begin.
The attendant took a green snake out of a basket.
He draped the snake around the teacher's neck.
She did not have a chance to protest.
He stepped back to admire the sight.
It doesn't really sound right. How could the writer change this to convey the drama of the situation? Look again at the sentences and decide what changes you could make, which ones you could join. Then click here to compare your ideas with the version in the book.
Her eyes faced the lighted exit. I saw her fear. The children, none of whom had ever touched a live snake, were sitting hushed, waiting for the drama to begin; one or two looked afraid, as the attendant withdrew a green snake about three feet long from the basket and with a swift movement, before the teacher could protest, draped it around her neck and stepped back, admiring and satisfied.
So the key points to remember about sentences are:
You should have a variety of sentences in each piece you write.
Complex sentences cause the most problems, but they can be the best for linking ideas and arguing your point.
Different types of sentence suit different purposes, so think carefully about what you are trying to do.
Connectives are a good way of linking ideas. They can provide a more detailed structure and help readers.
You write sentences all the time. Find out when and where to use them.

531,330,"Ducklings are able to walk almost immediately after hatching from the egg, and can even swim after a few days. They recognise their mother because of a behaviour type called
Ducklings will follow the first moving object they meet after hatching. They become socially attached to this object and treat it as their mother.
Imprinting lets young animals recognise their mother from a young age. They can follow her for food and protection.
Imprinting is useful if the first moving object they see really is their mother. But ducklings will imprint on people, balls and even cardboard boxes if these happen to be the first things they see.
Geese, chicks, and other baby birds that can walk around shortly after hatching, also show imprinting behaviour. Konrad Lorenz (1903 to 1989) was an Austrian scientist who studied animal behaviour.
He discovered that if he reared geese from when they hatched, they became imprinted on him. They followed him around and preferred to be near him even when they had grown into adult geese. Lorenz won the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine because of his experiments on animal behaviour.

Astronomy and space science - Days and nights
as they orbit the Sun. It takes the Earth 24 hours to make one complete turn on its axis, so an Earth day is 24 hours long.
Different planets take different amounts of time to make one complete turn, so they have different lengths of day.
The Sun lights up one half of the Earth, and the other half is in shadow. As the Earth spins we move from shadow to light and back to shadow and so on. It is daytime in the UK when our part of the planet is in the lit by the Sun. And it is night-time in the UK when our part of the planet is facing away from the Sun.
During the day, the Sun appears to move through the sky. Remember that this happens because the Earth is spinning on its axis. In the UK if we look south and follow the path of Sun in the sky during the day, it looks like this:
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west
. That's because the Earth is spinning towards to the east, so we see the Sun first appear there at the start of the day. The Sun 'rises' in the east and 'sets' in the west.
One way to remember which way the Earth turns is to remember ""
"", which means the Earth spins from west to east.
Star trails made by leaving the camera shutter open during the night
During the night, we cannot see the Sun. But the Earth is still spinning on its axis. This means that the stars appear to move from east to west in the sky, just as the Sun does in the day.

forces. These forces act in the opposite direction to the movement. Friction makes it harder for things to move.
friction between our shoes and the floor stop us from slipping
friction between tyres and the road stop cars from skidding
friction between the brakes and wheel help bikes and cars slow down
Frictional forces are much smaller on smooth surfaces than on rough surfaces, which is why we slide on ice.
Friction can also be unhelpful. If you don't lubricate your bike regularly with oil, the friction in the chain and axles increases. Your bike will be noisy and difficult to pedal.
When there is a lot of friction between moving parts, energy is lost to the surroundings as

as they move. Air resistance is caused by the frictional forces of the air against the vehicle. The faster the vehicle moves, the bigger the air resistance becomes. The top speed of a vehicle is reached when the force from the cyclist or engine is balanced by air resistance.
Racing cyclists crouch down low on their bikes to
the air resistance on them. This helps them to cycle faster. They also wear streamlined helmets. These have special, smooth shapes that allow the air to flow over the cyclist more easily.
Modern cars are also streamlined. Their smooth shapes make the air resistance smaller, which allows them to travel further on the same amount of fuel.

540,101,"Try out these example questions about relative frequency.
Q1. 100 people were asked whether they were left-handed. Four people answered 'yes'. What is the relative frequency of 'left-handed'?
Q2. A white counter was taken from a bag of different coloured counters, and then replaced. The relative frequency of getting a white counter was found to be 0.3. If the bag contained 20 counters, estimate the number of white counters.
A1. The relative frequency is 4/100 =
A2. The relative frequency of white counters is 0.3, and there are 20 counters in the bag, so, as an estimate, 0.3  20 =
Relative frequency can only be used as an estimate.

Life processes - The respiratory system and ventilation
The human respiratory system contains the organs that allow us to get the oxygen we need and to remove the waste carbon dioxide we don't need. It contains these parts:
tubes leading from the lungs to the mouth and nose
various structures in the chest that allow air to move in and out of the lungs.
In order to see this content you need to have both
Movements of the ribs, rib muscles and diaphragm allow air into and out of the lungs. Take care - this is called
, not respiration. When we breathe in, we inhale. When we breathe out, we exhale.
Air passes between the lungs and the outside of the body through the
. The trachea divides into two bronchi, with one bronchus for each lung.
Each bronchus divides further in the lungs into smaller tubes called bronchioles. At the end of each bronchiole, there is a group of tiny air sacs. These air sacs have bulges called

Romeo and Juliet first key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Montagues and Capulets have just had a fight in a public place in Verona. Prince Escalus stopped it and warned that if it happens again, those involved will be punished by death.
The first set scene begins with Montague asking Benvolio how the fight began.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
Benvolio tells him that servants from both families were fighting and that when he tried to stop them, Tybalt turned on him.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.
After that, lots of other people joined in until the Prince came and stopped the fighting.
Lady Montague is worried about her son, Romeo. He wasn't involved in the fighting but she wonders where he is. Benvolio explains that he saw him skulking about before dawn. Montague says that this is not unusual behaviour for Romeo: people have seen him crying and sighing on his own before daybreak before.
The audience finds out a lot about Romeo before he even walks onto the stage. What are your first impressions of Romeo?
Montague says he has tried to talk to his son, but he won't open up to him.
Parents and children - You might be able to sympathise with Romeo not wanting to talk about his feelings with his father.
He says he is like a flower that never gets to open because it has been stopped from blossoming by a worm that has eaten into it.
This is a simile to show that no one can get near to Romeo whilst he is in such a bad mood.
When Romeo arrives, Montague and Lady Montague leave Benvolio to try and find out why he is in such a bad mood all of the time.
- Time - There are lots of references to time in this play. The events in this play take place in just less than one week. Romeo and Juliet both feel that time drags whilst they are apart from one another.
Romeo tries to explain that he is in love with a girl who doesn't love him back. He doesn't make himself very clear though and Benvolio has to work hard to get him to tell him about it. Romeo comes up with lots of confusing descriptions of love to try and explain how he feels.
The list of opposites in Romeo's speech ('loving hate', 'heavy lightness', etc) are called oxymorons. They give us an important clue to his character. His confusing speech shows us how confusing the world is to him as a young man. It also shows us that Romeo likes to play with language.
""Here's much to do with hate, but more with love""
- Love and Hate - Romeo is commenting on the street brawl that has just happened: it's about hating an opposing family and feeling love and loyalty towards their own. Taken on its own, the line sums up the play as a whole: it's about two families that hate each other, but more about the love between Romeo and Juliet.
Romeo speaks in rhyme to try to describe how he feels.
Romeo's speeches are often in rhyme. He also likes wordplay, metaphors and similes. Romeo loves to talk about love, but does he really know what love is at this point? You could say that Romeo, at this point is 'all talk and no action'.
He says that love is like smoke made from the hot breath of lovers and that the flames are the sparks in their eyes. But if it doesn't work out, love is a sea of tears. He also describes love as a kind of madness and a poison.
- Love - The language that Romeo uses to describe love gives us an idea of what Romeo believes love to be at this point. For him it's about desire, which sounds like lust rather than true love.
Benvolio brings Romeo back to earth with a straightforward question: who is the girl he is in love with?
Whilst Romeo is pouring his heart out, Benvolio's responses could be performed in a number of ways- sympathetic, impatient, humorous. All three work.
Romeo still won't give him a straight answer though.
Romeo and Benvolio are good friends. We can see this through the way they banter with one another.
He tells Benvolio that the girl is very beautiful but she doesn't want to fall in love. It seems that she is very pure and Romeo says that because she isn't interested in men, her beauty will be wasted!
- Love - We never meet Rosaline in the play and only have Romeo's description of her to go by. It's hard to tell whether she really is a very good girl or whether she simply doesn't fancy Romeo!
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste
Benvolio says that the best thing to do is to forget her. He advises Romeo to look at other attractive girls. Romeo swears that he can never forget her; he'll never find anyone as beautiful as her. Benvolio bets that he will.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.

546,271,"> Preparing, planning and checking - Punctuation
The most important thing with punctuation is to make sure your sentences are correctly marked at the start and end:
The starts are easy; they should all have capital letters.
The endings have full stops (or the equivalent, such as question marks). However, endings cannot have commas. Commas are only used inside sentences, never right at the end of one.
One quick way to check is to read your work to yourself (it doesn't have to be aloud). If you 'run out of breath' or need to pause in your reading to add emphasis, ask yourself whether a comma or a full stop is needed. If so, put one in.
Other areas which often cause problems are:
If you have included the actual words that somebody speaks, make sure you put them inside speech marks. Remember to close the speech marks as well as open them!
Always use question marks when writing a question whether it is direct or rhetorical. Look out for rhetorical questions in persuasive texts eg ""How long will it be until all our countryside is destroyed?"". Writers use rhetorical questions to emphasise a point and they do not expect the reader to genuinely answer the question.
Be careful when using exclamation marks as overusing them can spoil a text. They should be used only to show excitement, surprise, shock or humour eg ""Stop the car!"" she yelled.
To show when a letter has been missed out:
Remember: ask your teacher for some advice if you feel unsure about any aspect of punctuation.

547,396,"> Writer's tricks - Persuading the reader
Some persuasive texts aim simply at persuading us to do something, particularly charity leaflets, holiday brochures and adverts. Others may try in more subtle ways; newspaper and magazine articles may try to persuade us to agree with a certain view.
Try to convince us to do or agree with something, such as spending money or agreeing with a certain belief.
Contain a mixture of fact and opinion.
Emphasise key points by using subheadings, repetition, memorable phrases and emotive language.
Often use a personal style so that the text seems to speak directly to the reader.
Show clear links between points, such as ""if you donate 20 you will be helping a sick animal"" or ""using our deodorant will attract women"".
Stories can also be persuasive as well. A writer may want you to like or dislike a character. The way that they describe a character can persuade you to do either of these. Look at this extract from 'Jane Eyre':
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at the table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye with flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mamma had taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate health'.
How does Charlotte Bront try to persuade, or convince, us that John Reed is an unpleasant character in this paragraph?
She makes him sound unattractive, with his ""dingy and unwholesome skin"" and ""heavy limbs"".
She suggests that he is greedy as he ""gorged himself habitually at the table"". She suggests that this is why he is so unhealthy, so that we don't feel sorry for him.
She makes him sound spoilt because his mother is keeping him home from school, even though his so-called ""delicate health"" is his own fault.

548,595,"> The Tempest Summary - The shipwreck
Ariel tells Prospero what has happened to the ship and its passengers and crew. He tells how he appeared on the ship as a flame (he is after all a magic spirit), and frightened the passengers so much that they had jumped in to the sea. Only the crew remained on the ship.
Prospero wants to be sure that the crew and the passengers are safe. Ariel tells him how he saw to it that the passengers were washed up on the island in separate groups. He made sure the ship was safe, and that the crew were sleeping peacefully. He had sent the rest of the fleet back to Naples, with everyone believing that their king's ship had been sunk, and its passengers drowned.
Ariel now changes the subject, and says he's getting impatient. He reminds Prospero there is a time limit on how long he had to be Prospero's servant, after his release from Sycorax's spell. Ariel wants his freedom, and reminds Prospero that he's been a good servant.

Prospero, in reply, reminds Ariel of the horror he was released from. He tells him that he needs him to work for two more days and then he will be free. Prospero sends him off to keep watch over the washed-up passengers.
As Ariel leaves, Prospero wakes Miranda and tells her that they are going to see Caliban. This doesn't please Miranda, who refers to Caliban as a ""villain"" that she does not ""love to look on"". It is clear, too, from the names he calls him, that Prospero has not forgiven Caliban for an attack he once made on his daughter.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The opening
The play starts by telling us what will happen at the end. A girl and a boy from two warring families will die. Their deaths will put an end to the violence. The action is set in Verona in Italy.
These equally rich and powerful families are:
Two of Capulet's servants pick a fight in the market place with one of Montague's servants. Benvolio tries to stop the fight. Tybalt attacks Benvolio. A riot starts. Prince Escalus stops the riot and warns that if the Montagues and the Capulets are involved in any more violence the punishment will be death.
Luckily, Romeo wasn't involved, but his mother and father wonder where he is. Benvolio has seen him moodily wandering about by himself. He says he will try to find out what is wrong with Romeo.
Romeo tells Benvolio that he is in love with a girl called Rosaline. He is in agony because she doesn't love him back. Benvolio's advice is to look at other attractive girls. Romeo says that no other girl could ever live up to Rosaline.

Polygons - The exterior angle of a polygon
The exterior angle at a vertex (corner) of a shape is made by continuing one edge.
The exterior angles of a polygon add up to 360.
Imagine walking round the outside of the polygon. By the time you get back to where you started you have completed one full turn. So all the corners you turned must add to 360.
In this diagram the exterior angles have been given different colours. You can see how they can be put together to make a full circle.

So if you're answering a question, state your point, back it up with a piece of evidence and then explain it.
Try out the PEE method. Here's an extract from 'Holes' about Stanley and the prison work camp.
Find two features of Stanley's character and explain how they are suggested. Write your answer down and then compare it to ours.
Stanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for a while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed animals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it. Sometimes he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games. Maybe he'd make some friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake.
Check our ideas on the extract by clicking the button below.
He is willing to make the best of a bad situation.
The writer suggests that Stanley spent long periods, when younger, playing alone with stuffed toys.
Stanley thinks that he will have the chance to make friends and 'at least he'd get to swim in the lake'.
The writer lists the sort of games Stanley played with his stuffed toys at 'Camp Fun and Games' in a way that suggests he was playing on his own - the toys became his friends.
He is going to a boy's prison work camp, but, instead of thinking about the horrors he might face, he shows that he is hopeful and ready to make the best of things.

> Changes in the environment - Humans
Humans are very successful living things. We compete with other organisms for many natural resources. These include:
The worlds population of humans is increasing all the time. In the year 1800 it was about
, and now it is more than
More people mean more use of natural resources, and bigger changes to the environment. The graph shows population growth over the last 200 years.
Humans use machines to move large amounts of earth to make new roads and buildings. We straighten rivers and build walls to stop them flooding. In some countries, such as the Netherlands, land is reclaimed from the sea. Barriers are built and water is pumped out. New dry land forms for people to use.
We also large areas of land for quarries. These are large holes in the ground where rocks containing useful metals are taken out.
The environment is also changed when land is flooded to make reservoirs for drinking water or hydroelectric power schemes. The animals and plants that live in the forest or on the land lose their habitat. They may die out in that region as a result.
Humans have been cutting down trees for thousands of years. We do this to clear land for farming and building, and for wood to use as a fuel or building material.
as long as forests are allowed to replace themselves, or are replanted after felling, but often this is not done. The result is that the worlds forests are steadily shrinking.

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
When you are persuading people, you usually use a different style. You don't need to show both sides - all you have to do is present your ideas. For instance, imagine you had to persuade people to buy a certain toothpaste. You could write about the great taste, or how clean your teeth feel or how white they are. It doesn't really matter what you find to write about as long as you get them to buy it.
But you wouldn't write about other makes of toothpaste. You don't persuade like this, because it sounds like you aren't sure. So the first thing to remember is:
- if you are writing about how great chips are, keep repeating the idea. Convince yourself how good they are - they might even be a healthy option, because lots of doctors are bound to like them and chips wouldn't be so popular if they weren't really great, would they? Once you have convinced yourself, it's much easier to convince others. So next you need to remember to...
- it's always better to hear how good your idea is rather than how bad other people's are. So write about the things that show your ideas in the best light. For instance, aren't chips just great for a quick snack? Why were chips voted the most popular option in our school at lunchtime? And finally don't be frightened to...
- If you don't seem too sure, or if you can't make your ideas stand out, then you aren't really persuading as much as you can. And if that is the case, you need The Persuaders' Toolkit.
- don't worry about saying the same thing again and again - people forget, so repeat yourself and they will remember. Even when you think they might remember, you can always repeat yourself another time.
- using words such as ""we"" or ""I"" always sounds a lot more convincing. We all know that, don't we?
- why would you use questions? Well, they make people think. They also get your readers involved in what you are writing. So will you use them when you persuade? If not, why not?
- words are your ammunition. In seconds, they can make your friends laugh, or your teacher angry, so why not use them properly to persuade your readers?
For instance, don't just write ""the pressure of doing school work"", because there is no real feeling there. Instead, how about: ""the endless trauma, the desperation and the mindless suffering that school work inflicts on students"".

556,97,"> Drama - Showing moods and emotions
Being able to recognise changes in mood and emotion in a script is important as you need to convey this to your audience.
Using these methods, decide how you would express the emotion of anger.
What happens to your face, body and voice when you feel angry? How do you walk when you're in a bad mood? Which gestures do you use to show someone you're angry with them?
Frown, tightly clenched jaw, a tight mouth or even bared teeth.
Tense shoulders, a swift and purposeful walk almost like a march.
Strong and forceful gestures. Perhaps even clenched fists.
Either very loud and out of control or very quiet and menacing.
Maybe if you're very angry you won't pause often, you'll talk very quickly without giving the other person a chance to talk. Or the pauses might be long - a deafening silence!
Now try this with other emotions, eg surprise, excitement, happiness, sadness. See how your body, face and voice change with each emotion.
Another way to practise emotions is to do mood walks - put all the elements together to develop a walk that represents each emotion, then greet (or growl at) people with the appropriate tone of voice.

557,229,"should introduce the subject. The writer wants to catch the reader's attention and hint at what is to come. If the beginning is poor, the reader could lose interest quickly and stop reading.
section presents the main ideas, thoughts, actions and so on. These will often be presented in stages or with several twists and turns of argument.
generally sums up the piece of text, or makes a final point, or brings a conclusion to a story.
It can add to your marks in a test if you show a plan of how you are going to answer a long question.
A writer will usually plan not only what they are going to write, but also how they are going to write it. For example, how would a writer plan a magazine article about the benefits of health and fitness?
Imagine you are writing a plan for a magazine article about fitness and health.
Beginning: do people need to be fit?
Health angle  unfit people can need more health care
Ending: get fit and eat healthy food and you will benefit
This is an example of quite a straightforward plan. Each box contains a summary of a paragraph and they are organised in a way that steers the reader through a journey. Obviously, the more complex the issue, argument, story, and so on, the more complex the plan will be.

560,395,"> Inform, explain and describe - Informing
The key thing about writing to inform is that you stick to the information. You shouldn't really show many of your own feelings, and you definitely don't want to tell your audience how they should feel. Instead, when you inform you make the facts easy to understand, with a clear structure.
Write an information leaflet for Year 6 pupils, telling them about the school day and what they need to know when they start your school in September.
It's important to structure your answer well. Think of the answer in terms of a drawing, like this:
This is a timeline - the arrow is time moving forwards and the four lines are different events in order. Now, you can think of the school day as the arrow, and plan the different events in a typical day. For instance, you could have registration, then an assembly, then two lessons followed by break. It should be easy to add information and detail. The structure also makes it easy for the Year 6 pupils to follow your information. Another way to inform is by subject, as in the diagram below:
These are points linked together. It is not in order of time, but in order of subject. So you could have PE at the centre with all the information connected to PE in the little circles around. For instance, you could have different types of PE kit, the different sports, the sort of exercises you do. Once you have written about PE, you can move on to look at other areas of the school.

Leon conducts a survey to find the number of people in each of the cars arriving at his school gate between 8.30am and 9.00am. His results are shown in the bar chart below:
a) How many cars contained 1 person?
b) How many cars contained more than 3 people?
c) Why there are only a small number of cars containing 1 person?
cars contained more than 3 people (10 + 4 = 14)
c) Most cars would be driven by parents bringing their children to school, only a few would contain just a teacher or a sixth former.

563,136,"> Fractions - Common factors and simplest form
Fractions - Common factors and simplest form
of a number are those numbers that divide into it exactly.
Numbers have common factors if the same number divides into both of them.
So 4 is a common factor of both 8 and 12, as it divides into both of them. 2 is a common factor of both 2 and 6, as it divides into both of them.
4 and 12 have a common factor (4), so
(divide the top and the bottom by 4).
2 and 6 have a common factor (2), so
(divide the top and the bottom by 2).
However, 1 and 3 have no common factors, so
cannot be simplified. When a fraction cannot be simplified we say that it is its

Character - First, second and third person accounts
A text can be written in the first, second or third person. This is all about who is telling the story. Here is a quick summary:
means ""I"" or ""we"". The narrator of the account will be a character in the text and we will read about events from their point of view. We will also tend to relate to and sympathise with their feelings because of this.
means ""you"". It is very rare to find a story written in the second person (why not have a go at writing a piece to see how difficult it is). Parts of adverts or leaflets are addressed directly to you, however, which can be a very persuasive way of writing.
means ""he"", ""she"", ""it"" or ""they"". The narrator of the story will usually be the writer. The text may give many different characters' viewpoints. Some stories focus on one character, the hero or heroine, and we usually relate to and sympathise with them more than others.
Take a look at these three extracts. Decide which ""person"" each one is written in and check your answers to see if you are correct.
When you arrive at Oldcastle Cottage you'll receive a warm welcome. Your every need will be taken care of by your hosts.
Is the extract above written in the first, second or third person?
person. The writer is talking directly to you.
Mr. Fogg's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste. Each pair of trousers, coat, and vest bore a number, indicating the time of year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing; and the same system was applied to the master's shoes.
'Around the World in Eighty Days' - Jules Verne
Is the extract above written in the first, second or third person?
person. The writer is telling you about Mr Fogg's clothing and how it is arranged.
I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed (crossed) the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing.
Is the extract above written in the first, second or third person?
person. The writer is telling the story as if they were a character in it.

Inform, explain and describe - The differences
, the writing tends to stick to facts - things you know about and things that can be checked elsewhere.
, the writing tends to be about facts and reasons, so you'd write about why or how something happened.
, it's like taking a photo of something - you need information, but also lots of interesting details. You can include your own thoughts and feelings as well, because that helps convey information to your audience.
So really, the ideas and topics you can write about are almost the same. It doesn't matter which of the three styles you are doing, you basically want to give information to your readers. What makes the difference is how you go about it.

569,224,"A food chain shows the different organisms that live in a habitat, and what eats what.
A food chain always starts with a producer, which is an organism that makes food. This is usually a green plant, because plants can make their own food by photosynthesis.
A food chain ends with a consumer, which is an animal that eats a plant or another animal. Here is an example of a simple food chain:
Take care - the arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating. If you get the arrows the wrong way round, instead of showing that humans eat cows, you are showing that cows eat humans, and that grass eats cows.
There are several words used to describe the organisms in a food chain. Study this food chain:
The plant is the producer and the animals are consumers.
Notice that the first consumer in the chain is also called the primary consumer, the next one is the secondary consumer and the one after that is the tertiary consumer.
A consumer that eats plants is called a
, and a consumer that eats other animals is called a
is an animal that eats both plants and animals.
A predator is an animal that eats other animals, and the prey is the animal that gets eaten by the predator. In the food chain above:
the frog is a predator and the grasshopper is its prey.
the hawk is a predator and the frog is its prey.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - The text
SECTION 2 - Act 2, Scene 2, lines 1 to 157
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
, below, sees the light at the window, then realises it is
 But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
Be not her maid, since she is envious:
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
 It is my lady!  O, it is my love!
She speaks  yet she says nothing. What of that?
Her eye discourses. I will answer it.
 I am too bold. Tis not to me she speaks.
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night!
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
O speak again, bright angel!  For thou art
As glorious to this night, being oer my head,
As is a wingd messenger of heaven
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name 
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love
And Ill no longer be a Capulet.
(Aside)Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
Whats Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
Whats in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet.
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name 
And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Call me but love, and Ill be new-baptized.
What man art thou, that thus bescreened in night
I know not how to tell thee who I am.
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of thy tongues uttering, yet I know the sound.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
How camst thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb 
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls,
For stony limits cannot hold love out 
And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet
And I am proof against their enmity.
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
I have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes.
And but thou love me, let them find me here.
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogud, wanting of thy love.
By whose direction foundst thou out this place?
By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot, yet wert thou as far
As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Fain would I dwell on form  fain, fain deny
What I have spoke.  But farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay 
And I will take thy word. Yet if thou swearst
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers perjuries
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
Or if thou think I am too quickly won,
Ill frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo  but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light.
But trust me, gentleman, Ill prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheardst, ere I was ware,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discoverd.
Lady, by yonder blessd moon I vow,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops 
O swear not by the moon, th inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract tonight.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden 
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.
This bud of love, by summers ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Th exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it 
And yet I would it were to give again.
Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
But to be frank and give it thee again:
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
is heard calling from inside the house.
I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
 Anon, good Nurse!  Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little: I will come again.
O blessd, blessd night! I am afeard,
Being in night, all this but a dream,
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow
By one that Ill procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite 
And all my fortunes at thy foot Ill lay,
And follow thee, my lord, throughout the world.
I come! Anon!  But if thou meanst not well,
 To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

Now put the the answer into its simplest form
When you divide 10 by 2, you are working out how many 2's there are in 10.
10  2 = 5, so there are five 2's in 10.
In a similar way, when dividing 2 by
, you are working out how many
Do you see a pattern? Let's write out those calculations a different way.

> Changes in the environment - Extinction
A species becomes extinct when there are no more individuals of that species left. An extinct species has gone forever.
Here are some of the things that can cause a species to become extinct:
a change in the physical environment, such as a change in the long-term temperature or rainfall patterns
competition from another species that is better adapted, including competition from humans
For example, dinosaurs became extinct millions of years ago. This was probably due to changes in the environment. But many species have become extinct more recently because of competition from humans.
The dodo was a flightless bird found on the island of Mauritius. It became extinct in the seventeenth century because of human activities. Humans disturbed the dodo's habitat and also brought new predators to the island, like pigs and dogs.

Energy transfer and storage - Saving energy
Electricity can be generated in many ways, including:
in power stations using fossil fuels or biomass fuel
Most of the UK's electricity is generated in power stations using
energy released from the burning fuel is used to boil water to make steam, which expands and turns turbines. These drive the generators to produce electricity.
the fuel is burned to boil water to make steam
the spinning turbine turns a generator which produces electricity
the electricity goes to the transformers to produce the correct voltage
when they burn, we are aiming to produce more of our electricity using other,
energy resources. This will reduce the rate at which the fossil fuels are used up.
We can also reduce the rate at which the fossil fuels are used up by saving energy. For example, we can:
walk to instead of getting using cars where possible
turn off the lights when leaving the room

577,487,"It's good to have a variety of sentences. You can have short ones, and then some long ones. But as we have already seen, if they are all simple sentences, then it gets boring and difficult to read. You should also use a mixture of questions and statements.
Imagine giving some advice to a friend who is being bullied. You'd probably think of a few ideas very quickly:
You could improve your work by adding other types of sentences. At the moment, it's just a list of orders. What about adding a question or two? Like this:
Why don't you talk to someone at school about it?
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now?
This pushes your friend to think about something. It also gives them the opportunity to start talking about it.
Then you could add a statement or two, like this:
Bullying is more common than many people think.
The worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone.
If we combine these ideas and sentences, we have an interesting and varied piece of writing. All we need to add are some connectives, like 'and', 'but', 'so' or 'because'. Now we have writing that makes a real impact and which can offer advice as well as persuading people, like this:
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now? Why don't you talk to someone at school about it? Because bullying is far more common than many people think. And it is far more serious than many people imagine. In fact, it is one of the main reasons for pupils missing school. But the worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone. So don't suffer in silence, tell your family about it and do something now.
You write sentences all the time. Find out when and where to use them.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The party
Romeo and his friends decide to gate-crash the party. Romeo has a bad feeling about the outcome of this evening, but decides to let fate take its course.
Capulet is having a great time at his party. People are dancing. Romeo and his friends arrive wearing masks. Romeo spots Juliet. He thinks to himself that he didn't really know what true beauty was until he saw her. He doesn't know that she is a Capulet. Tybalt recognises Romeo from his voice and threatens to kill him because he is a Montague, but Capulet stops him. Romeo and Juliet flirt and finally kiss. The Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet and he is dismayed. He leaves with Benvolio. Juliet is distraught when the Nurse tells her who Romeo is.
The Chorus recaps events for us: Romeo has forgotten Rosaline and is now in love with Juliet. Juliet feels the same way.
Romeo runs away from his friends. Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline.
Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom. Juliet doesn't know that he is there at first and, talking to herself, declares her love for him. She is shocked and embarrassed when he replies. They have only met that evening, but they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and what time their wedding will be! They find it difficult to part.
Romeo goes to see Friar Lawrence, the priest, who is worried that he has spent the night with Rosaline. When Romeo says that he wants to marry Juliet, Friar Lawrence tells him off for falling in love so easily, but agrees to the wedding because he thinks that it might be a solution to the rift between the Capulets and the Montagues.

The current is the same everywhere in a
. It does not matter where you put the ammeter, it will give you the same reading.
All three ammeters give the same reading in this series circuit
The current in a series circuit depends upon the number of cells. The more cells you add, the greater the current.
The more cells, the greater the current
You might think that the current gets less as it flows through one component after another. But it is not like this. The current is not used up by the components in a circuit. This means that the current is the same everywhere in a series circuit, even if it has lots of lamps or other components.

587,499,"> Drama - Drama from your imagination
Taking part in drama doesn't always involve learning lines from scripts - often you'll be asked to improvise. Usually you will work in groups or pairs to devise a piece of drama from your own imagination. You'll need to be able to think on your feet and become a different character.
This might sound difficult, but you've probably improvised before without realising it - in games you used to play as a child. If you've ever played pirates, nurses or superheroes when you were younger, you were improvising - although don't think running around your classroom with a tablecloth for a cape pretending to be Superman will impress your drama teacher - it probably won't!
As with any English work, you need to think about your audience when you devise drama. Your drama needs to entertain them and keep their attention. Your drama also needs to be believable - your audience is likely to become disconnected if your story or characters are too far fetched.
The story of your drama begins with your character. Ask yourself: what does my character feel, think and react?
Here are two ideas for a character:
You are a journalist who has uncovered a story that will have big consequences and you're about to tell the world. Would your character be confident or scared?
You are a global superstar - singer, actor and producer - and paparazzi follow your every move. You live a glamorous and privileged life, but what are the secrets behind the smiles?
When you have decided on your character, you need to create a scene.
Here are some ideas for a scene based on the characters above. Can you think of any more?
You're about to appear on the most popular morning TV programme and expose your discovery when you suddenly receive a startling phone call. Who is on the phone? What do they say? How do they make you feel?
You've landed a part in a popular soap but you don't get on with the other actors. Should you tell the press the truth or pretend that you all get along?
You've been working late in the library just double checking a few facts for your article when you notice a menacing looking man watching you. Does your character panic or keep calm? Do they run or confront the man? Maybe they are being paranoid?
The press have published some false rumours about you and you're really upset. Your agent has secured a slot on a popular chat show to give your side of the story. Do you accept the offer or decide to lie low? How do you feel?
Your article has been published and has been a massive hit. You're receiving job offers from high profile newspapers and magazines and your life is about to change for the better. How do your family react? What do you decide to do?
You've found out that one of the other band members is planning to leave the group and go solo. You confront them - can you persuade them to stay, or would it be better for everyone if they left?
When you have a rough idea of your character and scene, you can think about what your character might say. If you're given time to prepare you should write a short script. If working in pairs or a group, you could improvise the scene first to get more ideas.
You may be allowed to use props to make your scene more realistic and interesting. Only use a prop if it is relevant, otherwise it could end up distracting you and your audience. If you decide to use props and costumes, always practice with them first.

Magnets and electric current - Bar magnets
Before we look at electromagnets let's recap
magnets. This means that their magnetism is there all the time and cannot be turned on or off. They have two poles:
The north pole is normally shown as
Magnets are made from magnetic materials. These are metals that can be magnetised or will be attracted to a magnet. Most materials are not magnetic, but
is mostly iron, so steel is magnetic too.
If you bring two bar magnets together, there are two things that can happen:
if you bring a north pole and a south pole together, they
if you bring two north poles together, or two south poles together, they
and the magnets push each other away.
We say that unlike poles attract, and like poles repel.
How can you test if a piece of metal is a magnet. Seeing if it sticks to a magnet is not a good test, because unmagnetised iron, steel, cobalt and nickel objects will be attracted to either pole of a magnet.
So you can't test for what it is attracted to. But you can test what it repels:
You can only show that an object is a magnet if it repels a known magnet.

You already know that the size of an enlargement is described by its scale factor.
For example, a scale factor of 2 means that the new shape is twice the size of the original. A scale factor of 3 means that the new shape is three times the size of the original.
It therefore follows that a scale factor of
To enlarge the triangle with a scale factor of
and centre of enlargement 0, do the following:
Enlarging a triangle with a scale factor of one half
What is the scale factor of enlargement in this diagram?
Remember that OA is 6 units and OA' is 2 units.
BC is 3 units and B'C' is 1 unit, so each side on the image is
of the length of the original shape.
Always check which is the object and which is the image, so that you don't confuse the scale factors. For example, a scale factor of 2 might be mistaken for a scale factor of
, or a scale factor of 3 mistaken for a scale factor of

595,326,"> More on equations - Equations when x is negative
More on equations - Equations when x is negative
If the value of x is negative, tackle the equation in the same way - aim to get all xs on one side of the equation.
5x - 2 = 12 - 2x
Your aim is to get all the unknown x terms on one of the equation side only, so start by adding 2x to both sides: 7x - 2 = 12
Next add 2 to both sides: 7x = 14
And finally, divide by 7 to give
As always, you can check your answer in the original equation. So substitute x = 2 back into 5x - 2 = 12 - 2x
(5  2) - 2 = 12 - (2  2)
10 - 2 = 12 - 4
This makes sense, so the value x = 2 is correct.
Add x to both sides to give 5x = 10.
To find x, divide both sides by 5 to get x = 2
Solve the equation 4x + 1 = 2x + 5
Start by subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation to give
Then subtract 1 from each side to give

Variation and classification - Inherited & environmental
Some variation within a species is inherited, and some variation is due to the environment.
Variation in a characteristic that is a result of genetic inheritance from the parents is called
Children usually look a little like their father, and a little like their mother, but they will not be identical to either of their parents. This is because they get half of their inherited features from each parent.
Each egg cell and each sperm cell contains half of the
needed for an individual. When these join at fertilisation a new cell is formed with all the genetic information needed for an individual.
Here are some examples of inherited variation in humans:
Gender is inherited variation too, because whether you are male or female is a result of the genes you inherited from your parents.
Characteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle. For example, if you eat too much you will become heavier, and if you eat too little you will become lighter. A plant in the shade of a big tree will will grow taller as it tries to reach more light.
Variation caused by the surroundings is called
. Here are some other examples of features that show environmental variation:
flower colour in hydrangeas - these plants produce blue flowers in acidic soil and pink flowers in alkaline soil.
Some features vary because of a mixture of inherited causes and environmental causes. For example, identical twins inherit exactly the same features from their parents. But if you take a pair of twins, and twin 'A' is given more to eat than twin 'B', twin 'A' is likely to end up heavier.

597,65,"> Inequalities and Simultaneous Equations - Graphs
As well as solving simultaneous equations algebraically, you can solve them by rearranging them into the form of y = mx+c so that you can plot as straight line graphs. When you have plotted the graphs, you can work out the values of x and y that solve the equations.
To refresh your knowledge of straight line graphs, look at
Use the graphical method to solve the simultaneous equations:
Start by rearranging the two equations to get them in the form:
In this case you only need to rearrange the second equation. The two equations are now:
We now have two equations of straight-line graphs, which we can plot.
When we do this we can look at where the two lines cross (the point of
). The values of x and y at this point are the solutions of the simultaneous equations.
The solution of this pair of simultaneous equations is
x = 2 and y = 4

598,522,"Liquids and gases do not have a fixed shape. They can flow and fill their containers, but solids cannot. The particle model explains why.
Solids cannot flow because their particles are only able to vibrate and cannot move from place to place.
Liquids can flow because their particles can move over each other. When water is poured into a glass, the particles of water move over each other and into the corners of the glass. The particles keep on moving over each other as the water takes the shape of the glass. The animation shows how this works.
In order to see this content you need to have both
Gases can flow because their particles can move in all directions. When a Bunsen burner is connected to a gas tap and turned on, natural gas flows through the rubber tubing. The particles of natural gas are free to move anywhere inside the tubing, and pressure forces them through the tubing into the Bunsen burner.

603,4377,"Iron and steel rust when they come into contact with water and oxygen. They rust faster in salty water or acid rain. Aluminium, on the other hand, does not corrode easily, because its surface is protected by a layer of aluminium oxide.
Steel and aluminium have advantages and disadvantages when used to make cars, which are recycled to re-use valuable materials and cut down on waste.
Iron and steel rust when they come into contact with water and oxygen. Both water and oxygen are needed for rusting to occur. In the experiment below, the nail does not rust when air - containing oxygen - or water is not present:
Calcium chloride absorbs water in the right-hand test tube
Salt dissolved in water does not cause rusting, but it does speed it up, as does acid rain.
Aluminium does not rust - corrode. Its surface is protected by a natural layer of aluminium oxide. This prevents the metal below from coming into contact with air and oxygen.
Unlike rust, which can flake off the surface of iron and steel objects, the layer of aluminium oxide does not flake off.
reaction. The iron reacts with water and oxygen to form
, which we see as rust. Here is the word equation for the reaction:
iron + water + oxygen    hydrated iron(III) oxide
Most iron is converted into steel - an alloy - before being used. Compared to iron, steel is:
Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.
Cars are complex machines. Many different materials are used in their manufacture.
The main materials used in the manufacture of cars
tough and easily moulded to desired shape
good heat insulators, and can be woven into fabrics
European Union law requires that at least 85 per cent of a cars materials can be recycled, rising to 95 per cent by 2015. Recycling reduces the amount of waste, and the use of natural resources.

may have one theme or many. Understanding the themes makes the text more than 'just' a text. It becomes something more significant because we're encouraged to think more deeply about the story - about how it connects to real-life issues, and about what it might mean to us.
The boys try to construct a civilisation on the island; but it breaks down in blood and terror because the boys are suffering from the terrible disease of being human.
A central, unifying idea that runs through a text or performance.
is that of things breaking down. This is shown in a number of ways. Violence replaces peace, friends turn into enemies, life ends in savage death. Everything degenerates.
The boys are on the island because the plane that was evacuating them from Britain during a fictional nuclear war was attacked. Piggy reminds Ralph:
""Didn't you hear what the pilot said? About the atom bomb? They're all dead.""
Ralph is proud of his father - a commander in the Navy. So, the

who tries hardest to keep peace comes from a home that revolved around war.
We know that the civilisation from which they were trying to escape is being destroyed. When Roger stops himself throwing stones at the littluns, we're told:
""Roger's arm was conditioned by a civilisation that knew nothing of him and was in ruins.""
The dead parachutist who lands on the island was gunned down during an overhead battle.
Ironically, the naval officer who comes to their rescue is himself involved in the war. The boys may have been saved from life on the island, but what sort of life are they going back to?
Violence is always present. It starts as a game, but grows more horrific throughout the novel. For example:
When he first finds out Piggy's name,
""Ralph danced out into the hot air of the beach and then returned as a fighter-plane, with wings swept back, and machine-gunned Piggy.""
When the first pig is killed, Jack boasts,
""Kill the pig. Cut her throat. Bash her in.""
The boys become like wild and savage animals: when Jack hunts a pig he is
; Ralph becomes like a hunted animal, not a boy, at the end:
""He raised his spear, snarled a little, and waited.""
The murder of Simon is particularly horrific because it involves
the other boys - they get caught up in the frenzied chant:
""The crowd ... leapt onto the beast, screamed, struck, bit, tore.""
All the friendships and good relationships on the island break down, either through bullying and violence or death.
Ralph and Jack seem to be friends at the start, yet Ralph knows Jack is hurt when he is not elected chief. This rivalry for power is at the root of some of the violence.
Ralph finds it hard even at an early stage to get things done. He and Simon are left to build the third shelter by themselves, because everyone else is too busy having fun. The community spirit of the assemblies is hard to maintain.
Even the littluns' games involve violence and broken friendships. Once Roger watches them playing:
""Percival had gone off, crying, and Johnny was left in triumphant possession of the castles.""
As pressure builds, the boys find that they have to take sides. When Jack defies Ralph and goes off alone, he challenges,
""Anyone who wants to hunt when I do can come too.""
He ignores Ralph's effort to make peace.
Jack's tribe becomes ruled by fear. Most boys don't want to be involved, but have no option. He keeps control by intimidating them and bullying them, such as when he ties up and beats Wilfred.
Roger rules by terror too. When Samneric are captured,
""Roger advanced upon them as one wielding a nameless authority.""
The island is first seen as like paradise, too good to be true. Ralph thinks:
""Here at last was the imagined but never fully realised place leaping into real life""
However, the island is soon found to contain many dangers. For example, coconuts fall from the trees and just miss injuring Roger, the sun burns them, and the isolation is a curse.
Ralph reflects at the end that the island once had a
All this echoes the Bible story of the Fall of Man, when Adam and Eve were cast out of Paradise as a punishment for disobeying God. The island becomes a burnt wasteland, as if as a punishment for all the violence committed by the boys.
The language used by the boys progressively degenerates.

Most presentation software packages allow you to create your multimedia product using a series of slides. Text, images, video, animations, links and sound can be combined on each slide to create a sophisticated final product.
The most widely used presentation software is Microsoft PowerPoint but there is other presentation software, such as Impress (part of the OpenOffice suite).
Slides that can contain any mixture of text, images, video, animations, links and sound.

Here is an example of melody and accompaniment:
This texture is when a solo is heard which is immediately answered by another tune played or sung by a group. It is used a lot in popular music, jazz music and music from other cultures.
Here is an example of a call-and-response song from Latin America
Listen to this extract of music by Mozart that only uses the words 'Kyrie Eleison' and 'Christe Eleison' and comment on the textures voices and instruments you hear.
: The music starts with just one instrument and one voice. The other voices and instruments then join in one at a time. At the end, all the instruments and voices play their own tune starting at different times.
Talvin has obviously heard that the voices have tunes starting at different times, but has not gone into enough detail about it. He didn't mention any instruments or voices by name and couldn't mention any of the textures by name either.
: The music starts with just the trombones and the bass voice. This type of texture is called 'unison'. The alto voice then joins in making the texture weave in and out. The voices sing Kyrie Eleison. A high voice then comes in singing a tune to the words 'Christe Eleison' which adds to the weaving style. There are timpani and strings in this piece. At the end, all the voices are weaving in and out of each other.
This is a good answer by Sarah. She has named one texture, unison. She heard that the music was 'weaving' but didn't use the proper word 'polyphonic'. She has also correctly identified one voice and an instrument.
: The music begins with the trombones and bass voices in unison. The voices sing the words 'Kyrie Eleison'. The alto voices then join in with faster notes singing the words 'Christe Eleison'. The texture is now polyphonic. The Soprano voices then sing the 1st tune (that the basses sang at first) to the words 'Kyrie Eleison' while the tenor voices sing the tune that the altos sang earlier to the words 'Christe Eleison'. The texture is still polyphonic. Timpani are heard to add emphasis to the bass part. Towards the end, all the voices sing both tunes to both sets of words in a polyphonic texture. Overall, the music has two tunes. The style is a fugue, where the tunes overlap each other.
Geeta has used the proper words to describe the textures and the voices/instruments used in this excerpt. She spotted that each set of words 'Kyrie Eleison' and 'Christe Eleison' has its own tune. Finally, she correctly identified the piece of music as being a fugue.

613,4850,"Hemingway does not give a lot of direct explanation of how people are feeling, or what their motives are. His language is also quite bare. Instead, he likes to use symbols.
Remember the setting and think about what it might represent:
The minnows are described as sprinkling the surface ""like a handful of shot"". Hemingway does not use many similes in his writing, so why this one? What is the significance of what the minnows are being compared to?
How well is the fishing going? Who is in charge when they are setting the night-lines? What could that symbolise about their relationship?
Marjorie is described as not reeling in (that is, stopping) ""until the boat touched the shore"". She hopes for it to go well right up until the last minute. What does that tell you about her attitude to Nick?
The body language of the main characters is important. Think about how their positions on the blanket are described through the course of their conversation. How many times does Hemingway mention their positions, and why?
The moon seems to be significant. It could represent the end of their relationship. Look at what the characters say about it, and think about what they might really mean. It is only when the moon has finally come up completely that Nick has the courage to tell Marjorie what is really on his mind.

614,3802,"Sea water contains a number of dissolved salts. When these salts dissolve in water, the ions separate. Sea water therefore contains a mixture of ions. The most common ions in sea water are shown in the table:
It is possible to deduce from the table which salts dissolved to form the mixture of ions:
When sodium chloride dissolves it forms sodium ions and chloride ions.
When magnesium chloride dissolves it forms magnesium and chloride ions.
When magnesium sulfate dissolves if forms magnesium ions and sulfate ions.
When potassium chloride dissolves it forms potassium ions and chloride ions.
When potassium bromide dissolves it forms potassium ions and bromide ions.
You can use the charge on the ions shown in the table to work out the formulae of the ionic compounds.
. For the charges to cancel out in the neutral salt sodium chloride, they must be in a ration of 1:1. So the formula of sodium chloride is NaCl.
. For the charges to cancel out in the neutral salt magnesium chloride, they must be in a ration of 1:2. So the formula of magnesium chloride is MgCl
Put down that pen and listen to some additional Science audio.

618,5491,"A reflex response to a new stimulus can be
trained dogs to expect food whenever he rang a bell. The dogs eventually produced saliva when they heard the bell ring.
The dog salivates naturally when given food.
Pavlov rings a bell every time the dog eats.
After much repetition the dog salivates when the bell rings, even when there is no food.
. The dogs were conditioned to salivate when the bell rang.
A ringing bell does not normally cause salivation in dogs. However, when the ringing bell becomes a secondary stimulus, it does cause salivation, even though the dog will not be able to eat the bell as food.
This is now called a conditioned reflex. In a conditioned reflex the final response (salivation) has no direct connection with the stimulus (ringing bell).
Predators mistake the hoverfly for a wasp due to similar markings
For example, birds will not eat caterpillars with bright colouring because they are conditioned to think of bright colours as poisonous. Some caterpillars use this to their advantage. Their bright colours protect them, even though they are not poisonous.
How often have you run away from a harmless hoverfly because it has the same markings as a wasp?
a reflex response. It does this by sending an impulse along a motor neuron of the reflex arc. This enables us, for example, to hold onto a hot dinner plate when normally we would drop it.
Put down that pen and listen to some additional Science audio.

619,631,"as a result of the great depression. Before 1850, Parliament was dominated by agricultural landowners. However by 1901, industry and factory owners had the most dominant interest in Parliament.
Many landowners now found themselves bankrupt and their land worthless. The worst effect was that they
The final loss of power for the landowners was when Parliament granted agricultural workers

622,2154,"Species gradually evolve by a process of natural selection. The individuals in any population with the inherited features best suited to the environment in which they live are most likely to survive and reproduce. When they do, they pass on the genetic information for these features to their offspring.
Over time, a species can change its appearance and may even become a new species, unable to reproduce successfully with individuals of the original species.
Selective breeding, also called artificial selection, involves people taking charge of selection to produce new 'varieties' of various species. A variety is a type of a particular species that is different in some clear way from other varieties of that species.
For example, pedigree dogs come in lots of different varieties (or breeds) - they may be different colours and sizes, but they are all still dogs.
From left to right - Beagle, Wheaten Terrier, Rhodesian Ridgeback, Red Siberian Husky, Irish Setter, Golden Retriever, Boxer, Sheltie
Suppose you wanted a variety of cow that produced a lot of milk. This is what you could do:
choose or select the cows in your herd that produce the most milk
select the offspring that produce the most milk
keep repeating the process of selection and breeding until you achieve your goal
The key here is to identify the feature you want, and only breed from the individuals that have that feature. Here are some examples of what selective breeding can produce:
hens that lay big eggs of a particular colour
tomato plants that produce lots of tomatoes
crops that are resistant to certain plant diseases
An activity that would make Darwin proud!

628,865,"The three main causes of population change are:
- usually measured using the birth rate (number of live births per 1000 of the population).

- the movement of people in and out of an area.

. The natural increase is calculated by subtracting the death rate from the birth rate.
natural increase = birth rate - death rate
The rate of natural increase is given as a percentage, calculated by dividing the natural increase by 10.

630,1793,"The search to combat disease gained enormous
in the 19th century. Instruments such as the
were invented, and research into inoculation began to bear fruit.
Methods of diagnosis changed massively during the course of the 19th century.
(France: 1816) invented the stethoscope and started the practice of 'auscultation' (listening to the patient's chest).
(France: 1834) argued that symptoms were irrelevant, and that what was happening inside the body was much more important when it came to diagnosing illness. As a result, doctors made diagnoses on the basis of a full clinical examination of the 'signs' made by the disease on the body.
(Germany: 1878) developed the technique of biopsy (removing cells to determine if they were cancerous).
to measure the functions of the body precisely:
(Germany: 1847) invented the kymograph (which measured the pulse).
(Holland: 1900) invented the electrocardiograph (which measures heart activity).
The search for new ways to cure disease also gained momentum in the 19th century, and included the discovery of how
Usually a medical injection, which introduces a weakened dose of harmful disease-causing organisms into a patient's body. This induces the body to develop an immunity to the disease, which protects the patient from the full-blown sickness.
(France: 1880) discovered by chance (when he left bacteria exposed to air) that injecting chickens with an attenuated (weakened) form of chicken cholera gave them immunity to the disease (ie he discovered the principle of inoculation).
That realisation was the start of an important chain of events.
developed an effective inoculation against anthrax (1881), and rabies (1885).
(France: 1906) developed the BCG injection against TB.
(Germany: 1913) developed an anti-toxin against diphtheria.
(Germany: 1890s) reasoned that, if certain dyes could stain bacteria, perhaps certain chemicals could kill them. He set up a private laboratory and a team of scientists. By 1914 they had discovered several 'magic bullets' - compounds that would have a specific attraction to disease-causing microorganisms in the body, and that would target and kill them. These were methylene blue (for malaria), trypan red (for sleeping sickness) and Salvarsan (for syphilis) - although Salvarsan was more effective than the other two.
Preparations, often made of weakened viruses of a disease. These are given to a sick person (often by injection), in order to protect him or her from that disease, by causing the body to form antibodies against it.
, however (eg one developed by Robert Koch against TB in 1891), were not successful. And against
. They carried, as one medical historian wrote, 'a box of blanks'. So people looked elsewhere for their cures - sometimes in strange places.
A home medicine encyclopaedia of 1910 recommended cures that included electrical shocks, injection with animal hormones, and a range of
Other alternative medical treatments included mesmerism (hypnotism), homeopathy (taking tiny doses of poisons), 'health reform' (a religious movement which recommended a healthy lifestyle - it was run by John Kellogg whose brother invented cornflakes) and Christian Science (which taught that disease only existed in the mind).

631,2073,"Obviously designers have to think about what people want from a product. But consumer demand is a complex matter. Consumers are influenced by fashion, by public perceptions, by moral attitudes, and by changing lifestyles.
Product designers need to consider all these factors, as well as making sure the product conforms to current laws and standards.
Design is influenced by what people want, and what people want is affected by
. These influences come in the shape of current lifestyles and fashions, and the influence of design from other times and other cultures.
Market influences are partly caused by the fact that people want to have the same products as their friends. You and your friends will have similar interests, which designers have to understand if their products are to fit in with your lifestyle and sell well. Designers of mobile phones know that they have to design phones which will not only meet you and your friends' needs, but also make the right kind of 'design statement' about you the users.
At the same time, however, people want to be individuals, to stand out from the crowd, and express themselves by, for example, wearing clothes that look and feel unique. Designers need to understand this desire, otherwise their products will not sell.
Consumer choice is the idea that consumers should have a wide range of products to choose from, because different consumers will want different styles, different performance, and different prices when considering a purchase. Consumer choice is an influence on design, because designers need to know what their potential customers are looking for if they are going to design and make successful products.
Car manufacturers, for example, will design and make the same model of car in many slightly different versions, to suit individual drivers' different tastes.
Companies use market research to find out what people want. Interviews or questionnaires are used to gather people's views on the products they like, the functions and features they require, and the amount they would be prepared to pay. Sometimes the research is carefully focused on a particular group of people - eg women, people of a certain age-range or salary level - who have been identified as key potential consumers.
The results of the research are then passed on to the designer, whose job it is to design products which meet these consumer expectations. When designing your own products, you also need to do some basic market research to find out your potential users' requirements.
formal rules adopted by Parliament and enforced by government
guidelines or specifications which are widely agreed and commonly accepted, but do not necessarily have the force of law
exist to protect the consumer from faulty or sub-standard goods and services. There are a wide range of laws which can be enforced by
who work for local councils. These laws allow consumers to get their money back if goods are found to be faulty or if products do not perform in the way claimed by the manufacturer.
You need to know about the following three pieces of legislation:
This replaced the 1973 Fair Trading Act. Its most important provisions are:
control of monopolies (where a single business has a 25% share of the market or more, and is damaging competition)
control of mergers (where two or more companies join together, which might have adverse effects on competition and the public interest)
control of 'rogue traders' - giving the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) power to take action against businesses that persistently breach civil or criminal law when dealing with consumers
prohibiting the manufacture and supply of unsafe goods
making the person who manufactures or sells a defective product responsible for damage it causes
allowing local councils to seize unsafe goods and suspend the sale of suspected unsafe goods
prohibiting misleading price indications - eg, giving misleading information about discounts or sale prices
Makes it an offence for a trader to make false or misleading statements about goods or services. The Act carries criminal penalties and is enforced by local authorities' Trading Standards Officers. This Act makes it an offence for a trader to
apply a false trade description to any goods
supply or offer to supply any goods to which a false trade description has been applied
make certain kinds of false statement about the provision of any services, facilities or accommodation
UK products should be made to safety standards set by both the
. The BSI Kite Mark shows that a product has been made to British standards, while the CE mark shows that a product has been made to EC standards.
When designing your own product, you also need to ensure it will meet safety standards.
Product designers should also take into account
whenever they design or make a product. 'Moral issues' refers to any adverse impact the product might have on other people. 'Environmental issues' refers to any adverse impact the product might have on the environment. In practice, since people must live in the environment, it's difficult to separate these things out from each other.
The list below outlines some of the key moral and environmental questions a designer should ask themselves about their product.
Is the cost of the product justifiable?
Does the product make efficient use of natural resources?
Are there any waste products which could pollute the environment?
Can the product be recycled after use?
Having considered the potential moral and environmental impact of a product, a designer may decide to use alternative processes, materials or chemicals. The use of alternatives may mean that some parts of the product need to be re-designed, or an alternative manufacturing process needs to be used.

633,5421,"There are two types of timber: softwood and hardwood.
usually come from coniferous trees - that is, evergreen, needle-leaved, cone-bearing trees such as fir and pine. They do not have the hard cell structure that gives hardwood trees their name.
come from broad-leaved, deciduous trees, and are more important in Design and Technology than softwood timbers. The main hardwood timbers are ash, beech, birch, cherry, elm, iroko, mahogany, meranti, oak, obeche, sapele and teak.
The table lists the properties and uses of these hardwood timbers.
Light, creamy brown. Europe & North America
a wood with visible large pores - eg oak
able to withstand blows or sudden shocks without breaking.
capable of being bent or flexed many times without breaking
a wood with no visible large pores - eg beech
able to resist wear, scratching and indentation.
able to withstand a force without breaking or bending.
bends or twists out of shape, this is common with wood
Some furniture, especially chairs; toys; wooden parts of tools
Fairly soft and easy to work. Open grain
the grains have a weave like structure, the wood is often suitable for bending
able to withstand wear, especially as a result of weathering.

Who were the Chartists and what did they want?
The poor - these women wait to enter the workhouse
By 1830, working-class people in Britain were unhappy. There was a

- only 700,000 extra people got the vote.
- the 1833 Factory Act failed to achieve the 10-hour day and many workers were annoyed.
Bitterness towards the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act
- unemployed men were treated harshly by the act; poverty became a crime; New Union Workhouses were being built and; trade depression and high unemployment left many believing that Chartism was the only answer.
- trade unions existed, but they had limited power. Working-class people thought Chartism appeared more effective.

The poem seems to be spoken by a BBC newsreader.
He or she explains why the BBC thinks it is important to read the news in a 'BBC accent': no one will take the news seriously if it's read with a 'voice lik/wanna yoo/scruff'.
He or she speaks here in the accent of an ordinary speaker/viewer - just the kind of voice the newsreader is rejecting.
A newsreader would never really reveal his or her prejudices directly to the viewer in this way. So what the newsreader 'says' in this poem perhaps needs to be seen as the unspoken message (or
) of the way the news is presented.
Formal, official, 'book-English'. The opposite of dialect or slang.
. Would it carry the same 'trooth'?

638,3778,"Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. 'Attitude' can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
The mood or manner of a text or part of a text. The author's 'tone of voice' or way in which they expect to be understood. The emotional load carried by a text.
, you need to think about the ideas and attitudes in the poem, and then decide how you would read it aloud.
in a bitter way, suggesting Robin is angry that Batman prevented him from growing up for so long
in a thoughtful way, suggesting that Robin is reflecting on his experiences with Batman
triumphantly, showing Robin's delight that he is free of Batman at last.
Most readers will probably feel that the tone should be mainly triumphantly, showing Robin's delight that he is free of Batman at last, yet it could be read thoughtfully.
Robin is mocking the fact that the 'good' Batman had an affair with a married woman and exclaims about it in an over-exaggerated way, using a comically inappropriate phrase for sex.
Batman always had Robin close by him, like a shadow, but Robin also felt as insignificant as a shadow. Now that the shadow is gone, Batman seems almost unreal - only ghosts leave no shadows...

645,5968,"Calculating the interior and exterior angles of regular polygons
We already know how to find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon using the formula
We also know that all the interior angles of a regular polygon are equal.
Interior angle of a regular polygon = sum of interior angles  number of sides
Find the interior angle of a regular hexagon.
We know from the formula that the interior angles of a hexagon add up to 720.
As a hexagon has six sides, each angle is equal to
We know that the exterior angles of a regular polygon
add up to 360, so the exterior angle of a regular hexagon is
The interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle always add up to 180. (For a hexagon, 120 + 60 = 180.)
Calculate the exterior angle of a regular octagon, and write down the value of the interior angle.
The sum of the exterior and interior angles is 180, so the interior angle is 180 - 45 =

646,5869,"Jane is excited about returning to Thornfield and Mr Rochester, even though she believes he is married to Blanche Ingram. It is obvious when they meet that Rochester is delighted to see her, too.
What follows is ""a fortnight of dubious calm"", in which Jane expects to hear about the marriage but nothing is said.
On midsummer eve, Jane goes into the garden after Adele has gone to bed. She finds Mr Rochester there. The scene is described in extraordinary detail, as it moves to his proposal.
He is perhaps teasing or testing Jane as he talks of her having to move on, claiming to have found her a new position in Ireland. Eventually, however, he proposes, revealing that any chance of a relationship with Blanche ended when he pretended to have less money than she considered acceptable.
Rochester talks frequently of what he is doing as being wrong, but claims his love and care for Jane will atone for it. As readers, we think there could be something sinister behind this. However, Jane does not pick up on more than his emotion as they go into the house.
Jane is blissfully happy, but still aware that Mrs Fairfax seems shocked. So she asks Mr Rochester to speak to her the following day. Her congratulations, when they come, seem very subdued, fuelling our suspicions.
Jane decides she will not abandon her previous path. She refuses expensive gifts and spends a lot of time with Adele. Mr Rochester is eager to be with her, but allows her to dictate terms in this way in the four weeks leading up to the wedding.
Then we hear of a very bizarre episode. Mr Rochester has had to go away. When he returns, Jane describes having been woken by someone in her room. She describes the woman in hideous terms, and explains that her wedding veil was ripped in two, so it could not have been a dream. Mr Rochester encourages her to continue to blame Grace, and insists she shares Adele's room the night before the wedding.
The wedding morning arrives. Mr Rochester is possessed by tension and a desire that everything should be done quickly. Even Jane is encouraged to hurry.
There are no family present at the wedding. Perhaps for this reason, Jane notices two men, apparently waiting for the ceremony, enter the church before them.
When the priest asks if there is any impediment to the marriage, one of the men, Mr Briggs - a lawyer - explains that Rochester is already married to the sister of Mr Mason, who comes forward at this point.
Clearly, there can be no marriage. Mr Rochester takes them back to Thornfield to see his wife, Bertha, a dangerous lunatic, and Grace, her keeper. Bertha attacks Mr Rochester, but he is able to restrain her. Even though
The crime of marrying one person while still being married to another.
is a serious crime, it becomes easy to understand what drove him.
Before Briggs and Mason depart, we learn that it was a chance connection between Jane's uncle in Madeira and Mr Mason that brought Briggs and Mason to stop the marriage. We also learn that Jane's uncle is on his death-bed.
Jane spends a long time numb with shock at what has happened. She eventually meets with Mr Rochester and he tries everything in his power to keep her with him. He explains how he was trapped by his family into the marriage, and how he spent time in Europe seeking, in vain, some kind of escape.
He asks Jane to come away with him, but she is controlled by conscience and cannot allow herself to be loved by a married man. She knows she cannot stay with him and keep her resolution, so says she will leave.

The structures of control in the Nazi state
Measures were imposed to make sure that schools and youth associations became Nazified:
Non-Nazi teachers and university professors were sacked; teachers had to join the National Socialist Teachers' League.
Textbooks were re-written to include Nazi political and racial ideas.
There was a concentration on physical fitness.
Girls were taught cookery; boys were taught science and maths.
The Hitler Youth was compulsory; it indoctrinated boys and prepared them for war.
The Nazi Girls' youth organisation - the BDM - was compulsory; it indoctrinated girls and prepared them for church, children and cooking.
The following points are examples of how the Nazis took control of workers lives:
The RAD (National Labour Service) sent young men on public works.
Hitler introduced conscription in 1936; most men went into the army after the RAD.
The DAF (German Labour Front) controlled workers' conditions at work.
The KdF (Strength through Joy) movement regulated their leisure time.

649,1028,"A storyboard shows each stage you want to have on screen, one after the other. You would normally use a storyboard if there is just a single pathway through your product  for example, a simple slideshow that starts at Slide 1 and goes through to the end.
You can include pictures, text and descriptions to explain what you are trying to achieve. For example, you might want to describe some sound or music that you want to have, or the transition you would like to have between slides.
Below is an example of a storyboard for a School Parents' Evening presentation.
The more detail you include, the easier you will find it when you come to make the actual product.
Your finished version does not have to be exactly the same as your original design:
Sometimes you will find better ways of doing something. For example, you may not be able to find the precise image you intended to use.
Don't worry about changes. The storyboard is just a plan to guide you through the process. You will not lose marks for changes.
Use your evaluation section to explain the differences between the storyboard plan and final version. Don't forget to include reasons why changes were made.

650,41,"An electronics product can be thought of as a
with inputs, processes and outputs. The most common method of manufacturing electronic products is the batch method - though one-off production and continuous-flow production are also important.
ICT is used extensively in electronics manufacturing. The use of machines that are controlled by computers is called computer-aided manufacture or CAM.
Electronics systems diagrams are used to show how the parts of a product work together. Many electronic products are made up of a number of standard system circuits (circuits that are common to many different products), such as sensors, amplifiers, timers, counters and output devices.
System diagrams usually take the form of a
in which each part of the electronic system is represented by an input, a process or an output.
The block diagrams below shows two types of system.
has no feedback mechanism, so the accuracy depends on how well the system was set up before hand.
electronic systems use sensors to provide feedback. This means that if the output is not satisfactory, the inputs or processes can be altered.

653,4915,"Harmony can be defined as a pleasing arrangement of parts. In art and design, harmony is something that is pleasing to the eye. It engages the viewer and creates an inner sense of order, a balance in the visual experience.
Balance can be defined as the way the elements are arranged to create an equilibirium in an artwork. The three types of balance are
When one side of a composition is reflected in the other. It can also be referred to as formal balance.
When one side of a composition is not reflected in the other. Asymmetrical balance is created when one part of a composition differs from the other without destroying it's overall harmony.
When a composition is based on a circle extending out or towards a central point.
A good composition draws all the elements together to form one harmonious and balanced piece.

How other people work - examples to help with AO3
We have split Gamze's work journal into two halves, so you can see her research development and then the final ceramic pieces she created.
She started work by studying things from the sea from first-hand experience. She looked at shells, coral, fish, sea creatures, seaweed etc, and used water colours, pen and pencil.
Gamze looked at pictures of sea life in books, and at artwork by different artists. She planned to work in ceramics and so she also looked at the work of ceramicists like Kate Malone.
Gamze also developed her ideas by looking at work from different times and places in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

658,1066,"Fold mountains occur near convergent or compressional plate boundaries. Examples of fold mountains include the Alps, Rockies, Andes and Himalayas.
Where an area of sea separates two plates, sediments settle on the sea floor in depressions called geosynclines. These sediments gradually become compressed into sedimentary rock.
When the two plates move towards each other again, the layers of sedimentary rock on the sea floor become crumpled and folded.
Eventually the sedimentary rock appears above sea level as a range of fold mountains.
Where the rocks are folded upwards, they are called
. Where the rocks are folded downwards, they are called
. Severely folded and faulted rocks are called
High mountain ranges, eg Mont Blanc which is 4810m above sea level.
Contrasting microclimates on north facing (ubac) and south facing (adret) slopes.
Geologically young (30  40 million years old).

659,2508,"German 19th-century scholar, who founded Marxism (key theory of Communism).
People should contribute to the public wealth according to their ability, but receive according to their needs.
The means of production should be owned equally by the whole community (hence communism), not as in capitalism where individuals (who might be very rich) own the means of production and leave the rest of society to be poor and oppressed wage slaves.
A deterministic interpretation of history, which said that society must inevitably develop through successive stages of slavery, feudalism, then capitalism, ending up with the violent overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a communist society.
They should work to overthrow capitalism throughout the world by means of a revolution by the proletariat (workers).
Class was a feature of capitalist society, and should be destroyed and replaced by a society of equals.
The economy should be planned - controlled by the government.
Lenin changed Marx's ideas to add that a Communist government first had to be a dictatorship which was essential in order to bring in the communist state safely.

661,1227,"There are already ways in which we can reduce the air pollution caused by the burning of fuels, and others may be developed in the future. New applications that result from scientific research are subject to official regulations and laws.
Coal is an example of a fossil fuel
The fossil fuels include coal, natural gas and the products from the fractional distillation of crude oil, such as petrol and diesel. When any fossil fuel is burned, one of the combustion products is carbon dioxide.
amounts of fossil fuels have been burned each year. This has led to an increase in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air. Many scientists believe this is causing
Global warming refers to the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's surface. In the last 100 years it is believed to have risen by 0.6 degrees C. There are estimates that in the next 100 years, the global temperatures could rise by as much as 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.
One way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air is to burn
fossil fuels. Unfortunately, we depend on the burning of fossil fuels for heating, electricity generation and transport. If we are to burn less fossil fuels, we will need alternatives for these essential activities.

663,581,"Huntingtons disorder is caused by a dominant
, written as H. The symptoms usually develop in middle age, and include problems with controlling your muscles and forgetfulness.
You only need to inherit one copy of the faulty allele to have Huntingtons disorder, unlike cystic fibrosis, where you need to inherit both copies. You can inherit Huntingtons disorder if one or both of your parents carry the faulty allele, because it is a
an allele that always expresses itself whether it is partnered by a recessive allele or by another like itself
You can show inheritance of the disorder using genetic diagrams.
In this example, one parent, the mother, carries one copy of the Huntingtons allele. She has the disorder. The father does not carry the Huntingtons allele, so he does not have the disorder.

It sets up Portia's comparison of the light of Belmont, shining in the darkness, to a good deed shining
. Belmont represents the light of love and harmony.
The move from the darkness to dawn is a itself a powerful
An image or thing (usually something physical, like a flag) that stands for or represents something else - usually something abstract, like a nation. A crucifix is a symbol of Christianity.
Portia promises to the characters on stage that she will answer all things faithfully at a later time, but we never see this happen, leaving a few unanswered questions. We may also have questions of our own:
How and when did Portia find out about Antonio's ships?
What do we feel about the way Shylock was treated?
How likely is it that Jessica and Lorenzo will be happy together?

665,2826,"Compare your answer with the hints below:
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Both poems are about water when it is dangerous. Clarke describes a near-drowning while Heaney describes the savage sea in a storm.
In Clarke's poem the water seems to subtly hide its dangers (e.g. satiny mud blooms in cloudiness) but Heaney recognises its force and violence - the flung spray hits the very windows.
Clarke uses the image of water to question our powers of memory, whereas Heaney uses it to show the power of nature.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Like Heaney, Whitman describes a violent storm at sea.
Like Clarke, however, Whitman hints at the supernatural. His references to demoniac laughter and the savage trinity seem on the surface more threatening than the fairytale references in Clarke's poem.
We question the endings of both poems. We wonder about the dim weird forms that Whitman sees and about the lost things that Clarke imagines drowned in the lake.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Yet for Clare, the water is innocent. It is part of the beauty of summer as it supports the wildlife: marsh marigolds and water lilies, moor hens and insects. Clarke also suggests the beauty of the water (e.g. long green silk), but for her it could be hiding something potentially sinister, while for Clare it is simply the clear lake.
The sonnet form suggests Clare's love of the water, while Clarke's use of alternating stanzas and half rhyme suggests an uncertainty. She cannot be sure what is under the water; she cannot be sure of her memory.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

666,1949,"In your German exam you will have to show your reading skills. This exercise will help you understand an article where some students describe where they live.
Read these short descriptions, given by Claudia, Eva, Michael and Lars, of where they live. Don't worry if you don't understand every word at this stage.
Ich wohne seit vierzehn Jahren in Herborn. Ich fahre oft nach Gieen, aber ich bin immer froh, wenn ich von der Uni wieder nach Hause fahren kann. Es gibt zwar nicht sehr viel zu tun, aber das macht mir nichts aus. Ich brauche nur meine Freunde anzurufen und in zehn Minuten sitzen wir zusammen in einer der vielen Kneipen in der Altstadt und reden miteinander. Und nachher kann ich einfach nach Hause laufen.
Ich wohne in einer Wohnung in Offenburg, etwa fnf Gehminuten vom Bahnhof. Es gefllt mir dort, denn ich kann morgens im Stadtpark joggen. Ich habe daran gedacht, nach Freiburg zu ziehen, weil es dort viel mehr zu tun gibt, besonders was Sport betrifft. Aber da so viele Leute dort studieren wollen, sind die Lebenskosten viel hher und ich muss ein paar Jahre warten, bis ich dahinziehen kann.
Ich wohne immer noch bei meinen Eltern in Spiesen-Elversberg. Das liegt am Waldrand, etwa fnf Kilometer sdlich von Neunkirchen. Es ist ganz schn ruhig hier und man kann sich gut vom Schulstress erholen, aber abends und am Wochenende wird es mir langweilig. Meine Eltern sind super und fahren mich nach Neunkirchen zum Kino und holen mich oft sehr spt ab. Ich freue mich schon auf nchstes Jahr. Bis dann habe ich hoffentlich meinen Fhrerschein. Dann htte ich vor allem in Saarbrcken eine grere Auswahl an Filmen.
Seit fnf Jahren wohne ich auf dem Lande. Frher habe ich in Berlin gewohnt. Klar hat das Spa gemacht, in einer Weltstadt zu wohnen. Aber ich denke jetzt nie daran und auf dem Bauernhof habe ich alles, was ich brauche. Das geht allerdings nicht ohne Wagen und Telefon, denn hier gibt es so gut wie keine ffentlichen Verkehrsmittel.
Wer ist das? Schreiben Sie den Namen, der am besten passt.
Eva finds it restful at home after school.
Living costs are too high in Freiburg for Michael to move there.
Lars moved from Berlin five years ago.
fhrt in die Stadt abends, um sich zu unterhalten.
fhrt abends in die Stadt, um sich zu unterhalten.
Eva travels to town to go to the cinema.
Read the text through once, aiming to get a general sense of each paragraph. Don't worry if there are words that you don't understand - look for similarities with English words, for example:
Look for words to do with feelings and comparisons.
Read the question carefully, before you read the text. Look for key words that may give you clues to the answers you need.

There are a range of techniques for enhancing the appearance of a drawing, making it look more like the real object. The technique used will depend on the type of drawing and what you are trying to show.
For this technique, thin lines are used in between adjoining surfaces. Thick lines are suitable when only one side can be seen. The drawing illustrates the idea.
of the same colour. A lighter tone is called a tint and is made by adding white to the base colour. A darker tone is called a shade and is made by adding black to the base colour.
Tone can also be shown by using patterns of lines, dots, shading, reflections and highlights. It is also possible to obtain sheets of dry transfer material to represent different tones.
There are a number of ways of showing on paper the texture of materials used to make a product. These are intended to give an impression of the material, rather than represent it exactly. Some examples include drawing the grain on pieces of wood or drawing lines at angles to show reflected light on clear glass or plastics. Textures can be represented in shades of grey or colour.
Colour is an important part of graphic design. You need to know the following facts about colour.
are made by mixing the primary colours as follows: red + yellow = orange; red + blue = violet; blue + yellow = green.
Mixing primary and secondary colours together creates tertiary colours. These are dark browns, greens and greys.
The colour wheel illustrates how the colours relate to each other.
The colours next to each other harmonise (go together). Use harmonising colours to make elements of a design look related to each other.
Colours that are on opposite sides of the wheel contrast with each other (they are 'complementary' colours). Use contrasting colours to make elements of a design stand out from each other.
Yellow, orange and red are 'warm' colours; green and blue are 'cold'. Warm colours appear to come towards you from the page, while cold colours appear to recede.

668,2755,"The Monster and Victor meet for the first time since it was created, and Victor tries to kill it out of revenge. But the Monster dodges the attack, then asks to talk and explain its actions. It wants Victor to admit some responsibility and show sympathy for what it has gone through, thanks to Victor abandoning it.
The Monster is calm and restrained, and speaks politely with great skill and persuasion. Victor curses, calls it 'Devil', and is openly violent in his words and attempted deeds. This irony shows that Shelley wants the audience to sympathise with the Monster. The chapter ends with the Monster hinting to Victor that it will leave mankind alone if he agrees to listen to its story. Grudgingly, Victor accepts.

670,5167,"Most iron is converted into steel - an alloy - before being used. Compared to iron, steel is:
Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.

671,5139,"Most tasks allow you to write or talk about how language is used in the play. So imagine your title is: 'How does Beatrice change during the course of
?' There are all sorts of references you can make to language:
When we first meet Beatrice, she seems to be a clever, independent woman. She speaks openly, not waiting to be asked, and seems to like making fun of Benedick in particular. She compares him with ""a disease"", and her repartee makes even the messenger afraid of her. Throughout the play she uses puns, such as saying Claudio is ""civil as an orange"". This shows her witty nature, because she plays on the similarity between ""civil"" and ""Seville"": he is either polite or bitter (just like the oranges from Seville).
This combines much of what we have covered so far. It starts to answer the question without filling up the page with irrelevant facts, plot details and fancy technical terms. Remember, you do not have to tick off the language terms like a trainspotter. Instead, show you appreciate some of the techniques Shakespeare used, and the effects they have on his audience.

672,5973,"William Blake: The Little Boy Lost / The Little Boy Found
is about a boy walking with his father through marshy land at night. He becomes separated from his father and is obviously in danger. Even the
that might have provided him with some light disappears, so he is left alone in total darkness.
is about the finding of the lost boy, who has been following a 'wandr'ing light'. God appears and leads him back to his mother, who has been searching for him. Strangely, she was searching for him in the dale, not the fen. This could be interpreted as meaning she was in the wrong place and would not have found him without God's help.

674,1440,"When answering a source based question, it is important to pick apart the source and study every detail to see what it suggests.
For Source B, you must be able to identify which people in the source are the Chartists and which ones are the government. You must also ask questions:
These are the Chartists  most of them are carrying pikes but at least one of them has a gun.
These figures are the government  you can tell this by the top hats that they are wearing. They are holding guns.
Source B suggest that the Chartists and government fought in Newport outside the Westgate Hotel. The Chartists look fierce and organised, while the government men appear to cower in front of the hotel. There is a lot of smoke between the two groups which suggests a lot of gunfire and violence.
All things historic - from ancient to modern.

The way a text is built and shaped. Chapters, plot, acts and scenes, stanzas, narrative, verse-form, rhyme and rhythm - all these (and many more) are aspects of structure.

676,1307,"You will need to use your Ideas about science to:
Distinguish questions that can be answered using a scientific approach from those that cannot. For example, science can answer the question, ""What are the chances of my child having cystic fibrosis?"". However, it cannot answer the question, ""Should I have my pregnancy terminated?""
State clearly what the issue in any debate is. For instance, in a debate about treating genetic diseases with gene therapy, some people think that altering our
The material inside the nucleus of cells, carrying genetic information. DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid.
is against nature or God. The ethical issue is whether scientists should be allowed to use
treating or preventing disease by introducing or replacing specific genes inside human cells
You will also need to summarise the different views that different people might hold. For example, if gene therapy saves lives, it can only be a good thing. Or, we should not use gene therapy because we do not know the long-term outcomes.
Identify arguments that are based on the right decision, ie a decision that produces the best outcome for most of the people involved. So, if a certain type of gene therapy involves a risk of causing harm, but 90 per cent of the people who have the therapy are cured, is it worth taking the risk?
Identify when certain actions are never justified because they are unnatural or wrong. For example, we could wipe out cystic fibrosis in one generation if we made sure that anyone who was a carrier was not allowed to have children. However, most people would consider this action to be immoral and wrong.

679,1263,"Despite some MEDCs having food surpluses and problems such as obesity, many people in LEDCs suffer from malnutrition and starvation. This could be a result of factors such as drought, debt or conflict, eg in the Darfur region of Sudan.
This is an example of 'sustainable agriculture'. It benefits small farmers and enables them to use their land efficiently. The projects use cheap, appropriate technology to increase yields in ways that make farmers more independent and conserve their natural resources.
Farmers in 50 developing countries have adopted sustainable techniques and some have experienced increased yields. By combining science with traditional knowledge, sustainable agriculture could meet the long-term food needs of developing countries without damaging the environment.
Genetically modified (GM) foods, for example, could change food production methods. They allow more food to be produced in a smaller area using fewer resources. Some people are against GM crops and question whether it will reduce hunger in LEDCs and are concerned about the impact on the environment.
In the 1960s high-yielding varieties of crops were used to increase food production - this became known as 'The Gene Revolution'. In the Gene Revolution, genes from one plant were copied and inserted into another to give it new characteristics. This allowed foods to be developed to suit specific environments and food demands.

In plain-weave the warp and weft are aligned so that they form a simple criss-cross pattern. It is strong and hardwearing. It is used for fashion and furnishing fabrics.

Weft-knitted fabrics are made by hand or machine. Weft knits are used for socks, T-shirts and jumpers.
Weft-knitted fabric is made by looping together long lengths of yarn. This makes the fabric stretchy and comfortable.
The yarn runs in rows across the fabric. If a stitch is dropped it will ladder down the length of the fabric.
Weft knits, made by hand or machine, are used for socks, T-shirts and jumpers.
Warp-knitted fabric is made by machine and is used for swimwear.
The loops interlock vertically along the length of the fabric. Warp knits are slightly stretchy and do not ladder.
They are used for swimwear, underwear and geotextiles.

Fabrics can be layered and combined to improve their handle, appearance or performance. For example:
fabric such as Vilene can be stitched or
two or more layers or sheets bonded together
to other fabrics. This reinforces, stiffens and gives strength to collars and cuffs and prevents the fabric from stretching or sagging.
fabric has two or more layers sewn together to give an attractive appearance and added warmth.
can be laminated to another fabric using
a substance which bonds the surfaces of materials together
or heat. Gore-Tex is used for all-weather clothing and shoes because it is breathable and waterproof.
It is important to choose materials that are
. Choosing a fabric with the appropriate quality and cost will ensure that a product will suit the
the end-user or consumer group to whom the manufacturer aims to sell
and do the job it is intended to do. When making fabric choices, ask yourself the following questions:
derived from animal, vegetable or mineral sources
- should you use woven, knitted or non-woven?

the ability of a fibre, yarn or fabric to stretch and return to its original shape.
the ability to be pulled out of shape and then recover the original shape. Lycra is a stretch fabric.
It is important to match fabric properties to the requirements of the product. For example:
Cycling jackets need to be made from warm, breathable, elastic, windproof, water-resistant fabric.
Children's jumpers need to be made from soft, colourful, stretchy, warm, easy-care fabric.
Seat belts, airbags or conveyor belts need to be made from strong, durable, flame-resistant materials.
Fire protective clothing needs to be strong, durable, flame- and water-resistant. It may also need to be breathable and elastic.
textile materials used in contact with soil or rocks in the construction of roads or embankments. They stabilise the land and enable water to filter through.
need to be strong and durable so they stop embankments from slipping.

682,104,"Metals are very useful. Ores are naturally occurring rocks that contain metal or metal compounds in sufficient amounts to make it worthwhile extracting them. For example, iron ore is used to make iron and steel. Copper is easily extracted, but ores rich in copper are becoming more difficult to find. Aluminium and titanium are metals with useful properties, but they are expensive to extract. Most everyday metals are mixtures called alloys.
The outer layer of the Earth, on top of the mantle. It is between 6 and 48 kilometres thick and includes the continents and the ocean floor.
Substances formed by the chemical union (involving bond formation) of two or more elements.
such as gold, iron oxide and aluminium oxide, but when found in the Earth these are often mixed with other substances. To be useful, the metals have to be extracted from whatever they are mixed with. A
is a rock containing a metal, or a metal compound, in a high enough concentration to make it economic to extract the metal.
The method used to extract metals from the ore in which they are found depends on their reactivity. For example, reactive metals such as aluminium are extracted by
Electrolysis is the decomposition (separation or break-down) of a compound using an electric current.
, while a less-reactive metal such as iron may be extracted by
Reduction is a reaction in which oxygen is removed from a substance. Reduction also means a gain in electrons.
Thus the method of extraction of a metal from its ore depends on the metal's position in the reactivity series:
Metals - in decreasing order of reactivity
Note that gold, because it is so unreactive, is found as the native metal and not as a compound, so it does not need to be chemically separated. However, chemical reactions may be needed to remove other elements that might contaminate the metal.

683,4837,"Nuclear fusion involves two atomic nuclei joining to make a large nucleus. Energy is released when this happens.
The Sun and other stars use nuclear fusion to release energy. The sequence of nuclear fusion reactions in a star is complex, but overall hydrogen nuclei join to form helium nuclei. Here is one nuclear fusion reaction that takes place:
hydrogen-1 nuclei fuse with hydrogen-2 nuclei to make helium-3 nuclei
A nuclear fusion reaction showing the nuclei involved

Lichens are another example of mutualism. They are formed by algae and fungi living together. Algae can photosynthesise and make food, which is shared by the fungus. The fungus in turn shelters the algae from a harsh climate.

organism. The parasite benefits from this arrangement, but the host suffers as a result. Fleas are parasites. They live on the skin of other animals and suck their blood. This feeds the flea but weakens the host.
A tapeworm lives inside another animal, attaching itself to the hosts gut and absorbing its food. The host loses nutrition, and may develop weight loss, diarrhoea and vomiting. Parasites do not usually kill the host, as this would cut off their food supply.
plants. They have colonies of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules attached to their roots. The plants gain nitrates from the bacteria, and the bacteria gain sugars from the plants. This is another example of mutualism.

685,3857,"We often use formulas without even noticing. For example, we might convert miles to km by multiplying by 1.6, or find the circumference of a circle by multiplying pi by the diameter.
km = 1.6 x miles is an example of a formula.
We have already seen that km = 1.6 x miles and C =
 d are examples of formulas. There are many others that we use regularly in other subjects. Sometimes we have to construct our own formula:
A taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00. Write down a formula for the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles.
Travelling 1 mile would cost 2 + 50p.
Travelling 2 miles would cost 2 + 2 x 50p.
Travelling 3 miles would cost 2 + 3 x 50p.
So travelling for 'n' miles will cost 2 + n x 50p.
The formula is C = 2 + (n x 50p)
A rectangle has a width of x and a length of 2x.
Write down a formula for the perimeter (P) in terms of x.
P = 2x + x + 2x + x
Did you remember to include all 4 sides?
To recap, the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles, when a taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00 is:-
C = 2 + (n x 50p)
To find the cost of the taxi for a journey of 20 miles, replace 'n' with 20.
C = 2 + (20 x 50p)
What is the cost of hiring this taxi for 16 miles?
Remember that C = 2 + (16 x 50p)
The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.
r, so we divide both sides by 2
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c
Rearrange the formula to make 'c' the subject.
[To work this out: y = mx + c, so subtract mx from both sides.]

686,6222,"""he was a skinny, vivid little boy, with a glance coming up from under a hut of straight hair that hung down, black and course""
""He walked with an accustomed tread through the fruit trees""
The first time we meet Simon, he is in his choir robes. He faints on the beach because of the heat and Jack mocks him. We know he is delicate. He has epilepsy.
""a skinny, vivid little boy, with a glance coming up from under a hut of straight hair that hung down, black and course""
. His hair hides his face, which hints to us he is secretive.
He is imaginative: he sees the buds on the bushes as
He is helpful and works for the good of others; he is the only one to stick with Ralph to make the shelters. He is kind to the littluns and finds fruit for them.
The others recognise he is 'different' to them in some way. Ralph says
""a secret place in a clearing full of flowers and butterflies""
, and is sufficiently at one with the jungle to walk in it alone at night. He is at one with nature and he has no fear.
He seems able to prophesy - he is the first to suggest that
""You'll get back to where you came from""
He is the most perceptive about the beast. He says
""maybe there is a beast... What I mean is... maybe it's only us""
. He is the only one to see that the problems on the island stem from the boys' relationships with each other, not from an outside force. Yet nobody understands what he's trying to say.
When the Lord of the Flies 'speaks' to him this idea is reiterated: the voice in Simon's head says
""Fancy thinking the Beast was something you could hunt and kill!... You knew, didn't you? I'm part of you?""
He is killed just as he is about to reveal the truth. It is ironic that he is the only one who finds out that the 'beast' was a dead parachutist, but is denied passing on the message because the group of boys think, in their frenzy, he is the beast.
Simon's close relationship with nature seems to carry on even after he is dead:
"" The waves turned the corpse gently in the water. ... Softly, surrounded by a fringe of bright inquisitive creatures, itself a silver shape beneath the steadfast constellations, Simon's dead body moved out towards the open sea""

687,1659,"bject. Asteroids or comets on a possible collision course with the Earth are NEOs.
They are difficult to observe because they are smaller, and darker, than planets. But scientists are actively observing many NEOs with telescopes. It is possible to calculate the
(path) of an NEO if enough observations are taken over time.
Asteroid collisions leave craters behind. These are obvious on the Moon, but on the Earth craters are usually eventually weathered away or covered over by natural processes.
Other evidence for past impacts comes from studying layers of rock built up over millions of years. For example, some adjacent layers show abrupt changes in the type and number of fossils. This shows the possible effect on living organisms of an asteroid hitting the Earth.
Iridium is a rare metallic element on Earth, but it is relatively abundant in space. There is a layer of iridium-rich rock dating from around 65 million years ago. This is evidence of an asteroid collision.

This painting depicts the traditional view about the heroism of Custer and his men at the Battle of the Little Bighorn - Custer can be seen brandishing two guns, fighting until the very end.
However, this painting illustrates the problem of
of sources. This depiction is almost certainly wrong. An archaeological survey in 1983 found that Custer's men fell in a running battle, perhaps as they scattered and fled down the hillside towards the river. It also found that Custer was not scalped, which suggests that he shot himself, because the Sioux did not scalp a suicide.

the counter forces, there is a resultant force backwards. This will make the car
If the driving force is the same as the counter forces, there is no resultant force, and so no change in velocity.
If the car is already moving, it will carry on at a steady speed in a straight line.
If the car is not moving, it will stay still.

Safety is vitally important in the food industry, for obvious reasons. As in any other type of production, the most important part of safety-consciousness is identifying and monitoring potential
anything likely to cause harm and/or damage
) and taking steps to avoid them. There are three main types of hazard in food production:
is where foods become dangerously infected by bacteria. This might lead to food poisoning, such as salmonella.
occurs where foreign bodies, such as nuts and screws from factory machinery, personal jewellery and fingernails, fall into the food.
is where potentially dangerous fluids or pesticides have found their way into food.
Control of Substance Hazardous to Health (COSHH)
regulations help to protect workers in the food and other industry from hazardous substances such as cleaning fluids and pesticides. It encourages employers to put safety procedures in place to prevent accidents.
is a set of procedures used by caterers to ensure food is always safe to eat. This is based on
Critical control points (CCPs) are pre-determined checks which take place at specified points in the food production or preparation process. They must be carefully documented, with details of the checks themselves, the processes being checked, any faults and remedial action taken. Some of these checks will be done by hand - others may be computerised under CAM. They will include checking:
speeds at which machines and conveyor belts move
scanning for impurities, such as metal, and other potential hazards

695,5853,"New farming techniques and selective breeding ideas were introduced to Britain after 1750. These ideas helped to improve crop production and the quality of meat.
This Revision Bite will identify the main improvements made to agricultural techniques and the people responsible for these improvements.
began to reach Britain from abroad. Most of these ideas came from Holland and Denmark. At first, the ideas were not popular, but they soon started to spread across Britain because the farmers using them were making good profits.
Changes in farming techniques during this period were connected with:
that allowed better quality crops to be grown.
to produce bigger cattle and better meat.
Agricultural improvers played an important role in changing and improving British farming techniques. Improvers were divided into three categories:
- people who worked to improve the land.
- people who worked to improve the quality of cattle.
- people who worked to spread new ideas about farming techniques.
He popularised new techniques and proved that they were more profitable. He:
(wheat, turnips, barley, clover) to Britain. Turnips were used as a cleansing crop to allow the land to be hoed to kill the weeds, and clover was grown to replace the nutrients in the soil that the crops had depleted. This rotation prevented land from lying
An area of land which is left unseeded ie crops are not planted and left to grow.
and both turnips and clover were fodder crops, which could be fed to animals to allow more of them to survive cold winters.
, which mixed rich subsoil with a poorer sandy soil to produce better quality crops and increasingly more profit.
to encourage them to invest more money to experiment with new ideas and improving their land.
He is important because he introduced ideas that others went on to develop.
that planted seeds at the same depth in straight lines. This wasted less seeds and allowed farmers to manage their crops more easily.
that made it easier for farmers to weed between their seed rows.
In 1731, he wrote a book called ""
He was a pioneering selective breeder. His new methods were simple:
and bred from them. His most successful animals were the
New Leicester Sheep and the Dishley Longhorn cattle
. They were bigger animals, but they did not have better meat.
about his livestock, made sure they were very healthy and their stables and pens were always clean.
He was so successful that other farmers often hired his animals to breed from.
describing his new breeding techniques and their advantages.
They were also selective breeders, but not as well known as Robert Bakewell.
They improved on Robert Bakewell's methods and their main success was breeding the
, which were able to produce large amounts of milk and high quality lean meat for sale at market.
He was a propagandist for agricultural improvement who was convinced that Britain needed a strong agricultural community.
Young traveled around the country and some parts of Europe, writing
and also edited an agricultural journal called ""The Annals of Agriculture"".
secretary of the new Board of Agriculture
and encouraged the spread of new agricultural techniques and ideas.
Thomas William Coke - 1st Earl of Leicester
He was a Norfolk landowner who adopted and spread new agricultural methods on his farm in Norfolk.
to encourage them to try out new methods. He believed that if his tenant farmers felt they owned the land for a significant period of time, they would be more willing to invest in it.
Coke encouraged farmers to use the new techniques by
on his estate that demonstrated the newest methods. One such event was called Coke's Clipping. This was a competition to see how quickly a sheep could be sheared.
He was important for sharing and spreading new farming ideas.
Most examination boards will want you to answer a question about how important the different improvers were to the agricultural revolution. You need to revise at least two facts about each of the improvers so that you can answer either a three-mark question, or combine all your facts to answer an essay question worth 15 marks.
As part of your revision, think about the
the different agriculturalists improved farming in Great Britain.
each of the agriculturalists was important during the agricultural revolution.
the different agriculturalists fell into different areas of expertise.

696,6002,"There are already ways in which we can reduce the air pollution caused by the burning of fuels, and others may be developed in the future. New applications that result from scientific research are subject to official regulations and laws.
Coal is an example of a fossil fuel
The fossil fuels include coal, natural gas and the products from the fractional distillation of crude oil, such as petrol and diesel. When any fossil fuel is burned, one of the combustion products is carbon dioxide.
amounts of fossil fuels have been burned each year. This has led to an increase in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air. Many scientists believe this is causing
Global warming refers to the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's surface. In the last 100 years it is believed to have risen by 0.6 degrees C. There are estimates that in the next 100 years, the global temperatures could rise by as much as 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.
One way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air is to burn
fossil fuels. Unfortunately, we depend on the burning of fossil fuels for heating, electricity generation and transport. If we are to burn less fossil fuels, we will need alternatives for these essential activities.
Clouds of smoke and other combustion products are emitted from chimneys
Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.
to produce electricity are one of the main contributors of carbon dioxide in the air.
One way to reduce the air pollution caused by power stations is to
. Some ways to do this are:
turning off lights when you leave a room
using a microwave instead of an electric oven
from 2006 about saving energy in the home.
Power stations give out sulfur dioxide which is a cause of
Acid rain is rain that contains a high level of acids. These acids can contaminate drinking water, damage plants and water creatures and buildings. It is believed to be caused by pollution and, maybe, natural activity such as volcanic eruptions.
. The amount of sulfur dioxide given off by a power station can be reduced by:
removing sulfur from natural gas and fuel oil
removing sulfur dioxide from the flue gases emitted by coal-burning power stations
Coal-powered stations give off solid particulates. These can also be removed from the flue gases.
Atmospheric pollution caused by the exhaust gases given out by motor vehicles can be reduced by:
Exhaust gases given out by motor vehicles causes atmospheric pollution
burning less fuel by having more efficient engines
using catalytic converters, which convert nitrogen monoxide to nitrogen and oxygen, and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide
adjusting the balance between public and private transport, with more people using buses and trains instead of cars
setting legal limits on exhaust emissions which are enforced through MOT tests

698,1835,"Both heating and cooling food can change its susceptibility to
microscopic (too small to see) organisms such as bacteria and viruses
, and therefore its ability to stay fresh.
Keeping foods such as dairy produce, cooked foods and raw food ingredients in a refrigerator at a temperature from 0C to 3C will slow the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, but won't stop it entirely.
Storing food in a freezer makes long-term storage possible by making bacteria dormant.
Many different types of food are quickly frozen in factories to maintain high standards of freshness and safety. Products are stored in commercial freezers at between -18C and -29C. Home freezers store products at -18C. Freezing does not kill bacteria, but will keep them
A volcano is classed as dormant when it is temporarily inactive but not fully extinct.
Cook-chilled foods can be cooked from frozen without defrosting. The downside is that cook-chilled foods have a short lifespan and have to be thoroughly reheated before eating - to at least 72C - to avoid the risk of food poisoning. Leftovers should be disposed of quickly.
In the factory, the foods are prepared by cooking them to 70C for two minutes to destroy microorganisms. Food is packaged into portions and blast-chilled. Here the temperature is instantly lowered and stored at 0C to 4C.
UHT is used for products such as ""long-life"" milk. The product is heated to a temperature of 132C to 140C for one second to destroy all bacteria. Then the food is rapidly cooled.

702,165,"LEDCs face difficulties as they try to improve the conditions of their citizens. Many solutions have been proposed, with varying degrees of success, but poverty is still a daily reality for millions of people.
Factors that affect the economic gap between MEDCs and LEDCs.
such as the regime in power, relationships with other countries and old colonial ties will influence trading links. The current political regime in Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe is a major factor contributing to the low level of development.
such as susceptibility to floods, drought and other hazards can influence development. Frequent drought in the Sahel region of Africa is a huge obstacle in the way of development.
such as wealth generated through industry, agriculture or the availability of natural resources influences development. The UK is one of the world's most developed nations because these factors allowed it to industrialise during the Industrial Revolution.
 many LEDCs are in debt to MEDCs, which means they have to prioritise paying these off with interest before investing in development.

In the extract from Karimah's work journal, shown below, you will see how she has explained her work to others. This was a statement she included with her exhibition of coursework. Along with her other notes and explanations, she was able to help others understand how she had developed her ideas and work.
to develop and explore your ideas, like Karimah has done. Write your progress in your work journal, so the examiner knows how your work has progressed.
My art exhibition shows a series of artwork that I have created which all deal with my journey from Nigeria to England. During the term, I have created a series of art pieces that concentrate on the theme of 'Identity'. In the art pieces, I explore the journey that I have made from Nigeria to live in England. The reason that I have focused on this subject under the title of 'Identity' is because, the journey I have made was a life changing journey and it is a significant part of my identity.
I first started exploring this journey by creating self portraits, this was to develop my skills and ideas in art to help me to become more advanced. I then planned and created a collage of Africa. This collage shows the journey that I made to England from Nigeria, through symbols, colours and pictures used to represent the contrasting countries. The main elements that I included in my collage work is that England has a cool calm atmosphere and climate whilst Nigeria is hot and roars with excitement and noise. Nigeria has a beautiful collection of exotic animals that run wild and free, whilst in England the animals are locked up in a zoo. The environment in England is clean and fresh but in Nigeria, it is dirty and humid. I chose to show my journey this way because it is an effective way of showing the striking difference between England and Nigeria.
After the first collage I realised that collage is my strongest point in art and I began to produce a series of mixed media pieces that featured collage. 'Tree of Life' is a piece where I used a symbol of a tree to represent my life growing out of a symbol of Africa. In 'The first self portrait collage' I used maps to show the physical part of my journey. 'The second self portrait collage', is a piece where I used the different flags of England and Nigeria to show my journey and the comparison between England and Nigeria.
I have linked my theme of 'Identity', with numerous artists because they have all been exploring a similar theme to me. Gerard Quenum is an African artist who uses dolls to symbolise identity, Richard Long, an artist who expresses his journeys through photographs, Louise Bourgeois who deals with her identity by using memories of her childhood, Frida Khalo a Mexican artist who uses powerful images to show her identity and Henri Matisse who uses his knowledge of African art and refines it into a simpler form in his pieces of art. I have been to the National Gallery, the Tate Modern, the October Gallery, the Century City exhibition and the library to learn about artists that may have connections with my theme.
I have been exploring my cultural and family background through family photographs. This is because the photographs prompt ideas for units of work and they tell different stories through the atmosphere or pose in the picture.
The journey in the art pieces is presented in mixed styles of aboriginal art and African art. I do this to experiment with the different ways of presenting my journey to viewers and to give a variation in the techniques and arts styles that I use.
My progress whilst creating units of artwork has improved dramatically compared to the beginning of term where I was unable to develop and explore ideas. Overall, I am pleased with the way that I have managed to link all my units of artwork together all under the topic of 'Identity'. I have improved my art skills from the beginning of the term, when I had very little art skills. I am glad that I can now expand and explore ideas, compared to when I first started art and I could not develop an idea because of lack of experience and knowledge of art.

706,1939,"Isambard Kingdom Brunel is one of the three main engineers responsible for the development of the railways. This Revision Bite will look at his contribution to the railway network.
The development of railways during the 19th century happened because of the work of three main engineers. We have already mentioned Richard Trevithick and George Stephenson, but Isambard Kingdom Brunel also played a key role.
who designed steam trains, oversaw the construction of new railway tracks and built some amazing and breathtaking bridges and tunnels along his railway routes.
the chief engineer of the Great Western Railway
(GWR) in 1833. The railway line linked the towns of London and Bristol and was often referred to as ""God's Wonderful Railway"" because the route was so smooth and it was a perfect example of railway engineering.
The line was so successful that it was later extended to connect to Plymouth and Cornwall. Brunel used his considerable skills on the route and
built the Tamar Bridge and Box Tunnel
One of the reasons why Brunel's railway routes and tracks were so smooth is because, unlike George Stephenson,
he used a gauge of 7 feet 3 inches
. He believed that this gauge was not only the safest, but would allow trains to travel faster and give the passengers more comfort. Unfortunately, 92 per cent of the railway tracks in Britain had already been built at Stephenson's gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches. This led to
the Gauge Act being passed in 1846
, which stated that all train tracks had to be built to George Stephenson's gauge width. Isambard Kingdom Brunel had
. This made it easier for trains to run on all tracks across the country and not just in the local area.

710,1074,"Why does Mr Rochester marry Bertha Mason? In part, it is because he believes he is marrying an attractive woman. In part, it is to oblige his family by making a good marriage financially speaking. And in part it is because his father and brother, and Bertha's relatives, kept the madness in her family from him. While Rochester blames himself for falling for Bertha's superficial charm, he cannot forgive the betrayal of the deception. Even after his brother and father die, he is still trapped by the situation.
It is clear that he tries to hide from the reality of it, but when he meets Jane he sees her as extraordinarily different and refreshing. He falls deeply in love, but does not have the courage to tell her. He admits, after Mason has stopped the wedding, that he wanted to have her ""safe"" first, knowing her moral stance as he does. The fact that he was prepared to deceive her, even after his own experience, might suggest he needs a period of
before the happy ending. What is never in any doubt is how much he loves Jane:
""Oh, Jane! my hope - my love - my life!"" (Chapter 27.)

712,2234,"All animals and plants are made of cells. Animal cells and plant cells have features in common, such as a nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria and ribosomes. Plant cells also have a cell wall, and often have chloroplasts and a permanent vacuole. Note that cells may be specialised to carry out a particular function.
Dissolved substances pass into and out of cells by diffusion. Water passes into and out of cells by osmosis.
Function of cells which animal and plant cells have in common
contains genetic material, which controls the activities of the cell
most chemical processes take place here, controlled by enzymes
controls the movement of substances into and out of the cell
most energy is released by respiration here
contain chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy for photosynthesis
filled with cell sap to help keep the cell
having turgor; enlarged and swollen with water

713,1093,"The Birling family are spending a happy evening celebrating the engagement of Sheila Birling to Gerald Croft - a marriage that will result in the merging of two successful local businesses. Yet, just when everything seems to be going so well, they receive a surprise visit from an Inspector Goole who is investigating the suicide of a young girl.
The questions he asks everyone relating to the case reveal that they all have secrets linking them to the
A type of drama in which characters undergo suffering or calamity, and which usually ends with a death. A sad or catastrophic event causing suffering or death.
The Birling family are holding a dinner party to celebrate the engagement of Sheila to Gerald Croft, the son and heir of Mr Birling's rival in business. Although there are a few signs that not
is perfect (Mr Birling is a bit too anxious to impress Gerald, Eric seems rather nervous and Sheila playfully rebukes Gerald for not having come near her the previous summer) there is a happy, light-hearted atmosphere.
When the ladies leave the men to their port, Mr Birling has a 'man to man' chat with Gerald and Eric, advising them that a man needs to look after himself and his own family and not worry about the wider community. As he is telling them this, the door bell rings. Inspector Goole enters, an impressive, serious man whom none of them has heard of.

714,3552,"Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. Attitude can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
A good way to decide on the tone of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
Angrily, to show the poet's attitude to the fact that nothing has changed?
Or in a resigned way, as if he knows that it's almost too much to hope that things can change?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
Tatamkhulu Afrika wrote this about his poem:
Nothing's Changed is entirely autobiographical. I can't quite remember when I wrote this, but I think it must have been about 1990. District Six was a complete waste by then, and I hadn't been passing through it for a long time. But nothing has changed. Not only District Six... I mean, we may have a new constitution, we may have on the face of it a beautiful democracy, but the racism in this country is absolutely redolent. We try to pretend to the world that it does not exist, but it most certainly does, all day long, every day, shocking and saddening and terrible.
Look, I don't want to sound like a prophet of doom, because I don't feel like that at all. I am full of hope. But I won't see it in my lifetime. It's going to take a long time. I mean, in America it's taken all this time and it's still not gone... So it will change. But not quickly, not quickly at all.

? Briefly note down some points that you would want to include in your essay, then compare your ideas with those in our sample answer on the next page.
War transforms soldiers, breaking them physically and mentally: 'Bent double' 'Knock-kneed'. Rather than glorious men, Owen presents the soldiers as weakened old 'hags'.
The experience of war is something no soldier can escape: 'In all my dreams, before my helpless sight, / He plunges at me'.
The effect of gas used in World War One is communicated to the reader through Owen's use of verbs linked to death by a lack of oxygen: 'guttering, choking, drowning', 'smothering'.
Owen offers the reader very graphic imagery associated with suffering, aiming to present the truth about the war experience, arguably arising from his first-hand experience of war.
Owen presents the soldiers as victims who have been betrayed by those who encouraged them to go to war. He uses words such as 'innocent' and 'children' to reinforce his positive attitude to the soldiers.
Owen is bitter about war and the encouragement given to go to war. He angrily refers to 'The old Lie' that dying for your country is sweet and honourable.
The detailed description of a soldier dying as a result of gas attack is intended to make the reader feel discomfort, forcing him or her to confront the reality of war, something which is far from honourable or sweet.

Which of the following triangles (P, Q or R) is a translation of triangle ABC?
a translation of triangle ABC. Triangle ABC has been translated 3 squares to the right and 2 squares up.
a translation of triangle ABC because the object and its image are facing in opposite directions.
a translation of triangle ABC because the object and its image have different side lengths. They are different shapes.
When we translate an object, every vertex (corner) must be moved in the same way.
Triangle PQR has been translated 3 squares down and 4 squares to the right. All of the vertices have been translated in the same way, and the object and its image are exactly the same shape and size.

Alan Davie: 'To a Celtic Spirit, 1'
Alan Davie is a prominent Scottish artist well known for his work in a range of mediums including drawing, painting, and screenprinting.
He was born in 1920 and graduated from the Edinburgh Royal College of Art in 1940. After serving in World War II he began teaching in Edinburgh and in 1947 became a professional jazz musician.
In 1948 he took up a travelling art scholarship from the college and travelled throughout Europe in 1948-9. In Venice he met
, an influential art collector, who introduced him to
. Whilst exhibiting in New York in 1956 he befriended other artists including
Jackson Pollock, Willem De Kooning and Mark Rothko
His work continues to be widely exhibited across the USA and Europe.
and reflects the artist's love of jazz music, non-western cultural symbols, ancient religious and ethnic influences.
My ideas are intuitive and most ideas come from my thoughts. The art I create is no way expressive or impressionist, it just comes from an artist drive I have to keep on creating.
The work of art seems to be something thrown off, a by-product of the process of being and working. Art just happens, like falling in love.
When I am working, I am aware of a striving, a yearning, the making of many impossible attempts at a kind of transmutation  a searching for a formula for the magical conjuring of the unknowable. Many times the end seems just within reach, only to fly to pieces before me as I reach for it.
I paint because I have nothing, or I paint because I am full of ideas ... or I paint because after I last painted, something appeared miraculously out of it.
The titles are not necessarily directly linked to the image, they are more often terms I have to use to catalogue the artwork I have created.
Inside is a place of magic; resounding, surrounding, where big hanging works in progress are constantly being transformed and re-worked, making a shifting environment of developing moods, spaces, colours, forms, poetry fragments, script, signs and symbols, laughing, singing.

Listen to the poem and watch the slideshow
The squat pen rests: snug as a gun.
Under my window, a clean rasping sound
When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:
Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds
Bends low, comes up twenty years away
The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft
Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep
To scatter new potatoes that we picked
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
By God the old man could handle a spade.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day
Than any other man on Toner's bog.
Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
To drink it, then fell to right away
Over his shoulder, going down and down
The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head.
But I've no spade to follow men like them.

In this poem Heaney sees his father, an old man, digging the flowerbeds. He remembers how his younger, stronger father used to dig in the potato fields when Heaney was a child - and how his grandfather, before that, was an expert turf digger. Heaney knows that he has no spade to follow men like them - he is a writer, not a farmer - so will dig with his pen. He will 'dig' into his past.

uses helps to convey his ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is blunt. It is only when we have read the poem carefully that we realise that all three generation are involved in digging: his grandfather dug turf, his father dug up potatoes, Heaney is digging up his memories and his past.
The verb formation which describes the time at which the action occurred, eg past, present or future.
as Heaney describes seeing his elderly father straining among the flowerbeds, then goes into the past tense when he remembers his father and grandfather at work. The last two stanzas return to the present, when Heaney realises that his work is to write. The final line, however, is in the future tense, to emphasise Heaney's determination -
Heaney remembers his own role in the digging: he and other children would gather the new potatoes that his father dug up, and he was responsible for taking milk to his grandfather on Toner's bog. It was this involvement that enabled him to watch his father and grandfather at work and describe their movements so precisely.
His father was clearly skilled at his work. Heaney remembers him
(line 8) and his boot and his knee fitted the spade perfectly (lines 10/11). He uses technical terms (lug, shaft) to stress that the spade is a precise tool.
""By God, the old man could handle a spade""
(line 15) is a simple, loving exclamation of pride.
He was also proud of his grandfather, who was so keen to work that he hardly stopped when Heaney brought him some milk. His work was precise -

(line 16) suggests not only Heaney's affection for his grandfather, but his father's affection for him too: the love between them bonds the three generations.
Heaney does not explain exactly why he has
""no spade to follow men like them""
(line 28). Do you think he feels he is not physically strong enough for this type of work? Or that he is no longer emotionally equipped for it, having broken the family tradition of working the land? Does he fear his grandfather and father might not approve of his having left the land?

His pen becomes a metaphorical spade. This suggests that his pen is his tool, just as the spades were tools for his father and grandfather. It also suggests that Heaney wants to 'go back to his roots' - to dig into his past through his writing.

of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
in a regretful tone, because Heaney is not outside digging too, and feels he somehow ought to be?
in a proud tone, as Heaney is displaying the skills of his father and grandfather for everyone to appreciate?
in a loving tone, as if the poem is a gift to his father and grandfather?
Well, Heaney's description of his father and grandfather is very loving. He values his sense of connection with them, and he is clearly very proud of the work they did, even though he has
them. Far from regretting his break with the family's traditional work on the land, Heaney asserts that he is continuing their work, by digging with his pen.
The ideas in this poem concern our relationship to our forebears, and to work. Heaney describes his relationship to his father and grandfather purely in terms of their work on the land. He takes the idea of digging, the commonest form of work in any rural community, and uses it as a

Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
There is a sense of Heaney's love of the earth throughout the poem. His father and grandfather seem to be in harmony with the earth; he himself, as a child, loved picking up the potatoes that the earth produced.
By God, the old man could handle a spade.
This reminds us that Heaney's father is now an old man, but also shows his fondness for him: old man is a common term of affection. Heaney is clearly proud of him too.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day / than any other man on Toner's bog.
Heaney boasts about his grandfather's skill - he presents him as a champion digger. Perhaps the young Heaney boasted as a child to his friends about his grandfather's ability.
.. living roots awaken in my head.
These roots are both actual roots the grandfather's spade cuts through, and Heaney's metaphorical roots in the land and in his family. Even though he doesn't dig with a spade like his father and grandfather, these roots are still alive in his mind.
In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems deal with the bonds between the generations - in Clarke's poem a mother addresses her child, while in Heaney's a son talks about his father and grandfather.
Both poems make us think about the relationship between parents (especially fathers) and their children
But in Heaney's poem the relationship is very specific and particular, while in Blake's poem it is not so much a real father, as a symbolic one...
Both poems deal with the relationship between generations, and both describe hard, physical work
But the Old Mother is bitter about the drudgery which she must do; while Heaney's poem celebrates the work as creative.
In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other. The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas, and attitudes and tone
Compare Digging with two other post-1914 poems and one pre-1914 poem of your choice that present the relationship between a parent and child. How do the poets show the nature of the relationships?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Gillian Clark's Catrin, Seamus Heaney's Follower, and William Blake's Little Boy Lost/Little Boy Found.
What would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing Digging with each of these three poems.
Catrin is from mother to a child, while Digging is from a child to a father (and grandfather).
Catrin suggests that relationships between parents and their children are not always harmonious, but Digging shows no conflict.
Catrin explores how a mother and child are bound together through the actual birth; Digging suggests that different generations are bound by sharing the same occupation - Heaney, his father and grandfather all 'dig'.
Both of Heaney's poems show the contrast between his father as an old man and his younger self.
Both describe his expertise in farm work as a means of illustrating Heaney's admiration for is father.
In both poems, the young Heaney is present in the fields, but in Digging he was helpful, gathering in the potatoes, while he was a nuisance in Follower.
There is a determination at the end of Digging to work and explore the past, but there is a hint of frustration in Follower - today It is my father who keeps stumbling Behind me, and will not go away.
Heaney gives us a detailed description of his father and grandfather at work, but we are given no visual impression of the father in Blake's poem.
Blake's boy becomes lost as no father was there, which suggests he was irresponsible, but Heaney shows that his father worked hard to provide food for his family.
Digging suggests a close family relationship. Blake, though, shows the love of the boy's weeping mother and the ever nigh love of God.
Blake's poem implies praise of God ' the father' of us all, while Heaney's poem shows his personal love and respect of his father and grandfather.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

an application used to browse the Internet or view web pages
HTML is typically written (or generated) in two ways:
) editor, eg Dreamweaver, iWeb, SeaMonkey Composer etc
An editor like Notepad offers greater control over the code when compared to a WYSIWYG editor because each and every character that forms the HTML and the resulting web page is hand typed. The disadvantage is its a slow process.
The web page is designed, and the content written and styled, using a series of tools. The page can be previewed in the default browser from within the
applications serve a specific purpose, eg Microsoft Word is used for word processing
. This makes building a web page much faster because only a limited knowledge of HTML is needed as its automatically generated. However, the code can still be edited by hand.
Not all browsers render (display) web pages in the same way. Common browsers include:
a web browser developed by Opera Software
W3C is responsible for standardising HTML and releasing updated specifications that revise existing tags, introduce new tags and identify deprecated tags and should be the first reference point for any matters concerning HTML.

723,7531,"Ask your teacher to check your presentation for you before you learn it, or send it in to SOS Teacher.
As you learn it, keep breaking it down into separate headings or pictures until you have gone from a page of A4 to a small piece of paper with a maximum of 5 headings.
If you are talking about different subjects, draw them and try talking around the pictures. The more picture associations you can find, the easier your presentation will be to remember on the day.
Practise your talk with another person, or record it on to a minidisc or cassette, or onto your computer, and play it back. If you haven't been through the whole thing a few times, you won't know if you can remember all the points you want to make.

When a substance is described as impermeable it means that fluids, especially water, are unable to pass through it.
Over 150 rock outcrops called tors, formed by a combination of freeze thaw weathering and
Hydrolysis is the decomposition of a chemical compound when it reacts with water. It is an important factor in the chemical weathering of rocks.

, due to the combination of high rainfall and impermeable rock.
V shaped river valleys formed by the numerous surface streams. Valley sides are steep due to the resistant nature of the granite.
Contour lines are found close together on a map.
The land is at a higher altitude than the surrounding area due to the resistant nature of the rock.
Most of the large settlements, eg Tavistock, and Ashburton are found near the outskirts of Dartmoor.
An abandoned tin mine at Botallack on the West Penwith coast of Cornwall
. Kaolin, also known as china clay, is a product of hydrolysis and is used in ceramics and papermaking. The industry is very important for employment and the local economy.
. Granite blocks were used for dry stone walling, buildings and road stone. Many quarries are now abandoned.
. Dartmoor is a National Park. It is popular for walking, camping and pony trekking and over 10 million people a year visit the area.
. The soils are poor and acidic, and frequently used for sheep farming rather than growing crops.
. Copper and tin mining used to be common. The metals were found in thin 'veins' within the granite.
Quarrying, mining and china clay extraction can leave scars on the landscape. This makes it less attractive for both tourists and locals.
Tourism causes pollution and congestion on the roads. Tourist activities can sometimes lead to conflict with locals.
Tourists buying second homes pushes property prices up which means locals cannot afford to buy. Rural poverty is becoming a problem in areas such as Dartmoor.

725,4189,"Chemistry usually works with materials on a large scale. Even just a gram of a chemical consists of millions of millions of millions of molecules and chemical reactions affect all the particles in the sample.
. The individual fullerene molecules or nanotubes have different properties from the bulk material.
The nanotubes structure allows it to be used as a vessel for transporting a drug into the body. A molecule of the drug can be placed inside the nanotube cage which keeps the drug wrapped up until it reaches the site where it's required. In this way, a dose that might be prohibitively damaging to other parts of the body can be delivered safely to, say, a cancerous tumour.
The structure of nanotubes involves a massive surface area. Spreading a catalyst, atom by atom, on the surface of a nanotube provides a huge surface area where reactants can come into contact with the catalyst.
The examples above might be described as molecular manufacturing or nanotechnology. Building a product molecule by molecule, positioning molecules one at a time or producing nanoscale features by removing matter from a bigger structure may enable us to do things which only a short time ago were undreamed of.

Points can be converted into vouchers that provide discounts on products or services.
Each customers' loyalty card has a unique card number linked to a
a structured collection of records or data stored in a computer system
which stores information about them (provided by the customer when they signed up) and their purchases.
Swiping a loyalty card is an example of
. Every time the customer visits the shop the card is swiped, reading the unique number. This identifies the customer whose points total, stored in the database, is then updated. The tills use barcodes to identify each item bought.
When a customer signs up they provide basic details such as their name and address.
Loyalty cards provide companies with information about customer spending habits. This information can be used to target customers generally or specifically.
If customers frequently buy bread and milk together, these items may be put nearby each other for customer convenience or, farther apart forcing the customer to walk through the entire store (in the hope they buy additional items along their way).
If a customer frequently buys beans, vouchers offering money off beans will be sent to them (further increasing their loyalty), rather than for products they rarely buy.
Can be used to send out tailored advertisements. For example, someone who regularly buys garden magazines might be sent special offers on garden products.
When customers sign-up they provide their address. This information can be used to see where the customers come from and identify opportunities for new stores.

728,2044,"Giant covalent structures contain a lot of non-metal atoms, each joined to adjacent atoms by
A covalent bond between atoms forms when atoms share electrons to achieve a full outer shell of electrons.
. The atoms are usually arranged into giant regular
A lattice is a regular grid-like arrangement of atoms in a material.
- extremely strong structures because of the many bonds involved. The graphic shows the molecular structure of diamond and graphite: two
Allotropes are structurally different forms of an element. They differ in the way the atoms bond with each other and arrange themselves into a structure. Because of their different structures, allotropes have different physical and chemical properties.
of carbon, and of silica (silicon dioxide).
From left to right - graphite, diamond, silica
- Substances with giant covalent structures have very high melting points, because a lot of strong covalent bonds must be broken. Graphite, for example, has a melting point of more than 3,600C.
To allow electricity, heat or other energy forms to pass through.
Sub-atomic particles, with a negative charge and a negligible mass relative to protons and neutrons.
, so it does conduct electricity. Silicon is semi-conductive - that is, midway between non-conductive and conductive.
Graphite is a form of carbon in which the carbon atoms form layers. These layers can slide over each other, so graphite is much softer than diamond. It is used in pencils, and as a
A substance used to reduce the friction between two solid surfaces.
. Each carbon atom in a layer is joined to only three other carbon atoms. Graphite conducts electricity.
Diamond is a form of carbon in which each carbon atom is joined to four other carbon atoms, forming a giant covalent structure. As a result, diamond is very hard and has a high melting point. It does not conduct electricity.
Silica, which is found in sand, has a similar structure to diamond. It is also hard and has a high melting point, but contains silicon and oxygen atoms, instead of carbon atoms.
The fact that it is a semi-conductor makes it immensely useful in the electronics industry: most transistors are made of silica.
Structure of a buckminsterfullerene molecule - a large ball of 60 atoms
Buckminsterfullerene is yet another allotrope of carbon. It is actually not a giant covalent structure, but a giant molecule in which the carbon atoms form pentagons and hexagons - in a similar way to a leather football. It is used in lubricants.

729,5070,"To read a map you need to understand compass directions, grid references and the map's key and scale. You need to be able to find features when given a map reference. You also need to be able to describe a feature's location on a map by giving a map reference. From a map you should be able to pick out key information on natural features and types of human activity (eg, is this an rural or urban location?)
Maps are representations of the world. Maps are written by people called
the world. Maps contain information tailored to a specific purpose.
, for example, contains information that helps the reader get from one place to another using a vehicle.
will contain information of less interest to a road user, such as how the land in a place is used, the population density and the political boundaries that exist between regions, states and nations.
There are five fundamental things you need to be familiar with to read a map successfully:
Compass directions are vital for finding your way around a map. There are many ways to remember where each direction goes. You probably learnt a rhyme or a phrase to help you remember - if not, here's one now. Starting at the top and moving clockwise the directions on a compass or map are:

maps are divided into numbered squares. These squares can be used to give a place a four or six-figure grid reference. It is important that you know both
Easting are lines that run up and down the map. They increase in number the further you move east (or right). You can use them to measure how far to travel east.
Northings are lines that run across the map horizontally. They increase in number the further you move north (or up the map). You can use them to measure how far to travel north.
numbers along the bottom of the map come first and the numbers up the side of the map come second

Just like a key to a door, the key on a map helps you to unlock the information stored in the colours and symbols on a map. You must understand how the key relates to the map before you can unlock the information it contains. The key will help you to identify types of boundaries, roads, buildings, agriculture, industry, places of interest and geographical features.

Make sure you read the title of a map before you start to use it. This will give you a general idea about the information it stores. While it may appear a straight-forward thing to do, under exam conditions, it is easy to confuse different maps or not use the one that is most useful.
The scale of a map allows a reader to calculate the size, height and dimensions of the features shown on the map, as well as distances between different points. The scale on a map is the ratio between real life sizes and how many times it has been shrunk to fit it on the map.
The scale below is for a 1:50,000 scale map. At this scale, 1 cm on the map represents 50,000 cm on the ground (= 500 metres or 0.5 kilometres).
maps, the most common type of map in the UK, come in several scales.
Travel maps have a scale of 1:125,000. This means 1cm on the map represents 125,000 in the real world or 1 cm = 1.25km. These are used by drivers going long distances.
Landranger maps are 1:50,000 (1cm = 500m). These are useful for drivers going shorter distances.
Explorer maps are 1:25,000 (1cm = 250m). These are useful for walking and other outdoor pursuits.
Landplan maps are 1:10,000 (1cm = 100m). These show individual streets clearly and might be used by town planners.
You will be asked to interpret maps to find out specific information. Being able to distinguish between different types of land use on an Ordnance Survey (OS) map will help you interpret maps during your exams. Here are some things you should brush up on:
Make sure you can tell the difference between urban and rural land use. Start by looking at the key. Are the features in the key related to the countryside or to towns?
Look out for features of the urban landscape that are represented in symbols on the OS map. Start by looking at modes of transport (eg junctions of main roads, railways, ports and airports).
Look for rural features. Study the key carefully to see what different areas of shading on the map represent. For example, different types of farmland will be shaded differently.
Study the relief of the land on your OS map by looking for the
lines on a map joining points of equal height above sea level - thus representing the slope of the land
. Contours will show you where the hills (elevations) and valleys (depressions) are on the map. Contours will often show changes in height of 5 or 10 meters. The closer the contours are together the steeper the slope is. If the contours are far apart, you might be looking at a flat flood plain. On the map below the contours in square
are quite close together - indicating a fairly steep
Make sure that you know how to interpret different types of map. Read keys and grid references carefully.
When drawing maps be sure to include the following:
- stating what the map shows (eg land use or vegetation cover)
- so the reader knows what the symbols on the map represent
- showing which way is up (North)
- so the reader can translate distances shown on the map into distances on the ground
: In the case of map skills the internet is
. The best way to practise map skills is to use real OS maps. If possible look at a number of different types of map - this will help you identify urban and rural landscapes, different human activities and human influences on the landscape. It will also help you to spot the different natural and physical geographical processes that have taken place - the processes that you learnt about in the sections on rivers, coasts and glaciation.

The table summarises the main types of electromagnetic radiation and a typical use for each of them.
Unlike sound waves, electromagnetic waves do not need a substance to travel through. They can travel through the
of empty space. In a vacuum, they all travel with the same very high speed: 300 000 000 m/s.
A beam of electromagnetic radiation delivers energy in packets called photons.
The energy delivered by each photon increases with the
of the electromagnetic waves. This means that gamma photons have the most energy, and radio photons the least.
of a beam of electromagnetic radiation is the energy it delivers to a surface each second. This depends on how much energy each photon delivers, and on how many photons per second arrive at that surface.

(s)    CaO(s) + CO
, how much CaO can we make?
is 40 + 12 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 100
of CaO is 40 + 16 = 56
would yield 56g of CaO in this reaction. In the question we are told we have only half of that amount of CaCO
, 50g. So we will get half the amount of CaO, 28g.
mass of CaO we can make = 28g
Notice in this that 22g of CO
would also be produced, as 50 - 28 = 22

735,4962,"In this Revision Bite we are going to look at standard index form and zero, negative and fractional powers.
Adding and subtracting numbers in standard index form:
Convert them into ordinary numbers, do the calculation, then change them back if you want the answer in standard form.
Multiplying and dividing numbers in standard form:
Here you can use the rules for multiplying and dividing powers. Remember these rules:
To multiply powers you add, eg, 10
To divide powers you subtract, eg, 10
Multiply 2 by 3 and add the powers of 10:
If not, remember that you should first work out 36  6, then work subtract the powers of 10 (because it is division), like this:
) = (36  6) x (10
In the previous pages, we only looked at positive whole number powers. We can also find zero, negative and fractional powers. The rules below apply to these powers.

736,3960,"The worlds religions teach that God is good, and that God wants all people to enjoy a good life. Religious people believe that they have a responsibility to try to make the world a better, more equal place for everyone.
The world is a place where many people are poor and suffering, while there are some very rich people and institutions living more comfortable lives. People living in
often have a very low standard of living: they do not benefit from modern medical care, have few opportunities for education and little or no access to technology.
Religions teach that this is wrong; everyone should have the
opportunity to enjoy the wealth that Gods world has to offer
The First Article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says:
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
Freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people, the peoples of the United Nations have  determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.

738,3815,"Compare your answer with the hints below:
Both poems are about a harvest - yet in both, something happens to sour the happy atmosphere.
IClarke uses the mouse as a symbol of the weak and vulnerable in the world who are the innocent victims of warfare, while Heaney's poem shows the contrast between hope and disappointment. (His disappointment with the wasted blackberries reflects other disappointments in life.)
In both poems, the narrative is reflected in the structure - stanza 1 of Heaney's poem is about hope, stanza 2 is about disappointment.
Out in the storm, Whitman reflects on the violence of the natural world; Clarke is awakened to violence committed by man. However, both have nightmarish qualities.
Both are in the present tense, to add to the tension. Whitman's poem is a sonnet. The last syllable of each line rhymes, creating a dramatic effect. Clarke's is freer in form and sounds more like natural speech.
Clare's poem is very celebratory and innocent. There is no violence in the natural world he describes
...because there are no humans to cause it, unlike in Clarke's poem.
Again, both poems are from personal experience.
Both are about high summer: Clare refers to the hay grass, but it is for him something beautiful to look at rather than something with a purpose.
Like Whitman's, Clare's poem is a sonnet. We often associate sonnets with love, so perhaps his poem is simple an expression of his love of nature.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

Some knowledge of ancient Egyptian civilisation will help you to understand Egyptian medicine.
The Egyptian civilisation was the first of the great world civilisations, and the
of this society led to important spin-offs into medicine.
, with an organised government, laws and social conventions. This was a society in which people were wealthy enough to pay to take care of their health.
, which required temples, priests and rituals that included mummification. Their experience of mummification taught the priests about the workings of the human body, and some members of the priesthood evolved into professional doctors.
Further still, the Egyptians invented the skills of
, which Egyptian doctors were able to use to develop their ideas and record their cures.
The ancient Egyptians travelled and traded all over the known world, and brought back all kinds of herbs and spices, which their doctors then used to heal certain diseases. Most of all, they developed a wealthy way of life, which left them time for observation and reflection.
From their observations of the irrigation channels used by farmers to water their crops came an important medical development - the invention of the

, it is useful to know something about the author and what may have inspired her story.
Michle Roberts was born in 1949 in London. She had a strict Catholic upbringing and, as she grew up, came to disagree with the way her religion viewed women. In an interview with the BBC World Service, she said:
""We had to be forgiven for being women before we even began to try to be good, we had to get over having the bodies we had. This really pushed me into wanting to write as a way of opposing what was very constricting, and actually painful, in my life.""
Her family disapproved of her writing. In particular, she had a troubled relationship with her mother, although in recent years she has become close to her again. Roberts explores mother/daughter relationships in much of her writing.

Read the sentences that follow each advertisement very carefully. Try to get a clear idea of exactly what each sentence means.
Use different skills for getting the meaning of the text. For example, you can often guess the meaning of a difficult word in a sentence if you understand what all the other words mean.
You should be aware that many of the verbs in adverts, for example, 'on ne partagera pas, il sera, il faudra', are in the future tense.

742,3430,"Website designs vary from basic ones set up by users as a hobby to sophisticated designs that represent large international companies. Before designing a website, you should take a look at other websites to help you decide how your webpages should look.
You should also read the project brief carefully. Make sure you do exactly what the examiners want. There is no point in doing any more - if they say five pages, only do five pages.
Normally, on a website there is a title bar at the top, a menu on the left and then the main information appears in the big space on the right.
Stick to a simple, clear page layout
Try to avoid flashy things like sound, scrolling banners and animated text/graphics. These might look 'cool' to you, but, unless they are really suitable for the purpose and audience, they are more likely to lose you marks than earn you marks.
The examiners will be looking for a consistent house style throughout each publication you produce.
A good example of this can be seen on the BBC GCSE Bitesize website. GCSE Bitesize uses the same font, sizes and layout throughout the site. This gives a much more professional impression than constantly chopping and changing between different pages.
Ideally, you should come up with a few ideas for fonts, layouts and colour schemes and then test them on members of your target audience. Remember to include details of this testing when writing your reviews and evaluations. Always remember the publication has to appeal to your target audience!
Have consistent left-hand navigation on each page.
Don't have too much text on one page - people don't like scrolling down pages.
Break text up using bullet points, short paragraphs and tables. It's more difficult to read text on screen than it is on paper.
Keep graphics to a minimum. Graphics increase the page weight and increase the time pages take to download.
Take a look at the image below. It's a classic example of a badly designed website! Make sure you avoid using garish colours and patterned backgrounds.
Bright colours and poor quality photographs are not very attractive
Here are some important rules to stick to when writing text for a website:
Stick to a single font colour and size on your website. Try to stick to black text on a white or light-coloured background.
Arial size 12 is easy to read on websites. Try not to use a smaller sized font.
Remember the intended audience. Always test your website on users.
Do not use underlining on webpages. Users will think it is a hyperlink and get confused when it doesn't link to another website.
Keep it simple. Be consistent across the whole website.
Webpages need file names. This allows you and visitors to your website to identify each webpage.
There are several rules you need to stick to when naming webpage files.
Use correct file extension names, eg .htm .html or .shtml.
Do not use symbols, eg + & % in file names.
Do no put spaces in your file or folder name. Use either dashes (-) or underscores (_)
Name your files sensibly. Video_intro.shtml, video_movie.shtm are easier to identify than page1.shtml, page2.shtml etc.
Webpage file names should mean something to you and the user
Keep html, image, flash and other media files in separate folders.
Put images in a folder called images, put audio files in a folder called audio.
There should be an index.shtml file in the site folder.
Do not create folders that contain too many or too few files.
All screen-based publications are likely to need some images. The things to keep in mind when selecting images are:
For the current eportfolio, you are only allowed to use jpg, png, gif and tif. You may need to use a graphics package to convert the graphic to a suitable format.
If they are copyright images, you will actually lose marks for putting them in (you could email the person who holds the copyright, but this can take months to sort out).
If not, use a graphics package to re-size or crop them. Editing inside Powerpoint or a website package is likely to spoil the way the graphic appears.
Have you updated your list of sources?
Each time you add a graphic to a publication, you should update your list of sources.
Can you use some of your own graphics?
It's a good idea to create some graphics. This could be with a digital camera or by doing some original artwork on the computer.
How much memory do the graphics take up?
Remember your eportfolio has a maximum size so keep an eye on individual graphics to make sure they are not too big.
At all times, make sure the graphic is suitable for the intended audience and purpose.
Before creating a website, make sure you know the difference between relative and absolute links.
These point to where the file you want to link to is saved. For example, Jeff is saving his files on his school network. He has a file called intro.html for which the absolute link is:
Look at the image below to see the folders in which intro.html sits.
The problem with absolute links is that the examiner will not have access to your schools server. When your folder and files are copied across to the exam boards server, any absolute links will not work.
For example, Jeff hands in his folder called
to the examiner. In this folder is another folder called
. The examiner, therefore, has access to everything stored within the jeffd201 folder. Now look at the absolute link again - everything that has been handed into the examiner is in bold:
The part that is not in bold represents the school's server, which the examiner
Therefore, you must use relative hyperlinks (the part in bold) when linking your webpages together.
As you have read above, an example of a relative link in Jeff's folder is:
This hyperlink just describes where the file (intro.html) is relative to the current file  in this case, in a subfolder called webpages.
Relative links make it easier to type hyperlinks  youre less likely to make errors. Files can be moved from a local system (your school server) to another server (the examination board).
Remember that the examiner will not have access to your school server. Never refer to the server, or absolute address when you use hyperlinks.
Now look at the image below taken from the examiner's computer. Notice how Jeff's files and folders have been copied on to the exam board's server.
The absolute link for Jeff's file has now changed to:
But notice how the relative link is still the same:
It is crucial to thoroughly test your presentations and websites, as well as all the publications you produce.
First, check that all the links work. It is best to copy the website or presentation onto another device (like a memory stick or CD) and try it out away from the school network - this will show if you have used absolute hyperlinks by mistake. All the links must work before you submit your work for marking and moderation.
Secondly, test your publication with members of the target audience.
Listen carefully and improve your publication accordingly.
One good way of doing this is to prepare a checklist for the reviewer to fill in. Include questions like:
Was the information at the right level?
Finally, write the results of your tests in the review section of your eportfolio. Remember to say how well your publication meets the needs of the audience and include ideas on how it can be improved.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a computer language. HTML is used to make webpages. Many software packages such as Dreamweaver and Homesite allow you to build webpages and save them as html files.
The websites listed below offer HTML tutorials and advice for building your first website.
Practise your HTML in this online text editor with examples and tutorials.
This site is a bit patronising but is a good source of basic information
Images on websites can improve the look and style of the page. However, you must be careful to save images in the correct format.
The two main formats for web images are gif and jpg.
These are used for images that have only a few colours, such as line drawings, text and logos.
Images with few colours should be saved as a gif file
These are used for images or photographs that include details and more colours.
If you save a photo or graphic in the incorrect format, how the image looks will be affected. Look at the images below. When the fish photo is saved in a gif format, colours and details are lost.
When the bitesize graphic is saved incorrectly as a jpg, unwanted colours appear and the looks less sharp. Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Cropping allows you to select the part of the image you want to show. It's likely that you may take a photograph or find an image that is too big and you only want to use one part of the image.
To crop an image, you can use image editing software such as Word, Photoshop or Paintshop.
1. Crop this image to include only the penguin.
A penguin surrounded by a large area of pebbles and someone holding a bucket
2. Select the crop tool in a picture editing package.
3. Use the crop tool to outline the part of the image you want to keep. Adjust the size of the area to be cropped by dragging on the boxes on the selection border.

747,6039,"There is no single way to calculate the level of development because of the variety of economies, cultures and peoples. Geographers use a series of
to compare the development of one region against another. For example:
Do the population have access to medical care? What level of healthcare is available - basic or advanced? Is it free?
A Less Economically Developed Country [LEDC] has low levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the southern hemisphere (eg countries in southern Africa, southern Asia and South America) are LEDCs, while more of the countries in the northern hemisphere are More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs].
focus on primary industries, such as farming, fishing and mining.
A More Economically Developed Country [MEDC] has high levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the northern hemisphere are MEDCs, eg UK, USA, Canada, Europe. More of the countries in the southern hemisphere are Less Economically Developed Countries [LEDCs].
focus on secondary industries, such as manufacturing. The most advanced countries tend to focus more on tertiary or service industries, such as banking and information technology.
Do the population have access to education? Is it free? What level of education is available (ie primary, secondary or further/higher education)?
MEDCs are countries which have a high
Standard of living of a person or a population is usually measured in economic terms, ie how much wealth they have. It also takes into account what there is to spend more on, ie the goods and services that are available for purchase. Life expectancy, literacy rate and other indicators may also be taken into account, when determining standard of living.
Gross Domestic Product [GDP] measures the wealth or income of a country. It is the total value of goods and services produced by a country in a year.
. LEDCs are countries with a low standard of living and a much lower GDP.
The map shows the locations of LEDCs and MEDCs. Most of the southern hemisphere is less developed, while countries in the northern hemisphere are more developed.
