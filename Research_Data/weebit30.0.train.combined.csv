4,595,"How do stinkbugs and burrower bugs send messages? They use plants like telephone lines! That is what a new study shows. The insects drum on leaves and stems. They also shake their bodies. That makes the plants vibrate. Other insects hear the vibrations.
To do the study, scientists watched 21 species of stinkbugs and burrower bugs. The scientists measured the tiny vibrations using a laser. They learned that different species have their own vibration patterns. Males and females of the same species have different patterns too.
A stinkbug uses a leaf to send vibrations to other stinkbugs.

season is here. A hurricane is a storm that forms over warm ocean water. It brings strong winds and heavy rains. The season lasts from June to November.

It happens when a hurricane travels over water. The strong winds push against the water. The water gets higher and higher. As the hurricane passes over land, the water pushes onto the shore. The rising water can cause flooding.

of a hurricane! The eye is the calm center.
Inside the storm, the hunters measure the amount of rain and the speed of the wind. Their work helps weather experts predict where the hurricane will go and how strong it will become.
The three pictures show how a hurricane forms.
 First, small storms begin over an ocean.
 Then strong winds make the storms spin around and come together.
 Soon, a hurricane forms. It spins around and around. Sometimes it moves over land and brings heavy rains and strong winds.

16,53,"When you smile, people can see your teeth and your gums. Experts say you need healthy teeth and gums. Teeth help you talk and eat. People need to care for their teeth. Turn the page to learn some ways to take care of your teeth.
Brush your teeth after every meal and before you go to bed. Use a soft toothbrush and a pea-sized amount of toothpaste. Brush all parts of your teeth and even your tongue! Brush with short back-and-forth movements.
Floss your teeth once a day. Dental floss is thin thread that helps clean in between your teeth. Use it to get rid of food you might have missed with a toothbrush. Have a grown-up help you floss.
Visit a dentist once or twice a year. The dentist will clean your teeth, take X-rays, and give you fluoride. Fluoride helps keep your teeth strong.

17,87,"Rain forests are in trouble. They are disappearing. For many years, people have been cutting down trees to make room for farms and roads.
Many groups are working to save rain forests. The forests are home to half the worlds plant and animal
, or types. Many of those species are in danger of dying out.
We have lost almost all of our worlds tropical rain forests, says Ashley Schaeffer. She is a spokesperson for the Rainforest Action Network. That group is working to protect rain forests. Unless we take action now, they will all be gone, she says. We are working with large companies to get them to stop cutting down trees.
Farmers have destroyed a large area of this tropical rain forest.

20,608,"Put on your party hats! February 12 is the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincolns birth. He was the 16th president of our country.
A big birthday event takes place on February 12 at the Lincoln Memorial. A
is something that keeps a memory alive. The Lincoln Memorial is a building in Washington, D.C., that honors Lincoln. There, Americans will gather to hear speeches about Lincoln.
Events honoring Lincolns birthday actually began a year ago. A giant birthday party was held at the Lincoln Museum in Kentucky. That is the state where Lincoln was born.
Statue of Abraham Lincoln sitting in a chair.
Since then, many other events have taken place across the United States. They have included poetry readings, plays, dances, and tours of places where Lincoln lived. Events will continue until February 2010.
Why is the country having such a big celebration? It isnt just because Lincoln was a great president, says David Early. Early is a spokesperson for the group that has been planning the celebration. Lincolns story could be anybodys story, he explains. He grew up poor on a farm and rose to become president of the United States.
When Lincoln was president, some people owned slaves. He worked to help end slavery. One of the things that makes Lincoln great is that he believed everyone should be treated the same, says Early.
If Abraham Lincoln were here today, what would you ask him? Why?

21,395,"Christopher Columbus was an explorer. Explorers travel to places to learn more about them. Columbus sailed the ocean on a ship called the Santa Maria. Look inside to learn about his travels.
Columbus lived long, long ago. People had to go to faraway places to get spices and gold. Those trips were long and hard. Columbus wanted to find a shorter way to get to those lands. He had an idea to cross the ocean. He found people to help pay for his trip. Look at the map above to see where Columbus first sailed.
Columbus and his crew left Spain in August 1492. They sailed on three ships, called the
. The trip was long and stormy. Just when the crew was ready to give up, they saw land!
Columbus didn't find a shorter way to those faraway lands. Instead, he landed on an island near what is now the United States. He named the island San Salvador.
Columbus began to explore that island. He met people who already lived there. They were called the Taino (TIGH-noh). Later, Columbus left the island. He continued to explore other places. After some time, he returned to Spain.
Why might Columbus's trip have made him famous?

24,408,"April 22 is Earth Day. That day reminds everyone to take care of Earth, our home. Many of Earth's animals are in danger of losing their homes. The pika (PEE-kah) is an animal whose habitat is in danger. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal or a plant lives.
Earth's temperature is rising, and people are using land where animals live.
are related to rabbits. Some kinds of pikas live on the rocky slopes of mountains. These animals prefer cool weather. As Earth heats up, they must move to cooler places higher in the mountains.
make their nests in the holes of rain forest trees. People are cutting down those trees and using the land for farms. Macaws are running out of trees in which to make their nests.
live in the Arctic. They live on large pieces of sea ice. As Earth's temperature rises, the large pieces of sea ice begin to melt. If the ice keeps melting, polar bears will have nowhere to live.
live in the grasslands of Asia. Their habitat is shrinking because people are building towns in places that used to belong to the tigers. Now these big cats have fewer grassland areas to call home.
Tigers are among the animals losing places to live.
Scientists say Earth is getting warmer because of pollution in the air. They are working to protect animal habitats.
Take short showers to save water and energy.
Dispose of trash properly. Recycle plastic, glass, paper, and metal.
Turn off electrical appliances when you are not using them.

26,16,"More animals live in cold waters near the South Pole than people once thought. Scientists recently found more than 1,000 types of ocean animals around a group of Antarctic islands! Until now, most people believed cold waters didnt contain as much life as warmer waters.
A diver studies ocean animals near the cold South Pole.
How did scientists make the discovery? They wore scuba gear and dived into the freezing waters. They also used nets to catch marine animals nearly a mile down in the water. This is the first time scientists have managed to make a list of all the animal types living at a place near the South Pole, says scientist David Barnes.
Why might it be useful for scientists to know which types of ocean animals live near the South Pole?

28,317,"You probably know that exercise is good for your body. But would you run all the way across the country to show kids that exercise is healthful? During the summer, Stu Mittleman ran from California to New York in 57 days. Mittleman covered 3,000 miles, or about 52 miles a day, in his journey through 11 states.

29,460,"Scientists are hopping with joy. They recently found a new
, or type, of frog. It lives in Colombia. That is a country in South America.
The frog is very small. It is less than an inch long. Its skin is a golden color.
Scientists say the frog is part of a group called poison dart frogs. The frog's poison may injure or kill an animal that eats it. That is why poison dart frogs are so colorful. Their bright colors warn

34,183,"Experts rush to keep historic Venice afloat.
For many, Venice is the jewel of Italy. It is famous for its beautiful buildings, art, and
The canals, or waterways, take the place of roads. People travel through the city on boats. But this city, which attracts millions of tourists each year, is in danger of sinking.
Venice is located on the Adriatic Sea. The city was built on a series of small islands in a
A lagoon is an area of shallow water.
During some high tides, water floods the city. For hundreds of years, people have tried to keep water out of the city. Now a group of scientists has introduced a bold plan to prevent the city from flooding. And it means adding more water!
In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads.
Scientists say Venice is sinking about 1 1/2 inches each year. To save the city, scientists want to pump water into the ground through pipes. The team expects the water to expand the sand under Venice and raise the city.
Scientists behind the plan say the pipes will work. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnt done carefully.
Everyone, however, agrees that saving the city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose a tremendous part of [history],"" says Melissa Conn of Save Venice, a group that is working to save the city.
Venice is known as the City of Canals.
There are about 150 canals in Venice.
About 400 bridges connect the citys 118 islands.
Why might people want to live in a city that floods?

35,779,"Each year, 17 million people try to stop smoking. However, only 1 million quit. That's why the American Cancer Society has organized The Great American Smokeout and SmokeScream.
Mark next Thursday, November 16, on your calendars and get ready to scream. That is the day of the SmokeScream. It is a day when kids across the country can scream about the dangers of smoking.
November 16 is also the day of the Great American Smokeout. The goal of the Smokeout is to get people to stop smoking for the day--and maybe forever.
The SmokeScream and the Great American Smokeout is run by the American Cancer Society. The group helps fight
by teaching people about the illness and raising money for medical research. Cancer is an illness that can cause death. Doctors say that smoking can cause cancer and other illnesses that can kill.
The lungs are parts of the body that allow a person to breathe. There is no cure for lung cancer.

36,423,"On January 8, rescue workers tried to help save pilot whales in trouble. Pilot whales are actually members of the dolphin family. The whales were stranded on a beach off the coast of New Zealand. New Zealand is an island in the Pacific Ocean.
It is not uncommon for a large pod, or group, of pilot whales to get stranded. They are highly social animals that stay close together. ""The value of sticking close together at times brings the risk of beaching. When one whale beaches, the other whales may follow,"" said scientist Michael Moore.
Sadly, 120 whales died on the beach. But volunteers were able to rescue 39 of the whales. The rescuers poured cool water on the whales to protect them from the heat. They helped push the huge mammals back into the water. Then small boats led the pilot whales back to sea.

38,166,"The results are in! At the beginning of the school year, we asked kids: How much weight are you carrying in your backpack? More than 2,000 kids responded to our online poll.
Carrying packs that are too heavy may cause injury. Doctors say most third graders' packs should weigh no more than 8 pounds. The good news is that most of you are following that advice. More than 1,300 kids replied that they carry 8 pounds or less.
Still, some kids are very overloaded. Of the kids polled, 465 told us they lugged around more than 12 pounds! If that is true for you, it may be time to clean out your backpack and lighten up!

40,83,"Taking those first baby steps is very excitingespecially for a robot. For years, scientists have worked to create a robot that could walk in a humanlike way. That time has finally arrived!
This February, scientists unveiled three robots that can walk like humans. The robots swing their arms for balance, as people do. The new robots require far less power than earlier versions did.
Toddler is the most advanced of the three. It learns to walk like a
, or a young child. Its balance improves with each step.
The walking robots are more than just toys. In the future, robots like these may be used to perform dangerous space missions. The discoveries could also help scientists develop better robotic limbs for people who have lost their arms or legs.

49,417,"The United States is sometimes called a ""melting pot."" It got this nickname because people from all over the world have come here to live. A recent government report says more people from Latin American and Asian countries are living in the United States than ever before.
The U.S. Census Bureau counts all the people who live in the United States every ten years.
The world map shows the areas where the most immigrants who live in the United States came from between 1990 and 1999, according to the Census Bureau.
The Census Bureau's report shows that about 11 million Asian people live in the United States today. The report also says that 31 million Latin American people live in the United States.
Latin American people are from the countries south of the United States in Central and South America. People
or move from their homeland to another country, for many reasons. Some people leave their homeland to be with family members. Other people emigrate because life in their homeland has become too hard or dangerous. More people also emigrate today because traveling to other countries is faster, less expensive, and safer than ever before.
The Census Bureau says that the main reason people emigrate to the United States to start a new life.

. Actor and singer Jesse McCartney, 22, does the voice of Theodore.
student reporter Arin Soileau interviewed McCartney about the movie, which comes out December 25.
. Theodore ... was actually my favorite. Hes easy to like. Hes very friendly.
How long did it take you to make the movie?
It takes ... about six to eight weeks to record all the voices, but it takes the
[or people who draw the scenes] up to two years to animate all of the cartoons.
What advice do you have for kids interested in movie or music careers?
It is one of those things that ... doesnt happen overnight. You have to put a lot of time into it. Its an amazing experience. Its also a lot of hard work.
I love to cook. I [also] love classic cars.

51,273,"Nicole the shark set a world record for her swim distance and speed.
A great white shark named Nicole has taken a bite out of the record books. She swam farther than any other known sharkmore than 12,400 miles!
Great whites are endangered. They are often hunted for their teeth and fins.
The great white shark swam from South Africa to Australia and back within nine months. That is also the fastest
of any ocean animal. When an animal migrates, it moves from one region to another.
The map shows Nicoles route between South Africa and Australia.
Nicole was one of 25 great whites that scientists tagged in 2003. The tags record information such as time and speed. Scientists are using what they learn to find ways to protect these endangered animals.
""Its clear that we have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg; there is still much to learn,"" says lead researcher Ramn Bonfil.

52,569,"Wiffle ball has become a favorite backyard game through the years. This year, the famous plastic ball turns 50!
The Wiffle ball was invented in 1953. A few years later, the yellow plastic bat became part of the game.
A Connecticut man got the idea for the Wiffle ball after watching his son play ball with a friend. ""He decided he wanted to make a ball that would make it easier for us to pitch,"" said his son.
The Wiffle ball is hollow and has eight holes on one side. In the air, the ball dips and curves. That makes it hard for a batter to hit.
How did the ball get its name? When a kid swung at a ball and missed, kids used to say he or she had whiffed, said the inventor's grandson.

53,202,"A filmmaker spies on polar bears in the Arctic.
A huge polar bear walks across the ice. Everything around it is quiet. Suddenly, a smaller bear approaches. It swings at the larger creatures chest. The two animals fall to the ground in a playful wrestling match.
Little do they know, theres a camera hidden in the snow nearby. It is capturing the bears every move. The recorder was placed there by John Downer (above). He filmed polar bears in the Arctic. That is the snowy place at the northernmost part of the world.
Downer is giving people a chance to see polar bears as they never have before. He recently shared his footage with the public. [This film helps] you ... understand what it is like to be an animal, Downer told
A polar bear trails behind a camera.
how bears act. To reveal is to show. The cameras recorded rare images, such as newborn cubs leaving a
for the first time. A den is a home.
as ice and snow. To disguise something is to make it look like something else. One recorder is called the snowball cam. It looks like a giant snowball.
Downers cameras did more than just take super shots. They also showed the dangers polar bears face. The sea ice that polar bears stand on to hunt is melting. That makes it harder for the animals to catch food in the water, scientist Geoff York told
York and other wildlife experts hope Downers film will make people want to help the creatures. We [need to act now] so polar bears still have a place to live, York says.
The United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden have land in the Arctic.
Temperatures in the Arctic can range from -76 degrees to 86 degrees Fahrenheit.
Many people who live in the Arctic are Inuit. They are
, or local, to the area. About 150,000 Inuit live there.
How can people protect polar bears and other threatened animals in the Arctic?

58,19,"Beep! Beep! A small bus on the road is getting a lot of attention. It is a pollution-free bus that uses
vegetable oil as fuel. (When something is recycled, an old item is turned into something new.)
The veggie bus is meant to inspire people to vote on Election Day. A group of musicians from California came up with the idea. They are driving the bus from coast to coast to spread their message.
One of the musicians said, ""Our message is really simple. If everyone just voted, [the United States would] be a better country.""

59,93,"Snails may be slow, but they are helping speed up science. People are studying the way the animals protect their eggs. Some sea snails keep their eggs in a string of pouches. It is called a mermaids necklace (right).
The necklace is made of a material that is stretchy like a rubber band. You can pull it multiple times and it wont break, scientist Ali Miserez told
A rubber band snaps back into place. But the necklace gently returns to its original shape. That protects the eggs inside.
Scientists are trying to make such a material. It could be used to

60,676,"Hours before giant waves pounded coastlines in South Asia, many animals started behaving strangely. In Sri Lanka, elephants trumpeted frantically and fled to higher ground. Bats and flamingos deserted low-lying areas. Many other animals escaped unharmed.
Wildlife experts are amazed that many animals survived the tsunami. The series of huge waves killed thousands of people in South Asia and East Africa about two months ago. Experts say animals might have sensed the approaching waves and moved to higher ground.
""I think animals can sense disaster. They know when things are happening in nature,"" said an official at the national wildlife department in Sri Lanka.
Elephants' sharp senses may have warned them about the tsunami.
Other stories of odd animal behavior before the tsunami have also surfaced. Giant waves flooded low-lying parts of Yala National Park in Sri Lanka, uprooting trees and killing hundreds of people. Wildlife officials reported, however, that few animals died. The park is home to hundreds of animals, including elephants, monkeys, leopards, tigers, deer, and water buffalo.
In Thailand, elephants carrying tourists from Japan bolted for the hills, and other elephants broke free of their chains. In one fishing village, nearly 1,000 locals escaped safely after birds squawked madly.
Although some animals in South Asia successfully fled to higher ground before the tsunami, other animals were not as lucky. Many dogs and other pets lost their owners in the tsunami and are homeless, sick, and without food or water. Cows, goats, and other farm animals are also roaming aimlessly. Many of those animals are drinking polluted water. Rescue groups have been sending animal food and
to the area. Veterinarians are doctors who care for animals.
Why might animals have known trouble was on the way? Forget special powers. Instead, experts say that animals have better senses of hearing, smell, and sight than humans do. Those sharp senses help warn animals when natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes, are about to happen.
""It doesn't surprise me that animals had an early warning of the tsunami,"" animal expert Michael Dee of the Los Angeles Zoo told
. ""The senses of certain species are far stronger than what any human has."" Dee points out that dogs, for example, have a stronger sense of smell than humans and that cats can see better in the dark than people.
Scientists say that animals might have felt the vibrations from the earthquake that set off the tsunami. In addition, many animals, including elephants, pigeons, and dogs, can also pick up
. That is a sound that is too low in pitch for humans to hear.
""Elephants can hear or feel other elephants grumble up to 2 miles away, so they probably felt the earthquake,"" said Dee. ""Their first
would be to move away from the direction of the sound."" An instinct is a natural, untaught behavior or reaction.
Before the tsunami struck, animals may have started to flee because they saw other creatures running. ""Animals take their cues from other animals,"" said Dee.
How animals sense danger has fascinated people for centuries. Most scientists are quick to point out, however, that nothing has ever been proven.
Will animal instincts be used to create a warning system about natural disasters anytime soon? ""I wouldn't count on [it],"" said Dee.
In the meantime, animals are helping out in other ways. For example, elephants are assisting in the cleanup of areas hit by the tsunami.
Scientists say that elephants can pick up vibrations from earthquakes through their broad feet.
Elephants' toenails are in the skin and not attached to the toes.
Elephants' soles have sensitive foot pads that detect vibrations, such as those from an earthquake. That signals elephants to move to more stable ground.
In what other ways might animals' sharp senses be helpful?

61,438,"A new sports car is making waves. With the touch of a button, this convertible turns into a boat. It recently went for a test-drive, jetting along the Thames River in London, the capital of England.
Named the Aquada, the car can reach speeds of 100 miles per hour on land and about 30 miles per hour on water. The wheels pull into the car as soon as it hits water.
To avoid leaks, the car has no doors. Like a boat, the car requires drivers and passengers to climb over the side to get into it.
The new cars aren't cheap. One hundred are being built and will sell for $235,000 each at the end of the year.

62,787,"Condoleezza Rice is the first African American woman to become secretary of state.
After the November election, President Bush nominated Condoleezza Rice to become secretary of state. That is the highest job in the president's
Rice will make history as the first-ever African American woman secretary of state. ""The secretary of state is America's face to the world, and in [Condoleezza Rice] the world will see the strength, grace, and decency of our country,"" Bush told reporters.
Being a leader is nothing new to Rice. In 2001, Rice was the first African American woman to become national security adviser. In that position, she worked closely with President Bush and advised him on defense matters.
As secretary of state, Rice will advise President Bush on U.S. foreign affairs. She will serve as a top
. A diplomat is a person who represents his or her country abroad. Rice will also work with leaders of other countries on important issues, such as the war in Iraq and the rebuilding of South Asia after the tsunami.
Rice has overcome odds to make it to one of the country's top jobs. She was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1954, during a time when black people were
, or separated, from white people in the South.
Rice says her parents taught her that education was the best way to overcome segregation. At 15, she attended college at the University of Denver in Colorado.
Bush believes that Rice, a classical pianist and former competitive ice skater, is up to the challenge. ""It is an honor to be asked to serve ... my country once again,"" said Rice.
The president's Cabinet is made up of a group of leaders who are in charge of the 15 departments in the executive branch of the government. The president heads up that branch.
The Senate must approve President Bush's Cabinet choices. Not everyone agrees with the president's choices for those positions.

63,722,"Educators spread the word about slavery in the North.
Sojourner Truth is best known as an outspoken
someone who worked to end slavery. But what people may not know is that Truth was one of thousands of slaves in the United States who were bought, sold, and forced to do labor in the North.
""Many people are surprised when you talk about slavery in the North,"" Alan Singer, a professor of education at Hofstra University, told
""We associate slavery with the South, even though the biggest importer of slavesafter South Carolinawas New York City.""
Singer and other educators spread the word about slavery in the North. Although there were fewer slaves in the North than in the South, slavery flourished in New York City, northern New Jersey, rural Pennsylvania, and the shipping towns of Connecticut and Rhode Island. In 1771, slaves made up about 12 percent of the population of New York City.
Some slaves in the North were offered freedom to fight for the British during the Revolutionary War (17751783). However, slavery wasnt abolished in the United States until the end of the Civil War (18611865). New Jersey, for example, reported 18 slaves in 1860.
Singer explains that the slave trade helped support the
in many major Northern cities, such as Boston and New York City. The Industrial Revolution was a rapid change in the economy in the 1800s, when factories and powerdriven machines were introduced. Many U.S. businesses got their start with profits from the slave trade and slave-produced goods.
Singer tells students that the effects of slavery linger today through racial prejudice and discrimination. ""Kids see slavery as something that happened in the deep past. I want children to know that we still live with the effects of that slavery society.""
Isabella Baumfree (17971883) was born one of 13 children but never got to know her siblings because they were sold into slavery. She was emancipated, or freed, in 1828. In 1843, she changed her name to Sojourner Truth. She traveled throughout New England and the Midwest, speaking publicly against slavery and in favor of womens rights.

64,523,"Gordon Zwicky knows how to tell a tall tale. He is a champion liar. Zwicky recently beat 299 contestants from the United States and Canada to win the Burlington Liar's Club contest.
To win the contest, Zwicky, who lives in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, told a tall tale about a trip he took to Florida with his wife.
He said that he had won the lottery and decided to drive to Florida. A friend had warned him to read traffic signs carefully and he wouldn't have any problems.
Shortly after setting out on the trip, Zwicky saw a sign that said, ""Clean Restrooms Ahead."" He arrived in Florida two months later--after cleaning 450 restrooms.

The Poseidon Undersea Resort is expected to open late next year. In the hotel's most expensive rooms, guests will be able to watch ocean life outside their windows. Visitors won't need to dive to their accommodations. They can reach their rooms from a tunnel on the beach.

66,779,"Is Atlantis a myth? For centuries, people have wondered whether this legendary land really existed. A
is a made-up tale that is often accepted as truth. Now an American scientist claims he has discovered the remains of Atlantis on the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.
According to the age-old myth, Atlantis was a place of great wealth. The ancient kingdom gleamed with gold and silver and was a center for art and learning.
Over time, the people there became corrupt and greedy. As punishment, the gods unleashed powerful earthquakes and floods that swallowed up Atlantis and sank it to the ocean floor.
The only account of this legendary lost land comes from the long-ago writings of Plato. He was an ancient Greek writer who lived about 2,500 years ago. People don't know how much of Plato's text is factual, because he wrote about an event that had happened 9,000 years before his time.
Robert Sarmast, the American scientist behind the recent claim, performed sonar tests of the Mediterranean seafloor. Sonar tests use sound waves to find underwater objects.
Sarmast believes that he has found Atlantis in the Mediterranean Sea, between Syria and Cyprus.
Sarmast says his tests revealed human-made walls and structures that matched Plato's description. ""If you compare [my findings to Plato's description], you will be astonished,"" Sarmast told reporters. ""We hope that future expeditions will bring back physical proof.""
A scientist from Germany says the newly found ruins are underwater volcanoes that spewed mud, not the remains of Atlantis. Other scientists say the only location for Atlantis was Plato's imagination.
, or unsure, that the remains are those of Atlantis. Sarmast and his team are not the first researchers to believe that they have discovered the
, or sunken, land. Some of those explorers have placed it off Spain's coast, near Cuba, southwest of England, and in the South China Sea.
Plato wrote about Atlantis as an island in the western sea. Many people believe that location meant the Atlantic Ocean.
, or idea, is that the story of Atlantis refers to the ancient Minoan (mih-NOH-ehn) people. They lived on the islands of Crete and Thira, between Greece and Turkey.
Do you think Atlantis was real or a myth?
That civilization disappeared following volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Plato might have based his writings on that event. Even today, the mystery of Atlantis grows stronger and continues to

67,1,"If you want to see the biggest ball of twine, the largest doughnut, the largest model elephant, or just about any other wacky thing, you have to take a road trip.
America's roads are lined with some of the wackiest attractions you will ever see. The earliest roadside attractions opened at about the time people bought the first cars.
Today, more people than ever are hitting the road and traveling by car. Many of those people are parking their cars in front of bizarre roadside attractions.
If one of the attractions doesn't meet your expectations as the biggest, longest, tallest, or best something, just drive a little farther.
What are some of these wacky wonders? If you are ever in Cawker City, Kansas, drop by to see the world's largest ball of twine. The ball is made of 7 million feet of twine and weighs 17,320 pounds. And it's still growing.
If you're tired of riding in the car, you might want to stop in Holbrook, Arizona. There, you can sleep in a motel room shaped like a teepee.
After a restful night in a teepee, you could go to Margate, New Jersey. There, you'll find Lucy the Elephant. Lucy isn't just any old elephant. She's a six-story-high model of an elephant that was built in 1881.
So don't miss out on the wacky fun. Take a road trip with your family, and see what amazingly strange things you can find along the roadside.

69,769,"Police officers in several towns in Massachusetts are pulling drivers over and giving them presents.
The officers have started Buckle Up for Bucks, a program that rewards people who wear their seat belts. Officers reward people who wear seat belts by handing out doughnuts and raffle tickets for savings bonds.
""It works,"" said police officer John Janulewicz. ""If we can get them [people] in the habit of buckling up, it will reduce injuries."" The police say the number of people who wear seat belts has gone up by 10 percent.

70,678,"These days, almost everyone seems to have a cell phone. Last year, 128 million people had cell phone service. More and more people sign up every day.
Many people keep their cell phones for only a short time. On average, people throw away their cell phones after 18 months.
According to a new report issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, old cell phones could harm the environment. By 2005, people in the United States will throw away 130 million phones a year. That's 65,000 tons of phones!
""[Throwing away cell phones] is becoming a very serious problem because the amount of cell phone waste is growing,"" said one of the writers of the report.
Environmental experts worry that the chemicals in cell phone batteries could pollute the environment. They want the companies that make cell phones to use fewer poisonous chemicals to make the phones.

71,687,"While surfing, Matt Kraskiewicz, age 17, felt something tug on his leg. ""It was like someone dropped a weight on my foot,"" he said. That weight was a shark taking a bite out of Matt's leg.
Eleven-year-old Taylor Holley was standing in waist-deep water when a shark suddenly bit his leg, leaving a 2-inch gash.
Should humans be afraid of sharks, or should sharks be afraid of humans? Debate this issue.
The above incidents took place in Florida during October. After reading such stories, many people might think that they should not swim in Florida's waters. But shark experts say that would be an overreaction. As scary as they are, shark attacks are rare.
The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) says you are more likely to be hit by lightning than be bitten by one of the more than 350 shark species. In fact, each year about 500 people are hurt by lightning in the United States. In 1999, only 58 shark attacks occurred
Scientists say some species of sharks can live up to 50 years.
The largest shark, the whale shark, can be 50 feet long.
Shark skeletons have no bones. The skeleton is made of a tough substance called
Not all sharks are meat eaters. Basking sharks, for example, eat
, tiny plants and animals that float in water. As a result, basking sharks don't have teeth.
Shark Expert Rodney Fox explained, ""Sharks do not like humans; we are too bony. A lot of people who have been bitten by sharks have survived because the shark spat them out.""
One reason that shark attacks may seem more common than before is that more people are using shorelines for recreation, said George Burgess of ISAF.
Sharks that do bite humans have often mistaken people for other kinds of animals. For example, ISAF officials say sharks attack surfers wearing dark-colored wetsuits more often than they do anyone else. To a shark, the wetsuits make surfers look like seals, a favorite food.
Some shark experts say sharks should fear people, not the other way around.
One of the biggest threats to sharks, said Burgess, is
. Finning happens when a fisher catches a shark, cuts off its fins, and tosses the dead fish overboard. The fins are used to make delicacies such as shark fin soup.
Conservation groups are urging governments to protect sharks. During the summer, the U.S. House of Representatives acted to protect sharks when it passed a bill that could prevent finning in U.S. waters. In order for that bill to become law, the U.S. Senate has to pass it, and the president must sign it.
U.S. Rep. Randy Cunningham introduced the bill. ""We must end the harmful and wasteful practice of shark finning,"" Cunningham said.

72,521,"Hawaii is famous for its fiery volcanoes and rivers of lava. According to legend, those volcanoes were created by the goddess Pele, who made the fiery mountains by driving her digging stick into the ground.
Such legends are important to native Hawaiians. Today, however, ancient gods are a part of a fiery debate in this land of spirits.
Mauna Kea is an extinct, or dead, volcano on the island of Hawaii. According to an ancient Hawaiian saying, Mauna Kea ""is the astonishing mountain that stands in the calm."" These days the 13,700-foot-high peak is anything but calm.
, scientists who study space, say the mountain peak is a perfect spot to place telescopes.
Currently, scientists use 13 telescopes in a special 11,000-acre area called the Science Reserve on Mauna Kea. Using those telescopes, scientists have made several important astronomical discoveries. The scientists who use the telescopes pay a fee to the University of Hawaii, which built the observatories.
The use of the mountain for scientific research, however, is the source of a debate between scientists and some native Hawaiians. Some Hawaiians believe that the top of Mauna Kea is sacred, or an important place to their religion. They believe that the peak is the home of the snow goddess Poli'ahu.
According to officials at the Center for Hawaiian Studies, the university is making money from the site without sharing much of the money with native Hawaiians.
""We don't get a penny from Mauna Kea, and it's our land,"" said Jon Osorio, of the Center for Hawaiian Studies.
University officials say that a master plan, completed in June, addresses native Hawaiian concerns. The goals of the plan include educating people about Mauna Kea. It also states how many telescopes the university can build in the future.
According to observers, the debate will not end soon. A 1968 agreement gives the university control of the area until 2033. Until then, native Hawaiians will fight for what is theirs while scientists keep studying the skies.

73,54,"In the summer of 2004, Olivia Till, a student at Courtland Elementary School in Virginia, cut off a foot of her light brown hair. She donated her ponytail to Locks of Love. The Florida-based organization provides wigs to children who have lost their hair because of illness. Some children have lost their hair from cancer treatments.
Olivia, then a fourth grader, felt proud of herself for making the donation, but she wanted to do more. So she asked her principal, Sherri Steele, if she could organize a schoolwide cut-a-thon for the program.
Her principal liked the idea so much that she decided to donate her own hair as well. ""I've never had short hair in my life, so this was a personal challenge for me,"" Steele told
This past spring, a group of 29 students and teachers cut off their hair for donation to Locks of Love. Now a fifth grader, Olivia is planning to hold a second cut-athon in her school in December. She hopes her hair is long enough for another donation. What's her advice to others? ""Start something in your school or your community,"" Olivia told

74,648,"Coins were available for buying and selling at the World's Fair of Money.
Collectible coins and currency worth about $1 billion were on display at the World's Fair of Money. The fair was held this August in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
During the five-day event, money was displayed for looking at, buying, and selling. Some coins were worth as little as half a cent. Other coins were worth millions.
The event drew thousands of coin lovers from around the world. That's not surprising--coin collecting is one of the world's most popular hobbies.
, or a way to make money in the future. Most collectors, however, are not in it for the money. They participate in the hobby because of each coin's story. One coin expert referred to money as ""history that you can hold in your hand.""
Among the fair's most valuable coins were two Liberty Head nickels. The nickels were worth between $2 million and $3 million each.
A 1794 coin couldn't be missed at the fair either. Experts say the coin, believed to be the first silver dollar in the United States, is worth about $10 million.
Coin hobbyists point out that just because a coin is old doesn't necessarily mean it's valuable. A coin's worth depends on how many exist, on how many people want it, and on its condition.
Coin collectors are used to paying more for a coin than its original value. They say their hobby is worth every penny.
Each day, the government prints 37 million bills, worth about $696 million.
About 18 tons of ink per day go into printing those bills.
If you had $10 billion and you spent $1 every second of every day, you would go broke in 317 years.

75,352,"Fourth grader David Casey likes to surf the Internet. He finds information that helps him do his homework. He listens to music and plays games on the Web. He even talks with friends in chat rooms-at least he used to.
After David started getting e-mail from strangers, his parents limited what he could do on the Web. His parents wanted to protect David.
Now the federal government is trying to protect David and other kids. ""Kids need a safe place to go on the Internet. This [bill] is the nation's best chance to guarantee kids an online experience that is fun and age-appropriate from start to finish,"" said Sen. Byron Dorgan.
These tips should help you surf the net more safely:
Tell your parents if anyone asks personal questions.
Never meet with someone you know only through the Web.
In November, Congress passed a bill that created a special domain name for kids. The new domain name is
A domain name comes at the end of a Web site address. A domain name tells you about the people who run a Web site. For example, a domain name can tell you whether a Web site is run by a business, an organization, or the government.
Web sites that use the new domain name must be appropriate for kids younger than 13 years old. Web sites with the
domain name will not link to sites that have different domain names. The sites will not have instant messaging or chat rooms unless they are safe for kids.
David's mother says the new domain name makes her feel better about the Internet. She says she will still watch what David does on the Web, but she will feel that David is safer.

76,3,"How many moons circle Earth? Everyone know that Earth has only one moon. But in September, some scientist said they might have discovered a second moon circling, or
Scientist discovered a tiny object in a strange orbit around Earth. A space object that orbits another object in space, as the moon does, is called a
. The newly discovered satellite completes its orbit once every 50 days.
Because of the satellite's strange orbit the scientist first thought that it was a small space rock. As scientist studied the newly discovered object, they learned that it did not come from space. They decided that the ""new moon"" was actually from Earth.
Scientist now say the tiny satellite is actually a part of an old Saturn V rocket. The Saturn V was the largest rocket ever built in the United Sates. It was larger than a football field. The Saturn V launched the Apollo astronauts who went to the moon.

77,414,"The waters in the San Francisco Bay, off the California coast, are cold, choppy, and infested with sharks. But that didnt stop 9-year-old Johnny Wilson from braving the waves. The fourth grader swam the 1.4 miles between Alcatraz Island and San Francisco in just less than two hours. He swam to raise money for Hurricane Katrina victims.
Although Johnny trained for three months, the water was colder and wavier than he had expected. Johnny made it to the shore by telling himself, ""Im almost there. Im almost there.""
His classmates were waiting on shore, cheering ""Go, Johnny! Go, Johnny!"" When he came out of the chilly water, his father hugged him and said, ""Can you believe it? You did it!""
Johnny successfully made the trek that Alcatraz prisoners had dared to cross years ago. Alcatraz Island housed a prison from 1934 to 1963. In 1962, three prisoners escaped by swimming across the bay. They were never heard from again, so it remains a mystery whether they made it through the frigid waters to land.
Johnny didnt only raise more than $30,000 for his swim. He also reportedly became the youngest person to swim the distance from Alcatraz to San Francisco.

78,413,"Assur was once one of the greatest cities in the world. About 30,000 people lived there. A huge temple tower, or ziggurat, stood about 200 feet above the city streets. Assur (or Ashur) was one of the leading cities of Assyria, the center of a great empire.
Today, ancient Assur is in ruins. Desert sand has covered over much of the 3,500-year-old city. Now Assur faces a new threat: water.
Assur is located in what is now Iraq, a country in the Middle East. Many parts of Iraq are covered by desert. Water is hard to find in the desert areas. To increase the amount of water, Iraqi officials are building a dam on the river Tigris.
The dam will trap the river's water. As the water rises, it might flood Assur and many other nearby ancient ruins.
Scientists worry that floodwaters will destroy artifacts hidden beneath the desert sand. Assur has already been the site of some amazing discoveries.
Scientists recently discovered four hidden tombs at Assur. They found ancient coffins, gold, jewelry, and gems. They also dug up the remains of two ancient Assurian queens.
Scientists used modern medical equipment to study the queens' bodies. They learned about some of the medical problems the ancient queens suffered from. The bodies showed evidence of dental cavities, sinus infections, and poor nutrition.
Michael Mller-Karpe, a scientist who studies ancient Assyria, said, ""The Assyrian queens have just begun to speak to us, and we are looking forward to more answers.""
Mller-Karpe and other scientists worry that the new dam may keep them from getting more answers. Even if the new dam doesn't flood Assur, the rising water could damage the ancient city. Moisture could cause the artifacts to crumble.
""You can't save Assur if it's [near] a dam,"" said scientist Peter Miglus. The soil beneath the ancient city would soak up water like a sponge. The water in the soil would destroy what's left of ancient Assur.
For now, scientists are scrambling to uncover the secrets hidden for centuries in Assur and other nearby communities. Meanwhile, some people are looking for ways to save the ancient cities. ""We don't want the slightest damage to Assur,"" one Iraqi official said.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says that each year,
germs make as many as 20,000 people sick, and kill some people. The germs are often found in raw hamburger meat. Most people who are made ill by
get bad stomachaches that can last for a week.
According to the FDA, you should follow these rules to protect yourself from
Always wash your hands before and after handling any food, especially raw hamburger meat.
Wash all surfaces, such as counters and cutting boards, before and after raw hamburger meat touches them.

80,659,"History in the Making: Mercury 3 Rescue Mission
The Mercury missions were the first attempts by NASA, the U.S. space agency, to send a human into space. The rocket missions took place from 1961 to 1963. During the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union competed to build the best space program. That period was called the space race. Tia interviewed her grandfather, Clark Presler, about his role in the 1961 Mercury 3 mission, during which astronaut Alan B. Shepard Jr. became the first American in space.
What do you remember from your experiences in the Navy?
I remember being part of the pickup crew [aboard the U.S.S.
] when the first manned space capsule returned to Earth. It was May 5, 1961. The name of the [rocket] was the Mercury-Redstone 3.
What was the purpose of this mission?
NASA wanted to send a man into orbit and back safely. His name was Alan B. Shepard Jr.
The capsule reached [an altitude of] about 187.45 kilometers, which is 114.61 miles.
The orbit flight lasted only 15 minutes.
In the Atlantic Ocean, near Cape Canaveral, Florida.
How did you pick up Mr. Shepard?
Well, we lifted the capsule up on the chain. Alan was standing up on it, hanging on to the chain. He came out without a single scratch on his body.
At first, I thought this project would be easy, but after the interview I knew I had to learn what this was all about. So later that day I asked Grandpa to explain this to me. After that, it sounded a lot clearer, and it's fun having a member of your family actually do something, well, famous.

83,23,"Did you know that the average child will spend more time in front of the television than at school this year? That's according to the TV-Turnoff Network.
Beginning April 21, millions of children and their families across the country will trade some TV time for other activities. They will zap off their television sets for an entire week.
April 21 through 27 is the ninth annual TV-Turnoff Week. ""The idea of the week is to encourage people to take a break from TV,"" said Frank Vespe of the TV-Turnoff Network. ""One of the things we learn is that TV is taking away from other things that we might do for fun.""
The goal of the week, according to its organizers, is to help kids discover other activities they enjoy. Then kids may make lasting changes in their lives.
Health experts warn that too much television can have negative effects on kids. Children who spend too much time watching television often get too little exercise. They also don't perform as well in school as do children who watch less TV.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
1. This is the ninth year of TV-Turnoff Week.
2. Many kids like to watch TV.
3. TV-Turnoff Week lets kids discover other activities they enjoy.
So think about what you might do if you zapped off your television set for an entire week. Would you read a book? Head outside to ride your bike? Play a board game with your mom or dad?
""The limit is your own imagination and creativity,"" said Vespe.

84,89,"Fingerprint technology has a new home  in the cafeteria.
Talk about easy money! Students in Rome, Georgia, can now pay for cafeteria food with a touch of the finger. The Rome City School District has a new, high-tech payment system that reads students fingerprints instead of asking students to punch in codes or swipe their ID cards.
""The finger scan system is faster,"" Rome superintendent Gayland Cooper told
""This is the kind of thing that technology should help us with.""
Before the new system, students often lost their lunch cards or forgot their codes. In addition, the cafeteria lines moved slowly, often cutting into students mealtimes.
The new fingerprint scanner has sped things up. ""Our students have really enjoyed the new system,"" Narkissa Ware, principal of Anna K. Davie Elementary School, told
""When the lines move faster, the students have more time to enjoy their meal.""
Getting a students fingerprints into the new system takes 10 minutes. After that, the student can touch the scanner at the cashier counter. The students picture and account information then appear on the computer screen.
Although fingerprints are an easy way to pay for lunch, some parents arent happy with the new system. Some students dont use the fingerprint scanner because their parents dont like the idea that their childrens fingerprints are being scanned daily.
Cooper says that students still have the option of punching in their codes. He adds, however, that students fingerprint information is secure.

85,175,"Firefighters usually use water and chemicals to fight wildfires. But this summer, firefighter battling a wildfire near Jackson, Wyoming, fought the fire with a new weapon a chemical used in disposable diapers.
The firefighter sprayed homes that were in the fire's path with a special gel nicknamed ""green slime"". The slime, which doesn't burn, is made from the same absorbent chemicals that are used in disposable diapers.
The firefighter sprayed the gel on nearly 200 houses. Because the green slime doesn't burn, it protects the houses from the fire.
After the danger from the wildfire passed, firefighters used water to wash the slime away.

86,158,"Giant pandas get a new home at the National Zoos Asia Trail.
These lucky animals are getting some extra room to stretch out! Giant pandas at the National Zoo, in Washington, D.C., have a bigger home. The zoo opened its Asia Trail in October.
The zoos three pandas may be the stars of the show, but they arent alone. Six other threatened or endangered Asian species have new
or homes, on the trail. The animals with new homes are red pandas, fishing cats, sloth bears, Asian small-clawed otters, clouded leopards, and Japanese giant salamanders.
The $53 million makeover doubles the space for those animals. ""This is a giant leap forward for the National Zoo,"" says its director, John Berry.
The Asia Trail is part of a 10-year project to improve the zoo. Before the exhibit was
or updated, the animals lived in cramped quarters. Covering nearly 6 acres, the new area gives animals more room to roam and play.
""Visitors are treated to up-close views,"" says Susan Ades, head of the zoos exhibit design. ""You can see, hear, touch, and even smell the zoos science.""
The pandas are among the zoos most popular attractions. They draw huge crowds, which are expected to reach a record 3 million people this year. The pandas new habitat includes waterfalls and shallow pools, along with more rocks and leafy trees to climb. Fog machines even help model the pandas wet natural environment in China.
Along with the giant pandas, here are a few animals that capture visitors attention on the Asia Trail.
are the smallest of the worlds 13 otter species. They live in family groups of about 12 creatures.
are noisy, busy creatures. They grunt and snort as they pull fruit from trees and dig for termites.

87,677,"Imagine having a twin that you didn't know existed. For Tamara Rabi and her sister, Adriana Scott, it was like a fairy tale come true.
The twin girls, now 20, were adopted in Mexico by different sets of parents in the United States. As luck would have it, the girls grew up in the same area in New York and went to different colleges near each other.
A common friend insisted the girls were twins and put them in contact. The girls exchanged
e-mail messages. Tamara had to do a double take when Adriana e-mailed a picture of herself.
The girls were stunned to learn that they each had a sister. Tamara's adoptive mother was surprised, too. Adriana's adoptive mother was aware that her daughter had a twin, but that was all she knew.
Besides looking alike and being the same height, the girls have a lot in common. They love to dance, and both started lessons when they were young. Upon meeting her sister for the first time, Adriana said, ""It was a shock. I saw me.""

88,178,"Rosa Parks is arrested and fingerprinted again in February 1956 for breaking segregation laws.
Fifty years ago, one brave woman's refusal to give up her bus seat changed history.
Honor the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest and the start of the Montgomery bus boycott with our classroom play.
During the 1950s, the law in the South prevented black
people from having the same rights as white people. At that time, the South was
by law. Black people were forced to sit in the back of public buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, drinking fountains, and other public facilities.
Those laws made Rosa Parks angry. She was a well-known leader in the African American community of Montgomery, Alabama. For years, Rosa Parks had stood up to unfair laws against African Americans. She worked courageously with other African American leaders to change them. She also was one of the first women in Montgomery to join the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to fight for
, or equal rights under the law.
Rosa Parks had refused to move from her seat on city buses in the past. Drivers simply forced her off the bus. But 50 years ago, on December 1, 1955, her action changed history. She refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person and was arrested. Her arrest led to the Montgomery
. During the yearlong boycott, African Americans refused to ride public buses. As a result of the boycott and Rosa Parks's courage, the law was changed to provide equal seating on buses. It marked the beginning of the struggle to end segregation.
SCENE 1: Downtown Montgomery, Alabama, December 1, 1955
Rosa Parks, 42, boards a city bus on her way home from work as a seamstress.
At the time, buses are divided into two sections. The section at the front of the bus is for whites only. The section for black people begins five to 10 rows back. Holding her head high, Rosa Parks sits down in the first row of the ""colored"" section.
After the bus grinds to a stop, a few white people get on. They quickly fill the empty seats in the ""whites-only"" section. One white man is left standing. According to a city law, black people are to give up their seats in the colored section if no seats remain in the white section.
There are white people who want to sit down.
You know white people and black people can't sit in the same row. Are you going to stand up?
Then I'm going to have you arrested.
A few minutes later, two police officers board the bus and walk toward Rosa Parks.
Did the driver tell you to stand?
Why do you all push us around?
I don't know, but the law is the law, and you're under arrest.
SCENE 2: Rosa Parks's house, that night
Rosa Parks is released from jail on bail that day. She and other Montgomery civil rights leaders meet at her house to discuss the bus boycott.
For years, civil rights leaders have been planning a bus boycott to fight segregation. They are waiting for the right time and the right leader to spark the boycottand Rosa Parks is that person. They know Rosa Parks has the courage to stand up to segregation. Because most of Montgomery's bus riders are black, the bus companies will lose money if black people refuse to ride the buses.
I know one thing, I will never, ever ride another segregated bus againeven if it means I have to walk to work.
You have to stand up for what you believe in.
Rosa, how would you feel about making your arrest a test case against segregation? We may be able to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.
I don't like being in the spotlight, and I don't want to put my family in danger.
Rosa, this may be our best chance to fight segregation laws.
Good. In the meantime, we're going to boycott the buses.
The next day, community leaders meet to discuss the boycott. At their request, Martin Luther King Jr. agrees to lead it.
SCENE 3: Montgomery courthouse, a few days later
Rosa Parks approaches the courthouse steps with her husband for her trial.
The steps of the courthouse are packed with people. Some bystanders threaten Rosa Parks. Others shout their support.
Your place is in the back of the bus, lady!
Oh, she's so sweet. They've messed with the wrong one now!
After Rosa Parks and her husband manage to push their way into the courtroom, the trial begins. The bus driver takes the stand.
I politely asked her to move to the back, which is required by city law. She refused to listen.
Rosa Parks is not called to the stand. Instead, her lawyers speak on her behalf.
I find Rosa Parks guilty of violating the city law. She must pay a $10 fine plus $4 in court costs.
The crowd of supporters in the courtroom reacts angrily to the verdict.
You haven't heard the last from us.
Despite the boos from supporters, the guilty verdict was exactly what Rosa Parks and her lawyers wanted. Their case eventually made it to the nation's highest courtthe Supreme Court.
Montgomery's black community continued to boycott the buses. On November 13, 1956, their efforts finally paid off. The Supreme Court ruled that Alabama's segregated buses were against the law. After more than a year, the boycott ended.
At the urging of photographers, Rosa Parks boarded a bus on December 20. This time, she sat in the front seat. (See the cover.)

89,367,"The number of collisions between powerboats and manatees has been on the rise since 1976, according to the Save the Manatee Club. In that time, close to 1,000 manatees have died from collisions with powerboats. Thousands of others have been injured. In 2000, collisions caused 38 percent of manatee deaths in Florida.
To curb those collisions, Florida has already passed laws that limit a boat's speed to under 10 miles per hour in areas where manatees are found. Now, police are beefing up patrols and cracking down on waterway speeders.

90,592,"> Constructing triangles and bearings - Bearings
Suppose you were in the middle of nowhere, and there were no signs or landmarks to help you find your way. Would you know how to find your way home? Someone might tell you via phone or radio to 'walk to your left', or 'turn through 60 and then start walking', but how would they know which way you were pointing in the first place?
One way of describing direction from a point is to use
A compass always points north. Bearings are measured from the
So when someone tells you to walk on a bearing of 120, you should face north, turn clockwise through 120 and start walking.
The angle between the north line and the flight path of the aeroplane is 30. We say that the aeroplane is flying on a bearing of 030 from Heathrow Airport.
Click 'Play' to see the direction change in the diagram below. Click 'Pause' to see the bearing.
In order to see this content you need to have both
Bearings are always described using three figures. So for less than 100 put an appropriate number of 0s in front. Eg 020, 037, 002, 007.

""You're not going anywhere near that place. It's full of litter, it's never supervised and the equipment is a total health hazard! You'll have to find somewhere else to hang around.""
Write a letter to Mrs H Devonshire, Parks Department, complaining about the area and requesting that something is done about it.
Below are five ideas for paragraphs that you could include in your letter. They are not in the best order, so drag and drop them to improve the structure. Drag the idea into the best place in the table below:

97,51,"> Measures of average - Comparing distributions
Complete the following table. The data shows the scores in two tests, English and Maths, across a set of ten students.
In order to see this content you need to have both
If you were to compare the scores in the two subjects, English and Maths, which measure of average would you use and why?
The range of scores in English (37) is far greater than that in the Maths (4).
The mean score in each subject is 78 which implies that the scores of the students are more-or-less identical in English and Maths. But looking at the actual scores, you can see that this is not the case.
If you compare the medians (71 and 78), you might assume that the students generally scored less in English, (which is partly true, but there are also some much higher scores there too).
If you just state the modal score for each subject (101 and 78), you have no information about the scores of the other students.
So, which is best? It seems that to give maximum information,
a combination of the median and the range would be best.
So, in summary, English has a median score of 71 and a range of 37, and Maths has a median score of 78 and a range of 4.
How mean are you? Find out with this activity

99,502,"Everything is made from atoms, including you. Atoms are tiny particles that are far too small to see, even with a microscope. If people were the same size as atoms, the entire population of the world would fit into a box about a thousandth of a millimetre across!
We usually imagine atoms as being like tiny balls:
To make diagrams simpler we often draw atoms as circles:
There are over a hundred different types of atom, and these are called
. Each element has a special name. For example carbon, oxygen and hydrogen are all elements.
Lead and gold are elements too. A piece of pure gold contains only gold atoms. A piece of pure lead contains only lead atoms.
Chemical reactions join or split atoms to rearrange them. But they cannot change one element into another element, or anything simpler. A chemical reaction cannot turn lead into gold, becuse it can't change the atoms into different elements.

100,136,"> Fractions - Common factors and simplest form
Fractions - Common factors and simplest form
of a number are those numbers that divide into it exactly.
Numbers have common factors if the same number divides into both of them.
So 4 is a common factor of both 8 and 12, as it divides into both of them. 2 is a common factor of both 2 and 6, as it divides into both of them.
4 and 12 have a common factor (4), so
(divide the top and the bottom by 4).
2 and 6 have a common factor (2), so
(divide the top and the bottom by 2).
However, 1 and 3 have no common factors, so
cannot be simplified. When a fraction cannot be simplified we say that it is its

101,154,"> Inform, explain and describe - Describing
When you describe, you need to give lots of detail and make the words interesting for others to read. For example, if you wanted to describe your home, you wouldn't just write lots of facts, like this:
My house was built in 1972 of red brick with a pitched concrete tiled roof. The house was extended in 2003 with a small UPVC conservatory and an adjoining patio area of approximately 8 square metres...
This gives lots of facts, but these are the types of facts that someone buying a house might need. Most people would find a description like this boring. So what should you do?
The first thing is to think about what you want to show other people. Do you want to concentrate on the roof tiles or the types of bricks used? Or do you want to tell them about the fence panel your brother broke when he was chasing you last summer?
You could also write about the time Stephanie threw a tennis ball and it got stuck in the guttering - it's still there - and when it rains really hard the gutter overflows. You might even have a gnome in the front garden, which your grandad bought - it looks stupid, but you won't move it in case you offend him.
Each of these details is far more interesting than roof tiles or measurements. So, when you are describing something, think of drawing a picture or taking a photograph. You focus on a certain point, write a paragraph about it, then move to the next point and the next.

106,441,"We can see why variety is important by looking at this list below. It is taken from a story called ""You are now entering the human heart"", by Janet Frame, and is actually one of her paragraphs broken down into simple sentences:
None of them had ever touched a live snake.
They were waiting for the drama to begin.
The attendant took a green snake out of a basket.
He draped the snake around the teacher's neck.
She did not have a chance to protest.
He stepped back to admire the sight.
It doesn't really sound right. How could the writer change this to convey the drama of the situation? Look again at the sentences and decide what changes you could make, which ones you could join. Then click here to compare your ideas with the version in the book.
Her eyes faced the lighted exit. I saw her fear. The children, none of whom had ever touched a live snake, were sitting hushed, waiting for the drama to begin; one or two looked afraid, as the attendant withdrew a green snake about three feet long from the basket and with a swift movement, before the teacher could protest, draped it around her neck and stepped back, admiring and satisfied.
So the key points to remember about sentences are:
You should have a variety of sentences in each piece you write.
Complex sentences cause the most problems, but they can be the best for linking ideas and arguing your point.
Different types of sentence suit different purposes, so think carefully about what you are trying to do.
Connectives are a good way of linking ideas. They can provide a more detailed structure and help readers.
You write sentences all the time. Find out when and where to use them.

Graphs - The form y = mx + c
The equation of a straight line on a graph is made up of a y term, an x term, and a number and are written in the form of y = mx + c.
The slope of the line is known as the
All the points that lie on the blue line have a y coordinate that is the same as the x coordinate
We say that the equation of the line is
All the points that lie on the orange line have a y coordinate (the second number in brackets) that is one number higher than the x coordinate of the same line eg
In other words, the y coordinate equals the x coordinate + 1
So the equation of the line is
What is the equation of this line?
The co-ordinates of the points are (2,4), (1,2) and (-2, -4).
The equation of the line that fits these x and y values is y = 2x

Variation and classification - Inherited & environmental
Some variation within a species is inherited, and some variation is due to the environment.
Variation in a characteristic that is a result of genetic inheritance from the parents is called
Children usually look a little like their father, and a little like their mother, but they will not be identical to either of their parents. This is because they get half of their inherited features from each parent.
Each egg cell and each sperm cell contains half of the
needed for an individual. When these join at fertilisation a new cell is formed with all the genetic information needed for an individual.
Here are some examples of inherited variation in humans:
Gender is inherited variation too, because whether you are male or female is a result of the genes you inherited from your parents.
Characteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle. For example, if you eat too much you will become heavier, and if you eat too little you will become lighter. A plant in the shade of a big tree will will grow taller as it tries to reach more light.
Variation caused by the surroundings is called
. Here are some other examples of features that show environmental variation:
flower colour in hydrangeas - these plants produce blue flowers in acidic soil and pink flowers in alkaline soil.
Some features vary because of a mixture of inherited causes and environmental causes. For example, identical twins inherit exactly the same features from their parents. But if you take a pair of twins, and twin 'A' is given more to eat than twin 'B', twin 'A' is likely to end up heavier.

Astronomy and space science - Days and nights
as they orbit the Sun. It takes the Earth 24 hours to make one complete turn on its axis, so an Earth day is 24 hours long.
Different planets take different amounts of time to make one complete turn, so they have different lengths of day.
The Sun lights up one half of the Earth, and the other half is in shadow. As the Earth spins we move from shadow to light and back to shadow and so on. It is daytime in the UK when our part of the planet is in the lit by the Sun. And it is night-time in the UK when our part of the planet is facing away from the Sun.
During the day, the Sun appears to move through the sky. Remember that this happens because the Earth is spinning on its axis. In the UK if we look south and follow the path of Sun in the sky during the day, it looks like this:
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west
. That's because the Earth is spinning towards to the east, so we see the Sun first appear there at the start of the day. The Sun 'rises' in the east and 'sets' in the west.
One way to remember which way the Earth turns is to remember ""
"", which means the Earth spins from west to east.
Star trails made by leaving the camera shutter open during the night
During the night, we cannot see the Sun. But the Earth is still spinning on its axis. This means that the stars appear to move from east to west in the sky, just as the Sun does in the day.

Measures of average - Mean and modal class
Calculating the mean and modal class for grouped data is very similar to finding the mean from an ungrouped frequency table, except that you do not have all the information about the data within the groups so can only estimate the mean.
This table shows the weights of children in a class.
To estimate the mean weight, you know that 7 children are between 30kg and 40kg, but you don't know exactly how much they weigh, so assume that they all weigh 35kg (the midpoint of the group).
Do the same for all the other groups:
a) Estimate of mean = 1215  25 =
b) The modal class is the class that has the highest frequency. In this case the modal class is

Acids, bases and metals - Reactions of acids with metals
Acids react with most metals and a salt is produced. But unlike the reaction between acids and bases we don't get any water. Instead we get
This is the general word equation for the reaction:
The salt produced depends upon the metal and the acid. Here are two examples:
It doesn't matter which metal or acid is used, if there is a reaction we always get hydrogen gas as well as the salt.
There is a simple laboratory test to see if a gas is hydrogen. A lighted wooden splint goes pop if it is put into a test tube of hydrogen. This is because the flame ignites the hydrogen, which burns explosively to make a loud sound.
All acids contain hydrogen atoms. Apart from hydrochloric acid, this is not clear from their names, but you can tell they contain hydrogen from their chemical formulae. Remember that the chemical symbol for hydrogen is H.

Sometimes the instructions on the reading exam are in English - but be careful,they may not be as straightforward as they seem!
Read each situation carefully and think about what you actually need to know.
Read every choice all the way through. There might be a word or part of a word that you recognise.
Don't jump to conclusions! Sometimes a word like 'Oficina' can be used in a way that it isn't in English.

123,391,"The final thing to remember is there are lots of ways of answering the same question. You don't have to follow a set plan, or include things in a fixed order. It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters, dramatic effects, themes and language. Stick to what is relevant and don't be afraid to put a personal reaction in as well - it shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied ideas you have heard.
So, imagine our task is 'How is the theme of ambition dealt with in
?'. There are all sorts of ways of answering this - one answer might start with different aspects of ambition, another answer with the language of ambition and another with the dramatic effects created. However, try to plan the start of an answer using the character of Macbeth as the focus. Once you've done that, compare your ideas with the answer below.
'How is the theme of ambition dealt with in
One of the main themes in Macbeth is ambition and from the start we can see just how tempted Macbeth is at the thought of becoming king. He recognises his 'black and deep desires' but writes to tell his wife at length and is increasingly torn by a 'suggestion' that killing Duncan will make the witches' predictions come true.
Macbeth recognises where ambition can lead and the contrast between what he thinks he should do, and his inner thoughts. His language reflects this, using antithesis such as 'heaven or to hell'. In fact, his very first words are 'So fair and foul a day'. This repeats what the witches have been saying and it would be obvious to an audience in Shakespeare's day that Macbeth is already associated with the evil the witches represent.
There are many approaches you can take to the same question. This is only the start of the task and there is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction because it keeps to the point as well as using a range of relevant details combined with personal thoughts.

125,3045,"There were two types of water transport available in Britain before the 18th century - coastal shipping and navigable rivers. However, although both these methods were useful, they still had their problems, so something new was needed...
Bad weather was a risk of coastal shipping
, but ships could be affected by tides, winds and pirates.
Heavy goods such as coal and iron could only be transported by coastal shipping and not by roads.
Some rivers had to be widened and deepened for large ships
Rivers that were large enough and deep enough to link towns and cities in Britain were called navigable rivers.
The main navigable rivers in Britain were the Thames, Severn, Humber, Trent and Mersey.
rivers were widened and deepened by local communities
While coastal shipping and navigable rivers were useful, there needed to be a more effective form of transport than roads and the existing water transport. The main reasons for change were:
during winter and dry up during summer months.
did not always link the major towns
A rapidly growing population also needed a more efficient method of transport because
canals would be the next step forward
Read this Revision Bite and then attempt to write down the information that you consider to be
for revising the early problems with pre-18th century water transport.
As part of your revision, think carefully about the

A covalent bond between atoms forms when atoms share electrons to achieve a full outer shell of electrons.
. The atoms are usually arranged into giant regular
A lattice is a regular grid-like arrangement of atoms in a material.
- extremely strong structures because of the many bonds involved. The graphic shows the molecular structure of diamond and graphite: two
Allotropes are structurally different forms of an element. They differ in the way the atoms bond with each other and arrange themselves into a structure. Because of their different structures, allotropes have different physical and chemical properties.
of carbon, and of silica (silicon dioxide).
From left to right - graphite, diamond, silica
- Substances with giant covalent structures have very high melting points, because a lot of strong covalent bonds must be broken. Graphite, for example, has a melting point of more than 3,600C.
To allow electricity, heat or other energy forms to pass through.
Sub-atomic particles, with a negative charge and a negligible mass relative to protons and neutrons.
, so it does conduct electricity. Silicon is semi-conductive - that is, midway between non-conductive and conductive.
Graphite is a form of carbon in which the carbon atoms form layers. These layers can slide over each other, so graphite is much softer than diamond. It is used in pencils, and as a
A substance used to reduce the friction between two solid surfaces.
. Each carbon atom in a layer is joined to only three other carbon atoms. Graphite conducts electricity.
Diamond is a form of carbon in which each carbon atom is joined to four other carbon atoms, forming a giant covalent structure. As a result, diamond is very hard and has a high melting point. It does not conduct electricity.
Silica, which is found in sand, has a similar structure to diamond. It is also hard and has a high melting point, but contains silicon and oxygen atoms, instead of carbon atoms.
The fact that it is a semi-conductor makes it immensely useful in the electronics industry: most transistors are made of silica.
Structure of a buckminsterfullerene molecule - a large ball of 60 atoms
Buckminsterfullerene is yet another allotrope of carbon. It is actually not a giant covalent structure, but a giant molecule in which the carbon atoms form pentagons and hexagons - in a similar way to a leather football. It is used in lubricants.

127,3857,"We often use formulas without even noticing. For example, we might convert miles to km by multiplying by 1.6, or find the circumference of a circle by multiplying pi by the diameter.
km = 1.6 x miles is an example of a formula.
We have already seen that km = 1.6 x miles and C =
 d are examples of formulas. There are many others that we use regularly in other subjects. Sometimes we have to construct our own formula:
A taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00. Write down a formula for the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles.
Travelling 1 mile would cost 2 + 50p.
Travelling 2 miles would cost 2 + 2 x 50p.
Travelling 3 miles would cost 2 + 3 x 50p.
So travelling for 'n' miles will cost 2 + n x 50p.
The formula is C = 2 + (n x 50p)
A rectangle has a width of x and a length of 2x.
Write down a formula for the perimeter (P) in terms of x.
P = 2x + x + 2x + x
Did you remember to include all 4 sides?
To recap, the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles, when a taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00 is:-
C = 2 + (n x 50p)
To find the cost of the taxi for a journey of 20 miles, replace 'n' with 20.
C = 2 + (20 x 50p)
What is the cost of hiring this taxi for 16 miles?
Remember that C = 2 + (16 x 50p)
The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.
r, so we divide both sides by 2
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c
Rearrange the formula to make 'c' the subject.

128,1568,"There are four main stages in setting up a new computer system: Analysis - studying the problem; design - designing a solution; implementation - putting the solution into effect and testing it; evaluation - checking that the solution is working as intended. This process is often called systems analysis.
Developing and activating a new computer system is a long process. It is important to break the process down into smaller stages, each one requiring a different set of professional skills.
An important part of this process is the first stage -
. During this stage the systems analyst will investigate how the current system works and what needs to be improved. This involves finding out whether a new computer system is needed at all and exactly what it will be used for.
Analysis is all about looking at how a job is done at present and seeing if the job could be done better or more efficiently by upgrading or developing a new system.
With this goal in mind, the systems analyst might:
a step by step guide, eg a guide to using a piece of software including instructions, example scenarios and screenshots
and any printouts the current system creates
Having investigated the present system, the systems analyst will produce a
. This will look at whether the new system is:
- is the new system technically possible to implement in the time available?
- will the cost of the new system be offset by savings once it is implemented, ie will it save the organisation time, money or increase its performance?
The project will only continue to the next stage if the answer to both of these questions is yes. At this point the decision makers in the organisation, eg the board of directors, decide whether or not to go ahead.
The next step is to draw up a
that outlines exactly what the new system will do. For example, it will mention:
a general term used to describe an application or a program
the term denoting either an entrance or changes which are inserted into a system and which activate/modify a process
the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process
A test plan will be included in the design phase to explain exactly how the new system will be tested and the expected outcomes for each test.
a general term used to describe an application or a program
is usually very complex. Any mistakes made by the designers or programmer can have a dramatic effect depending on what the software is used for.
Usually software is tested with three distinct types of
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
 this is normal data the system should be working with.
 this is data at the boundary between typical data and invalid data.
Invalid data (sometimes known as erroneous data)
 this is data that should cause the system to tell the user that there is a problem with data entered into the system.
Testing helps to ensure that the system always acts as expected.
Implementation is the next stage of developing a new system, after design. This is where the new system is created and installed.
a list of instructions written in a programming language
a general term used to describe an application or a program
a resource - for example, a collection of documents containing all the information a user needs to know about using and getting support with a piece of software
testing the system using the test plan
If the tests are not satisfactory then any problems will need to be corrected and the system tested again.
User documentation will be written to help staff become familiar with the new system. It will include:
a step by step guide, eg a guide to using a piece of software including instructions, example scenarios and screenshots
the term denoting either an entrance or changes which are inserted into a system and which activate/modify a process
the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process
taking a screen shot of what's displayed on screen and saving it in an image file, eg as a *.jpg, *.bmp or *.gif
details of what error messages mean, ie troubleshooting advice
When the system is ready to go on-line there are different ways of moving from the old to the new system:
Running both the old and new system until you are certain the new system is working correctly. Parallel running is likely to be the most expensive as it involves doing the work twice for a period of time. However, it is the safest. If there are any bugs in the new system, you can always go back to the old system while the problems are corrected.
Changing over in a small part of the company to start with. Only when the system is deemed satisfactory will it be rolled out to the rest of the organisation. A supermarket introducing a new 'self-scanning' system might choose to introduce it in two or three stores at first. This is a pilot changeover.
The old system is scrapped and immediately replaced by the new system. With this option there is a danger that there may still be problems with the new system. Even though it is the most risky type of changeover, many companies use this method.
The change over is split into phases or stages. Each stage is introduced one at a time and the old system is kept running to do the remainder of the tasks that have not yet been changed.
Once the system has been installed it will be monitored to check whether it is working correctly. Sometimes problems with a system will not be found until it is being used by a large number of people or an unusual situation occurs.
Evaluation is really re-analysing - starting the same systems analysis process all over again. Many of the same techniques can be used, such as interviewing staff or sending out questionnaires.
Once a system is running correctly it can still need maintenance. This may be because a bug is found or because the company needs a new feature.

When you are required to fill in word gaps in your exam, remember to begin by filling in the easiest of the gaps, so that when you get to the harder ones you have fewer words to choose from.
Read the sentences with the gaps very carefully, word by word, so you know exactly what they mean.

131,7593,"This Revision Bite will give you practice in creating and structuring a presentation about a famous person in five key sections: introduction, past, present, future and concluding opinion.
In your presentation exam you should speak for about one minute in Irish on a topic you have prepared, then you will be asked questions in Irish about what you have said. You are usually allowed to take a prompt card into the exam with you with five brief points on it and as many pictures as you like, to help you remember what to say.
A good way to structure your presentation so you include a variety of tenses plus an opinion is to start with
('tomorrow' - the future), before finishing off with
For his presentation Samus has written five paragraphs about Peter Canavan, but the order of the paragraphs has been jumbled up. Can you work out which paragraph is the introduction, which is about Peter Canavan's past, present and future, and which is the concluding opinion? It will help you to look out for uses of different tenses.

132,5231,"Atoms are made of three types of sub-atomic particle: neutrons and protons in the nucleus and electrons orbiting the nucleus.
Some materials are radioactive because the nucleus of each atom is unstable and gives out nuclear radiation in the form of alpha particles, beta particles or gamma rays. The radiation can be detected using a Geiger counter.
Atoms are made up of two main parts, the
The nucleus contains two types of particles called
. As protons, neutrons and electrons are the building blocks of atoms they're called
because the nucleus of each atom is
in the form of alpha particles, beta particles or gamma rays. The nuclear radiation given off can be detected using a Geiger counter. The number of nuclei that decay and give off radiation every second is called the
of the material and is measured in
If a radioactive material has an activity of 200Bq, in 1 second 200 of its nuclei will decay and give off radiation. In 1 minute 12000 (=200 x 60) nuclei will decay.
The activity of a radioactive material will

134,1676,"Despite the loss of political and religious freedom,
life improved in Germany for many ordinary people
who were prepared to 'toe the line' and look the other way.
Everybody had a job, and a wage. To people who had been unemployed and starving, 'work and bread' was a wonderful blessing worth every civil liberty they lost.
The Nazis set up KdF (Strength through Joy), which gave workers rewards for their work - evening classes, theatre trips, picnics, and even free holidays.
The Nazis devised a scheme to allow workers to buy a Volkswagen Beetle car for a small weekly payment.
People appreciated the public works - eg new schools and hospitals.
The streets were safe and there was no crime.
Germany was strong and successful in world affairs.
Nazi Youth groups provided activities and holidays for young people.
Nazi ideology gave people hope and confidence.

141,678,"Humans grow at different rates at different stages in their lives. Growth is very rapid in the womb and in the first two years of life. Puberty is another stage when growth and development is rapid.
Dependent on others for food and care
Peak health and fitness but no increase in height
Human gestation is around 40 weeks although infants can survive if born earlier than this. Other mammals have different gestation times depending on their size, the number of offspring and how independent they are when born. Large animals with a small number of independent offspring have the longest gestation.
When humans are born, their heads are relatively large, and their legs relatively short. Through childhood their bodies grow faster than their heads until they reach maturity. To check that development is happening at normal rates, infants regularly have their mass and head circumference measured.

142,4254,"The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.
r, so we divide both sides by 2
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c
Rearrange the formula to make 'c' the subject.
[To work this out: y = mx + c, so subtract mx from both sides.]
See if you can do it better than Einstein!

143,7481,"Materials obtained or made from living things are sometimes called natural materials, whereas synthetic materials are made from chemicals. Today, synthetic materials offer us more durability at a lower cost than the natural materials we used to use.
The materials we use are chemicals or mixtures of chemicals. For example, sugar is a chemical, but chocolate is a mixture of chemicals, one of which is sugar.

144,7331,"One government that is often seen as an example of 'reforming' by introducing positive changes that really improve peoples' lives is the Liberal government in Britain of 1906-1914. Many historians label this period the beginning of the
A state (or a country) where the government provides welfare benefits such as education, health care, and unemployment payment to its population free at the point of use, although paid for by general taxation.
, but why did the Liberal government introduce its reforms?
Some governments in history seem to have implemented changes that have particularly improved people's lives. For instance, Roosevelt's New Deal in America, or the Labour government in Britain after the First World War. The dynamism and positive achievements of these governments make them look much better than the governments that came before or after them.
A study of poverty in 1901 by Seebohm Rowntree found that in a society where those who didn't work didn't eat, there were three times in people's lives when they were especially vulnerable:
After 1906, the Liberal government, with Lloyd George as Chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced reforms to help these three groups:
Children and Young Persons Act introduced a set of regulations that became known as the

) of 7s 6d a week for 15 weeks in return for a payment of 2d a week.
1906 - the Trades Disputes Act ruled that unions were not liable for damages because of strikes.
1906 - the Workers Compensation Act granted compensation for injury at work.
1910 - half-day a week off for shop workers.
A Merchant Shipping Act improved conditions for sailors.
From 1911, MPs were paid. This gave working men the opportunity to stand for election.
Why did the Liberal government introduce these reforms?
in 1901 found that 28 per cent of the population did not have the minimum to live on at some time of their life.
- when Britain went to war in 1899, the army found that two-thirds of the men who volunteered for the army were unfit to join up.
- which had a good system of state welfare for workers, was passing Britain as a great industrial power.
meant politicians feared that, unless standards of living improved for the workers, they might turn to Communism or rebellion.
and it was attracting working-class voters because of its demands for welfare reform.
Liberal Party did not get a majority
of seats in the House of Commons, so it had a coalition with the 42 Labour Party MPs who had been elected.
Many government politicians, especially Lloyd George, genuinely wanted to

Most of these jobs were temporary or part-time; the government did not do anything to increase the number of jobs available.

- to pay for the reforms, Lloyd George's 1909 budget raised duties on tobacco and spirits, raised income tax by 16 per cent (from 1s to 1s 2d), and introduced a new 20 per cent tax on profits from selling land.
When the House of Lords refused to pass Lloyd George's budget, the House of Commons passed an Act stating that the House of Lords could not reject a bill that had been passed three times in the House of Commons. It also required a general election every five, not seven, years.
Lloyd George became loved - old people cried when they got their pension and blessed 'Lord George' who gave them - and hated - workers who objected to paying national insurance chanted: 'Taffy was a Welshman, taffy was a thief' at him.

Any piece of writing. More widely, a text can be anything that conveys meaning - eg, a film, tv programme, advert, website, or image.
. A text may have one theme or many. Understanding the themes makes the text more than 'just' a text - it becomes something more significant, because we're encouraged to think more deeply about the text, to work out what lies beneath its surface.
The title of the book comes from a poem by the 18th century Scottish poet Robbie Burns. It is about a mouse which carefully builds a winter nest in a wheat field, only for it to be destroyed by a ploughman. It is written in Scots

The mouse had dreamed of a safe, warm winter and is now faced with the harsh reality of cold, loneliness and possible death. There is a parallel here with George and Lennie's joyful fantasy of a farm of their own, and its all-too-predictable destruction at the end of the story.

The two main themes in 'Of Mice and Men' - foreshadowed by the reference to Burns' mouse - are loneliness and dreams. They interlock: people who are lonely have most need of dreams to help them through.
Study the table below, showing both the loneliness and the dreams of each of the main characters. You could use a table like this as the basis for an exam answer about

Loneliness and Dreams in Of Mice and Men
George is not lonely during the novel, as he has Lennie. He will be lonely afterwards, without his best friend.
George and Lennie share a dream - to own a little patch of land and live on it in freedom. He is so set on the idea that he even knows of some land that he thinks they could buy.
Lennie is the only character who is innocent enough not to fear loneliness, but he is angry when Crooks suggests George won't come back to him.
George and Lennie share a dream - to own a little patch of land and live on it in freedom. Lennie's main desire is to tend the soft-haired rabbits they will keep.
She is married to a man she doesn't love and who doesn't love her. There are no other women on the ranch and she has nothing to do. She tries to befriend the men by hanging round the bunkhouse.
She dreams of being a movie star. Her hopes were raised by a man who claimed he would take her to Hollywood, but when she didn't receive a letter from him, she married Curley.
When Candy's ancient, ill dog was shot, Candy has nothing left. He delayed killing the dog, even though he knew deep down that it was the best thing, as he dreaded losing his long-time companion.
Candy joins George and Lennie's plan of owning a piece of land. His savings make the dream actually possible to achieve.
Crooks lives in enforced solitude, away from the other men. He is bitter about being a back-busted nigger. He is thrilled when Lennie and Candy come into his room and are his companions for a night.
Crooks dreams of being seen as equal to everyone else. He knows his civil rights. He remembers fondly his childhood, when he played with white children who came to his family's chicken ranch, and longs for a similar relationship with white people again.

146,168,"In your work you need to show how different events fit together. This means you should know the basic storyline and what other parts of the plot are relevant to your task. If your task is about a particular scene, you should know what has already happened and what happens after the scene. Imagine you are looking at Act 2, Scene 1 (which finishes with Macbeth killing Duncan). You would probably want to include details from the plot like:
How Macbeth and his wife have secretly agreed to kill Duncan
How trouble is predicted at the start of the act (with Banquo saying he can't sleep and having 'cursed thoughts')
How Macbeth greets Banquo as a 'friend' when he is really a traitor
How Macbeth denies he has been thinking of the witches and their predictions (so we already know he is a liar)
How leaving Macbeth alone puts the focus directly on him and his thoughts
How Macbeth is relying on his wife for the signal to kill Duncan (just as he relied upon her for the courage to kill him)
How we do not see the murder, so are in the same position as Lady Macbeth - can we be sure Duncan is dead?
How the murder affects all the other characters in the play
