40,"The National Security Agency (NSA) has obtained direct access to the systems of Google, Facebook, Apple and other US internet giants, according to a top-secret document. The NSA access is part of a previously undisclosed program called PRISM, which allows officials to collect material including search history, the content of emails, file transfers and live chats, the document says. 
The Guardian has verified the authenticity of the document, a 41-slide PowerPoint presentation  classified as top secret with no distribution to foreign allies  which was apparently used to train intelligence operatives on the capabilities of the program. The document claims collection directly from the servers of major US service providers. Although the presentation claims the program is run with the assistance of the companies, all those who responded to a request for comment denied knowledge of any such program. 
In a statement, Google said: Google cares deeply about the security of our users data. We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law and we review all such requests carefully. From time to time, people allege that we have created a government 'back door' into our systems, but Google does not have a back door for the government to access private user data. 
Several senior tech executives insisted that they had no knowledge of PRISM or of any similar scheme. They said they would never have been involved in such a program. If they are doing this, they are doing it without our knowledge, one said. An Apple spokesman said he had never heard of PRISM. 
The NSA access was enabled by changes to US surveillance law, introduced under President Bush and renewed under Obama in December 2012. The program facilitates extensive, in-depth surveillance on live communications and stored information. The law allows for the targeting of any customers of participating firms who live outside the US, or those Americans whose communications include people outside the US. It also opens the possibility of communications made entirely within the US being collected without warrants. 
Disclosure of the PRISM program follows a leak to the Guardian on Wednesday of a top-secret court order compelling telecoms provider Verizon to turn over the telephone records of millions of US customers. The participation of the internet companies in PRISM will add to the debate about the scale of surveillance by the intelligence services. Unlike the collection of those call records, this surveillance can include the content of communications and not just the metadata. Some of the worlds largest internet brands are claimed to be part of the information-sharing program since its introduction in 2007. Microsoft  which is currently running an advertising campaign with the slogan Your privacy is our priority  was the first, with collection beginning in December 2007. It was followed by Yahoo in 2008; Google, Facebook and PalTalk in 2009; YouTube in 2010; Skype and AOL in 2011; and finally Apple, which joined the program in 2012. The program is continuing to expand, with other providers due to come online. Collectively, the companies cover the vast majority of online email, search, video and communications networks. The extent and nature of the data collected from each company varies. Companies are legally obliged to comply with requests for users communications under US law, but the PRISM program allows the intelligence services direct access to the companies servers. The NSA document notes the operations have the assistance of communications providers in the US . The revelation also supports concerns raised by several US senators during the renewal of the FISA Amendments Act (FAA) in December 2012, who warned about the scale of surveillance the law might enable and shortcomings in the safeguards it introduces. When the FAA was first enacted, defenders of the statute argued that a significant check on abuse would be the NSAs inability to obtain electronic communications without the consent of the telecom and internet companies that control the data. 
But the PRISM program renders that consent unnecessary, as it allows the agency to directly and unilaterally seize the communications off the companies servers. 
A chart prepared by the NSA, contained within the top-secret document, highlights the breadth of the data it is able to obtain: email, video and voice chat, videos, photos, voice-over-IP (Skype, for example) chats, file transfers, social networking details and more. The document is recent, dating to April 2013. Such a leak is extremely rare in the history of the NSA, which prides itself on maintaining a high level of secrecy. 
The PRISM program allows the NSA, the worlds largest surveillance organization, to obtain targeted communications without having to request them from the service providers and without having to obtain individual court orders. With this program, the NSA is able to reach directly into the servers of the participating companies and obtain both stored communications and perform real-time collection on targeted users. 
A senior administration official said in a statement: The Guardian and Washington Post articles refer to collection of communications pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). This law does not allow the targeting of any US citizen or of any person located within the United States. The program is subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch and Congress. It involves extensive procedures, specifically approved by the court, to ensure that only non-US persons outside the US are targeted and that minimize the acquisition, retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about US persons. 
This program was recently reauthorized by Congress after extensive hearings and debate. Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable intelligence information we collect and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats.

182,"That millennials rely heavily on technology is no secret. More than eight in ten say they sleep with a mobile phone by their bed, almost two thirds admit to texting while driving, one in five has posted a video of themselves online and three quarters have created a profile on a social networking site. 
Compared to other generations, millennials are the most active on social media, according to a 2010 report, with 75% of them having created at least one social media account. In contrast, only 50% of Generation X, 30% of baby boomers and 6% of those aged 65 and older use social media. But there is a small percentage of millennials who dont use social media at all. Meet the millennials bucking the trend. 
Celan Beausoleil, 31, Oakland, California Beausoleil is a social worker and has had an on and off, more off than on relationship with Facebook. 
She last deactivated her account in December 2015 after finding the amount of personal information shared by others too heavy to deal with on top of her work demands. 
A lot of my job is listening to peoples lives all day, every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybodys life, including people that I dont really have a relationship with, she said. It feels almost like intimacy overload. She added: Im holding a lot in my work life for people and sometimes it felt like it was too heavy to do in my personal life also. 
But Beausoleil does love the way social media connects the world in a truly unique way, citing it as one of her only reasons for staying on Facebook for as long as she did. One thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and one of their friends and one of their friends and literally end up on someones Facebook page from the other side of the world, she said. I used to do that all the time. 
One day, I realized Im spending so much time doing this. These little seconds add up. I wonder what it would be like if I didnt spend these seconds here and spent them doing something else. What if I was doing other things with these seconds? What would they become? Would I enjoy it? 
Mathias, who works for the Baltimore City government, had Facebook and Twitter accounts for years before deleting them both in November 2012. But he quickly forgot that Facebook existed after his impromptu decision to end his social media presence. He can still appreciate the benefits that come with having social media accounts, like when he met his girlfriends friends for the first time and realized humanizing 20 people youre meeting at a party is much easier if you can connect their faces, hometowns and jobs to a photo later on. Or how easy it is to organize large events online. Mathias relies on friends for party invites and is sure there are times he slips through the cracks. 
But, now, he relishes the time thats freed up. He spends his lift rides and spare moments at work reading news articles and books rather than scrolling through a newsfeed. And with no friends accounts to follow online, he has to pick up the phone and call them, something hes come to definitely enjoy. 
Lauren Raskauskas, 22, Naples, Florida Raskauskas describes herself as a pretty private person. So social media, which can open you up to the scrutiny and analysis of others, is not that appealing to her. Im more privacy-minded and have concerns about giving out my data, said Raskauskas, who is currently looking for a job. 
She recently deleted her Twitter account and deactivated her Facebook account two years ago after realizing she didnt like everyone knowing what I was doing. But Raskauskas, who was late to the Facebook game because her parents were really strict with technology, can see the positive sides of social media. When a friend of hers that shed lost track of moved to Naples for a month, Raskauskas didnt even realize she was there until after shed left, which the 22-year-old said was a bummer. 
But in the end, her privacy concerns outweighed any benefits social media could provide and she saw a definite upside when she went through a recent break-up. The last time a relationship of hers ended and she was online, it was not pleasant. 
One time, I did break up with somebody while I was on Facebook and I was like Oh my gosh, should I change my profile photo? Should I change my status? And, this time, I dont have to worry about any of that because that kind of stuff is pretty hard, she said. 
Rajagopalan, a student at Boston College, doesnt see any drawbacks to abstaining from social media. 
He claims that he hasnt seen any effect at this point. Even though classmates post about parties and events on Facebook, they make sure to send him a text message, too, he said. Since I was young, I was always a step behind on that kind of thing so it never really mattered to me, he said. 
In fact, the only time Rajagopalan made use of social media was when it was unavoidable: it was the only way to reach his new roommate at college. Before starting his first year at college, he signed up for his first, and only, social media account. He joined Facebook in order to contact his future roommate and talk about their plans for that year. 
Months later, he still has the account but he admits: I dont use it. I dont check it or anything like that. The most activity it sees is when his two sisters tag him in family photos. He has avoided social media accounts in all other situations, though he has felt the draw of Twitter. As a sports fan, he acknowledged that its where most of the news breaks out. But he refused to get an account, stating: I dont really need one to read tweets.

92,"The age of the big British summer music festival, including Glastonbury, is drawing to a close, according to the leading rock promoter and manager Harvey Goldsmith. 
The man who has produced and worked with most of the western worlds biggest music stars, from the Who, the Rolling Stones and Queen to Madonna, Bob Dylan and Luciano Pavarotti, said the biggest problem was a dire lack of major new bands to succeed the old ones. 
The festival circuit has peaked, he said, speaking at the Hay Festival of Literature and Arts in Powys, Wales. It really peaked about two years ago. Theres too many of them and there are not enough big acts to headline them. That is a big, big problem in our industry. And, we are not producing a new generation of these kind of acts  the likes of the Rolling Stones, Muse, even the Arctic Monkeys  that can headline. 
There were about 900 music festival events in the UK between May and September 2014, he said, and there is no way they can all continue. Music festivals have probably run their course. What is going to happen is a growth in events where it isnt just music but, like this one, with poetry or books or magic shows. There will be lots of small combination festivals that give something extra  not people standing around in a massive great field unable to go to the toilet because they might miss the band. 
Clearly, the way music is being delivered has changed, he said. People dont seem to want to listen to a body of work, an album, any more. And, most rock bands built a reputation on a body of work  they might take three albums to really hone their art, to become great, but young people dont want that. They home in on a track, a sound, then, ping, off again to the next one. Pop pervades, not that theres anything wrong with pop. I think it will come round again but it will take time. 
Goldsmith, 69, also revealed that he has teamed up with Robin de Levita, the Dutch producer of the Whos 1970s rock musical Tommy, at a new 1,100-seat theatre in Wembley, which is due to be finished in time for the first stage adaptation of the phenomenally successful teen book and movie series The Hunger Games in June 2016. 
De Levita would, said Goldsmith, be bringing his experimental SceneAround concept to London  theatre that puts the audience seating on a turntable that rotates round a series of scenes built around its circumference, accompanied by projections on panel screens. The concept was pioneered in an aircraft hangar outside Amsterdam and has proved hugely successful. 
Goldsmith, who is already planning to bring a production of the Anne Frank story to the as-yet-unnamed venue, said: Its a whole completely different way of producing shows. 
During his Hay appearance, the impresario also revealed some of the access-all-areas secrets from his long career in the music industry, talking about Keith Moon putting dynamite down a Sydney hotel room toilet in an effort to unblock it and witnessing the paralysing stage fright that gripped John Lennon just before an appearance at Madison Square Garden in 1974 and led to him being dragged, vomiting, out of his dressing room and shoved out on stage. Its the most bizarre thing, really, how common that is among artists. Its odd how stricken with fear theyll get but, as soon as the first chord is hit, theyre fine, he said. 
He also laid to rest a long-running rockn roll mystery: why Elvis Presley never performed outside North America. Presleys long-time manager, Colonel Tom Parker, admitted to him over tea, he said, that the real reason why Goldsmiths attempts to bring the singer to London had failed was Parkers own uncertain immigration status. 
He explained that it was because he was an illegal Dutch immigrant. He didnt want to risk leaving the US  it was him, not Elvis, said Goldsmith. 
And, his ultimate rockn roll performer? Freddie Mercury had to be our most powerful stage performer, the best live performer weve ever had. At Live Aid, he went out and saw that audience and just grabbed it. 
But, the next Queen was still far from being formed, he said. Were not producing a new generation of this kind of act. Coldplay is probably the last one to come up and that was ten years ago. There isnt much out there that looks like it is forming the next generation of heritage artists. 
So, with no big acts to headline, there are no big shows. Glastonbury has got to the point where it cant find any more big acts and thats the pinnacle of the festivals. They are really over.

28,"Temperature rises resulting from unchecked climate change will be at the severe end of those projected, according to a new scientic study. The scientist leading the research said that, unless emissions of greenhouse gases were cut, the planet would heat up by a minimum of 4C by 2100, twice the level the worlds governments deem dangerous. The research indicates that fewer clouds form as the planet warms, meaning less sunlight is reected back into space, driving temperatures up further still. The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery surrounding future climate change. Professor Steven Sherwood, at the University of New South Wales in Australia, who led the new work, said: This study breaks new ground twice: rst, by identifying what is controlling the cloud changes and, second, by strongly discounting the lowest estimates of future global warming in favour of the higher and more damaging estimates. 
4C would likely be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous, Sherwood said. For example, it would make life difcult, if not impossible, in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet, with sea levels rising by many metres as a result. 
The research is a big advance that halves the uncertainty about how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions, according to scientists commenting on the study, published in the journal Nature. Hideo Shiogama and Tomoo Ogura, at Japans National Institute for Environmental Studies, said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was convincing and agreed this indicated future climate change would be greater than expected. But they said more challenges lay ahead to narrow down further the projections of future temperatures. 
Scientists measure the sensitivity of the Earths climate to greenhouse gases by estimating the temperature rise that would be caused by a doubling of CO in the atmosphere compared with pre-industrial levels  as is likely to happen within 50 years, on current trends. For two decades, those estimates have run from 1.5C to 5C: a wide range. The new research narrowed that range to between 3C and 5C, by closely examining the biggest cause of uncertainty: clouds. 
The key was to ensure that the way clouds form in the real world was accurately represented in computer climate models, which are the only tool researchers have to predict future temperatures. When water evaporates from the oceans, the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reect sunlight; or, it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds. In reality, both processes occur and climate models encompassing this complexity predicted signicantly higher future temperatures than those only including the nine-mile-high clouds. 
Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the rst to admit they are not perfect, said Sherwood. But what we are nding is that the mistakes are being made by the models which predict less warming, not those that predict more. He added: Sceptics may also point to the hiatus of temperatures since the end of the 20th century, but there is increasing evidence that this inaptly named hiatus is not seen in other measures of the climate system and is almost certainly temporary. 
Global average air temperatures have increased relatively slowly since a high point in 1998 caused by the ocean phenomenon El Nio, but observations show that heat is continuing to be trapped in increasing amounts by greenhouse gases, with over 90% disappearing into the oceans. 
Furthermore, a study in November 2013 suggested the pause may be largely an illusion resulting from the lack of temperature readings from polar regions, where warming is greatest. Sherwood accepts his teams work on the role of clouds cannot denitively rule out that future temperature rises will lie at the lower end of projections. But, he said, for that to be the case, one would need to invoke some new dimension to the problem involving a major missing ingredient for which we currently have no evidence. Such a thing is not out of the question but requires a lot of faith. He added: Rises in global average temperatures of at least 4C by 2100 will have profound impacts on the world and the economies of many countries if we dont urgently start to curb our emissions.

4,"Facebook has lost millions of users per month in its biggest markets, independent data suggests, as alternative social networks attract the attention of those looking for fresh online playgrounds. 
As Facebook prepares to update investors on its performance in the first three months of the year, with analysts forecasting revenues up 36% on last year, studies suggest that its expansion in the US, UK and other major European countries has peaked. In the last month, the worlds largest social network has lost 6m US visitors, a 4% fall, according to analysis firm Socialbakers. In the UK, 1.4m fewer users checked in in March, a fall of 4.5%. The declines are sustained. In the last six months, Facebook has lost nearly 9m monthly visitors in the US and 2m in the UK. 
Users are also switching off in Canada, Spain, France, Germany and Japan, where Facebook has some of its biggest followings. A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment. 
The problem is that, in the US and UK, most people who want to sign up for Facebook have already done it, said new media specialist Ian Maude at Enders Analysis. There is a boredom factor where people like to try something new. Is Facebook going to go the way of MySpace? The risk is relatively small, but that is not to say it isnt there. Alternative social networks such as Instagram, the photo-sharing site that won 30m users in 18 months before Facebook acquired the business, have seen surges in popularity with younger age groups. 
Path, the mobile phone-based social network founded by former Facebook employee Dave Morin, which restricts its users to 150 friends, is gaining 1m users a week. It has recently topped 9m users, with 500,000 Venezuelans downloading the app in a single weekend. 
Facebook is still growing fast in South America. Monthly visitors in Brazil were up 6% in the last month to 70m, according to Socialbakers, whose information is used by Facebook advertisers. India has seen a 4% rise to 64m  still a fraction of the countrys population, leaving room for further growth. 
But in developed markets, other Facebook trackers are reporting declines. Analysts at Jefferies bank have developed an algorithm that interfaces directly with Facebook software and it suggests user levels in [the first quarter] may have declined from peak. 
Jefferies saw global numbers peak at 1.05bn a month in January, before falling by 20m in February. Numbers rose again in April. The network has now lost nearly 2m visitors in the UK since December, according to research firm Nielsen, with its 27m total flat on a year before. 
The number of minutes Americans spend on Facebook appears to be falling, too. The total was 121 billion minutes in December 2012, but that fell to 115 billion minutes in February, according to comScore. 
As Facebook itself has warned, the time spent on its pages from those sitting in front of personal computers is declining rapidly because we are switching our screen time to smartphones and tablets. 
While smartphone minutes have doubled in a year, to 69 a month, that growth is not guaranteed to compensate for dwindling desktop usage. 
Facebook is the most authoritative source on its own user numbers, and the firm will update investors on its performance for the quarter. Wall Street expects revenues of about $1.44bn, up from $1.06bn in 2012. 
Shareholders will be particularly keen to learn how fast Facebooks mobile user base is growing, and whether advertising revenues are increasing at the same rate. 
Mobile usage represented nearly a quarter of Facebooks advertising income at the end of 2012, and the network had 680m mobile users a month in December. 
The company warned in recent stockmarket filings that it might be losing younger users to other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, Facebook. 
Wary of competition from services that were invented for the mobile phone rather than the PC, founder Mark Zuckerberg has recently driven through a series of new initiatives designed to appeal to smartphone users. The most significant is Facebook Home, software that can be downloaded onto certain Android phones to feed news and photos from friends  and advertising  directly to the owners locked home screen.

8,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge won the first round in their battle for privacy on Tuesday when a French magazine was banned from selling or reusing images taken of the couple at a private chateau in Provence. 
But the war is far from over as French prosecutors must now decide if criminal proceedings are to be brought against the magazine editor and the photographer or photographers responsible for taking pictures of the duchess sunbathing topless while on holiday in the south of France. 
The Tribunal de Grande Instance in Nanterre, Paris granted an injunction ordering the gossip magazine Closer to hand over digital files of the pictures within 24 hours and preventing it disseminating them any further, including on its website and tablet app. 
The four-page ruling, which only affects Mondadori Magazines France, Closers publisher, also ordered it to pay 2,000 in legal costs. The magazine faces a 10,000 fine for every day it fails to comply with the order. No damages were sought by the couple. 
These snapshots, which showed the intimacy of a couple, partially naked on the terrace of a private home, surrounded by a park several hundred metres from a public road, and being able to legitimately assume that they are protected from passersby, are by nature particularly intrusive, it said. 
The magistrates ruled that every photograph published in France by Mondadori, the publishing company owned by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, in future would carry a fine, also of 10,000 per breach. 
But the ruling refers only to the 14 pictures that have already been published. Closers editor has hinted she has other, more intimate pictures. 
St Jamess Palace said the couple welcome the judges ruling. A source said: They always believed the law was broken and that they were entitled to their privacy. Maud Sobel, a lawyer for the royal couple in Paris, described it as a wonderful decision, adding: Weve been vindicated. 
Though pleased their civil action has succeeded, the couple have taken the rare step of seeking to have a much more public criminal prosecution for breach of privacy brought against the magazine and photographer or photographers responsible. 
The prosecutor will have to decide the targets for any criminal proceedings and the complaint cites persons unknown. But it is understood the couple want proceedings brought against the editor of Closer, which published the photos on Friday, and whoever took the images of the couple sunbathing at the chateau, which belongs to Lord Linley, son of the late Princess Margaret. 
A preliminary investigation was launched on Tuesday by the Paris police. Under French law breach of privacy carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a fine of 45,000. 
This is the legal action that will truly lay down a marker, and by pursuing it the couple indicate a determination to convey a wider message to the world and, they hope, deter paparazzi in the future. 
Their lawyers had not asked for copies of Closer magazine to be removed from shelves. 
On Saturday the Irish Daily Star published the photos, leading to the editor being suspended on Monday night pending the outcome of an internal investigation. Also on Monday, the Mondadori-owned Italian celebrity magazine Chi rushed out a special edition with 26 pages devoted to the candid photos of the future queen. 
The couples lawyer, Aurlien Hamelle, had told the Paris court it was necessary to block the highly intimate images of the duchess without her bikini top as she was a young woman, not an object. 
But Delphine Pando, defending Closer, said the action was a disproportionate response to publication of the photographs. She added that the magazine could not control their resale as it did not own the original images. 
Copies of Closer magazine were doing brisk business on online auction site eBay, with one selling for 31.01, until the site removed all listings following strong feedback from its community.

94,"The Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to a son on Monday, 22 July. Third in line to the throne, the baby is destined to be the 43rd monarch since William the Conqueror obtained the English crown in 1066. 
Kensington Palace announced at 8.30pm that the baby was born at 4.24pm in the exclusive Lindo Wing at St Marys Hospital, Paddington, West London. We could not be happier, the Duke of Cambridge said. 
In a statement, Kensington Palace said: Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge was safely delivered of a son at 4.24pm. The baby weighs 8lbs 6oz. The Duke of Cambridge was present for the birth. The duchess experienced at least ten and a half hours labour, which Kensington Palace said had progressed as normal. 
The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and members of both families were informed and were delighted with the news that Her Royal Highness and her child were both doing well. 
It is understood that the couple delayed making the announcement immediately so that they could enjoy some private time with their newborn. William telephoned his family to tell them the good news, speaking to the Queen, his father, Charles and younger brother, Prince Harry. 
The birth of the baby prince means the monarchy has three generations of heirs to the throne for the first time since 1894. 
The baby is the first Prince of Cambridge to be born for more than 190 years since Prince George of Cambridge, a grandson of George III and the only son of Prince Adolphus Frederick, the 1st Duke of Cambridge. 
In a statement, Prince Charles said: Both my wife and I are overjoyed at the arrival of my first grandchild. It is an incredibly special moment for William and Catherine and we are so thrilled for them on the birth of their baby boy. 
Grandparenthood is a unique moment in anyones life, as countless kind people have told me in recent months, so I am enormously proud and happy to be a grandfather for the first time and we are eagerly looking forward to seeing the baby in the near future. 
The newest royal will be called HRH Prince George of Cambridge. When Kate was three months pregnant, a decree issued by the Queen said: All the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales should have and enjoy the style, title and attribute of Royal Highness with the titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their Christian names or with such other titles of honour. 
Following tradition, a formal notice was posted on an ornate rococo-style easel  the same used to announce Prince Williams birth in 1982  in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace shortly before 9pm. Within an hour, the numbers had swelled from hundreds to thousands outside the palace, with locals and tourists alike keen to share in the historic moment. 
New Yorker, Sharon Surloff, was delighted with her phone picture of the royal bulletin, snapped after she and her niece and mother had squeezed through crowds to take a photograph of the easel. 
The police were just saying to everyone: 'OK, 20 seconds and then the next person'. Its just great to be here, though. We arrived this morning, at nine in the morning, so it has all worked out beautifully. 
The palace announced the birth in a press release. Minutes later, as crowds of well- wishers outside cheered, Its a boy, the formal medical bulletin was taken from the hospital to a waiting car by Ed Perkins, Prince Williams press secretary. He handed it to a soldier, who then took the notice, which was signed by Marcus Setchell, the Queens gynaecologist, to Buckingham Palace under police escort. 
The prime minister was one of the first to offer his congratulations. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street, David Cameron said: It is wonderful news from St Marys, Paddington, and I am sure that, right across the country, and, indeed, right across the Commonwealth, people will be celebrating and wishing the royal couple well. 
It is an important moment in the life of our nation but, I suppose, above all, it is a wonderful moment for a warm and loving couple who have got a brand new baby boy. It has been a remarkable few years for our royal family: a royal wedding that captured peoples hearts, that extraordinary and magnificent jubilee and now this royal birth  all from a family that has given this nation so much incredible service. 
Congratulations came from the White House, too, from Barack Obama and his wife. The president said: Michelle and I are so pleased to congratulate the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the joyous occasion of the birth of their first child. We wish them all the happiness and blessings parenthood brings. 
The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, tweeted: Delighted for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. May God bless them all with love, health and happiness. 
The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, said: Many congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. I wish them and their son all happiness and good health. 
The campaign group, Republic, which launched its Born Equal initiative calling for every child to be born equal in political status and rights, said the royal birth raised questions about Britain and democratic values. Chief Executive Graham Smith said the baby should be able to grow up without constant interference and intrusion. He said: Here is a new baby whose career, religion, even personal relationships have already been mapped out. Meanwhile, this is an opportunity for the rest of us to consider whether this circus is the best way to run things.

135,"A major international row with wide-ranging implications for global drugs policy has erupted over the right of Bolivias indigenous Indian tribes to chew coca leaves, the principal ingredient in cocaine. Bolivia has obtained a special exemption from the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the framework that governs international drugs policy, allowing its indigenous people to chew the leaves. 
Bolivia had argued that the convention was in opposition to its new constitution, adopted in 2009, which obliges it to protect native and ancestral coca as cultural patrimony and maintains that coca in its natural state  is not a narcotic. 
South American Indians have chewed coca leaves for centuries. The leaves reputedly provide energy and are said to have medicinal qualities. Supporters of Bolivias position praised it for standing up for the rights of indigenous people. The Bolivian move is inspirational and groundbreaking, said Danny Kushlick, Head of External Affairs at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, which promotes drug liberalization. It shows that any country that has had enough of the war on drugs can change the terms of its engagement with the UN conventions. 
However, the UNs International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), which monitors implementation of the global drug treaties, has accused Bolivia of threatening the integrity of the international drug control regime. A number of countries  including the UK, the US, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Russia  opposed Bolivias demands. 
The UKs submission to the UN, which oversees the convention, said that it acknowledges and respects the cultural importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia, but it adds: The United Kingdom is  concerned that the reservation could lead to increases in coca production and  crucially  the amount of coca diverted to the cocaine trade. As such, the reservation would weaken international law as it relates to the global effort to tackle the drugs trade and could weaken the international communitys response to that trade. 
The right of indigenous communities in South Americas Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed up to the convention. But, under the terms of the agreement, Bolivia was given 25 years to implement the ban. This expired in 1989 and since then the issue has been under dispute. 
In 2011, Bolivia  whose President, Evo Morales, is a former coca producer  formally notified the UN of its withdrawal from the convention. On Friday it reacceded to the convention, but with an exemption from the prohibition on the chewing of coca leaves. 
The move is the first of its kind in the history of UN drug-control treaties and has sparked concerns that other countries may apply for amendments. The Russian government has argued that the move will lead to an increase in illegal circulation of cocaine and warned that it also sets a dangerous precedent that could be used by other states in creating a more liberal drug-control regime. 
The British parliaments Home Affairs Select Committee has recommended that Bolivias request should be backed by the UK government, arguing that it was important that countries remained within the single convention. Bolivias re-accession could be blocked only if a third or more of the 184 countries that have signed up to the convention opposed its request. There are suspicions that the US and UK are frantically lobbying other countries to gain sufficient numbers to block Bolivias request. 
Nancie Prudhomme, Projects Director at the International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy, criticized the co-ordinated opposition to Bolivias demands. These objections are legally questionable, she said. They support an arbitrary and over-broad provision and apply international drug laws in a vacuum. This is not appropriate. No state has paid any attention to decades of developing international norms on cultural and indigenous rights, which support Bolivias efforts. 
The decision to ban coca chewing was based on a 1950 report produced by the UN Commission of Inquiry on the Coca Leaf, which proponents of drug liberalization say was not based on supporting evidence. In an interview in 1949, the head of the Commission, Howard B Fonda, signalled his opposition to the chewing of coca leaves before his inquiry had begun. Fonda told an interviewer: We believe that the daily, inveterate use of coca leaves by chewing  is not only thoroughly noxious and therefore detrimental, but is also the cause of racial degeneration in many centres of population, and of the decadence that visibly shows in numerous Indians  Our studies will confirm the certainty of our assertions and we hope we can present a rational plan of action  to attain the absolute and sure abolition of this pernicious habit. 
The growing of coca leaves is legal and licensed in Bolivia. The policy has been credited with a fall in cocaine production in the country, leading some experts to see the Bolivian model as a way forward for other countries.

127,"The Canadian tennis player Frank Dancevic slammed Australian Open organizers for forcing players to compete in inhumane conditions after he collapsed on court as temperatures rose to 41C. 
Dancevic, who collapsed during the second set of his first-round match against Frances Benot Paire on the uncovered court six at Melbourne Park and passed out for a minute, said conditions were plainly dangerous for the players. He also said the heat had caused him to hallucinate: I was dizzy from the middle of the first set and then I saw Snoopy and I thought, 'Wow, Snoopy  thats weird.' 
I think its inhumane. I dont think its fair to anybody  to the players, to the fans, to the sport  when you see players pulling out of matches, passing out, he added. Ive played five-set matches all my life and being out there for a set and a half and passing out with heat stroke, its not normal. 
Having players with so many problems and complaining to the tournament that its too hot to play; until somebody dies, they just keep going on with it and putting matches on in this heat. I, personally, dont think its fair and I know a lot of players dont think its fair. 
Other players were in broad agreement. The British number one, Andy Murray, said: Its definitely something that you have to look at a little bit. As much as its easy to say the conditions are safe, it only takes one bad thing to happen. And it looks terrible for the whole sport when people are collapsing, ball kids are collapsing, people in the stands are collapsing. Thats not great. 
I know when I went out to hit before the match, the conditions at 2.303pm were very, very tough. Whether its safe or not, I dont know. Theres been some issues in other sports with players having heart attacks. 
Caroline Wozniacki said: I put the water bottle down on the court and it started melting a little bit underneath the plastic. So, you know it was warm. 
John Isner, who retired from his first-round match with a right ankle injury, said: It was like an oven when I open the oven and the potatoes are done. Thats what its like. 
The defending champion Victoria Azarenka took the same line. It felt pretty hot, like youre dancing in a frying pan or something like that, she said. 
The tournaments extreme heat contingency plan was put into force for womens matches on Tuesday, allowing an extra ten-minute break between the second and third sets. Under a change to the rules for 2014, however, the decision on whether to stop matches at the tournament is now at the discretion of the tournament director, Wayne McKewen. Rather than use the raw Celsius readings to assess the heat, organizers prefer to use the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature composite, which also gauges humidity and wind to identify the perceived conditions. Organizers said temperatures peaked at 42.2C in the early evening on Tuesday and conditions had never reached the point where play would be stopped. We have to reach a minimum threshold and have a forecast that it will be sustained for a reasonable time, McKewen said in a statement. That didnt happen. While conditions were hot and uncomfortable, the relatively low level of humidity ensured play would continue. 
Dancevic, who said he had felt dizzy from the middle of the second set, resumed after medical attention but, unsurprisingly, ended up losing 76, 63, 64. I was really close to stopping completely, he said. I wasnt really running too much towards the end. I wasnt tired; I just felt my body temperature was too high. 
A ball boy had earlier required medical attention after collapsing during Milos Raonics 76, 61, 46, 62 victory over Daniel Gimeno-Traver on the equally exposed court eight and the tournament shortened rotations for the ball boys to 45-minute shifts. Chinas Peng Shuai also said the heat had caused her to cramp up and vomit, and she had to be helped from the court after her 75, 46, 63 defeat to Japans Kurumi Nara. Officials played down health risks, saying the majority of matches were completed without calls for medical attention. 
Of course, there were a few players who experienced heat-related illness or discomfort, but none required significant medical intervention after they had completed their match, Tim Wood, the tournaments chief medical officer, said in a statement. 
Most competitors, though, followed Roger Federers line that, although conditions were tough, they were the same for both players. Its just a mental thing, the Swiss said, albeit before Dancevic collapsed. If youve trained hard enough your entire life, or the last few weeks, and you believe you can do it and come through it, theres no reason. If you cant deal with it, you throw in the towel. 
Dancevic disagreed. I dont think its much to do with the shape the players are in. Some players are used to the heat  their bodies can genetically handle the heat and others cant, he said. Its hazardous to be out there; its dangerous. Its an hour and a half since my match and I still cant pee.

138,"Sometimes life just isnt fair. Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook and is now worth an estimated $48bn. James Goodfellow also invented something used by millions of people around the world every day  the cash machine  but it didnt make him rich. In fact, he earned just 10 from the patent and has not made a penny more from it since. 
You can imagine how I feel when I see bankers getting 1m bonuses. I wonder what they contributed to the banking industry more than I did to merit a 1m bonus. It doesnt make much sense to me but thats the way of the world, Goodfellow says. 
It also annoys him that hes not seen as a good role model for inventors and engineers. He came up with a groundbreaking invention that generated billions of pounds and I got nothing, so whos going to want to follow in James Goodfellows footsteps and get 10 if they have a fantastic success? 
There have been arguments for years over who should officially go down in history as the inventor of the ATM and, in 2005, a man called John Shepherd-Barron received a UK honour for services to banking as the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser. But, the UK government is now saying it was Goodfellow who invented the ATM  so it would seem that, after all the squabbling, his place in history is now assured. 
Back in the mid-1960s, Goodfellow was working as a development engineer and had been asked to devise a way to enable customers to withdraw cash from banks on Saturdays. Most people working during the week couldnt get to the bank. They wanted a solution. The solution was a machine which would issue cash on demand to a recognized customer, he recalls. I set out to develop a cash-issuing machine and, to make this a reality, I invented the PIN [personal identification number] and an associated coded token. 
This token took the form of a plastic card with holes punched in it. The patent documents proposed a system incorporating a card reader and buttons mounted in an external wall of the bank and stated: When the customer wishes to withdraw a pack of banknotes from the system, he simply inserts his punched card in the card reader of the system and operates the set of ten push-buttons in accordance with his personal identification number. 
Aside from the cards with punched holes, that pretty much describes todays ATM. After Goodfellow successfully demonstrated the methodology by producing a model, prototypes were built and the first machines were installed in 1967. 
At around the same time, Shepherd-Barron was developing a rival cash-dispensing device. His machine didnt use plastic cards  instead, it used cheques impregnated with carbon-14, a mildly radioactive substance. The machine detected the carbon-14, matched the cheque against a PIN and paid out the cash. 
It is widely accepted that the Shepherd-Barron ATM was the worlds first when it comes to being installed and used by the public; the first one, at a bank in north London, was opened on 27 June, 1967  a month before Goodfellows ATM made its public debut. However, the patent for Goodfellows machine was lodged on 2 May, 1966, 14 months before the London ATM machine came into service. 
The rivalry between the two men bubbled up when Shepherd-Barron received an official honour for his achievement. Goodfellow says: My one big regret is that I never said anything about it until John Shepherd-Barron received the OBE in 2005. This honour was granted on the basis that he was the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser. That really stuck in my throat and I kicked up a bit of a fuss. Shepherd-Barron is no longer alive to put his case but, in a 2005 interview, he was fairly withering about his rival: I dont know him but its clear that the difference between Goodfellow and us was that we thought through the whole system concept and that was important to the banks who bought it. His invention reminds me of the hovercraft, an elegant failure. 
The cash machine has become a world-conquering piece of technology and nothing  the contactless revolution, bitcoin, wearable technology, etc  seems to be slowing its growth: there are now 3m ATMs worldwide, with the number forecast to hit 4m by 2020. 
Goodfellow accepts he didnt invent the concept of a cash-issuing machine but I did invent a way of doing it. When people talk about the Wright brothers, they didnt invent the concept of flying  everyone was trying to do it  but they did it and got the credit for inventing the aeroplane so I think I should get the credit for inventing the cash dispenser. 
The good news for Goodfellow is that this is now starting to happen. The website ATMInventor.com concludes: Who invented the idea of an ATM? We believe it was Luther George Simjian. Who invented the ATM as we know it? We have to think it was James Goodfellow in Scotland for holding a patent date of 1966. Who invented the ATM design we recognize today? We think it was John D White for Docutel in the US. 
Even better for Goodfellow, his achievement has been officially recognized in the latest edition of a 180-page guidebook called Life in the United Kingdom. In the section about great British inventions of the twentieth century , it states: In the 1960s, James Goodfellow (1937-) invented the cash-dispensing automatic teller machine (ATM) or 'cashpoint'. 
So after all these years, Goodfellow finally finds himself being talked about in the same breath as John Logie Baird (the television), Alan Turing (the Turing machine), Sir Frank Whittle (the jet engine) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the World Wide Web). Asked what he did with the 10 he received back in the 1960s, Goodfellow says he thinks he blew it on a wild night out, adding: It didnt change my life. But, he concludes, its been a good working life: I was very happy doing the job I was doing.

181,"He is not the first person to express scepticism about Mars One, a vastly ambitious private mission aiming to settle humans on Mars from 2025. But Joseph Roche is different from most critics: hes on the shortlist of astronauts. 
Roche, an astrophysicist at Trinity College Dublin who was announced in February as among the 100 people in line for the mission, has written for the Guardian expressing his grave doubts about the viability of Mars One. 
The selection process, Roche writes, was not rigorous enough to reach the requisite standard of more traditional astronaut selection programmes. He also says the Dutch Mars One team have displayed a certain naivety in believing they can succeed alone in the supposed $6bn mission and should now accept it is very unlikely to happen. 
He writes: More openness and transparency would benefit Mars One greatly but I think that the shortcomings of the selection process, coupled with their unwillingness to engage and collaborate with the scientific community mean that the time might have come for Mars One to acknowledge the implausibility of this particular venture and turn their efforts towards supporting other exciting and more viable upcoming space missions. 
Roche also expressed worries about the way the mission organizers publicized a so-called top-ten candidates. The ranking, he said, didnt mean these were the most likely potential astronauts but was, instead, based on how many supporter points each had earned through acts such as buying official merchandise. 
He writes: These points are Mars Ones supporter points which 'represent the degree of your support to Mars Ones mission'. These points play no role in the selection process and serve only to show how much each supporter has donated to Mars One. 
The official timeline for the mission says the group plans to dispatch a stationary lander and satellite to Mars in 2018, followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022. Humans would start arriving in 2025 and crews of four would be sent every two years to add to the settlement. They would not return to Earth. 
In February, a prominent supporter of the project, Gerardt Hooft, a Dutch Nobel laureate in physics, said he did not believe this timetable was realistic. He said: It will take quite a bit longer and be quite a bit more expensive. When they first asked me to be involved, I told them: 'You have to put a zero after everything'. 
Roche also spoke to Medium, a US blogging platform that has previously expressed grave sceptism about Mars One, reporting among other things that the supposed 200,000 applications to be astronauts in fact totalled 2,761. 
He told Medium about the selection process in more detail: I have not met anyone from Mars One in person. Initially, theyd said there were going to be regional interviews; we would travel there, wed be interviewed, wed be tested over several days and, in my mind, that sounded at least like something that approached a legitimate astronaut selection process. 
But then they made us sign a non-disclosure agreement if we wanted to be interviewed and then, all of a sudden, it changed from being a proper regional interview over several days to being a ten-minute Skype call. 
Roche told the Guardian he did not want to give more interviews as he was wary about being negative about the idea of space travel. 
In his comment piece he writes: I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of scientific endeavour and that is why the ambitiousness of the Mars One plan appealed to me. Although Mars One were never likely to overcome the financial and technical barriers during their proposed timeline, it was refreshing to hear a new idea that challenges us to think about our own role in the future of space exploration. 
Being part of the subsequent public debate over the ethics and morality of future missions has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable aspects of my candidacy with Mars One. If a one-way mission to Mars ever became possible, then I would always volunteer. For an astrophysicist, that is not a difficult decision to make but it is also a moot point because I do not think we will see a one-way mission in my lifetime.

189,"Tigers are more numerous in Nepal than at any time since the 1970s, a new census has revealed, giving conservationists hope that the big cats, whose numbers have been dropping across south Asia for 100 years, can be saved. 
The number of wild royal bengal tigers in Nepal has increased to 198  a 63.6% rise in five years  the government survey showed. This is very encouraging, said Maheshwar Dhakal, an ecologist with Nepals Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation. 
The census is based on the examination of pictures from more than 500 cameras placed in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors. More than 250 conservationists and wildlife experts worked on the survey, which cost about 250,000. 
Dhakal said that a parallel survey was conducted in India and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013. It will take a few more months for India, which now has 1,300 big cats in several huge protected areas, to finalize the data, he added. 
Nepal has pledged to double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 when the last systematic tiger count took place. Increasing prosperity in Asia has pushed up prices for tiger skins and the body parts used in traditional Chinese medicines. International gangs pay poor local Nepali significant sums to kill the cats. The skin and bones are handed to middlemen, who pass easily through the porous border to India, where the major dealers are based. 
One major problem is complicity between senior officials and mafia networks involved in the trade. Conservation experts credit the increase in numbers to the effective policing of national parks, stronger anti-poaching drives and better management of tiger habitats in Nepal, where forests cover 29% of the land. But they say Nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers prey so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat. 
As the number of tigers has increased over the years, so have incidents of conflict with villagers. Seven people were killed in attacks by tigers around national parks in 2012 compared to four in 2011, park officials said. Villagers are also seeking better protection. The government is making conservation plans for tigers. But it should also come up with plans to protect people from tigers, Krishna Bhurtel, a local village headman in Chitwan, told Nepali newspaper Nagarik. 
Wildlife authorities captured a tiger in Chitwan after it killed two people, including a villager who was pulled from his bed in May. Thousands of tigers once roamed the forests in Bangladesh, India and Nepal. But their numbers have dropped to about 3,000, a 95% drop over a century. Chitwan National Park in central Nepal has the highest number of adult tigers, with 120, followed by Bardiya National Park (50) and Shukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve (17). 
Diwakar Chapagain, who heads a World Wildlife Fund Nepal unit that monitors wildlife trade, said tiger skins were in demand in Tibet, where well-heeled people use them as festival costumes. 
In Nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins in front of stuffed tigers for special occasions. Some affluent Nepali have mounted tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms. Tiger bones are in high demand for use in traditional Chinese medicines. The trade in tiger parts is lucrative and fetches thousands of dollars in illegal markets, Chapagain said, highlighting the threat tigers face.

177,"The continual relegation of women to the sidelines of football was given a good kicking when France appointed its first female professional team manager. It did not matter that it was a second-division club. It did not matter if it was, as some bad sports  male, of course  suggested, just a cynical stunt to drum up publicity for a minor team, Clermont Foot 63, currently ranking a lowly 14th out of 20 in its league. 
What mattered was that Helena Costa had been given the top job, a move that saw her make football history by becoming the first female manager to be appointed in the highest two divisions of any professional European league. As a woman, its made me happy, Vronique Soulier, president of the clubs supporters association, told journalists. When I first heard the news, I was rather surprised, but, once that passed, we were pretty unanimous that its good news. We all agree that a woman at the head of a group of men is no bad thing. 
The new manager of Clermont Foot 63, whose average home crowd at the stadium at Clermont- Ferrand in the Auvergne region of south-central France is around 3,800, is a former talent spotter for the Scottish Premiership side Celtic. Costa, 36, was born in Alhandra on the River Tagus in southeast Portugal and graduated with a masters degree in sports science. She is also a UEFA-licensed coach. She previously coached Benficas male youth teams, the Qatar womens team, which she led to its first international victory in 2012, and, more recently, the Iranian womens national side, which she left in September 2013. 
Costa was appointed on a two-year contract by the president of Clermont Foot 63, Claude Michy, who is a champion at grabbing the headlines for his club. In 2013, he announced the team had signed Messi. They had. Not the Argentinian and FC Barcelona record-breaking striker Lionel Messi, but Junior Messi Enguene, a 20-year-old midfielder from Cameroon. 
Frances womens minister, Najat Vallaud- Belkacem, tweeted: Bravo to Clermont Foot for understanding that giving women a place is the future of professional football. 
Carolina Morace, an Italian who was the only previous woman coach of a mens professional team, said: I dont know Helena, but, if she has been hired by a team, then it means that she knows how to do her job. I hope that, one day, this can become normal. Morace was an outstanding player in the womens game. She was the top scorer for 12 seasons in Italys Serie A and played for Italy in 153 internationals. In 1999, she was named as the coach of Viterbese in the mens Serie C1. But, after only two games, she resigned from the job following a clash with the clubs mercurial proprietor, Luciano Gaucci, who at the time was also the owner of a Serie A side, Perugia. 
Morace was quoted as saying that she had refused Gauccis demand that she fire her deputy and the sides trainer. He let me know that I could carry on working with whomever I wanted. But, by then, mutual trust was lacking and I didnt fancy carrying on in that climate of uncertainty, she said. Morace works today as a lawyer in Rome and as expert soccer commentator on television and in the pages of the daily Gazzetta dello Sport. 
She said: For the time being, I see too many men, even in the womens game, who are working, despite not having the same expertise as women, who, by contrast, are not working. Raymond Domenech, former manager of the French national team, said: Women know how to play football and how to manage and are good at doing it. Why shouldnt they manage mens teams? The opposite happens and doesnt cause any problems. Its a natural choice and reflects our society in which women are equal to men. I say well done to President Michy. I told myself that, if I took charge of a club again, Id hire a woman as my number two. He beat me to it. 
A statement on Clermont Foot 63s website said Costas appointment would allow the club to enter a new era. On the club supporters website, reaction to Costas appointment was a mix of surprise and a certain cynicism. In my opinion, its just a publicity stunt to get people talking about the club and she wont last the season. I find it hard to believe shell be able to get the players respect, above all when shes the same age as the oldest, wrote one fan. Her CV isnt bad, but now the question is: will she be good enough? added another. A third wrote: I wish her welcome and success but I think itll be hard for her to make her mark as a woman in such a macho business. Has our president pulled off a media coup? 
But Soulier was hopeful: Hopefully, with the new manager, the club can find the motivation theyre lacking at the moment, she said. The boys in the team can be difficult to manage. With a woman in charge, maybe theyll be less demanding. 
If Costas reputation is anything to go by, she will be the one making the demands. After doing work experience at Chelsea during her compatriot Jos Mourinhos first stint as manager of the club between 2004 and 2007, she was reportedly described as Mourinho in a skirt. Costa quickly kicked the sexist remark into touch. Like Mourinho, I always want to win. As far as thats concerned, yes, Im happy to be compared with him, she said.

46,"From all across Rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring Burundi, people flock to the southern town of Butare to a little shop called Inzozi Nziza (Sweet Dreams). They come for a taste of the unknown, something most have never tasted  the sweet, cold, velvety embrace of ice cream. 
Here, at the central African countrys first ice- cream parlour, customers can buy scoops in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple flavours. Toppings include fresh fruit, honey, chocolate chips and granola. Black tea and coffee are also on sale. 
The shop, which has ice cream, coffee, dreams across its signage, is milking local curiosity about the dessert  and changing lives in the process, says Inzozi Nzizas manager, Louise Ingabire. 
Ice cream is important, she says between mouthfuls of a honey-flavoured offering. Some Rwandans like ice cream, but its a new thing. We still have some work to do, to tell others that theyll enjoy it. 
True to Inzozi Nzizas motto, the shop can certainly make dreams come true. I didnt have a job before: I just stayed at home. Now, I have a vision for the future. I am making money and I can give some of it to my family, says the 27-year-old. 
Butare, which has 89,600 residents and is located 135km south of the capital, Kigali, is the home of the National University of Rwanda. Inzozi Nziza has become a hub for tired students looking to treat themselves to something cool and different. 
Its something uniting people here, Kalisa Migendo, a 24-year-old agriculture student, says. If you need to go out and talk to a friend, a girl or a boy, you come to Inzozi Nziza for an ice cream. 
Most of the ingredients are sourced locally and the milk comes from a depot in nearby Nyanza. The vanilla beans and cocoa are imported. 
Inzozi Nziza was opened by the theatre director Odile Gakire Katese. She met Alexis Miesen and Jennie Dundas, co-founders of Blue Marble Ice Cream in Brooklyn, New York, and formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010. 
An ice-cream shop, Katese proposed, might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits, hopes and family traditions, Miesen says. 
At the start, Miesen and Dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative and non-profit. They did not set financial targets, but waited for 18 months before they transferred their shares to the women, who had by then proved their business credentials. 
The shops success is no exception, says Fatuma Ndangiza, deputy chief executive of the Rwanda Governance Board. Small businesses are mostly managed by women but when it comes to big business where you have to compete for big tenders, very few women are there. Women are newcomers to big business, she points out. We have more women entrepreneurs. Its an area where women are taking an interest, both in and outside Kigali. 
Though ice cream is somewhat new to Rwanda, Ndangiza is enthused by the idea of the shop. I think its great. It requires a lot of skills and changing peoples mindsets because selling and eating ice cream is not part of our culture. I think being able to innovate and introduce this on the market, and the process of making it, is quite interesting. 
The Butare shop employs nine women, who spend their spare time practising with Ingoma Nshya, Rwandas first and only female drumming troupe, which was established by Katese ten years ago. 
The musicians are Hutu and Tutsi women, some survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed. 
Some members of Ingoma Nshya are widows, some orphans. Others have been affected by the massacre in different ways. 
Historically, says Ingabire, Rwandan women were forbidden to drum and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry. But its something which brings unity. 
Ingabires father, two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide. Some of us are survivors; some know someone who was killed, she says. When Im drumming with them, it gives me power because were still alive and survivors. 
The popular eatery features in a documentary by Rob and Lisa Fruchtman, sibling film-makers. Sweet Dreams, which tells the story of how the women have forged a promising post-genocide future, also includes the female drummers. 
The film, which has been screened in more than a dozen countries, including the US, UK and several African states, premieres in Rwanda in 2014. We feel the film is about resilience, hope, bravery, resourcefulness and the ability to change the course of your own life, says Lisa Fruchtman, who won an Academy Award for film- editing in 1984.

100,"A long time ago, cinema audiences were transported to a galaxy far, far away: one where imperial cruisers battled rebel fighters, where droids rubbed circuits with Wookiees and where a spaceship called the Millennium Falcon could make the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs. That was 1977 but, in 2015, as the franchise approaches its seventh big-screen instalment, interest in Star Wars shows no sign of abating  now, there is news of a new film about Han Solo and of a reappearance for Darth Vader. Countless fans around the world are in a constant state of vigilance waiting for the release of new poster art, new trailers and other information, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at box-office monitor Rentrak. Its hard to imagine any other movie franchise that could evoke such a level of passion, enthusiasm and excitement. 
The latest Star Wars mania dates from the Hollywood studio Disneys purchase of Lucasfilm from the films creator, George Lucas, in 2012; the $4bn acquisition was accompanied by an announcement of three more sequential episodes  VII, VIII and IX  plus then unspecified plans for spin-off movies and stand-alones to fill the gaps in the release schedule. Details of the second spin-off have now been made public: an origins story about Han Solo, the intergalactic smuggler played by Harrison Ford in the first three films, which is scheduled to be released in May 2018. 
It will follow the release in December 2015 of Episode VII, directed by JJ Abrams and titled Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the unnamed Episode VIII due out in 2017 and the already announced spin-off, Rogue One, which will arrive in cinemas in 2016. 
That movie will outline a rebel mission to steal the plans of the Death Star, a key plot element of the first film in 1977. Levels of interest in the rumour that Rogue One will also feature the reappearance of Darth Vader, the black-clad villain of the original series, only confirmed the power of Star Wars nostalgia. 
In creating a multi-stranded, multi-character cinema universe around Star Wars, Lucasfilm-Disney are taking their cue from the phenomenally successful series of films produced by Marvel Studios, which Disney also acquired, in 2009.  
Disney has brought a whole new level of marketing savvy to an already popular product: Dergarabedian cites the decision to make all six existing Star Wars films available on streaming services as a brilliant way to build the anticipation for the new film and reinvigorate the idea of Star Wars in the minds of the fans. 
Whether it needs reinvigorating is questionable. The level of enthusiasm that has surrounded Star Wars for at least the last two decades is evidenced by what has become known as the Expanded Universe: the plethora of novels, comic books, video games and merchandising that Lucasfilm has created or licensed over the years. 
This extra material began emerging as far back as 1978 but was given a massive kick by the mushrooming of the internet in the 1990s. Role-play and fan participation show no sign of slowing: in the UK, event-cinema brand Secret Cinema have found considerable commercial success with their live staging of The Empire Strikes Back. 
Michael Rosser, news editor for Screen International, suggests that it is this shared universe of highly infectious nostalgia that keeps Star Wars in pole position among film franchises. The great thing about the original films was that they created a huge universe of characters and possibility that sparked the imagination of viewers, he said. 
For years, people have been wondering how the different strands would play out. This new film, because its going back to Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, looks as though it will reconnect with the original Star Wars in a way that the prequels failed to. 
Rosser is referring to the three films Lucas directed between 1999 and 2005  The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith  which chronicled the life of Luke Skywalkers father, Anakin, who transforms into Darth Vader. Despite being greeted with less-than-stellar reviews, the prequels took $2.5bn at the worldwide box office, shortly after the release of restored and augmented special editions of the first trilogy had netted $469m in 1997. 
It shows the power of Star Wars that, although they were disappointing, the prequels still managed to make a lot of money, said Rosser. 
In a film business where branding is all and a successful franchise the answer to everybodys prayers, is there a risk that movie studios will simply become branding machines and lose their interest in cinema for its own sake? 
Rosser thinks not. They are desperate to ensure the longevity of the franchise and make sure the quality is kept up. They are also trying to bring people into the cinema at a time when lots are staying home for entertainment. But you dont want to watch Star Wars on your iPhone so I dont think its going to run out of steam any time soon. 
Meanwhile, Dergarabedian is anticipating massive business when The Force Awakens reaches cinemas in December 2015. We are certainly looking at a record opening for December and it should go on to make at least a billion dollars worldwide. Truly, Star Wars is the ultimate movie brand.

70,"When two islanders spotted a small fibreglass boat washed up on a remote Pacific atoll, they decided to take a closer look. What they found inside was a tale of adventure and unlikely survival to rival the blockbuster book and film Life of Pi: an emaciated man with long hair and a beard, who claimed to have been drifting for 16 months after setting out from Mexico, more than 12,500km away. 
The man, dressed only in a ragged pair of underpants, told his rescuers that he had been adrift in the 7.3-metre fibreglass boat, whose engines were missing their propellers, since he left Mexico for El Salvador in September 2012. A companion had died at sea several months earlier, he said. 
His condition isnt good, but hes getting better, said Ola Fjeldstad, a Norwegian anthropology student doing research on the isolated Ebon Atoll, part of the Marshall Islands archipelago. The man had said his name was Jos Ivan and he had indicated that he survived by catching turtles and birds with his bare hands, but, because he spoke only Spanish, further details were sketchy. There was no fishing equipment on the boat, but a turtle was inside when it washed up. The boat is really scratched up and looks like it has been in the water for a long time, Fjeldstad told reporters. 
According to the researcher, the islanders who found the man took him to the main island in the atoll  which is so remote it has only one phone line and no internet  to meet the mayor, Ione de Brum, who contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Majuro, the Marshall Islands capital. Officials at the ministry said that they were awaiting more details and expected the man to be taken to the capital. 
The government airlines only plane that can land at Ebon is currently undergoing maintenance and is not expected to return to service for several days. Officials are considering sending a boat to pick up the castaway. Hes staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him, said Fjeldstad, who added that the man had a basic health check and was found to have low blood pressure, but did not appear to have any life-threatening conditions and was able to walk with the aid of men on the island. Weve been giving him a lot of water and hes gaining strength. 
Fraser Christian, who teaches maritime survival courses at his Coastal Survival School in Dorset, said the mans story, if true, would be remarkable but far from unique. It was entirely possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand, he said, since they are inquisitive and they will approach a small boat to shelter underneath it. Christian advises clients who find themselves forced to eat turtles to start with their eyes  lots of fluid  then move on to the blood. 
he major problems the man would have faced were exposure and dehydration. The basic rule is: no water, no food. You need water to digest protein. If you have no fresh water and it doesnt rain for a few days, so you cant collect rainwater, you have basically had it. Individual physiology also plays a part, he said, with some people better suited to survival than others. The mental thing is key and thats often down to peoples situation in life and how used they are to dealing mentally with hardship. 
Stories of survival in the vast Pacific Ocean are not uncommon. In 2006, three Mexicans made international headlines when they were discovered drifting, also in a small fibreglass boat near the Marshall Islands. They claimed to have survived for nine months at sea on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds, with their hope kept alive by reading the Bible. But Cliff Downing, who teaches sea survival to sailors, said he was sceptical about the latest tale. It just doesnt sound right to me. There are 1,001 hazards that would make his survival for so long very unlikely. One would want to know a lot more. 
More castaways: Poon Lim, a Chinese sailor from a British ship sunk by a German submarine in 1942, survived 133 days on a wooden raft floating in the South Atlantic before being rescued by Brazilian fishermen. In 1971, experienced Scottish sailor Dougal Robertson and his family were sailing to the Galpagos Islands from Panama when their boat was sunk by killer whales. They survived 38 days on a lifeboat before being rescued by a passing fishing trawler. 
In 2006, three Mexican fishermen were discovered drifting in a small boat near the Marshall Islands, nine months after setting out on a shark-fishing expedition. They apparently survived on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds. Before being rescued by the US coastguard, the men stayed alive by eating tuna. A Panamanian fisherman sued Princess Cruises in 2012 after one of their ships ignored cries for help from him and two companions who were stranded in their broken boat. He survived 28 days adrift, but his friends both died of thirst.

47,"Scientists have implanted a false memory in the brains of mice in an experiment that they hope will shed light on the well-documented phenomenon whereby people remember events or experiences that have never happened. False memories are a major problem with witness statements in courts of law. 
Defendants have often been convicted of offences based on eyewitness testimony only to have their convictions later overturned when DNA, or some other corroborating evidence, is brought to bear. 
In order to study how these false memories might form in the human brain, Susumu Tonagawa, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and his team encoded memories in the brains of mice by manipulating individual neurons. Memories of experiences we have had are made from several elements, including records of objects, space and time. These records, called engrams, are encoded in physical and chemical changes in brain cells and the connections between them. 
According to Tonagawa, both false and genuinememories seem to rely on the same brain mechanisms. In their work, Tonagawas team used a technique known as optogenetics, which allows the fine control of individual brain cells. They engineered brain cells in the mouse hippocampus, a part of the brain known to be involved in forming memories, to express the gene for a protein called channelrhodopsin. When cells that contain channelrhodopsin are exposed to blue light, they become activated. The researchers also modified the hippocampus cells so that the channelrhodopsin protein would be produced in whichever brain cells the mouse was using to encode its memory engrams. 
In the experiment, Tonagawas team placed the mice in a chamber and allowed them to explore it. As they did so, relevant memory-encoding brain cells were producing the channelrhodopsin protein. The next day, the same mice were placed in a second chamber and given a small electric shock, to encode a fear response. At the same time, the researchers shone light into the mouse brains to activate their memories of the first chamber. That way, the mice learned to associate fear of the electric shock with the memory of the first chamber. 
In the final part of the experiment, the team placed the mice back in the first chamber. 
The mice froze, demonstrating a typical fear response, even though they had never been shocked while there. We call this incepting or implanting false memories in a mouse brain, Tonagawa told Science. 
A similar process may occur when powerful false memories are created in humans. Humans are very imaginative animals, said Tonagawa. Independent of what is happening around you in the outside world, humans constantly have internal activity in the brain. So, just like our mouse, it is quite possible we can associate what we happen to have in our mind with bad or good high-variance ongoing events. In other words, there could be a false association of what you have in your mind rather than what is happening to you. 
He added: Our study showed that the false memory and the genuine memory are based on very similar, almost identical, brain mechanisms. It is difficult for the false memory bearer to distinguish between them. We hope our future findings along this line will further alert legislatures and legal experts to how unreliable memory can be. 
Chris French, head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths, University of London, is a leading researcher in false memories in people. He said that the latest results were an important first step in understanding their neural basis. 
Memory researchers have always recognized that memory does not, as is often assumed, work like a video camera, faithfully recording all of the details of anything we experience. Instead, it is a reconstructive process, which involves building a specific memory from fragments of real memory traces of the original event, but also possibly including information from other sources. He cautioned that the false memories created in the mice in the experiments were far simpler than the complex false memories that have generated controversy within psychology and psychiatry  for example, false memories of childhood sexual abuse, or even memories for bizarre ritualized satanic abuse, abduction by aliens, or past lives . Such rich false memories will clearly involve many brain systems and we are still a long way from understanding the processes involved in their formation at the neuronal level, said Professor French. 
Mark Stokes, a neuroscientist at Oxford University, said the experiments were a tour de force but that it was important to put them into perspective. Although the results seem to imply that new memories were formed by the artificial stimulation (rather than the actual environment), this kind of phenomenon is still a long way from most peoples idea of memory, he said. Rather, he said, it was equivalent to implanting an association that perhaps someone cannot place but that makes them wary of a specific environment for no apparent reason. It is unlikely that this kind of pairing could lead to the rich set of associations related to normal memories, although it is possible that, over time, such pairing could be integrated with other memories to construct a more elaborate false narrative. 
The mouse models created by the MIT team will help scientists ask ever more complex questions about memories in people. Now that we can reactivate and change the contents of memories in the brain, we can begin asking questions that were once the realm of philosophy, said Steve Ramirez, a colleague of Tonagawas at MIT. Are there multiple conditions that lead to the formation of false memories? Can false memories be artificially created? What about false memories for more than just contexts  false memories for objects, food or other mice? These are the once seemingly sci-fi questions that can now be experimentally tackled in the lab. 
As the technology develops, said French, scientists need to think about its uses carefully. Whatever means are used to implant false memories, we need to be very aware of the ethical issues raised by such procedures  the potential for abuse of such techniques cannot be overstated.

142,"They are the darkness seekers  and they are growing in number. On Black Fell, looking down on Northumberlands beautiful Kielder Water reservoir, a group of people wait in a car park next to a strange wooden building with a minimalist design beamed down from the future. This is Kielder Observatory, the centre of Britains nascent astrotourism industry. And those waiting outside were the lucky ones. Many more had applied for a night of stargazing at the observatory but numbers are strictly limited. 
Inside, next to a woodburner and under dimmed lights, the observatorys founder and lead astronomer, Gary Fildes, a former bricklayer with Tarzan hair, delivers a pep talk to his colleagues and volunteers. The team discusses the prospect of seeing the northern lights but Fildes is doubtful. Instead, they decide to train their powerful telescopes on Jupiter and Venus and later to pick out stars such as Capella and Betelgeuse. An additional attraction is the appearance of the International Space Station. 
Remember, Fildes tells his team, its about interaction, its about entertainment, its about inspiring people. He puts on some music. Pink Floyd, the Jam, the Pogues. By 9.30, the sky is going to be sexy, Fildes says. Its going to be epic. 
Fildes, 49, is at the forefront of the UKs burgeoning astrotourism industry. The pivotal moment for Northumberland came in 2013 when the entire national park housing Hadrians Wall, along with Kielder Water and Forest Park, some 1,500 sq km, was awarded Dark Sky Park status, the only one in England. Dark Sky Parks are rare. The 2013 Star Count revealed that only 5% of the UK population can see more than 31 stars on a good night. 
The Tucson, Arizona-based International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) confers the status only on places that take major steps to avoid light pollution. Recipients must also prove their night skies are sufficiently dark. In Northumberland Dark Sky Park, as the area was rebadged, it is so dark that Venus casts a shadow on the Earth. 
Duncan Wise, visitor development officer for the Northumberland National Park Authority, helped to spearhead the campaign for dark-sky status after the Council for the Protection of Rural England found it was one of Britains most tranquil places. We tend to look at landscape as everything up to the horizon, Wise said. But what about whats above it? Wise and others spent years drawing up their submission to the IDA, collecting reams of light readings and forming an alliance of local councils, parks bodies and community groups to produce an exterior lighting master plan that influences the construction of new developments in the area. 
Their efforts have been vindicated. Many of the 1.5 million who visit Northumberland each year are now aware of its Dark Sky status. We get a lot of people coming here to see the sky now, says the man at the car-hire firm in Newcastle. They come in autumn and winter, when its darkest. Good for the B&Bs as they get business all year round now. Local hoteliers now issue guests with night-vision torches and put out deckchairs at night. Those who have acquired some knowledge of astronomy can receive a badge confirming that their hotels are Dark Sky Friendly. 
Wise acknowledges that Northumberland needs to do more to capitalize on its scarce resource and believes the region needs a couple more observatories to ensure that visitors will see what they came for. A 14m national landscape discovery centre, which he describes as the norths answer to the Eden Project, will have an observatory when it is completed in a couple of years. 
Fildes has grand designs. He is planning Britains first astrovillage, one that would house the largest public observatory in the world and boast a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, a one-metre aperture telescope, and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes. The multimillion-pound project would feature a hotel and draw in 100,000 people a year, four times the number currently able to use the observatory. Fildes is cryptic about his backers but believes the astrovillage will be a reality by 2018. 
However, Northumberland faces competition. Galloway Forest Park in Scotland also has Dark Sky Park status. Since Exmoor was designated Europes first International Dark Sky Reserve  one notch below Dark Sky Park  in 2011, a range of local businesses offering stargazing breaks and safaris has sprung up. The UK will have to go some way to eclipse northern Chile, which boasts more than a dozen tourist observatories and has some of the clearest skies in the world. The Teide National Park in Tenerife is also becoming a major astrotourism destination. 
So, what is driving the desire to look upwards? The media have helped. TV presenters like Brian Cox have attracted a new generation of stargazers. Brian Cox has made astronomy accessible, says Wise. Its no longer seen as the province of professors in studies with brass telescopes. Technology has also played a part. Apps such as Stellarium now turn smartphones into pocket-size planetariums. Ultimately, though, Fildes believes people are starting to appreciate what lies above. If you had to build a visitor attraction from scratch, what could be better than the universe?

87,"In 2005, BlackBerry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone and the company was just entering its period of success. Then, the iPhone was still just an idea and BlackBerrys innovations made its smartphone one of Canadas biggest exports. 
Six years later, in the summer of 2011, there were riots in London and other UK cities. Rioters used BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) and politicians wanted the service to shut down. But, two years later, the users themselves are leaving BBM. 
Fewer and fewer people want BlackBerry phones. There are now many alternative products, from Facebooks and Apples instant messaging applications to independent apps such as WhatsApp and Kik (which is also Canadian). They are free to download and use, and they use the internet to swap text messages, pictures, voice clips, 'stickers' and even videos between most types of phones. 
BBM is trying to keep its customers and you can now use it on Android and Apple phones. There are many other apps people can use, but lots of people want to use the BBM app  more than 20 million people downloaded it. But many people believe BBM will not survive. The move to bring BlackBerry to the iPhone is four or five years too late, says James Gooderson, a technology blogger. WhatsApp has made BlackBerrys unnecessary for young people. 
BBM says it has 80 million monthly users after its upgrade, but WhatsApp has 300 million. Other services show BBMs weaknesses: Skype and Viber have video or voice calls, but BBM doesnt; Path does location sharing, but BBM doesnt; there is no video sharing, as on iMessage; and the stickers (a more sophisticated version of the smiley face), that kids around the world adore, are also absent. Even the contacts and calendar sharing that BBM made possible on BlackBerry phones are not on the Apple and Android versions. 
Messaging is now becoming visual. Photos that are uploaded to Instagram get instant comments and Snapchats pictures have opened a world of other possibilities. Like BBM, all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection. But, in 2011, BBM was so powerful that it helped to start a revolution in Egypt; and at the time of the London riots, people used BBM, not their televisions, to find out quickly what was happening. 
Nearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application but two-thirds use more than one. 60% of 16- to 24-year-olds use Facebook every day, but 46% use alternatives. Its much more complex, says Benedict Evans, a digital media specialist. All of these apps use your smartphone. Apps rise and fall like fireworks. Some, like Instagram, last; others just disappear. 
Thirteen-year-old Bennett has three phones. He keeps his BlackBerry for messaging, he uses an iPhone to play games, and he makes phone calls on an Android phone. His friends are still on BBM. At the touch of a few buttons, you can send a single BlackBerry message to several hundred people; on WhatsApp, the limit is 50. But, for Bennett, Instagram is now a major social network. Instagram is Facebook without parents, he says. Facebook is now for older people. The low cost of buying and using a BlackBerry is still an advantage. Anyone with a second-hand phone and a 7-a-month deal from a telecoms company can use unlimited BBM messages. But people no longer trust the privacy of BBM. Business people, revolutionaries, demonstrators and rioters used to believe that their messages were secret. The arrests that followed the riots showed that wasnt true. 
In the rich London district of South Kensington, the older pupils at one school all have Apple phones. They all use WhatsApp. For many, BBM is a distant memory. I still have a Blackberry, but Im the only one, says one teenager. And how does that make him feel?

185,"Two scientists at Stanford University, in the USA, used metadata on peoples telephone calls and texts to find out peoples names, where they lived and the names of their partners. The metadata told them what number people called, when and for how long but it didnt tell them what people said. 
But, that was not all. With the same metadata, they could find out private information about some people. They discovered that one man had a gun and that another man had a heart problem. Other data told them that someone was having a baby and someone had a serious illness. 
The results show the extraordinary power of telephone metadata. It is particularly powerful when you use it together with information from Google, Yelp and Facebook. 
Then, the scientists used a simple computer program to analyse peoples calls and this helped them to see who was in a relationship. Once they knew the owner of a particular phone number had a partner, it was easy to find out who the partner was, they said. 
For the final part of the study, the researchers looked even deeper to see what private information they could get from telephone metadata. They collected details on calls made to and from places such as hospitals, pharmacies, religious groups, legal services and gun shops. From these, they produced interesting pictures of peoples lives. 
Mutchler said the study showed how easy it is to find out private information about people. He says that the results should make governments think twice before they record this information. Metadata programmes, like the NSAs, will show very private information about ordinary people, the scientists said. 
Stewart Baker, who worked at the US National Security Agency (NSA), said Metadata tells you everything about somebodys life. 
Patrick Mutchler, a researcher at Stanford, said that people who collect the information understand the power of metadata but that the public was in the dark. 
For the study, 823 people agreed for researchers to collect metadata from their phones using an app. The app also received information from their Facebook pages, which the scientists used to check their results. The scientists collected metadata on more than 250,000 calls and over 1.2 million texts. 
With very little money, Mutchler and Jonathan Mayer found out a lot of personal information about the people in the study. Some of the information was private. They found out 82% of peoples names. The same method gave them the names of businesses the people called. When they marked these on a map, they showed groups of local businesses, which the scientists guessed were near the persons home address. In this way, they named the city people lived in 57% of the time and were nearly 90% correct in guessing, within 50 miles, where people lived.

65,"The brand and logo of Apple are the most valuable in the world. They are worth nearly $119 billion  that is more than the economies of Morocco, Ecuador or Oman. 
The brand value of Apple, the worlds biggest company, has increased by 21% in 12 months, the Interbrand Best Global Brands report said. 
People all around the world recognize Apple by its simple Apple with a bite missing logo. Other technology companies have also done very well in the 2014 report. The technology companies pushed more traditional brands  such as Coca-Cola, McDonalds and Gillette  down the table. 
Googles brand value rose by 15% to $107 billion to take second place. Coca-Cola, in third place, is up 3% to $81.5 billion. IBMs value is $72.2 billion and Microsofts $45.5 billion. They are in fourth and fifth places. 
Facebooks value has increased the most in the table. Its brand value increased by 86% to $14.3 billion. It is at 29th place in the table, ahead of older global companies such as Volkswagen, Kelloggs and Ford. 
Apple was started by Steve Jobs in his Los Altos garage in 1976. It only appeared in the top ten of the Interbrand annual study in 2011. 
Its logo was created by advertising executive Rob Janoff in 1977. It was designed with a bite taken out of it so that it would not look like a cherry. 
Graham Hayles, Interbrands chief marketing officer, said, Apple makes a lot of money because it has a very strong brand. If you have a strong brand, you make more money. 
Many technology companies rose up the chart but some fell, too. Finnish mobile-phone company Nokia dropped 41 places to 98th at $4.1 billion, just ahead of Nintendo in 100th place (down 33). 
A Chinese company has appeared in the top 100 for the first time, with mobile-phone and broadband company Huawei at 94th place. It has a brand value of $4.3 billion. 
Most of the brands in the top 100 are American. The most valuable non-American brands are South Koreas Samsung (6th), Japans Toyota (8th) and Germanys Mercedes-Benz (10th). The most valuable British brands are HSBC (33rd), Shell (65th) and Burberry (73rd). 
Other fashion brands in the top 100 include Boss, Prada and Ralph Lauren. Designer label Louis Vuitton is the top fashion name, in 19th position with a value of $23 billion, just ahead of clothing chain H&M, with a brand value of $21 billion in place 21. 
Sports brand Nike is at place 22 with a brand value of nearly $20 billion, ahead of its rival Adidas at place 59 with a value of $7 billion. 
Jez Frampton, chief executive of Interbrand, said that customers now have more control than ever over a brands reputation. This is because they can make comments about a brand on social media, such as Twitter. 
Customers expect interaction, 24/7 accessibility, customization options and high levels of personalization, he said.

31,"A new report says that almost one billion people will remain in extreme poverty by 2030 if countries dont try to solve the social, economic and cultural problems that keep them poor. The report by the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network says that many people may rise above the poverty line of $1.25 a day, but fall back again when they have problems such as drought or illness and insecurity or conflict.
The report found that, in parts of rural Kenya and in South Africa, 30 to 40% of people who escaped from poverty fell back again. This percentage rose to 60% in some areas of Ethiopia between 1999 and 2009. Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, the proportion was 20%.
Individual examples show how easy it is for people to fall back into poverty. Amin is from a village in Bangladesh. His income has fallen slowly, because of his illness and his wifes illness, the cost of his sons marriage, the death of his father and loss of goods such as fishing nets. Lovemore, from Zimbabwe, is now one of the poorest people in his village. He recently lost his job because of ill health and has to look after his five grandchildren after the death of his daughters.
We need to make sure that people who come out of poverty remain above the poverty line permanently. Too many families return to poverty when they have personal or bigger problems. Governments shouldnt assume that, just because somebodys income hits $1.25, that means the problem is solved, said Andrew Shepherd, the main author of the report.
According to the UN, the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 is still possible. But the report says that countries need to make changes to achieve zero poverty. There was a drop in extreme poverty from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 1.2 billion in 2010, but the report says that progress in the next 15 years will be much more difficult. There has been a lot of progress in China but there will probably not be similar progress in other parts of the world.
The report says countries should try to help the chronically poor  those who are poor for many years or their entire lives  and stop people becoming poor. Governments have been quite good at moving people over the poverty line because that is quite easy. But they have avoided the more difficult job of trying to reduce chronic poverty, said Shepherd.
The report says progress on poverty reduction has helped people who were already closer to the poverty line, but has helped the chronically poor much less. It will not be possible to get to zero poverty if development policies dont focus on the chronically poor, it adds. The report suggests three ideas. They all cost a lot of money.
The first is social help  to bring the poorest people closer to a good-enough standard of living. The second is education, from early childhood to the start of work, so people can escape and stay out of poverty. The third is economic growth policies that make sure that the benefits of increasing national wealth reach the poorest people.
All this will cost money and the report says higher taxes will be necessary. Aid will also be necessary for the start-up costs for social assistance, healthcare for everyone and to finance education. There remains a huge role for aid in the next 20 years, as many developing countries spend less than $500 on each of their citizens a year. Even Nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per person, Shepherd said.
The authors say governments should have a national development plan and make sure the poorest people are represented politically as well as trying to stop difficult social customs, such as dowries and witchcraft, that make extreme poverty worse.

177,"Swiss police recently entered the Baur Au Lac hotel in Zurich at dawn and arrested 16 football officials, including five current or former FIFA executives. They were later charged with corruption in the US. The officials included the former Brazilian federation chief Ricardo Teixeira and his successor, Marco Polo Del Nero. 
They were among 16 individuals accused of fraud and other crimes by the US Department of Justice. The US has now charged 27 defendants, including former FIFA executives. The level of corruption is completely unacceptable, said the US Attorney General, Loretta Lynch. 
Swiss police arrested the president of the South American football confederation, the Paraguayan Juan ngel Napout, and Alfredo Hawit, the head of the North and Central American and Caribbean governing body. Hawit started his job after Jeffrey Webb left the job in May 2015 because he was arrested. This was part of the US operation that led to a crisis at FIFA and caused Sepp Blatter to lose his job and reputation. 
The Swiss Federal Office of Justice said of the latest arrests: They are in custody before their extradition. The US believes they accepted bribes of millions of dollars. Webb and the Colombian former executive Luis Bedoya entered guilty pleas in the US. 
Eleven current and former FIFA executives have now been charged in the investigation, which alleges $200m in bribes, mainly from TV and marketing contracts but also FIFAs development programmes. 
The message from this announcement should be clear to everyone who hopes to escape our investigation: you will not escape, said Lynch. Teixeira, the former son-in-law of the FIFA ex-president Joo Havelange, was charged together with Del Nero and his predecessor Jos Maria Marin, who was charged in May 2015. 
Fourteen men were charged in May 2015. Days later, Blatter won a fifth term as president but then agreed to leave his job as the crisis grew. He was then suspended together with the UEFA President, Michel Platini, because of an alleged 1.3m payment to the Frenchman. Both men might get life bans when the FIFA ethics committee hears their case in December if they are found guilty. 
Among those also charged on Thursday were Rafael Salguero, a Guatemalan who left the executive committee in May; the former South American confederation secretary general Eduardo Deluca; former Peruvian football federation president Manuel Burga; and Bolivias football president, Carlos Chaves, already jailed in his own country. 
Lynch said: The Department of Justice really wants to end the corruption in the leadership of international football  not only because there is such a lot of corruption but also because the corruption is an insult to international principles. 
The acting FIFA President, Issa Hayatou, refused to comment on the detail of the latest arrests. But he said neither he nor the organization was corrupt. Hayatou appeared for the first time before the media since he started the job in September, when Blatter was suspended, and said the current crisis was the fault of a few bad people. 
FIFA is not corrupt. We have some people that have shown negative behaviour. But not everyone in FIFA is corrupt, said Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football for more than 25 years. There are lots of people who have been in FIFA for more than 20 or 30 years that have not been accused of anything.

Throughout the 1970s, Bowie was a trailblazer of musical trends and pop fashion. He became a singer-songwriter, a pioneer of glam-rock, then became involved in plastic soul. 
He then moved to Berlin to create innovative electronic music. Bowie was born David Robert Jones in south London. At 15, David formed his first band, the Kon-rads, but it was soon clear that David should go solo. 
David took the name Bowie so people wouldnt confuse him with Davy Jones of the Monkees. 
Bowies first album, released in June 1967, was titled simply David Bowie. In July 1969, Bowie released Space Oddity, the song that would give him his first big success. Timed to coincide with the Apollo 11 moon landing, it was a top five UK hit. The Man Who Sold the World was released in the US in late 1970 and in the UK the following year. With its daring songwriting and hard-rock sound, it was the first album to really show his talents. He followed it with 1972s Hunky Dory, a mix of wordy, elaborate songwriting. It was an excellent collection that was not a great success. But that all changed with The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars later that year. 
This time, Bowie appeared as Ziggy Stardust, a science-fiction character  an intergalactic glam-rock star visiting planet Earth. The hit single Starman brought instant success for the album. 
Everything Bowie touched turned to gold. He had his first UK number 1 album with Aladdin Sane (1973), which included the hit singles The Jean Genie and Drive-in Saturday. 
His interest in funk and soul music could be heard on the album Young Americans (1975), which included the single Fame (with John Lennon as a guest singer). 
With the album Station to Station (1976), Bowie turned himself into a new character, the Thin White Duke. 
Bowie and his wife divorced in 1980. This was a year of more creative success, with a good album, Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and its hit single, Ashes to Ashes. 
After this, he played the title role in The Elephant Man on the Broadway stage. 
He achieved a number 1 single with his 1981 partnership with Queen, Under Pressure. 1983 was the year in which he put his energy into the album Lets Dance and his concerts. Lets Dance turned Bowie into a global rock star  the album and its singles Lets Dance, China Girl and Modern Love all became huge international hits. 
The early 80s was the heyday of MTV. Bowies talent for making eye-catching videos increased his popularity and the six-month Serious Moonlight tour attracted lots of people. It was to be the most commercially successful period of his career. 
At the 1985 Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium, Bowie was one of the best performers. Also, that year, he worked with Mick Jagger to record the fundraising single Dancing in the Street , which quickly went to number 1. 
A few days after he performed at the Freddie Mercury tribute concert at Wembley Stadium in April 1992, Bowie married the Somalian model Iman and bought a home in New York. 
For the album Black Tie White Noise (1993), he included elements of soul and hip hop. It went to the top of the UK album chart and gave him a top 10 single, Jump They Say . 
Bowie performed at the Concert for New York City in October 2001, where he joined Paul McCartney, Jon Bon Jovi, Billy Joel, the Who and Elton John in a benefit show six weeks after the 9/11 attacks. 
During his Reality tour in 2004, Bowie had chest pains while he was performing in Germany and needed emergency surgery in Hamburg. 
He saw the medical emergency as a warning and started to slow down. In February 2006, he was given a Grammy lifetime achievement award. He was entered into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.

172,"Galina Zaglumyonova was woken in her flat in central Chelyabinsk by a very big explosion that broke the balcony windows and broke pots containing her houseplants. When she jumped out of bed she could see a huge vapour trail in the morning sky and hear car alarms from the street below. 
I didnt understand what was going on, said Zaglumyonova. There was a big explosion and then lots of little explosions. My first thought was that it was a plane crash. In fact, it was a ten-tonne meteorite that fell to Earth in lots of pieces. 
Almost 1,200 people were injured. More than 40 people were taken to hospital  most of them were hurt by flying glass. There were no deaths. 
The meteorite entered the atmosphere at a speed of at least 33,000 miles per hour and broke into pieces between 18 and 32 miles above the ground.
The event caused panic in Chelyabinsk, a city of more than one million people to the south of Russias Ural mountains. People could see the vapour trail for hundreds of miles, even from neighbouring Kazakhstan. 
Tatyana Bets was at work in the reception area of a hospital clinic in the centre of the city when the meteorite hit. First we noticed the wind, and then the room was filled with a very bright light and we could see smoke in the sky, she said. Then, after a few minutes, the explosions came. 
At least three craters were found. One crater was more than six metres wide. Another piece of meteorite broke through the thick ice of a lake. 
In Chelyabinsk, schools and universities were closed and people were told to go home early. About 200 children were injured. 
Many people, mostly with cuts from flying glass, came into the clinic where Bets works. She said many of the students at a nearby college came to the hospital. There were a lot of girls in shock, she said. 
More than 100,000 square metres of glass were broken and 3,000 buildings were hit. The total cost of the damage in the city is probably more than one billion roubles (20 million). 
The meteorite arrived a day before asteroid 2012 DA14 passed Earth very closely (about 17,510 miles). But experts said the two events were not connected. 
There were lots of rumours in the first few hours after the incident. Reports on Russian state television and in local media suggested that the Russian military blew apart the meteorite. 
The ultra-nationalist leader of Russias Liberal Democrat party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, said it was not a meteorite. He said it was a weapons test by the United States. 
Some people were selling pieces of meteorite through internet sites within a few hours of the impact. 
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said that it shows us that the whole planet is vulnerable.

107,"You probably know a vaper  someone who smokes e-cigarettes. But has vaping started to become less popular? Statistics suggest that smokers and recent ex-smokers (the majority of vapers) may already be using e-cigarettes less. The big e-cigarette companies will study the gures carefully because they have spent millions of pounds on a technology that they thought was becoming more popular.
E-cigarettes do not contain tobacco and produce vapour, not smoke. In 2014, the health charity Action on Smoking and Health published gures that showed that the number of British users of electronic cigarettes has increased three times from 700,000 users in 2012 to 2.1 million in 2014.
But gures from the Smoking Toolkit Study show vaping may be becoming less popular. The number of vapers who are smokers and ex- smokers rose until the end of 2013, when 22% of smokers and ex-smokers were vaping. But this percentage stopped rising in 2014. Then, it dropped to 19% at the end of the year. Professor Robert West, who collected the data for the Toolkit, described the gures as statistically important.
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette companies because seven out of ten vapers are smokers. Only around 1% of people who have never smoked have tried an electronic cigarette. The number of people who use e-cigarettes while continuing to smoke is going down, West said. Weve only been studying vaping for just over a year, so its a short time period, but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or never  smokers using e-cigarettes. The number of people vaping might change but, at the moment, it looks like its staying the same. 
Experts believe that vaping will probably not become fashionable with young non-smokers.  Only 1.8% of children are regular e-cigarette users. But e-cigarettes seem to be most popular with adults who want to quit. The gures published this month show that the use of electronic cigarettes by smokers has stopped rising. But the gures also show the huge increase in use since May 2011, said James Dunworth, of ecigarettedirect.co.uk. Our customers are still very happy with the product and technology is improving their experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes.
E-cigarettes are like a sort of nicotine patch, West agreed. They are more popular than nicotine patches but we do not know if they are more effective. One-third of people who want to quit smoking use e-cigarettes. They are the most popular method of stopping.
The European Commission (EC) wants to increase taxes on e-cigarettes, which could make them less popular. A new EC tobacco directive becomes law in 2016. It will limit the amount of nicotine in e-cigarettes to below their current levels. This may mean vapers will have to increase the number they smoke to get the same effect. This is another thing that may make e-cigarettes more expensive.
West suggested that politicians should see e-cigarettes as something that helps people stop smoking. He doesnt think they should follow the same laws as smoking. Some local authorities and organizations treat e-cigarettes like cigarettes  they ban them in public places and outdoors, he said. He thinks we should support vapers not attack them.",0,Ele-Txt,2,0.3086627423763275,0.2737562954425812,0.4175809323787689,1,0.29649439454078674,0.3848521411418915,0.3186535239219665,0,0.4115718007087708,0.32083964347839355,0.2675884962081909,0,0.4876315891742706,0.3217887878417969,0.19057968258857727,0,0.5247462391853333,0.3194156289100647,0.15583811700344086,0,0.6825674772262573,0.2061603218317032,0.11127226054668428,0,0.7315061092376709,0.18525667488574984,0.08323723077774048,0,0.7511921525001526,0.17505143582820892,0.0737563967704773,0,0.7513652443885803,0.2036919295787812,0.04494287073612213,0,0.8049888610839844,0.15748226642608645,0.03752884268760681,0,0.8345168828964233,0.13101182878017426,0.034471284598112106,0,0.7695690393447876,0.19489090144634247,0.03554004803299904,0,0.8536806106567383,0.12072352319955824,0.025595864281058308,0,0.8591166138648987,0.1163485422730446,0.024534912779927254,0,0.8564032912254333,0.11982134729623795,0.023775417357683185,0,0.5066851973533629,0.1894359439611435,0.3038788437843323,0,0.5503113865852356,0.20005367696285248,0.2496349513530731,0,0.4712482988834381,0.3198246955871582,0.2089270055294037,0,0.5777379274368286,0.23037281632423398,0.1918891966342926,0,0.6080796718597412,0.2160517126321793,0.17586863040924072,0,0.7435919046401978,0.1729150265455246,0.08349309116601944,0,0.427232950925827,0.2687765657901764,0.30399051308631897,0,0.8034651279449463,0.18255002796649933,0.013984904624521729,0,0.800373911857605,0.18691806495189667,0.01270797848701477,0,0.9182684421539308,0.0720241442322731,0.009707462042570114,0,0.943138301372528,0.05111662298440933,0.005745150614529847,0,0.9559353590011596,0.03985035791993141,0.004214312415570021,0,0.9503358602523804,0.04605715721845627,0.003607002552598715,0,0.9630082845687866,0.03380019962787628,0.0031915337312966585,0,0.9643919467926024,0.03254960849881172,0.003058392787352205,1,0.34462305903434753,0.3633940815925598,0.29198282957077026,1,0.33583423495292664,0.36478391289711,0.2993818521499634,0,0.35943156480789185,0.2881412506103516,0.3524271547794342,2,0.3613613545894623,0.03036866150796413,0.608269989490509,0,0.7468741536140442,0.029375571757555008,0.22375035285949707,0,0.8645499348640442,0.012521114200353622,0.1229289323091507,0,0.8824666738510132,0.008498698472976685,0.1090346947312355,0,0.9332443475723268,0.008568313904106617,0.05818730592727661,0,0.9687559604644777,0.01554700080305338,0.015696996822953224,0,0.9803860783576964,0.007139584980905056,0.012474323622882366,0,0.9726439714431764,0.004531675018370152,0.02282432466745377,0,0.9456738829612732,0.0040735905058681965,0.0502525307238102,0,0.9582971334457396,0.003945713862776756,0.037757202982902534,0,0.9683213829994202,0.003939839545637369,0.027738770470023155,0,0.9706384539604188,0.0037701474502682686,0.02559133619070053,1,0.24569016695022586,0.4865323603153229,0.2677774727344513,2,0.2924174666404724,0.3281157910823822,0.3794667720794678,0,0.5219139456748962,0.2027442306280136,0.27534177899360657,1,0.2927713692188263,0.4369727969169617,0.27025580406188965,0,0.8345713615417479,0.06522499024868011,0.1002037078142166,0,0.8755189776420593,0.04492729157209397,0.07955372333526611,0,0.6654316186904907,0.009081589989364149,0.3254867494106293,0,0.8958011269569397,0.007373400032520293,0.09682551026344301,0,0.9058266878128052,0.006953199859708548,0.08722012490034102,0,0.987266719341278,0.0036129418294876814,0.00912033673375845,0,0.9904717206954956,0.0027011095080524683,0.006827130913734436,0,0.9897945523262024,0.0021289791911840443,0.008076483383774756,0,0.9668607711791992,0.002610011026263237,0.030529141426086426,0,0.992238461971283,0.0015848667826503515,0.006176718045026064,0,0.9945093989372253,0.0015386502491310239,0.003952019847929478
37,"For 85 years, it was just a grey blob on classroom maps of the solar system. But, on 15 July, we saw Pluto in high resolution for the first time. The images show dramatic mountains made from solid water ice as big as the Alps or the Rockies. 
The extraordinary images of the former ninth planet and its large moon, Charon, were sent four billion miles back to Earth from the New Horizons spacecraft. 
Alan Stern, the missions principal investigator, said New Horizons is returning amazing results. The data look absolutely gorgeous, and Pluto and Charon are just mind-blowing. 
John Spencer, a mission scientist, said that one of the biggest surprises was the discovery that there are mountains in the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is the solar systems mysterious third zone where Pluto is, with about 100,000 smaller icy objects. He said the mountains are around 3,000 metres high and several hundred miles across. 
Pluto used to be the ninth planet but, since 2006, it has been a dwarf planet. The NASA press conference began with spectacular images of the sun and the eight official planets. 
Stern said the images from New Horizons were just the beginning and that we would learn more about the planet soon. Scientists believe the mountains on Pluto are made from water ice with just a thin cover of methane and nitrogen. 
Water ice is strong enough to hold up big mountains. The images are the first to show ice mountains, except those found on the moons of giant planets. 
The images are so detailed that, if the spacecraft flew over London, we would be able to see the runways at Heathrow airport. 
It is five billion kilometres to Pluto. This means it takes New Horizons hours to send back a picture and it will take 16 months to send back all the data. The team also said that the heart-shaped area on Pluto will be called the Tombaugh Regio, after Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the dwarf planet in 1930. 
The image of Charon shows an area of cliffs about 1,000km long. The image also shows a dramatic canyon 7 to 9km deep. 
Cathy Olkin, a mission scientist, said: Charon just blew our socks off when we saw the new image. The team is so excited. 
Pluto is two thirds rock surrounded by a lot of ice. The temperature is about minus 230C. 
The 460m spacecraft is continuing its journey into the Kuiper belt. Scientists hope that it will help us to see and understand more of the ancient solar system and the origins of planets. It may even help to explain how the Earth was made. 
Andrew Coates, the head of planetary science at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, said: Its a really thrilling time for solar system exploration. 
NASA says that the spacecraft will be able to keep recording and sending images until the mid- 2030s. Then its plutonium power source will run out and it will drift outwards towards the edge of the solar system and deep space beyond.

5,"Governments in Europe dream of finding a magic solution to rising unemployment. But, in the poorest parts of the EU, unemployment continues to rise.
Now, in Sardinia, Italy, a mayor thinks he has found an answer to his towns unemployment problem. Valter Piscedda, the mayor of Elmas, a small town near Sardinias capital, Cagliari, wants to pay residents to leave. The town will pay for ten unemployed local people to take English lessons, get on a cheap flight and look for jobs in other parts of Europe.
This idea comes from common sense and experience,  he told the Guardian. In the past year and a half  especially in the past few months  I have seen young people, almost every day, who have lost hope that they will find work. Some ask for help in finding work here. Others have tried everything and, now, they want to go and gain work experience abroad; life experience, too.
So he decided to help people who want to gain experience abroad.
Sardinia, and also much of southern and central Italy, is struggling with high unemployment. Unemployment was at 17.7% in the second quarter of 2014, according to Italys National Institute of Statistics. More than 54% of people under 25 are out of work. 
For the Adesso Parto (Now Im leaving) programme, Elmas will give 12,000 to the first ten applicants aged between 18 and 50. The applicants must be out of work and have lived in the town for three years. They do not have to be university educated and they must not earn more than 15,000.
The idea of helping people to leave is sensitive at a time when many Italians  many of them clever young graduates  are leaving their country every year. But Piscedda believes that the people he is sending away might return and give me back 100 times what we gave them. More importantly, he wants the scheme to help the people most in need.
In Elmas, the scheme has got mixed reactions. There is little work here, said Alessandro Macis. The opportunity to go abroad to learn about the workplace and experience other cultures can be very worthwhile. The son of a friend of mine who didnt study much is in London and hes doing very well. He started as a waiter. Now, hes a cook and hes learning English.
Others were not sure. I heard about it but I thought it was strange. If you have that money to pay for people to go away, why dont you use that money to keep them here? said Consuelo Melis, who works in a local caf.
But Piscedda says, The work I can create, as mayor, is temporary. I can ask someone to clean a piazza. I can ask them to clean it again. I can ask someone to clean the streets. But these are all temporary things that give nothing more than a little bit of money for a few months.

59,"Anitta, a music star from Brazil, has millions of fans, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour. 
Some people are saying that Anitta had to give up her black skin to be a success in the mostly white middle-class market. 
The debate was started by photographs that show that Anittas skin has got much lighter since she signed a music deal with Warner. 
In the first photo, before she was famous, she looked darker. In the second photo  a marketing photo after she became famous  she seems lighter. The difference has started a discussion about whether you need to have light skin to be a success in Brazil. 
Born Larissa de Macedo Machado, the diva-to-be was a church chorister in her childhood. In her teens, she made a name for herself in Rio de Janeiros baile funk scene as a dancer and singer. 
She now has an album and a huge hit single, Show das Poderosas, which was number one in the charts and attracted 52 million YouTube views. 
Many people love her because she is a pop idol with a strong message and some good pop songs. Her marketing team want people to see her as a cultural bridge between the poor people living in the mostly black and mixed-race shanty towns on Rios hills and the richer and whiter parts below. 
But now people are asking if she  or her marketing team  have gone too far and changed her too much. 
This is a sensitive topic in this mixed-raced country. Brazil has the largest population of African descent outside Africa, but race and where your family come from are less important there than colour. There is a clear link between skin colour and inequality. 
In Brazilian cities, white workers earn twice as much as workers of African descent. Up until 2011, black or mixed-race students also spent two years less at school on average. 
Most business and government executives are white, but black and mixed-race workers do most of the boring or dirty jobs. 
Brazil did a census in 2010. Among the 197 million population, 82 million said they were pardu (mixed race), 15 million black, two million Asian and 0.5% indigenous. 
Maycon de Mattos Batista, a financial analyst who used to work with Anitta, said there has been a huge change in Anittas image, but not of her colour. 
I dont believe she is whiter; its more the makeup, hairstylists and the way she dresses, he said. I dont think that was because of pressure they put on her. She always liked to show off, sing and dance. That was a natural thing for her. I believe that it is because of this naturalness that she has become a success.

53,"Volcanoes, hurricanes and earthquakes can make a city totally disappear. But there are two other things that can make it disappear, too  water and sand.
One hundred years ago, Venice  one of the most beautiful and low-lying cities in the world  used to flood about ten times a year. Now, its lowest point, Piazza San Marco (only three feet above sea level) floods approximately 100 times a year.
But rising sea levels are not the only cause. In many parts of the world, the land is also sinking. In Venice, the city sank by 20cm between 1950 and 1970. Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam is also sinking by about 2cm a year  but the situation in Jakarta is much worse  it is sinking 10 to 20cm every year. In the past three decades, the city has sunk four metres.
The Indonesian capital has pumped out so much water to support its population that the land above is too dry. This is creating a bowl.
There are many plans to save Venice, and Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta are taking the problem seriously. But it is not same in Miami where politicians will not accept that the city has a serious problem.
There are three main problems in Miami. It is less than ten feet above sea level; an increasing number of tropical storms are flooding the city; and it is built on porous rock, which absorbs the rising seawater. This water then fills the citys foundations and comes up through drains and pipes. This forces sewage upwards and pollutes the citys fresh water. It is possible that it may, one day, be impossible to live in Miami.
In the Maldives, the populations of whole islands may leave their homes. The capital is Mal. It has a population of 153,379 and is only four feet above sea level. Mal has built a ten-foot sea wall, which cost $63 million. But, in the long term, Mal and the rest of the islands will only be safe if sea levels stop rising.
In Africa, the Sahara is getting bigger  it is moving south at a rate of 30 miles per year. This is a problem for people who live in northern Mauritania.
People may have to leave the Californian resort of Rancho Mirage, near Palm Springs, in the next decade. The problem in California is not caused by global warming  the problem is that there are too many people there. In 1870, the total population was only half a million but, now, the state is home to 38 million people. And these people have 32 million cars.
Every person in Rancho Mirage uses more than 200 gallons of water every day. This is causing a man-made drought. They have reduced water use by 25% but this will probably not make much difference. The long-term answer in Californias desert is for people to leave some cities.
Fire is a growing problem to towns and cities in America  in fact, forest fires cause the most damage after bad storms. There were 800 major fire disasters there between 1953 and 2014. A new report by the USDA Forest Service shows the increasing number of towns and cities that are particularly vulnerable to wildfire.
Many cities are fighting a losing battle against nature but is it possible to choose the worlds most vulnerable city? Natural disasters are very difficult to predict  but the future for Mal does look very bad. Its new sea wall might continue to work but the islands around the Maldives capital are going to disappear soon. And, if they disappear, Mals reason for existing disappears, too.",0,Ele-Txt,0,0.3552407324314117,0.29138821363449097,0.3533710539340973,1,0.30129238963127136,0.3611236810684204,0.33758389949798584,0,0.38779085874557495,0.31506726145744324,0.2971419394016266,0,0.5096964240074158,0.3001259863376617,0.19017763435840607,0,0.5463005304336548,0.3040657043457031,0.1496337652206421,0,0.6744619011878967,0.1823235899209976,0.14321452379226685,0,0.663120448589325,0.22354835271835327,0.11333125829696655,0,0.7510947585105896,0.17216666042804718,0.07673851400613785,0,0.7730984091758728,0.18060173094272614,0.04629985243082047,0,0.8118242621421814,0.14997710287570953,0.03819864615797997,0,0.8349233865737915,0.12997780740261078,0.03509879484772682,0,0.8311047554016113,0.1400635540485382,0.028831766918301582,0,0.8555392026901245,0.11819154769182205,0.026269318535923958,0,0.8613138794898987,0.11405854672193527,0.024627577513456345,0,0.8605613112449646,0.11607740074396132,0.0233613234013319,0,0.4331281781196594,0.2606332004070282,0.3062386214733124,0,0.5063002109527588,0.25313276052474976,0.24056707322597504,0,0.4739917814731598,0.3017121255397797,0.22429606318473816,0,0.5959072709083557,0.1865171641111374,0.2175755798816681,0,0.6497806906700134,0.18645067512989044,0.16376863420009613,0,0.7800307273864746,0.13270525634288788,0.08726399391889572,0,0.912364661693573,0.057022545486688614,0.030612805858254436,0,0.9269086122512816,0.06174745410680772,0.011343937367200851,0,0.9145846366882324,0.0732618123292923,0.012153611518442627,0,0.9467161893844604,0.0419793576002121,0.011304492130875587,0,0.9701200723648072,0.023592304438352585,0.006287636701017618,0,0.9755561351776124,0.01918663270771504,0.005257269833236933,0,0.978943407535553,0.016646122559905052,0.0044105458073318005,0,0.9776718020439148,0.017130592837929726,0.005197606980800629,0,0.9779014587402344,0.016952862963080406,0.005145598202943803,1,0.3431905210018158,0.3680219054222107,0.2887876033782959,1,0.3336406946182251,0.3731209337711334,0.2932383716106415,1,0.3482473194599152,0.35345128178596497,0.29830142855644226,0,0.4315667152404785,0.1783490628004074,0.3900842666625977,0,0.7625580430030823,0.047428533434867866,0.19001342356204987,0,0.8865069150924683,0.01917169615626335,0.09432139992713927,0,0.9078475832939148,0.015446430072188376,0.07670589536428453,0,0.9540851712226868,0.0175633542239666,0.028351541608572006,0,0.9436014294624328,0.035641033202409744,0.02075764164328575,0,0.9739972949028016,0.0117341885343194,0.014268532395362852,0,0.9668759703636168,0.008786763995885849,0.02433723770081997,0,0.9461237192153932,0.007266998291015625,0.04660937190055847,0,0.9535914063453674,0.0075347572565078735,0.03887391462922096,0,0.9619279503822328,0.007884310558438301,0.030187759548425674,0,0.9653618931770324,0.00744340056553483,0.02719464898109436,1,0.21277017891407013,0.4871455729007721,0.30008426308631897,2,0.2674771249294281,0.3601052165031433,0.3724176287651062,0,0.4831126630306244,0.3418627381324768,0.17502455413341522,1,0.11823448538780212,0.8431507349014282,0.03861481696367264,0,0.5459824800491333,0.43882468342781067,0.015192775987088682,0,0.6663205623626709,0.32519179582595825,0.008487625978887081,0,0.929180383682251,0.050496559590101235,0.020323043689131737,0,0.9598856568336488,0.025634435936808583,0.014479810371994972,0,0.9691810607910156,0.020910998806357384,0.009908024221658708,0,0.9816168546676636,0.014036144129931928,0.004346975591033697,0,0.9846205711364746,0.012167748995125294,0.003211582778021693,0,0.9862218499183656,0.010827231220901012,0.002950973575934768,0,0.9862415790557858,0.010310612618923187,0.003447842318564653,0,0.9893522858619691,0.008210231550037861,0.0024374227505177264,0,0.9900838136672974,0.007742841728031635,0.002173380693420768
157,"We do not yet live in an age of flying cars, as predicted in the 1985 film Back to the Future II, but smartphones and other new technologies are creating exciting possibilities. Experts agree that economic and population changes, new technology, and environmental concerns are having a big effect on transportation.
With an ageing transport infrastructure, cities in the US have to change and improve their transportation. Experts and scientists now realize that old ways of reducing traffic congestion arent enough to solve the problems of population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now an environmental problem.
Big US cities like Los Angeles and Chicago are adding more bus lanes and pedestrian walkways, and expanding rail networks. At the same time, they are creating advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment.
Here are three of the key ideas that experts predict will change transportation in the future.
Taxi-sharing services like Uber and apps like Waze, which finds the quickest routes for drivers, are completely changing how people move around and affecting the way traffic moves through a city. Communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era.
According to a recent study, people born in the 1990s are using cars less than older generations. According to the study, people born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than older generations did at the same time in their lives. And, people who still drive cars are experiencing less traffic thanks to Waze. 
Traffic congestion is improving in other ways, too. At the moment, a traffic light knows when a car is getting close but thats all. Companies are developing technology that allows a vehicle to tell traffic control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.
We have known about driverless cars ever since Google began testing the vehicles in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. But, there is already some automation of cars. Automation will probably happen in stages: first, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: vehicles that are connected electronically and travel one behind another.
The idea of a fully automated transportation system is interesting because it could improve safety  peoples mistakes wont cause accidents any more. It could also help reduce carbon emissions and traffic congestion. But, it will take a long time to get fully automated because the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.
To see what driverless cars might look like on the road, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380 .
The world is trying to slow down climate change and countries and cities are trying to reduce emissions. These things could have a big effect on the future of transportation and lead to zero- and low-emission vehicles and apps that encourage more walking, cycling and carpooling.
When thinking about the future of transportation, its also important to think about why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. Technologies that reduce the need for those trips  for example, online meetings or online work  could also have a big effect on transportation.

Dong Nguyen, the inventor of the mobile game Flappy Bird, removed it from app stores. It was downloaded more than 50 million times and was making him around 30,000 each day. He said its success ruined his simple life. On Twitter, he said: I cannot live like this anymore. 
Nguyen is the latest inventor who wishes he hadnt created a monster: 
2 The labradoodle 
The labradoodle isnt a monster  its lovely. But whats monstrous is the way people sell crossbreed dogs since the labradoodles inventor, Wally Conron, rst created the dog in the 1980s. Ive created a lot of problems, he said. There are a lot of unhealthy and abandoned dogs now. Conron invented the labradoodle when he was working for the Royal Guide Dog Association of Australia. He invented it as a dog for a blind woman. Her husband was allergic to dog hair. He didnt know that the labradoodle would become so popular. 
3 The AK-47 
Six months before his death in December 2013, Mikhail Kalashnikov, the inventor of the assault rie, wrote to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church and asked: If my rie killed people, am I, Mikhail Kalashnikov, 93 years old, the son of a poor farmer, Christian and Orthodox, responsible for peoples deaths, even if they were enemies? 
4 Electronic tagging 
The electronic tag was rst made in the 1960s to check if ex-prisoners went to school or work, and to reward them for good behaviour. Its inventors, Bob Gable and his brother Kirkland, were later horried that the tag became a form of control and punishment. Its not pleasant, Kirkland Gable said in 2010, but Im not in control of the universe. I have to realize there are some things out of my control. 
5 Pepper spray 
After police sprayed peaceful protesters with pepper spray at a University of California campus in 2011, Kamran Loghman, one of the scientists who helped develop the spray in the 80s said, I have never seen such an inappropriate use of chemicals. 
6 The ofce cubicle 
In the late 60s, a new kind of ofce was made to give workers privacy and increase how well and how quickly people work by giving more work space. But the cubicle became a way for companies to put employees into smaller spaces. The inventor, Bob Propst, said, in 1997, the use of cubicles in modern companies is crazy.

169,"When Larry Pizzi first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago, he asked: Why would anyone want to spoil a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it? 
Its a question that some people still ask. Many bicycle shops in the US do not sell e-bikes. 
Pizzi is CEO of Currie Technologies, the number one seller of e-bikes in the US. He believes that things will change very soon. Other people who sell bikes agree. Familiar brands including Trek, Raleigh and Specialized all offer electric bikes and they believe that the market is going to grow. 
The US is different from other countries when it comes to electric bikes. Nearly 32 million e-bikes were sold in 2014, most of them in China, where people mostly use them for transportation. They are popular in many parts of Europe, too. Theyre common in the Netherlands and Switzerland; German postal workers use them and BMW sells one for about $3,000. 
Electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds, which use motors; you pedal an electric bike with  or without  help from an electric motor. Riding an e-bike feels like riding a normal bike with a strong wind behind you; the motor just helps you go faster or climb hills. You can usually ride e-bicycles on bike lanes and they cant travel faster than 20mph. 
E-bikes are banned in some states in the US, including New York. Some bike shops dont like putting motors on bicycles because it makes them too heavy. Some e-bikes weigh nearly 30kg. 
E-bikes are also expensive. While cheap bikes sell for just $700, you will pay at least $1,500 for a quality e-bike with a good battery. The best bikes cost more than $3,000. 
But e-bike technology, particularly the batteries, is improving. Batteries are getting smaller, theyre getting lighter, theyre getting more reliable and they are lasting longer, says Don DiCostanza, the CEO of Pedego, an electric bikemaker and retailer. 
Perhaps most importantly, more cities are building bike lanes so bicycle commuting has become more popular. Electric bikes make commuting more practical  and fun  because people dont have to worry about hills, strong winds, tiredness and sweat. 
Most of our customers are baby boomers who want to have the cycling experience they had as a kid, says Pedegos Don DiCostanza. The main reason they stopped riding bikes was because of hills. Pedego has opened nearly 60 stores in the US. 
ElectroBike has 30 stores in Mexico. It opened its first American store in Venice Beach, California in 2014 and hopes to have 25 US stores in a year. CEO Craig Anderson says: We want to help reduce traffic, help reduce our carbon footprint and encourage a healthy lifestyle. He tells customers: Ride this bike once and try not to smile. 
Curries Larry Pizzi thinks that e-bikes will become popular in North America. A lot of young people are using e-bikes for transportation, instead of cars. 
There is even a cargo bike with a stronger motor and rack at the back. You can carry two children, says Pizzi. You can carry 45kg of shopping. Its a minivan alternative.

35,"Angry waiters are asking people to support their battle to keep their tips. Protesters plan to target PizzaExpress restaurants, to try to get the restaurant chain to stop taking a percentage of tips for staff that have been paid on credit and debit cards. Protesters have also started an online petition  they hope that people who go to the restaurants will support them.
Some employees are very angry because PizzaExpress keeps, as an admin fee, 8p out of every 1 paid when tips are given by card. The chain, which has 430 restaurants in the UK, earns around 1 million a year from this practice, according to the union Unite.
We believe this 8% fee is unfair. If the chain values its staff, it should pay them the total tips from customers, said Chantal Chegrinec of Unite. We are starting with PizzaExpress but they are not the only company who do this. And we will target other companies after this. 
The first protest will take place at a PizzaExpress restaurant at the British Museum in London. Unite did a survey of PizzaExpress staff after a Chinese company bought the chain in 2014. Lots of the staff complained about the 8% deduction from their tips so thats why Unite began the campaign. 
One angry PizzaExpress employee, who does not want to give her name, said that the admin fee cost her 3 a night. I have worked at PizzaExpress for 15 years, she said in a letter to Unite. After all this time, Im still only paid the national minimum wage of 6.50 an hour. So you see my colleagues and I need customer tips to increase our low wages. I work hard and am good at my job but, when PizzaExpress thinks it can take a percentage of our tips, I get upset.
Restaurant chains Ask and Zizzi also deduct 8% of the tips paid by card. But other chains deduct even more. Caf Rouge, Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10%; Strada and Giraffe do, too.
A spokesperson for PizzaExpress said that the money they take from tips pays for a system that they use to share the tips among staff. Staff use this system to decide how to share tips made by card, she said.
The chain sells 29 million pizzas a year in its UK restaurants. It says it does not make a profit from the admin fee. But other restaurant groups do not deduct an admin fee from tips. Wagamama, Pizza Hut and TGI Friday all take nothing. Frankie & Bennys, Chiquitos and Garfunkels used to take 10% but stopped years ago.
Unite recently targeted ten PizzaExpress restaurants in south London. They distributed leaflets to customers  the customers were shocked and disgusted  by the practice. PizzaExpress says they mention the admin fee at the bottom of the menus. But the employee who wrote to Unite said that customers were always surprised by the admin fee. Most customers then paid the tip in cash. Almost 6,000 people have signed Unites online petition.
One waiter said that at least a third of his money is from tips. He doesnt work for PizzaExpress but has worked for 11 years for another restaurant chain. I work in a busy London restaurant and I usually serve 150 people every night. I earn 40 to 50 in tips, he says. That seems like a lot but that money is very important to me because my basic pay is only 6.50 an hour.

125,"Emmanuel Limal wanted to find love on online dating sites but he was tired of meeting women who said that they werent ready to start a family. The 43-year-old actor, who is from France, has lived in Copenhagen for 20 years. He was looking for love and wanted to start a family. 
He tried to find someone online but without success. Everyone said that they were really active, always travelling or with a long list of hobbies, but they didnt talk about children, Limal said. On some sites, there was an option to click saying: 'Id like kids someday,' but I read the persons profile and thought: 'You will never have time!' If someones going to the gym eight times a week and travelling every month, they are not putting a family first. 
Limal has a six-year-old daughter from an old relationship but he has always wanted more children. I couldnt meet anyone who wanted to start a family. He said it was difficult to know when to talk about wanting kids when he met someone new. Its a difficult subject to talk about when you are on a date, he said. Then one day I read a profile from a 38-year-old who said she knew it was 'really bad to admit' but she wanted children. And I thought: 'You shouldnt be ashamed of this.' 
Limal borrowed money to start Babyklar.nu  or 'baby-ready now' in English. It works like a normal dating site but everyone is asked to be honest about their wish to start a family soon. We ask people if they are OK with someone who already has children and if they want another baby, Limal said. But we dont make them say how many children they would like. That would be like food shopping online. 
He has had a very positive response to the site. Fifty people signed up every hour when we started in June. There are already couples who met through the site and are now together. I think we will have the first Babyklar.nu baby by next summer. More men have signed up than women (53% to 47%), with comments such as I can finally be honest about what I want. 
The site has come at the right time for the country of five million people. Danes are not having enough children and the current rate of 1.7 children per family means that the population is falling. The usual reasons are given  women are leaving it too late and couples are living together without getting married and waiting to start families. 
Now, I hope, men and women who want to start a family but havent met the right person yet will have another choice, says Limal. He says that this isnt just about making babies: I want this to be about children and love. My goal is to bring together people who really want a family and a partner  and wholl stay together. Im a romantic. 
He is planning to start sites in France and the UK later in 2013, but at the moment the only site is in Denmark. Danes have no problem having children before marriage so things can move fast and, because the countrys so small, someone from Jutland can date someone from Copenhagen without too much travel, Limal said.

94,"Scientists have made an atlas of the brain. It shows how the meanings of words are organized in different regions of the brain. The atlas uses rainbow colours to show how words and their meanings are grouped together in areas of the brain.
We wanted to build a giant atlas that shows how the meanings of words are represented in the brain, said Jack Gallant, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley.
No single brain region contains one word or idea. A single brain spot contains a number of related words. And, each single word appears in many different brain spots. Together, they form networks that represent the meanings of each word we use: life and love, death and taxes. All have their own networks. 
The atlas shows how modern imaging can completely change what we know about how the brain does some of its most important tasks. With further work, the technology could have an enormous effect on medicine and other areas of study.
It is possible that we could use this technology to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking, said Alexander Huth, the main author of the study. One possible use would be a language decoder that could allow people who cant talk, because they have a serious illness, to speak through a computer.
To make the atlas, the scientists recorded peoples brain activity while they listened to stories. Then, they matched the transcripts of the stories with the brain activity data to show how groups of related words produced 50,000 to 80,000 responses all over the brain. Huth used short, interesting stories. The stories had to be interesting so that the people in the experiment would listen to the words and not fall asleep. Seven people listened to two hours of stories each. Each person heard about 25,000 words  and more than 3,000 different words  as they lay in the scanner.
The atlas shows how words and related terms use the same regions of the brain. For example, on the left-hand side of the brain, above the ear, is one of the tiny regions that represents the word victim. The same region responds to killed and murdered . On the brains right-hand side, near the top of the head, is one of the brain spots used for family terms: wife, husband, children, parents.
Each word is represented by more than one spot because words often have many meanings. One part of the brain, for example, is used for the word top and also for other words that describe clothes. But, the word top also uses many other regions. One of them is for numbers and measurements, another for buildings and places. Interestingly, the brain atlases were similar for all the people in the experiment. This suggests that their brains organized the meanings of words in the same way. But, the scientists only scanned five men and two women. All are native English speakers. It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different brain atlases.
Lorraine Tyler, a neuroscientist and head of the Centre for Speech, Language and the Brain at Cambridge University, said the research was a great achievement. But, at the moment, the brain atlas does not show small differences in word meanings. This research is amazing and new, there is still a lot to learn about how the meaning of words is represented in the brain.

147,"When you enter a department store, cameras are watching you. If you pick something up, a camera will make sure you dont put it into your bag. Cameras will follow you around the store. But new technology is less focused on shoplifting and more interested in your age, gender and shopping habits.
A few months ago, IT company Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) wrote a report that said around 30% of stores use facial recognition technology to track customers in shops. Facial recognition is a technology that can identify people  it analyses and compares peoples faces. Shops use special cameras for this, like the Intel RealSense camera. 
Joe Jensen, who works for Intel, says that the aim of using RealSense technology in shops is not to get information about specific peoples lives but to understand, in general, peoples lifestyles and shopping habits. We dont need to know a particular shopper. We need to know what characteristics this shopper has and that, when those characteristics are present, this is what a person usually does.
This technology makes it possible to predict what a person may or may not do in a shop. If, for example, a woman is walking quickly towards the sock section, a store can automatically put ads on screens specifically for that person. If she looks like the type of person who wants to buy socks, they will show her adverts for socks. 
If it sounds familiar, its because the internet has been using techniques like these for years. If you search for something on Amazon, youll get ads for similar products on other sites. But its not easy to use these systems in shops. People do not react to cameras in the same way as they do to cookies on websites.
One company, Hoxton Analytics, has developed a technology that puts people into categories based on the shoes they are wearing. By analysing the style and size of peoples shoes, the system can identify a customer s gender with 75-80% accuracy.
Owen McCormack, Hoxton Analytics CEO, says that they wanted the system to be different from facial recognition. I thought, why dont we simply look at the clothes someones wearing?  he said. If I just showed you a photo of someones body, you could probably tell me what gender they are. But pointing a camera at someones body feels just as creepy as facial recognition. The idea was  what about peoples shoes?
People use the word creepy a lot during discussions of tracking in stores. Stores need to find a way of getting information without seeming intrusive.
McCormack says, Right now, shops are doing lots of intrusive things but we just dont know about it. We tell the shops that, if you know someones a male or a female, your advertising will work better. If you know that everyone in your shop right now is a male, youll advertise PlayStations not hairdryers.
It is easy to understand that stores want some of the information online stores collect. We allow this to happen online so why not in shops? But shopping centres are different from websites  you walk from one shop to another without a computer asking you if its ok to collect information about you.
But young people who are growing up with online shopping do not think online advertising is invasive. In the CSC report, a survey showed that 72% of people aged 55 or more said they were very uncomfortable with these types of technologies in real shops. But only 51% of 16-24 year olds said they were uncomfortable. In any case, there are more and more eyes watching you and they care a lot about what youre wearing.

The right of Bolivias indigenous Indian tribes to 1 chew coca leaves, the main ingredient in cocaine, has caused major international disagreement, which could have a significant effect on global drugs policy. Bolivia has received a special exemption from the 1961 Convention on Narcotic Drugs, which controls international drugs policy. The exemption allows Bolivias indigenous people to chew the leaves.
Bolivia had argued that the convention was in 2 opposition to its new constitution, adopted in 2009, which says it must protect native and ancestral coca as part of its cultural heritage and maintains that coca in its natural state  is not a narcotic.
South American Indians have chewed coca 3 leaves for centuries. The leaves are said to provide energy and have medicinal qualities. Supporters of Bolivias position said that defending the rights of indigenous people was the right thing to do. The Bolivian move is inspirational and groundbreaking, said Danny Kushlick, of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, which supports drug liberalization. It shows that any country that is fed up with the war on drugs can change its relations with the UN conventions.
However, the UNs International Narcotics Control 4 Board (INCB), which checks implementation of global drug treaties, says that Bolivia is threatening international drug controls. A number of countries  including the UK, the US, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Russia  opposed Bolivias demands.
The UK told the UN that it respects the cultural 5 importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia, but it adds: The United Kingdom is  worried that the exemption could lead to increases in coca production and  most importantly  the amount of coca that goes into the cocaine trade. As a result, the exemption would weaken  the global effort to tackle the drugs trade.
The right of indigenous people in South Americas 6 Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed up to the convention. But Bolivia was given 25 years to implement the ban. This arrangement came to an end in 1989 and since then the issue has been under dispute.
In 2011, Bolivia  whose President, Evo Morales, 7 is a former coca producer  formally told the UN that it did not want to be in the convention any more. It has now signed up to the convention again, but with an exemption so that its indigenous people can continue chewing coca leaves.
The exemption is the first of its kind in the 8 history of UN drug-control treaties and has led to concerns that other countries may apply for exemptions. The Russian government has argued that the exemption will lead to an increase in illegal circulation of cocaine and warned that it also sets a dangerous precedent that could be used by other states in creating a more liberal drug-control regime.
The British parliament has recommended that 9 Bolivias request should be supported by the UK government. It argues that it is important that countries stay in the convention. Bolivias return could be blocked only if a third or more of the 184 countries that have signed up to the convention opposed its request. There are suspicions that the US and UK are trying to persuade other countries to block Bolivias request.
Nancie Prudhomme, of the International Centre 10 on Human Rights and Drug Policy, criticized the co-ordinated opposition to Bolivias demands. These objections are legally questionable, she said. They support an arbitrary and over-broad provision and apply international drug laws in a vacuum. This is not right. No state has paid any attention to decades of developing international norms on cultural and indigenous rights, which support Bolivias efforts.
The decision to ban coca chewing was based on 11 a 1950 report produced by the UN Commission of Inquiry on the Coca Leaf, which supporters of drug liberalization say was not based on evidence. The growing of coca leaves is legal and licensed in Bolivia. Some believe this has led to a fall in cocaine production in the country. For this reason, some experts see Bolivia as a model for other countries.

Cities dont often decide to pack their bags, get up and move down the road. But thats exactly what Kiruna, an Arctic town in northern Sweden, has to do  to avoid being swallowed up into the earth.
Its a terrible choice, says Krister Lindstedt of White, the Swedish architects company that is managing the biblical task. They have to move this city of 23,000 people away from a gigantic iron-ore mine that is fast swallowing up the ground beneath its streets. Either the mine must stop digging, creating mass unemployment, or the city has to move.
Founded in 1900 by the state-owned Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara mining company (LK), Kiruna has grown rich off the vast amount of iron ore that is below the town but its now facing destruction by exactly the thing that made it rich. The town is here because of the mine, says Deputy Mayor Niklas Siren. Otherwise, no one would have built a city here.
Located 145km inside the Arctic Circle, Kiruna has a brutal climate. It has winters with no sunlight and average temperatures below -15C. But the iron ore has kept people here. It has become the worlds largest underground iron-ore mine. It produces 90% of all the iron in Europe, enough to build more than six Eiffel Towers a day. And demand continues to grow.
In 2004, the mining company told the town that its days were numbered: digging its shafts towards the city at an angle of 60 degrees, subsidence would soon lead to buildings cracking and collapsing. Ten years later, cracks are starting to appear in the ground, and they are creeping closer and closer to the town.
The people of Kiruna have been living in limbo for ten years, says Viktoria Walldin, a social anthropologist who works with the architects. They have put their lives on hold, unable to make major decisions like buying a house, redecorating, having a child or opening a business.
After years of dithering, the city finally has a plan for how it will proceed. Lindstedt has a plan that shows the towns streets and squares beginning to crawl eastwards along a new high street, until the whole place has moved safely away from the mine by 2033.
A new town square is already being built, 3km to the east, with a circular town hall planned by Danish architect Henning Larsen. Twenty other key buildings will be dismantled and put together piece by piece in their new home  like an Ikea flatpack on a bigger scale. Kirunas red wooden church, built in 1912 and once voted Swedens most beautiful building, will take pride of place in a new park, and the bell tower will stand once again above the town hall. But not everything will be saved.
I spoke to an old lady who walks past the bench every day where she had her first kiss, says Walldin. Its things like that  the hospital where your first child was born, for example  that are important to people and all thats going to disappear.
Called the most democratic move in history, the project will get 320m from the mining company for building new facilities, including a high school, fire station, community centre, library and swimming hall. But the biggest worry for most people is where they will actually live and how they will get a house or flat.
People are used to very low rents and very high incomes but, in future, this will have to change says Lindstedt. LK has agreed to compensate residents to the value of their homes plus 25% but many locals say this is not enough to afford a new-build house.
A closer look at the plan shows the new town does not look like the original Kiruna at all. The current town has winding streets and detached houses with gardens. Whites plan has multi-storey apartment blocks around shared courtyards in long straight streets.
It is an opportunity, say the architects, for Kiruna to reinvent itself into a town that will attract young people. There will be new cultural facilities and visionary things such as a cable car above the high street. But it is a vision that many of the existing residents will probably not be able to afford.

Every morning, before the temperatures in Indias capital start to rise, a handful of old friends gather. On the dry grass not far from the India Gate monument at the centre of Delhi, they stretch, breathe and meditate.
It is the only healthy way to start the day. Much better than an egg or a sandwich or a cup of tea, said Arvind Singh at 6.15am as he did his breathing exercises on a bench.
Singh, a 42-year-old salesman, and his friends are not alone. All across India, in the overcrowded cities, on whatever green space is left, you can see similar scenes.
On 21 June  the new International Day of Yoga  Narendra Modi, Indias prime minister, hopes the world will join in. On the grass near India Gate, up to 45,000 people will take part in a 35-minute class  they hope it will be the biggest yoga session ever.
The participants will include 64-year-old Modi, most of his government and, they hope, a range of celebrities.
Encouraging Indians, and others, to stretch has become a focus for Modi, who led his Bharatiya Janata Party to a landslide election victory in 2014. In May 2015, schools were told to make sure students attended yoga events at the same time as the big demonstration in Delhi, even though it is on a Sunday.
Indias police officers are well known for being out of shape. So, the government has said they want to introduce compulsory yoga for them. They have said, too, that daily yoga lessons will be offered free to three million civil servants and their families. Air India, the national airline, has also said it will introduce yoga for trainee pilots.
Modi, an ascetic who is a vegetarian and an enthusiastic yoga practitioner, suggested an international yoga day when he was speaking to the United Nations on a visit to New York in 2014.
Modi said that yoga is an invaluable gift of Indias ancient tradition. He said that it encourages unity of mind and body, thought and action, harmony between man and nature, and a holistic approach to health and wellbeing. He added, It is not about exercise but discovering the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and nature.
Yoga is between 3,000 and 6,000 years old. It came from somewhere on the Indian subcontinent, possibly from among religious ascetics. Its meditative practices, as well as its physical exercises, have long been associated with local religious traditions including Buddhism and Jainism, as well as Hinduism, which is practised by 80% of Indians.
Modi has been criticized before for creating a view of Indian culture that has little place for other traditions. One person called the event on 21 June a mix of cultural nationalism and commercialization.
Others, however, talk about a recent US court ruling that said yoga was not always linked to religion. A court in California ruled that: The practice of yoga may be religious in some contexts but yoga classes as taught in the [San Diego] district are not religious, mystical or spiritual. This ruling came after two Christian parents said they believed that yoga in schools was a Hindu exercise.
Amish Tripathi, the author of best-selling novels set 4,000 years ago in India that retell stories from Hindu mythology, said characters in his books practise yoga.
In ancient India, yoga was part of daily life, both the physical and the mental aspects. Every culture has gifted something to the world and this is our gift, Tripathi said.
Suneel Singh, a guru in south Delhi, agreed that yoga did not belong to any one religion: Is tai chi just Chinese? Is football just English? It is the same with yoga  yoga is for everybody. It is a cheap way to stay healthy.

Legos profits rose strongly in the first half of 2014, helped by the success of its Lego Movie, which has stormed box offices in the US and UK.
The Danish toy firms sales rose across Europe, the Americas and Asia as children bought products linked to the film. The film, released in February 2014, took more than $250m in the US and 31m in the UK by the first weekend in April.
The movie cost about $60m to make and has been described as an almost perfect piece of marketing. It is entertaining and aimed at consumers who are likely to go out and buy the companys products.
Legos finance director, John Goodwin, said that the Lego Movie products had a positive effect on profits during the first half of 2014. They are now waiting to see how the products will continue to develop after the launch of the movie on DVD in the second half of 2014.
Jrgen Vig Knudstorp, Legos chief executive, said: It is a very satisfactory result that shows our significant growth in recent years in a tough economic environment. The result for the first half of 2014 is an outcome of our ability to develop, launch and distribute Lego products, which children all over the world put at the top of their wishlists.
Lego, based in the small town of Billund, started producing its plastic bricks in 1949 and became a popular and well-known childrens toy around the world by the 1970s. But the group lost its way and was on the brink of collapse in 2003. Knudstrop took over as chief executive, ending 70 years of family rule, and got rid of hundreds of surplus products. He then refocused the business on its bricks.
The company opened its first factory in China in April and opened an office in Shanghai to start expansion into the worlds second-biggest economy.

A girl born today in the UK can expect to live nearly to the age of 82 on average and her brother will live to 78. They would have a longer life in Andorra (85 and 79 respectively) but will live a little longer than in the US (81 and 76). If they lived in the Central African Republic, they would die in middle age (49 and 44). However, almost everywhere in the world, with the exception of countries such as Lesotho, which have experienced HIV and violence, lifespans are lengthening. And the best news is that small children are much less likely to die than they were forty years ago. There has been a drop in deaths in under-fives of nearly 60%, from 16.4 million in 1970 to 6.8 million in 2010.
This last statistic provides justification for the enormous project that the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle has led over the past five years, involving nearly 500 researchers, to assess the global effects of disease. Knowing how many children die and from what cause allows the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive. There are many lessons to be learnt from the enormous database they have put together, which will help global organizations and individual governments to better care for us all.
The project was a big task and is not without controversy. IHME has been very radical in some of its methods. Where they did not have death registries or medical records, for instance, they have taken evidence from verbal autopsies  deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family. The most surprising result has been the malaria figure. IHME said 1.2 million die of the disease every year  twice as many as previously thought. The big increase is in adult deaths. It is commonly believed that malaria kills mostly children under five.
The way I was taught as a doctor and everybody else is taught is that, in malarial areas, you become semi-immune as an adult, said Dr Christopher Murray, IHME Director. We originally went with that opinion but there has been a change as we have become more empirical, following the data. African doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot. But, he adds, their fever could be something else. The findings have led to further studies.
Although Margaret Chan, Director General of the World Health Organization, gave the IHME study a warm official welcome, some of the staff are cautious. We need to be very careful in assessing the validity [of the figures], said Colin Mathers, a senior scientist. We need to wait to be persuaded by evidence. His colleague Dr Tiers Boerma, Director of one WHO department, added: People should understand that some of the numbers are very different and the WHO cant go with any academic publication that states a different number. However, said Mathers, IHME has pushed the envelope with some of these analyses and that is stimulating. One of the main themes, said Murray, was incredibly rapid change in the main causes of death and the speed of that change is a lot faster than we expected it to be.
Reduced fertility and longer life have led to a rise in the average age of the worlds population in a decade from 26 years old to almost 30. The change has been dramatic in Latin America, for instance, where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010. That is a 35-year increase in the average age of death over four decades. In a place like Brazil, the speed of change is so fast that most institutions are not able to deal with it, Murray said.
A second factor is the move outside Africa from communicable diseases and the common causes of mother and baby deaths to what are sometimes termed lifestyle diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer  some of which have significant genetic triggers. That change has been particularly marked in Latin America, the Middle East and south-east and even south Asia, he said.
The third big finding was, Murray said, a surprise to us. There is a lot of disability and it has a big effect on people who are living longer but not healthier lives. The main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you, he said. They were mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, and disorders, such as arthritis and lower back pain, anaemia, sight and hearing loss and skin disease. In addition, there was substance abuse. The numbers for these are not going down over time, he said. We are making no progress in reducing these conditions.

The forests  and suburbs  of Europe are echoing with the growls and howls of large predators according to a new study. The study shows that brown bears, wolves and lynx are thriving on the crowded continent. Rising human populations and overconsumption make many people believe that such animals will soon become extinct. But the study has found that large-predator populations are stable or rising in Europe.
Brown bears, wolves and the Eurasian lynx are found in nearly one-third of mainland Europe (excluding Belarus, Ukraine and Russia), with most living outside nature reserves. This indicates that changing attitudes and conservation measures are successfully protecting species that have suffered massive persecution throughout human history.
Bears are the most abundant large carnivore in Europe  there are around 17,000 of them. There are 12,000 wolves and 9,000 Eurasian lynx. Only Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Luxembourg in mainland Europe  like Britain  have no breeding populations of at least one large carnivore species. But the studys main author and other conservationists said that these animals now live in well-populated regions of Europe, so even the British countryside could support big predators.
Guillaume Chapron from Swedens University of Agricultural Sciences and researchers across Europe found wolves, in some cases, living in suburban areas alongside up to 3,050 people per square kilometre. On average in Europe, wolves live on land with a population density of 37 people per sq km, lynx in areas with a population density of 21 people per sq km and bears among 19 people per sq km. The population density of the Scottish Highlands is just nine people per sq km.
In order to have wolves, we dont need to remove people from the landscape, said Chapron. He adds that the big-carnivore revival shows the success of a land-sharing model of conservation  unlike the policy of keeping predators and people apart by fencing off wilderness areas, as occurs in North America and Africa.
Im not saying its a peace-and-love story  coexistence often means conflict  but its important to manage that conflict and resolve the problems it causes. Wolves can be difficult neighbours, said Chapron. We shouldnt be talking about people-predator conflict; we have conflict between people about predators. These animals are symbolic of difficult questions about how we should use the land.
According to the researchers, this land-sharing approach could be applied elsewhere in the world. The reasons for its success in Europe include political stability, growing populations of prey species such as wild deer, and financial support for nonlethal livestock protection such as electric fences, which mean that farmers do not have to shoot wild predators. Most crucial, said Chapron, has been the EU Habitats Directive, which has forced member states to protect and revive rare species.
Without the Habitats Directive, I dont think we would have had this recovery, he said. It shows that, if people are willing to protect nature and if politicians introduce strong legislation, its possible to achieve results in wildlife protection. The revival was welcomed by author George Monbiot, who is launching Rewilding Britain, a new charity to encourage the return of wild landscape and extinct species.
It is great to see this trend continuing but Britain is completely anomalous  weve lost more of our large mammals than any country except for Ireland, he said. Apart from the accidental reintroduction of wild boar, weve done almost nothing, whereas in much of the rest of Europe weve got bears, lynx and wolves coming back.
The survey found that the Eurasian lynx lives permanently in 11 population groups in 23 European countries and only five of these were native populations. This indicates the success of reintroduction efforts. According to Monbiot, support for the reintroduction of the lynx into the Scottish mountains is growing.
If it works in the rest of Europe, theres absolutely no reason why it cant work in the UK, he said. He points out that bears and wolves live within an hour of Rome. Theres no reason why we cant have a similar return of wildlife in the UK.

Introduction Did you know that, in the UK, there is no legal requirement for restaurants to pass on tips to staff?
For a new government report, workers, employers and customers were asked about their views on tipping. After reading the report, government ministers said they wanted to change the rules and make sure low-paid workers get the money left for them by happy customers.
The report said that some waiters are charged up to a 15% administration fee on tips that are left when customers pay by credit or debit cards. The government said it would consider not allowing employers to charge workers an administration fee.
The government also said that it wanted customers to know that tips are voluntary and they want the system to be more transparent, with restaurants clearly displaying their tips policy.
We asked waiters around the UK what they think of the tipping process (including how much they take home from tips and whether its fair) and what would improve it for them.
1. Rodri, 37, London: Around 50% of a waiters income is tips Average tips: 60 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... the US
Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015. This is when dozens of restaurants were exposed for taking money from tips for administration fees. However, you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains. Some restaurants take 4% of all sales to pay the chefs and as an admin fee. It doesnt matter how much you make in tips. This means that, if a table has a 100 bill and doesnt tip, the waiter has to pay 4 of their own money. This leads to bad service. If a table doesnt tip, the waiter feels as if the company is stealing their money and resents the customers.
I get an average of around 60 of tips per shift. On a good night, this can go up to over 100 and, on a poor night, its around 40. Around 50% of a waiters income is tips. All restaurants should have to publicly state their exact tipping policy. America has it pretty good  everyone tips.
2. Elle, 22, Edinburgh: We never know whether its fair Average tips: 20 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... France
I have three part-time catering jobs. My main day job is in a cafe where the small number of staff work both in the cafe and in the kitchen so all our tips go in a pot and they are shared equally. My main evening job is at a restaurant where we dont get our tips but our wages are minimum wage plus an extra 2.50 per hour. My third job is events catering and nobody ever tips.
In restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips through card payments, the staff never see how much the tip is  so we dont know whether what we get is fair or not. The system seems better in France, where they dont tip much but being a waiter is seen as a proper job, with job security and a decent income.
3. Ashley, 22, London: Tips go towards customer breakages Average tips: 10-15 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... Australia
I work in a London pub in the evenings and I do day shifts at a local restaurant. In both places, all the tips are collected and shared out at the end of the night. Money is also taken from the tips to pay for breakages by either staff or customers.
It is incredibly unfair that our tips are shared out, especially when one member of the team doesnt work hard enough. Or, when a member of the team does incredibly well, they dont get what theyve earned. Its really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers. The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without taking our tips. I make around 20 a shift in tips but often I only get 10-15 of that money.
I really rely on tips because I am only paid 7 an hour. Id rather we earned a good basic wage (like in Australia) and didnt have to rely on tips.
4. Tom, Manchester: A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips: 40 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... Italy
Where I used to work, waiters kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips. The other 20% of cash went into a pot for the commis waiters and bar staff. The 60% from the card tips went to the kitchen staff.
Its hard to say how much I earned a shift; maybe around 40. It can make a massive change to your weekly  nances. Sometimes, the waiters needed a good night to pay their rent.
They have got tipping right in Italy, where customers dont add a service charge but usually round up their bill so, if their meal is 19, they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change. They respect the staff. In Italy, people often make a career as a waiter and the experience these waiters have shows in the service the customers get.

Nobody knows which came first: the economic crisis in Greece or shisha, the drug now known as the cocaine of the poor. But what everyone knows is that shisha is a killer. And it costs only 2 or less a hit.
It is the worst kind of drug. It burns your insides, it makes you aggressive and makes you go totally mad, said Maria, a former heroin addict. But it is cheap and it is easy to get, and it is what everyone is taking.
This drug crisis has put Athenss health authorities, already having to deal with large financial cuts, under further strain.
The drug of preference for thousands of homeless Greeks forced on to the streets by poverty and despair, shisha is described by both addicts and officials as a drug that is related to crystal meth. The synthetic drug is frequently mixed with battery acid, engine oil and even shampoo. It has the potential to send users into a state of mindless violence. And, even worse, it is not only easily available, but also easy to make.
It is a killer, but it also makes you want to kill, Konstantinos, a drug addict said. You can kill without understanding that you have done it. And it is spreading faster than death. A lot of users have died.
For Charalampos Poulopoulos, the head of Kethea, Greeces anti-drug centre, shisha symbolizes the crisis that has led to record levels of destitution and unemployment. It is, he said, an austerity drug  it is the response of dealers who have become more and more clever at producing synthetic drugs designed for those who can no longer afford more expensive highs from such drugs as heroin and cocaine.
The crisis has given dealers the possibility to promote a new, cheap drug, a cocaine for the poor, said Poulopoulos at a centre for addicts in Exarcheia, in Athens. Shisha can be sniffed or injected and it can be made in home laboratories  you dont need any specialized knowledge. It is extremely dangerous.
Across Greece, six years of recession have been brutal and cruel. Depression, together with drug and alcohol abuse, has risen dramatically. Crime has soared as a result of austerity measures that have cut the income of ordinary Greeks by 40%. Prostitution  the easiest way of paying for drugs  has similarly skyrocketed.
Many women agree to have unprotected sex because that way theyll make more money, said Eleni Marini, a psychologist with Kethea. Shisha has been linked to a very intense sexual drive but it attacks your ability to think clearly and were seeing a lot more pregnancies among drug addicts who engage in prostitution. In 2012, two sex workers gave birth on the streets of Athens.
As the number of suicides has also increased and HIV infections are spreading, drug addicts (a population believed to be around 25,000) have become increasingly self-destructive. And, experts say, young Greeks marginalized by record rates of unemployment  at 64% Greece has the highest youth unemployment in the EU  are leading the way.
The crisis has created a widespread sense of pessimism, said Poulopoulos. For those who might have stopped taking drugs, there is now no incentive. Instead, theres an atmosphere of misery, where people who know they wont find work are becoming a lot more self-destructive. In Athens, where the economic crisis has hit hardest, shisha is part of that.
Just when the need for help has never been greater, state-funded organizations such as Kethea have had their money cut by a third at the request of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. These organizations are trying to stop the Greek economy from sinking.
Since the financial crisis began in 2009, Kethea has lost 70 of its 500 staff. The cuts come despite studies that show that, for every euro they spend on anti-drug programmes such as Kethea, the Greek state saves about 6 in costs to the criminal justice and healthcare systems. The cuts we have witnessed are a false economy, a huge mistake, said Poulopoulos.
On the streets of Athens, where shisha is growing in popularity, there is a fear that austerity not only doesnt work  it kills.

Glastonbury Festival is declaring war on the plastic water bottle as part of a long-term plan to become the worlds most environmentally friendly outdoor music event.
Festival organizers are targeting the disposable bottle, one of the most obvious symbols of the throwaway culture, that each year leaves the 900-acre festival site covered in plastic. An estimated one million plastic bottles are used during the festival.
Stainless-steel reusable bottles will be given to 2,000 road crew and band members. Thousands more will go on sale to festival-goers to stop them relying on plastic bottles. The 140,000 ticketholders are also being asked to bring reusable bottles that they can fill at 400 drinking-water taps across the site.
Lucy Smith, Glastonburys green issues organizer, said: We have amazing water quality in the UK but everyone is obsessed with drinking bottled water.
She said that, in 2015, Glastonbury also plans to replace all plastic glasses and cutlery with reusable items.
Environmentalists say that there is currently 150 million tonnes of plastic waste around the planet and oceans, poisoning ecosystems and killing wildlife.
Ultimately, festival organizers hope to make Glastonbury the worlds greenest greenfield festival. They want to be like Americas Burning Man festival in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, which is a leave-no-trace event, where people have to take away all that they bring.
Glastonbury festival-goers are also being asked to travel to the site on public transport or to try car-sharing with friends. We want to be as sustainable as we can. We do everything we can, but the litter of 140,000 people is a challenge. We cant put bins everywhere, added Smith.
Plastic water bottles can take hundreds or even thousands of years to completely biodegrade. Their manufacture makes their negative ecological impact even worse. Millions of barrels of oil are used in the manufacture of plastic bottles and the transportation of mineral water across the planet produces even more carbon emissions.
Around 13 billion plastic water bottles are sold in the UK every year, but only one in five is recycled.
Smith said that, instead of buying bottled water, festival-goers should take advantage of the water on tap, which comes from huge underground reservoirs. The charity WaterAid will also set up water kiosks around the site, which will stock reusable bottles and cups and offer free refills.
Organizers say that almost half of all the rubbish left on site was recycled in 2013 and add that there will be 15,000 bins for recycling across the festival grounds in 2014.
Even though it is becoming more environmentally friendly, critics say that Glastonbury is becoming increasingly corporate. Iron Maidens Bruce Dickinson said he would never bring his band to Glastonbury Festival, which he called the most bourgeois thing on the planet.

The atmosphere at the beginning of the final series of Downton Abbey is one of melancholy and changing times. The year is 1925. The neighbours are selling up their own stately home, while Lord Grantham wants to cut back on servants.
But, at the real Downton Abbey, Highclere Castle  a stately home owned by George Geordie Herbert, 8th Earl of Carnarvon  they have more money than before. According to Lady Fiona Carnarvon, the huge global success of Downton has paid for building repairs that are needed to save Highclere for the next generation.
Its been an amazing magic carpet ride for all of us, she said. Its given us free marketing and an international profile. Im hugely grateful. My husband and I love Highclere Castle. Now, it is loved by millions of other people.
Currently, only the ground and first floors of Highclere, on the borders of Hampshire, are used. But, a restoration project of tower rooms has begun that will eventually allow visitors to climb up into the tower to an exhibition showing the work of the architect of the Houses of Parliament, Sir Charles Barry, who rebuilt the house between 1839 and 1842.
When the Downton Abbey producers first approached Highclere in 2009, the family had 12 million of repairs to do  1.8 million of that work was urgent. But, by 2012, Downton Abbey was having a positive effect. Lord Carnarvon said then: It was just after the banking crisis and we were worried. Then, Downton began and Highclere became a major tourist attraction.
Visitor numbers doubled, to 1,200 a day, as Downton Abbey, written by Julian Fellowes, was shown around the world after becoming a hit in the UK in 2010 and, then, in the US. It is now broadcast in 250 countries.
There is now a computerized advance booking system, which helps foreign visitors to buy tickets. Highcleres current assets have almost trebled to around 1 million since 2012. Gareth Neame, the executive producer for the series, said: I think Downton Abbey secured Highcleres future.
Peter Fincham, ITVs director of television, remembers the moment when Highclere was booked. I thought, So what?, because I had never heard of Highclere Castle. I thought, Every stately home looks the same. But I was wrong. The castle has been an enormous character as well.
The Downton tourists are part of a growing phenomenon. VisitBritain estimates that nearly 30% of foreign visitors, or nearly nine million people, visit castles and historic houses. Almost half of visitors to Britain now say they want to visit places from films or TV.
More than a million take a tour of historic buildings each year, spending more than 1 billion. Fifty-one per cent of Brazilians, 42% of Russians and Chinese, and 35% of Indian visitors are likely to include a visit to a site of interest in their trips.
VisitBritains director, Patricia Yates, said: The links between tourism, films and TV are strong. She added that period dramas have also increased the popularity of places outside of London.
Downton Abbey expresses a certain view of Britain. It is a fantasy world, based in a particular time in history. Its the first TV period drama that has really become part of popular culture.
Lady Carnarvon says that the long-term future of Highclere is not necessarily secure. But, she says, The programme has allowed us to spend faster on the buildings.
Highclere Castle plans a Tutankhamun event in 2022, 100 years after the 5th Earl of Carnarvon discovered Tutankhamuns tomb with Howard Carter. Another opportunity to keep Highclere in the public mind is the 300th anniversary of the birth of Lancelot Capability Brown, who designed the grounds.
Every single day, dont take anything for granted, said Lady Carnarvon. You have to invest in all these great houses. And, there has been a deficit since the 1930s. In the past, an estate and house supported the family and their lifestyle but, today, it is quite the reverse: the challenge is how Geordie and I can support Highclere.
Ive tried to persuade people it is fun. We have specific events they can engage with, not just a walk around a dusty house. We have to compete with attractions like the London Dungeon.

A subway system has billions of inhabitants: the bacteria of Swiss cheese and kimchi, bubonic plague and drug-proof bugs and human skin. Now, for the  rst time, scientists have started to catalogue and map the bacteria in a citys subway  and they have found many interesting results.
Dr Christopher Mason, a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medical College, led a team that, for 18 months, tested the New York City subway system for the microscopic life forms that cover its turnstiles, seats, ticket booths and stations. His team found meningitis at Times Square, a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan.
The team have strongly downplayed the  ndings of plague and anthrax. They say that there is only an extremely small trace of the latter, that rats likely carried the former and that no one has fallen ill with plague in or around New York for years.
The results do not suggest that plague or anthrax is prevalent, the study says. Nor do they suggest that New York residents are at risk.
In fact, most of the bacteria identi ed by the team are either harmless to humans or bene cial in the citys thriving world of microorganisms.
Some of the results were expected and should be a gentle reminder for people to wash their hands, Mason said. He also said that they found many bacteria of the same sort as those that are bene cial and helpful, like the one used for making cheese.
Bacteria appeared to re ect the eating habits of various neighbourhoods. All around the subway, bacteria associated with cheeses  brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella found on New York pizza  appeared. The distinctive bacteria of Swiss cheese were more limited to midtown Manhattan and the  nancial district, and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the  nancial district and Bay Ridge.
Bacteria associated with illness and infections were extremely common. Species that cause diarrhoea and nausea, as well as E.coli, and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city. The species that produces tetanus appeared in Soho and bacteria that cause dysentery appeared at a station in the Bronx and another in Harlem.
Mason and his team collected more than 1,000 samples at all of New Yorks 466 open subway stations. They put the organic materials through a DNA sequencer and, then, through a supercomputer. They identi ed 15,152 distinct species, nearly half of which were bacteria.
The good news, the researchers said, is that these potentially infectious bacteria are not spreading sickness or disease throughout New York. They seem to be normal co-habitants of a city.
In short, the researchers conclude, the subway and city are about as safe as everyone thought.
Mason said people should not be concerned about getting urinary-tract infections from subway seats. You should wash your hands, he said, and probably get some sleep, eat salads and go to the gym, and thats about the same today as it was yesterday.
In fact, he added, Ive become much more con dent riding the subway.
Many  findings made sense: stations like Grand Central and Times Square, where there are more people, had more bacteria and more diversity among them. The Bronx, with its diverse neighbourhoods and stations, had the greatest diversity of bacteria; Staten Island, with just three stops, had the lowest.
The researchers found marine bacteria at South Ferry, a station that  ooded during Hurricane Sandy  but they were surprised to note the species included some normally associated with Antarctica and  fish.
The next steps, Mason said, are studies of other cities, which have begun in Paris, Sa_o Paolo and Shanghai, and continued studies of New York, for instance to see how the results change with the seasons. He said he hoped the research would provide a baseline of research for health of cials and geneticists, and could help health of cials to prevent and track diseases and pathogens.

Sometimes life isnt fair. Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook and is now worth an estimated $48bn. James Goodfellow also invented something used by millions of people around the world every day  the cash machine  but it didnt make him rich. In fact, he earned just 10 from the patent and has not made a penny more from it since.
You can imagine how I feel when I see bankers getting 1m bonuses. What have they contributed to the banking industry, compared to me, to merit a 1m bonus, Goodfellow says. He invented something that generated billions of pounds and he got nothing.
There have been arguments for years over who is the inventor of the ATM and, in 2005, a man called John Shepherd-Barron received a UK honour as the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser. But, the UK government is now saying it was Goodfellow who invented the ATM  so it seems that, after all the arguments, he now has his place in history.
Back in the mid-1960s, Goodfellow was working as a development engineer and was asked to devise a way to allow customers to withdraw cash from banks on Saturdays. Most people worked during the week and couldnt get to the bank. They wanted a solution. The solution was a machine which would give cash to a recognized customer, he remembers. I wanted to develop a cash-issuing machine and, to make this a reality, I invented the PIN [personal identi cation number] and a coded token.
This token was a plastic card with holes in it. The patent documents described a system with a card reader and buttons mounted in an external wall of the bank. After Goodfellow produced a model that showed how the machine would work, prototypes were built and the  rst machines were installed in 1967. At around the same time, Shepherd-Barron was developing a rival machine. His machine didnt use plastic cards  instead, it used cheques containing carbon-14, a mildly radioactive substance. The machine detected the carbon-14, matched the cheque against a PIN and paid out the cash.
It is widely accepted that the Shepherd-Barron ATM was the worlds  rst to be installed and used by the public; the  rst one, at a bank in north London, was opened on 27 June, 1967  a month before Goodfellows ATM appeared. However, the patent for Goodfellows machine was lodged on 2 May, 1966, 14 months before Shepherd-Barrons ATM machine was first used.
Shepherd-Barron received an of cial honour for his achievement and Goodfellow says: My one big regret is that I never said anything about it until John Shepherd-Barron received the OBE in 2005 for inventing the automatic cash dispenser. That really stuck in my throat and I kicked up a fuss.
Shepherd-Barron is no longer alive but, in a 2005 interview, he was quite critical of his rival: I dont know him but its clear that the difference between Goodfellow and us was that we thought through the whole system concept and that was important to the banks who bought it. His invention reminds me of the hovercraft, an elegant failure.""
The cash machine is now used all over the world and nothing  the contactless revolution, bitcoin, wearable technology, etc  is slowing its growth: there are now 3m ATMs worldwide and, by 2020, there will probably be 4m.
The good news for Goodfellow is that he is beginning to be recognized for his invention. The website ATMInventor.com says: Who invented the idea of an ATM? We believe it was Luther George Simjian. Who invented the ATM as we know it? We have to think it was James Goodfellow for holding a patent date of 1966. Who invented the ATM design we recognize today? We think it was John D White in the US.
Even better for Goodfellow, his achievement has been of cially recognized in the latest edition of a 180-page guidebook called Life in the United Kingdom. In the section about great British inventions of the twentieth century, it states: In the 1960s, James Goodfellow (1937-) invented the cash-dispensing automatic teller machine (ATM) or cashpoint.
So after all these years, Goodfellow is  nally among a group of famous British inventors with John Logie Baird (the television), Alan Turing (the Turing machine), Sir Frank Whittle (the jet engine) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the World Wide Web). Asked what he did with the 10 he received in the 1960s, Goodfellow says he thinks he blew it on a night out. He added: It didnt change my life.

JMW Turner, one of Britains greatest painters, will appear on the new 20 note, after a nationwide vote.
It will be the first time an artist has appeared on a British banknote, after the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, asked the public to choose a deceased cultural figure they felt deserved to be on the banknote.
Turner, who is famous for his dramatic seascapes, beat off competition from 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, film-makers and actors put forward by 30,000 members of the public.
The list included Alfred Hitchcock, Alexander McQueen, Derek Jarman, Laura Ashley, William Morris and Vanessa Bell. This list was narrowed down to a final choice of five by a panel of artists, critics and historians.
The final five  Barbara Hepworth, Charlie Chaplin, Josiah Wedgwood, William Hogarth and Turner  were chosen because of their unquestioned contribution to both the visual arts and British society, as well as their enduring influence.
The announcement of the new banknote was made at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate. The announcement was made jointly by Carney and the artist Tracey Emin, who grew up in the town.
Carney said it had been so important to get this right and have a proper process that involved the public. He added that banknotes are not only a practical necessity  they can be a piece of art in everyones pocket.
The fact that we will have Turner on the 20 note shows that the British people are a nation of people who appreciate creativity and appreciate the arts, said Emin.
The note will show Turners 1799 self-portrait, as well as one of his most famous works, The Fighting Temeraire, the ship that played an important role in Nelsons victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.
The note will also contain a quote from the artist  light is therefore colour  as well as his signature. The signature is from his will, in which he left many of his paintings to the nation.
Historical figures were first shown on banknotes in 1970. Turner joins Winston Churchill and Jane Austen as the significant figures who will feature on the new polymer notes  a plastic-type material  Churchill on the 5 and Austen on the 10 note. The new 20 note will be available by 2020.
Turner was born in 1775 in London, the son of a barber, and he entered the Royal Academy Schools at the age of 14. In 1786, when he was sent to Margate, his love of painting and drawing the north-east Kent coast began. He returned to that coast throughout his life and it was where he painted some of his most dramatic oils and watercolours. He described its skies as the loveliest in all Europe.
Turner was a very prolific artist  he produced more than 550 oil paintings and 2,000 watercolours in his lifetime. His life was also the subject of a film, in 2014, by Mike Leigh, with Timothy Spall as the artist.
Victoria Pomery, the director of Turner Contemporary, said: The decision to celebrate JMW Turner, one of the greatest technical pioneers in the history of British art, is extraordinary. It has proven that Turner is the nations favourite artist.

Coal will probably rival oil as the worlds biggest source of energy in the next five years, with possible disastrous consequences for the climate, says the worlds leading authority on energy economics.
One of the biggest factors behind the rise in coal use has been the massive increase in the use of shale gas in the US.
New research from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that coal consumption is increasing all over the world  even in countries and regions with carbon-cutting targets  except in the US, where shale gas is now more popular than coal. The decline of coal consumption in the US has helped to cut prices for coal globally. This has made it more attractive, even in Europe where coal use was supposed to be discouraged by the Emissions Trading Scheme.
Maria van der Hoeven, Executive Director of the IEA, said that coal consumption continues to grow each year and, if no changes are made, coal will catch oil within a decade.
Coal is available in large amounts and found in most regions of the world, unlike conventional oil and gas, and can be cheaply extracted. According to the IEA, China and India will drive world coal use in the coming five years, with India likely to overtake the US as the worlds second biggest consumer. China is the biggest coal importer, and Indonesia the biggest exporter.
According to the IEAs Medium-Term Coal Market Report the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today.
With the highest carbon emissions of any major fossil fuel, coal is a huge contributor to climate change, particularly when burned in old-fashioned, inefficient power stations. When these are not equipped with special scrubbing equipment to remove chemicals, coal can also produce sulphur emissions  the leading cause of acid rain  and mercury and soot-particle pollution.
Van der Hoeven said that, without a high carbon price to discourage the growth in coal use and encourage cleaner technologies such as renewable power, only competition from lower-priced gas could reduce demand for coal. This has happened in the US, due to the extraordinary increase in the production of shale gas in that market in the past five years.
She said: The US experience suggests that a more efficient gas market can reduce coal use, carbon dioxide emissions and consumers electricity bills. Europe, China and other regions should take note.
If something isnt done, the world faces an increased risk of climate change as a result of this fast-increasing consumption of the highest carbon fossil fuel.

Scientists have connected the brains of two animals and allowed them to share sensory information. It is a major step towards what the researchers call the worlds first organic computer.
The US team fitted two rats with devices called brain-to-brain interfaces that let the animals collaborate on simple tasks to earn rewards, such as a drink of water. In one important demonstration of the technology, the scientists used the internet to connect the brains of two rats separated by thousands of miles  one in North Carolina, USA, and the other in Natal, Brazil.
The researchers were led by Miguel Nicolelis, a pioneer of devices that allow paralyzed people to control computers and robotic arms with their thoughts. They say their latest work could make it possible for multiple brains to be connected to share information. These experiments showed that we have established a sophisticated, direct communication connection between brains, Nicolelis said. Basically, we are creating what I call an organic computer.
The scientists first demonstrated that rats can share, and act on, each others sensory information by electrically connecting their brains via tiny grids of electrodes that reach the part of the brain that processes movement.
The rats were taught to press a lever when a light went on above it. When they did the task correctly, they got a drink of water. To test the animals ability to share brain information, they put the rats in two separate compartments. Only one compartment had a light above the lever. When the rat pressed the lever, an electronic version of its brain activity was sent directly to the other rats brain. In tests, the second rat responded correctly to the imported brain signals and pressed the lever 70% of the time.
Incredibly, the communication between the rats was two-way. If the receiving rat failed at the task, the first rat did not get the reward of a drink, and appeared to change its behaviour to make the task easier for its partner. In further experiments, the rats collaborated on a task that required them to tell the difference between narrow and wide openings using their whiskers.
In the final test, the scientists connected rats on different continents and used the internet to send their brain activity back and forth. Even though the animals were on different continents, they could still communicate, said Miguel Pais-Vieira, the first author of the study. This tells us that we could create a workable network of animal brains distributed in many different locations.
Nicolelis said the team is now working on ways to connect several animals brains at once to solve more complex tasks. We cannot even predict what might happen when animals begin interacting as part of a brain-net, he said. In theory, you could imagine that a combination of brains could find solutions that individual brains cannot achieve by themselves.
Anders Sandberg, who studies the ethics of neurotechnologies at Oxford University, said the work was very important in helping to understand how brains encode information. But the potential future uses of the technology are much wider, said Sandberg. The main reason we are running the planet is that we are amazingly good at communicating and coordinating. Without that, although we are very smart animals, we would not dominate the planet.
I dont think theres any risk of supersmart rats from this, he added. Theres a big difference between sharing sensory information and being able to plan. Im not worried about an invasion by smart rats.
Very little is known about how people encode thoughts and how they might be sent to another persons brain  so that will not happen any time soon. And much of what is in our minds is a draft, as Sandberg calls it, of what we might do. Often, we dont want to reveal those drafts, because that would be embarrassing and confusing. And we change a lot of those drafts before we act. Most of the time I think wed be very thankful not to be in someone elses head.

Barack Obama flew back to Washington and his desk in the Oval Office on Wednesday, hours after delivering an election victory speech in Chicago in which he asked the country to unite behind him.
Unlike after his election in 2008, the President is unlikely to get a honeymoon period.
Both the Republican House Speaker, John Boehner, and the Democratic Leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, spoke about a need to work together to resolve the economic crisis. But it could become one of the biggest battles yet between the White House and Congress under Obamas presidency.
While Obama easily beat his Republican opponent Mitt Romney, holding swing state after swing state, the election showed again how divided America remains.
While the inauguration is not until January, in effect Obama started his second term on Wednesday. Having disappointed many supporters in his first term, he now wants to establish a legacy that will transform him from a middling president into a great one.
As well as overseeing what he hopes will be continued economic recovery, he hopes to address issues from immigration reform to investment in education and climate change, and, in foreign policy, from Iran to Israel-Palestine.
He comfortably won more than the required 270 electoral college votes, and he also won a higher share of the popular vote.
Boehner, in a statement, sounded conciliatory. He talked about the need for both parties to find common ground and take steps together to help our economy grow and create jobs, which is critical to solving our debt.
Reid, also sounded conciliatory, saying: I look at the challenges that we have ahead of us and I reach out to my Republican colleagues in the Senate and the House. Lets come together. We know what the issues are; lets solve them.
The trouble will come when talks move to detail: the Republicans want to protect military spending while the Democrats want cuts. Obama wants tax increases on households earning more than $250,000; Boehner has rejected any tax increases.
In the presidential race, Romney won only one of the swing states, North Carolina, while Obama held New Hampshire, Virginia, Ohio, Wisconsin, Nevada, Iowa and Colorado.
In his victory speech in Chicago, Obama referred to the long queues to vote and said there was a need for electoral reform.
He returned to the soaring rhetoric that was his trademark during the 2008 election but which was not seen in 2012 because his campaign team decided it was inappropriate.
But now that he has won, he returned to famous lines from earlier speeches, such as his 2008 slogan about hope.
Obama told the ecstatic crowd of supporters: Tonight in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back. And we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come. In a speech that lasted more than 25 minutes, Obama paid emotional tribute to his wife, Michelle, and his daughters, Malia and Sasha  as well as to his Vice-President, Joe Biden. Then he returned to the message that first brought him to national attention.
We are not as divided as our politics suggests, he said. We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions, and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states. We are, and forever will be, the United States of America.
Obama made clear he had an agenda in mind for his second term. He mentioned changes in the tax code, immigration reform and, as he put it, an America that isnt threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.
Just before, Romney had phoned the President to concede. He said, This is a time for great challenges for America and I pray the President will be successful in guiding our nation.
The campaign almost throughout has been a referendum on Obama. Despite the slow economy recovery and a high unemployment level, Americans decided not to change presidents.
Historically, it would have been a disappointment for African Americans and many white liberals if the first black presidency had ended in failure.

Scientists have created an atlas of the brain that shows how the meanings of words are arranged across different regions of the brain. The atlas shows in rainbow colours how individual words and their meanings can be grouped together in areas of the brain.
Our goal was to build a giant atlas that shows how one speci c aspect of language is represented in the brain, in this case semantics (the meanings of words), said Jack Gallant, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley.
No single brain region holds one word or concept. A single brain spot is associated with a number of related words. And, each single word lights up many different brain spots. Together, they make up networks that represent the meanings of each word we use: life and love, death and taxes. All light up their own networks.
The atlas was described as a great achievement by one researcher who was not involved in the study. The atlas shows how modern imaging can transform our knowledge of how the brain does some of its most important tasks. If scientists make further advances, the technology could have an enormous impact on medicine and other areas of study.
It is possible that this approach could be used to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking, said Alexander Huth, the main author of the study. One possible use would be a language decoder that could allow people who cant talk, because they have a serious illness, to speak through a computer.
To create the atlas, the scientists recorded peoples brain activity while they listened to stories. Then, they matched the transcripts of the stories with the brain activity data to show how groups of related words produced brain responses in 50,000 to 80,000 pea-sized spots all over the cerebral cortex.
Huth used short, compelling stories. The stories had to be interesting so that the people in the experiment would focus on the words and not drift off. Seven people listened to two hours of stories each. Per person, that was a total of about 25,000 words  and more than 3,000 different words  as they lay in the scanner.
The atlas shows how words and related terms light up the same regions of the brain. For example, on the left-hand side of the brain, above the ear, is one of the tiny regions that represents the word victim. The same region responds to killed, convicted, murdered and confessed. On the brains right-hand side, near the top of the head, is one of the brain spots activated by family terms: wife, husband, children, parents.
Each word is represented by more than one spot because words often have several meanings. One part of the brain, for example, responds to the word top, as well as other words that describe clothing. But, the word top lights up many other regions. One of them responds to numbers and measurements, another to buildings and places. The scientists have created an interactive website where the public can explore the brain atlas.
Interestingly, the brain atlases were similar for all the people in the experiment. This suggests that their brains organized the meanings of words in the same way. The scientists only scanned  ve men and two women, however. All are native English speakers. It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different semantic brain atlases.
Using the atlas, researchers can now piece together the brain networks that represent very different concepts, from numbers to murder and religion. The idea of murder is represented a lot in the brain, Gallant said.
Uri Hasson, a neuroscientist at Princeton University, said the work was great. He said that many studies just looked at brain activity when a single word or sentence was spoken but Gallants team had shed light on how the brain worked in a real-world scenario. The next step, he said, was to create a more complete and precise semantic brain atlas. In the future, Hasson believes it will be possible to reconstruct the words a person is thinking from their brain activity. The ethical implications are enormous.
Lorraine Tyler, a neuroscientist and head of the Centre for Speech, Language and the Brain at Cambridge University, said the research was a great achievement. But, the brain atlas in its current form does not show small differences in word meanings. This research is  Centre for Speech, Language and the Brain at Cambridge University, said the research was a great achievement. But, the brain atlas in its current form does not show small differences in word meanings. This research is 4 Comprehension check ground-breaking but there is still a lot to learn about how semantics is represented in the brain.

According to a top-secret document, the National Security Agency (NSA) has got direct access to the systems of Google, Facebook, Apple and other major US internet companies. The NSA access is part of a program called PRISM, which allows officials to collect material including search history, the content of emails, file transfers and live chats, the document says.
The document claims collection directly from the servers of major US service providers. Although the document claims that the program is run with the help of the companies, all the companies who responded to a request for comment denied knowledge of any such program.
In a statement, Google said: Google cares deeply about the security of our users data. We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law and we review all such requests carefully. From time to time, people allege that we have created a government back door into our systems, but Google does not have a back door for the government to access private user data.
Several senior tech executives insisted that they had no knowledge of PRISM or of any similar scheme. They said they would never have been involved in such a program. If they are doing this, they are doing it without our knowledge, one said. An Apple spokesman said he had never heard of PRISM.
The NSA access became possible because of changes to US surveillance law, introduced under President Bush and renewed under Obama in December 2012. The program facilitates a large amount of in-depth surveillance on live communications and stored information. The law allows for the targeting of any customers of participating companies who live outside the US, or those Americans whose communications include people outside the US.
The revelation of the PRISM program follows a leak of a top-secret court order that forced telecoms provider Verizon to give the telephone records of millions of US customers to the US government. The participation of the internet companies in PRISM will add to the debate about the level of surveillance by the intelligence services. Unlike the collection of those call records from Verizon, this surveillance can include the content of communications and not just the metadata.
It is claimed that some of the worlds largest internet companies are part of the information-sharing program, which was introduced in 2007. Microsoft  which is currently running an advertising campaign with the slogan Your privacy is our priority  was the first, with collection beginning in December 2007. It was followed by Yahoo in 2008; Google, Facebook and PalTalk in 2009; YouTube in 2010; Skype and AOL in 2011; and finally Apple, which joined the program in 2012.
Under US law, companies must comply with requests for users communications, but the PRISM program allows the intelligence services direct access to the companies servers. The NSA document notes that the operations have the help of communications providers in the US.
During the renewal of the FISA Amendments Act (FAA) in December 2012, several US senators warned about the high level of surveillance the law might allow and shortcomings in the safeguards it introduces. When the FAA was first introduced, its supporters argued that one safeguard would be the fact that the NSA could not get electronic communications without the permission of the telecom and internet companies that control the data. But the PRISM program makes that permission unnecessary, because it allows the agency to take the communications directly off the companies servers, communications that include email, video and voice chat, videos, photos, voice-over-IP (Skype, for example) chats, file transfers and social networking details.
The PRISM program allows the NSA, the worlds largest surveillance organization, to get targeted communications without requesting them from the service providers and without needing individual court orders. With this program, the NSA is able to reach directly into the servers of the companies and get both stored communications and live communications.
A senior administration official said in a statement: The Guardian and Washington Post articles refer to collection of communications under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). This law does not allow the targeting of any US citizen or of any person who is within the United States. The program is overseen by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch and Congress. Only non-US persons outside the US are targeted.

Nelson Mandela, the towering figure of Africas struggle for freedom and a hero to millions around the world, has died at the age of 95.
South Africas first black president died with his family beside him at home in Johannesburg after years of illness, which had caused him to stop taking part in public life.
The news was announced to the country by the current president, Jacob Zuma. He said Mandela had departed around 8.50pm local time and was at peace.
This is the moment of our deepest sorrow, Zuma said. Our nation has lost its greatest son. What made Nelson Mandela great was exactly what made him human. We saw in him what we look for in ourselves.
Fellow South Africans, Nelson Mandela brought us together and it is together that we will bid him farewell.
Zuma announced that Mandela would receive a state funeral and ordered that flags fly at half-mast.
Barack Obama led tributes from world leaders, referring to Mandela by his clan name  Madiba. The US president said: Through his fierce dignity and strong will to sacrifice his own freedom for the freedom of others, Madiba transformed South Africa  and moved all of us.
UK prime minister David Cameron said: A great light has gone out in the world and described Mandela as a hero of our time.
FW de Klerk  the South African president who freed Mandela and shared the Nobel Peace Prize with him in 1993  said the news was deeply sad for South Africa and the world.
He lived reconciliation. He was a great unifier, de Klerk said.
People gathered in the streets of South Africa to celebrate Mandelas life.
In Soweto, people gathered to sing and dance near the house where he once lived. They sang songs from the anti-apartheid struggle. Some people were wrapped in South African flags and the green, yellow and black colours of Mandelas party, the African National Congress (ANC)
Mandelas death sends South Africa deep into mourning and self-reflection, nearly 20 years after he led the country from racial apartheid to democracy for all.
But his passing will also be felt by people around the world who considered Mandela to be one of historys last great statesmen, comparable with Gandhi and Martin Luther King.
It was his act of forgiveness, after spending 27 years in prison, 18 of them on Robben Island, that will assure his place in history. With South Africa facing possible civil war, Mandela chose reconciliation with the white minority to build a new democracy.
He led the ANC to victory in the countrys first multiracial election in 1994. He then voluntarily stepped down after one term.
Born Rolihlahla Dalibhunga in a small village in the Eastern Cape on 18 July, 1918, Mandela was given his English name, Nelson, by a teacher at his school.
He joined the ANC in 1943 and became a co-founder of its youth league. In 1952, he started South Africas first black law firm with his partner, Oliver Tambo.
Mandela was a charming, charismatic figure with a passion for boxing and an eye for women. He once said: I cant help it if the ladies notice me. I am not going to protest.
When the ANC was banned in 1960, Mandela went underground. After the Sharpeville massacre, in which 69 black protesters were shot dead by police, he took the difficult decision to begin an armed struggle. He was arrested and eventually charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government.
Conducting his own defence in the Rivonia trial in 1964, he said: I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society, in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.
It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But, if necessary, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.
He was not given the death penalty but was sentenced to life in prison.
Finally, in 1990, FW de Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and Mandela was released from prison, to scenes of great happiness that were seen around the world.
