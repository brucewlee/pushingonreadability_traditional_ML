40,"Experts say that Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth. They say that some of the coldest temperatures in the world have been noted in Antarctica. People there wear special clothes to stay warm. But how do animals stay warm in Antarctica?
Antarctica is a big icy continent. It is around the South Pole. The South Pole is found at the bottom of Earth.
Penguins are birds. Emperor and Adelie penguins live in Antarctica. The penguins stay warm because they have feathers that are very small and close together. The feathers have oil on them. Cold water can't get through the feathers to touch the penguins' skin. Each year, penguins molt, or lose, their feathers and grow new ones.
Penguins can waddle faster than humans can walk.
Penguins like to line up and dive into the water again and again.
Penguins sometimes toboggan, or slide, on their bellies.
Penguins surf waves to get back to shore.
Weddell seals live in Antarctica. Weddell seals swim in the cold ocean water to catch fish and other ocean animals to eat. These seals don't chew their food. They swallow the food in big pieces.
Weddell seals stay warm because they have a layer of blubber, or fat. They also have a coat of thick fur. The fur keeps water from touching the seal's skin.

parts where the ants can live. Something that is hollow has empty space inside. The ants help the plants by killing insects that eat the plants.
Scientists recently found that some ants can harm plants. The ants attack plants that do not have hollow parts. The ants dig tunnels in the plants to make nests. Why? Scientists say that when the ants run out of space in ant plants, they make room in other plants.
This ant and plant get along well. The ant lives inside the plants hollow parts. The ant kills insects that eat the plant.

In a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear.
Scientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help.
Scientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled.
Scientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest.
The African elephant is the largest animal that lives on land. African elephants can weigh up to 16,000 pounds.

Cigarette butts can be dangerous. Cigarettes have hundreds of poisons in them. Scientists worry that the poisons could pollute the ocean water.
Cigarette butts can also harm animals. Seabirds will try to eat cigarette butts. The birds think the butts are food. The butts get stuck in the birds' stomachs and make them sick.
Every day, about 3,000 kids start smoking.
The average age a kid starts smoking is 13.
About 46 million adults in the United States smoke.
Smoking-related illnesses kill about 500,000 people each year.
Smoking one cigarette takes about seven minutes off the smoker's life.
On November 16, kids across the United States will scream their lungs out. That's when the Great American SmokeScream will happen. The kids will tell people not to smoke.
You need healthy lungs to breathe and to scream loudly. Keep your lungs healthy by not smoking. Use your healthy lungs to tell other people not to smoke.

Most tornadoes last fewer than 15 minutes. During that time, a twister can travel across a large area of land and destroy everything in its path.
The strong winds in some tornadoes reach speeds of up to 300 miles per hour. Those winds can toss cars and other objects high into the air.
Tornadoes can happen any time of the year. However, they are most common from March through July.
A tornado can destroy homes and trees.
Most tornadoes start as thunderstorms. During those storms, heavy rain and lightning are common. Large

Large thunderstorm clouds appear in the sky. The clouds become dark. Thunder can be heard.
Warm and cold air meet. Air rises from the ground to the clouds. If the rising air starts to spin, a funnel-shaped cloud can form.
The funnel-shaped cloud spins faster. When the bottom of the cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.

Eating in space can be hard because everything floats. Juice poured into a cup will float away and crumbs can get into air vents. So astronauts drink and eat in special ways. Astronauts drink with special straws and pouches. The pouch closes around the straw so juice doesn't leak out. Astronauts eat foods that don't make crumbs, like tortillas instead of bread.
On Earth, people usually sleep in beds. But most astronauts sleep in sleeping bags. The sleeping bags are in little cubbies. That way, a sleeping astronaut won't lose his or her pillow or float into something!
Astronauts have to work hard in space. Astronauts make sure that the space shuttle is in good condition. They clean air vents and check the engines and computers. The astronauts also do research and tests. Their work helps people learn about space.

Kids in some countries must deal with problems like those. But a special worldwide organization is trying to help them.
UNICEF helps children around the world. One way it helps is by providing schools and supplies. Three of the countries where UNICEF helps with education are Colombia, in South America, Rwanda (ruh-WAHN-duh), in Africa, and Thailand (TIGH-land), in Southeast Asia.
Those countries are probably far from where you live. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to go to school in another country?
In Colombia, the government requires kids to go to school for at least five years. Some people are poor and must work hard to survive. Some children must quit school to help their parents earn money.
With UNICEF's help, Colombia's government is creating a special school for those children. The students learn at their own pace and attend when they can. They have a small library and a garden where they grow vegetables.
One or two teachers must teach all the students, from grades 1 through 5. Students of the same age work together in small groups, helping one another learn.
Children in Rwanda must go to school from ages 7 to 15. But there is not enough space in some schools in Rwanda to fit all the students. Some students cannot afford to buy the uniforms and notebooks they must have to go to school.
To help solve those problems, UNICEF has created a special program called Schools-in-a-Box. Each box contains school supplies, workbooks, and learning games. When teachers use the Schools-in-a-Box, kids can be taught wherever they are.
Children in Thailand must go to school for six years. Though school is free, some families cannot afford to buy the uniforms children must wear to school.
Some classrooms in Thailand have as many as 50 kids and only one teacher! Often, children of all ages are in the same grade. The children must share the few books and school supplies that are in the school.
But UNICEF is working to help these people. The organization has built Village Education Centers in parts of Thailand. At night, adults gather there and take classes. During the day, the buildings are schools for children.
UNICEF is an organization that works to help children all over the world. UNICEF tries to provide health care, nutritious food, clean water, and an education for all children. The organization raises money and talks to world governments about helping children.

form in the air when it is very cold. Many ice crystals make a snowflake. A group of snowflakes creates a snowfall.
Before a snowflake reaches the ground, it goes through four steps.
1. Each snowflake begins as water droplets inside a cloud in the sky.
2. When the temperature freezes, the water droplets turn into ice crystals.
Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division.
3. As more water sticks to the ice crystal, it begins to change shape.
4. When many ice crystals stick together, snowflakes form and fall to the ground.
The shape of a snowflake depends on the temperature at which ice crystals form. These crystals bump into each other and stick together. That creates new shapes of snowflakes.
Snowflakes are usually less than half an inch across.

The Incas were a South American Indian people who ruled one of the largest and richest empires on the continent. By 1532, the Incas ruled an area that stretched for 2,500 miles along the west coast of South America. The Inca empire included parts of what are now Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.

As a leader, King took action to improve his community. When he was growing up in the South, black people did not have the same rights as white people. When King was older, he gave speeches and led peaceful marches. As a result of his work, lawmakers passed
Those laws protect the rights of all Americans.

During the early 1700s, there was a man who struck fear in the hearts of sailors. Seeing his pirate ship on the high seas might have made them yell, Shiver me timbers!
The News & Observer, Robert Willett/AP Images
Crews bring up a 3,000-pound anchor from the shipwreck.
His name was Edward Teach. People called him Blackbeard. He was a cruel pirate captain with a long black beard. He robbed and hurt people along the eastern coast of North America until 1718. That year, his ship crashed. It sank near North Carolina. Blackbeard got away. He was killed soon after.
When experts found a shipwreck in that area a few years ago, they thought it might be Blackbeards boat. Recently, they

It rests on the ocean floor off the coast of Beaufort, North Carolina.
Researchers found many weapons near and inside the ship. The finds included parts of a sword and many cannons. Blackbeard most likely used the battle gear to
other ships. To seize is to take over.
Blackbeards scary appearance also helped him get what he wanted. During battles, the pirate was said to have put lit matches under his hat. That caused smoke to appear around his beard.

Dun wrote the musical piece to celebrate the art of making paper. About 2,000 years ago, the world's first fine paper was invented in China. China is the country in Asia where Dun was born.

What does it take for a tiny seed to turn into a leafy plant? Lets take a look to find out.
 Seeds need water and oxygen to grow. Most seeds grow best between 65 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
 After a seed takes in water, a root pushes out from the seed. The root collects water and minerals from the soil.
 A stem and leaves come out of the seed and grow upward. The stem brings water and minerals to the leaves.
 The leaves use sunlight to make food for the plant. That process is called

Everyone knows helping others is a good thing - maybe even chimps! Scientists recently studied from Uganda. That is a country in Africa. The scientists did tests that show that chimps often help people or other chimps, even if they get nothing in return.
In one test, a person dropped a stick near a group of chimps. In most cases, a chimp handed the stick back to the person. Chimps care about other chimps too. In another test, a chimp handed over the stick when another chimp dropped it. The animals did not receive food or praise for their actions in either test.

Since 1984, many more people have moved to areas around Mauna Loa. They have built homes on the volcano's slopes. If the volcano erupts now, hot lava could destroy those homes.
For now, people should not worry too much about an eruption, experts say.

Until then, scientists will continue to keep track of changes in the volcano. They hope to give people lots of warning about future eruptions.
Mauna Loa is a shield volcano. Shield volcanoes form from lava flows. When lava cools, it hardens. The lava builds up and forms a low mountain.

Thats the finding of one of the most recent surveys by the National Institutes of Health. Allergens are things that set off allergies. Many allergenssuch as dust and moldare found in the air.
Allergies [are] increasing over time, says Andy Nish. He is a doctor from Georgia.
Allergens in the air arent the only problem. Kids food allergies have risen too. Between 1997 and 2007, the number of kids with food allergies jumped 18 percent. Eating milk products and eggs can give some children rashes. Those foods can even cause some people to have trouble breathing.
Whats behind allergies spread? Some scientists think our
dont have enough to do. Immune systems help our bodies fight germs. But kids today come in contact with fewer germs than their grandparents did. Thats in part because more medicine is available. Experts say that when our immune systems have fewer germs to fight, they can get confused. They attack other things, such as milk, instead.
Other scientists say hotter temperatures are to blame. They say the weather is warmer for longer periods now, so plants bloom longer. Plants release pollen (left), which is a common allergen.
Doctors do not know for sure whats making allergies increase. But they do know how to treat them with medicine. There is very good treatment for allergies, Nish says. No one should suffer with symptoms.
Dust and other allergens that float into your nose are in for a blasta cough or a sneeze, that is! Both are natural
, or responses, to help keep you from getting sick. Heres a look at the big bursts.
Sneezes start at the back of your throat. Each quick burst can force out up to 40,000 droplets of saliva. The tiny droplets travel at up to 300 miles per hour.
Coughs come out of your lungs. Each blast can push out 3,000 saliva droplets as fast as 50 miles per hour. Enough air comes out to almost fill a 2-liter bottle.
What might be some other reasons for the rise in allergies?

A peanut allergy is one type of food allergy. A food allergy is when the body has a strong reaction to a certain food. Eleven-year-old Chris Conetta is allergic to peanuts. If he eats peanuts, he gets very sick. ""My face and my tongue swell up, and I can't breathe,"" he said.

tree nuts (such as walnuts and cashews)
Help may soon be on the way for kids with peanut allergies. A team of scientists tested 300 kinds of peanuts. They recently found one that is special. It is missing one of two major allergens. An allergen is something that causes an allergic reaction.
The peanut hunt is not over yet. Now scientists are looking for a peanut missing the other allergen. Once they find it, they will try to create an allergy-free peanut.
Scientists hope an allergy-free peanut will one day replace the more common peanut. That would make kids with peanut allergies very happy.

Batman, have you heard? A new kind of ""batmobile"" is in the works!
Scientists in Rhode Island are studying how bats fly. The United States Air Force is funding the $6 million project. It hopes the mammals will offer clues about how to design better-flying aircraft. Mammals are warm-blooded animals that feed their babies milk.
Bats can fly in ways that birds and airplanes can't. The animals' wings have more than 24 joints. The joints allow them to
, or control, their wings while flying. Bats can stretch and bend their wings. This helps them fly higher and faster. Scientist Sharon Swartz says bats' control of their wings is similar to humans' control of their hands. ""Bats are the only flying animals whose wings are really just like human hands,"" she told
Swartz and the other scientists will study about 20 species of bats over the next five years. They are using real bats, high-tech cameras, and wind tunnels in their research. The team hopes to find out why bats can turn sharply without falling. If airplanes could do that, they could
, or move, in tight spaces. They could also fly in more dangerous conditions. The Air Force also hopes to learn how weight affects bat flight. Bats can carry up to 50 percent of their weight while flying. If aircraft designers knew bats' secrets, they could design airplanes that could carry more weight.
Swartz says there is still a lot more to learn about the animals. ""We expect to be studying bats long into the future,"" she says.
It's going to be a hair-raising Halloween for Little Rock Zoo in Arkansas. Three vampire bats were born there recently. Vampire bats are the only type of bat that drinks the blood of other animals. They do this to survive, but don't worry! Vampire bats are usually friendly with people. Of the more than 1,000 bat species, only three are vampire bats. They live mostly in Mexico and Central and South America.

When 13-year-old Katie recently went online, she couldn't believe that some classmates were making fun of her. The seventh grader from New Jersey discovered mean and hurtful comments written about her in an online Web journal.
""It was really offensive and upsetting to me because I knew everyone could see it online,"" Katie told
. ""There was nothing I could do to take it down.""
Katie's story is not unusual. She is one of the many victims of
. ""Cyberbullying is when a child torments, humiliates, or tries to frighten another child using interactive technology,"" online safety expert Parry Aftab told
Instead of teasing or picking on kids in the school yard, bullies have new territorycyberspace. The explosion in technology, such as computers, cell phones, and interactive games, gives bullies more places to do their dirty work.
Cyberbullies use e-mail, instant messages, text messages, and online journals to spread nasty rumors, post embarrassing photos, and tease other kids. Breaking into others' e-mail accounts and sending out mean messages to their buddy lists is a common practice for cyberbullies. Cyberbullies also run up other kids' cell phone bills with text messages. Some kids have even conducted online votes for the ugliest person in class.
For many kids like Katie, online bullying has become part of everyday life. Most cyberbullies are between the ages of 9 and 14. Studies show that about 55 percent of kids in grades 4 through 8 have had mean or hurtful remarks made to them online. ""Cyberbullying is a huge problem in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades,"" said Aftab.
Why is cyberbullying such a growing problem? For starters, kids spend a lot of time online at both home and at school. Nearly two-thirds of American kids have computers in their homes, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Online experts say being mean online is easier because computers give kids a sense of being
, or not being known. Kids say things on the Internet that they would never say face-to-face.
Some kids also don't realize that they're cyberbullies because they don't see the consequences of their actions. ""In face-to-face communication, we see when we've gone too far,"" she says. ""We lose all those visual cues online.""
To address the problem, more schools and communities are educating kids about online etiquette and are holding anti-bullying seminars. Aftab trains groups, called TweenAngels and TeenAngels, to become safe and responsible cybercitizens who share their knowledge with others.
TeenAngel Kendall, 12, experienced cyberbullying when kids at school blocked him out of gaming sites. His advice for dealing with a cyberbully: ""Don't be afraid to tell your parents, teachers, or whomever you trust the most.""
, or fight, cyberbullying, is to take a stand against it. ""The only way cyberbullying will stop is if kids protect each other,"" says Aftab. ""If you stand by and let someone else hurt someone, you're part of the problem. You need to be part of the solution.""
Online safety experts offer the following tips to protect yourself from cyberbullying:
Don't give out your passwords or any private information to anyone, even close friends.
Don't post any information online that you don't want others to read.
Don't answer a mean or threatening e-mail, block the person who sent you the offensive message, and tell a trusted adult. That person can help you take action.
Don't react to a mean message. Walk away from the computer and do something else that you enjoy for a few minutes.
Run your name through search engines, such as Google, to check whether there is information that you don't want on the Internet. Some search engines let you set up alerts that send you an e-mail if a new posting includes your name.
How is face-to-face communication similar to or different from sending a message by e-mail or IM?

A condor's wingspan is 9.5 feet across. That's about as wide as two kids lying down head to toe.
Wildlife experts say the condors did not die from the heat. Instead, the experts believe the huge birds died from lead poisoning. They say the condors had swallowed lead shotgun pellets.
, which means they eat the remains of dead animals. The condors probably ate the remains of an animal that had been shot by a hunter. As they ate the dead animal's flesh, the birds ate the deadly pellets.
If swallowed, lead can make an animal sick or cause death. Lead stops the body from making red blood cells. It can also damage an animal's organs, including the brain and liver.
The five poisoned birds were among 35 condors that have been released in Arizona since 1996. The release program has cost millions of dollars.
After the dead condors were found, wildlife experts recaptured and tested the 16 birds left in the Arizona group. All the birds were healthy and were soon released.
Members of the Peregrine Fund have been releasing and watching the condors set free in Arizona. Jeff Cilek, of the Peregrine Fund, told
that saving California condors is important. ""Condors are good for the environment. They [eat] dead animals,"" Cilek said.
California condors are among the world's largest birds. A hundred years ago, the birds were found in many parts of the United States. Today, the condor is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's list of endangered species. That means the number of California condors is so low they all could disappear someday.
Why are scavengers an important part of the food chain?
Peregrine Fund officials say there are 150 California condors left on Earth. Forty-eight of those birds are living in the wild; the rest are in zoos.
Although the loss of five birds is a ""serious setback,"" Cilek said his group is looking to the future. Peregrine Fund officials recently announced plans to release 12 more California condors in Arizona this winter.

Woodstock was a large music festival held in the rural town of Bethel, New York, in 1969. At that time, the United States was divided over the war in Vietnam and the struggle for civil rights. Adam interviewed Michael Lang, one of the organizers of the concert.
When did you come up with the idea for the Woodstock Music and Art Fair?
In the winter of 1968. I was 23 or 24.
How did you get big stars to come to the concert?
Woodstock sounded like an event nobody wanted to miss, and the name Woodstock in those days was known. It was the home of Bob Dylan, Janice Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and other cultural icons. Initially, it was all about making everyone believe that these people were going to come and that I could get everyone to come. Soon, through word of mouth, bands were calling us.
Did you have any idea that so many people would show up?
In the beginning, we planned on 200,000, but officially we were trying to get a permit for only 50,000. In the end, we had somewhere between 500,000 and 600,000, but more than 1 million who tried to come were turned away. They had to close the [New York State] Thruway and the Canadian border.
Why did you choose Woodstock as the site, and why did you decide to keep the name Woodstock even after you ended up holding the festival 60 miles away, in Bethel?
We had to move to Bethel because we could not find a largeenough place in Woodstock. A lot of people tried to convince me to change the name [of the festival] to Bethel, but I felt the name reflected the spirit of what we were trying to do, which was to create an atmosphere of artistic community. Woodstock always stood for that.
Why are people still talking about Woodstock today?
What made Woodstock unique was how many people came and how well they treated each other. The world was shocked to discover that a crowd of more than 500,000 could live together for three days in a field and treat each other with love and respect. This was set against a backdrop of the war in Vietnam, ... a battle for civil rights and women's rights, and a yearning for peace in the world. The people who came to Woodstock accomplished all of these things, at least for that period of time, so it gave people hope for their future.
The interview taught me that a lot of musicians were activists. I also learned that no matter how prepared you are, you also have to

Even though the coqui and greenhouse frogs are each only about the size of a dime, they make a huge racket. Instead of making soft chirping or gentle croaking sounds, the frogs chirp as loudly as a lawnmower. ""You'd never believe so much noise could come from a creature that small,"" Stevens said.
Scientists say the frogs in Stevens's backyard recently arrived in Hawaii. They came from islands in the Caribbean Sea, south of the United States mainland. Scientists think the frogs were accidentally shipped to Hawaii in flowerpots.
Since arriving in Hawaii, the foreign frogs have spread to 150 areas. In some areas, more than 8,000 can be found on a single acre of land. Each one is adding to the noise level.
The frogs are more than a noisy nuisance; they are causing other problems, as well. They eat insects that birds and other frogs used to eat. Each night, each thunderous frog can eat at least six insects.
The number of frogs is increasing because no other animals prey on them. If the foreign frog population keeps growing, other frogs and birds in Hawaii might not have enough insects to eat and might starve.
Some officials worry that the frogs might cause some people to leave Hawaii because of the racket. ""We get a lot of complaints from residents,"" said Fred Kraus, a spokesperson for the state. ""Some [have] threatened to leave the state.""
Residents of Hawaii are trying to capture the shrill frogs, which live in trees. Recently, Stevens and some of his neighbors went out looking for the noisy critters. They used ladders to climb into trees and capture frogs. ""We got them all,"" he said.
However, within a few months of the frog roundup, more frogs moved into Stevens's neighborhood. ""It was hopeless,"" Stevens said. ""There were just too many [frogs to capture]. Now they're out of control.""

Several factors contributed to the shortage, said Lawrence J. Makovich, a scientist who studies energy use. One problem is that California doesn't have enough power plants to supply all the electricity the Sunshine State needs. In addition, prices have risen for the fuels used in power plants to produce electricity, Makovich said.
The energy crisis may become worse this summer as Californians turn on air conditioners. According to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the state will probably be 10 percent short of the amount of electricity it needs.
This summer, the electricity crunch may spread to other parts of the country. In some areas, prices for electricity have been on the rise.
Many states are taking steps to solve the shortage. In California, Gov. Gray Davis is urging people to save energy.
""Yes, we have a power shortage, but we are far from powerless,"" Davis said. ""By reducing our electricity demand by even a small amount, we can reduce the price, avoid shortages, and lower energy bills.""

But some Americans acted differently. Instead of helping others, they attacked innocent Arab and Muslim Americans.
Some individuals vandalized mosques (the buildings where Muslims practice Islam, their religion). Others attacked anyone they thought looked to be from the Middle East.
Dr. Abdullah Khoui, of the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C., condemned the attacks while defending his religion.
""What took place, no sound mind would approve of it, and no religion at all in the world would accept it,"" Khoui said. ""Islam does not approve of what took place.""
Arshad Majid, of the Islamic Center of Long Island, N.Y., said that Islam promotes peace.
""We're concerned that the actions of a small number of extremists is likely to paint with a very broad brush the large population of God-fearing, peace-loving Muslims in America,"" Majid said after the attacks.
President George W. Bush agreed with the Islamic leaders. While visiting a mosque, President Bush commented on the attacks on Muslim and Arab Americans. ""That's not the America I know,"" he said. ""That should not and that will not stand in America.""
Muslims practice the religion of Islam. Islam was first preached by the prophet Muhammad about 1,400 years ago.
In the 600s, Muhammad had a dream in which Allah, the Arabic name for God, called him to be a prophet. Islam means ""submission, commitment, and peace"".
Islam teaches that human diversity, or difference, is a sign of the richness of Allah's mercy. In other words, according to religious experts, Islam promotes peace.
Those experts add that the September 11 attacks do not represent Muslim beliefs. The majority of the 1.2 billion Muslims worldwide practice peace and tolerance toward others.

The new study worries many doctors. ""This is particularly disturbing, given that each day, over 4,800 [U.S.] teens smoke their first cigarette.

President George W. Bush recently recognized the heroic efforts Americans have made in the wake of this tragedy. In a speech on September 18, Bush said: ""Out of our tears and sadness, we saw the best of America. We saw a great country rise up to help. Tens of millions of dollars and thousands of hours and tons of food and clothing have all been donated to help rebuild shattered lives.""
By flying flags and holding vigils, millions of Americans shared the president's sentiments. ""As Americans, there is a bond between us, no matter how far away we are from one another,"" said Karen Bogart of Pasadena, California.
In the aftermath of the attacks, thousands of heroes offered to help. Those heroes were the volunteers, firefighters, police officers, and emergency crews at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Many of those heroes traveled thousands of miles to help out at ""ground zero,"" the site of the World Trade Center collapse, in New York City. ""We've had fire departments from Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and so many other places help us,"" said New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In addition to their usual jobs, rescue workers looked for pets trapped in deserted apartments or injured in the attacks. Many people who live near the World Trade Center in New York City had to leave their apartments quickly and were not allowed to return--even for their pets.

The above incidents took place in Florida during October. After reading such stories, many people might think that they should not swim in Florida's waters. But shark experts say that would be an overreaction. As scary as they are, shark attacks are rare.
The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) says you are more likely to be hit by lightning than be bitten by one of the more than 350 shark species. In fact, each year about 500 people are hurt by lightning in the United States. In 1999, only 58 shark attacks occurred

Shark Expert Rodney Fox explained, ""Sharks do not like humans; we are too bony. A lot of people who have been bitten by sharks have survived because the shark spat them out.""
One reason that shark attacks may seem more common than before is that more people are using shorelines for recreation, said George Burgess of ISAF.
Sharks that do bite humans have often mistaken people for other kinds of animals. For example, ISAF officials say sharks attack surfers wearing dark-colored wetsuits more often than they do anyone else. To a shark, the wetsuits make surfers look like seals, a favorite food.
Some shark experts say sharks should fear people, not the other way around.
One of the biggest threats to sharks, said Burgess, is

Conservation groups are urging governments to protect sharks. During the summer, the U.S. House of Representatives acted to protect sharks when it passed a bill that could prevent finning in U.S. waters. In order for that bill to become law, the U.S. Senate has to pass it, and the president must sign it.

Native American artifacts, such as these baskets, will be on display at the National Museum of the American Indian.
A wealthy New Yorker named George Gustav Heye collected most of the new museum's items throughout the early 1900s. He was interested in Native American culture and traditions.
There are about 800,000 Native American objects included in the museum's collection. The museum plans to display about 8,000 artifacts at a time.
The 4 million people who are expected to visit each year won't just find ancient objects--although there are plenty of them to see. Officials say the new museum also teaches people about Native Americans in modern times. Along with ancient pieces, such as beadwork, pottery, and carvings, visitors will also find newer ones, such as modern art and beaded sneakers.
The museum has been a work in progress for 16 years. Twenty-four Native American tribes helped build and plan the museum. They even reviewed the traditional dishes served in the museum's caf.
Symbolism abounds in the five-story building, which is made of limestone from Minnesota. The building's curved exterior resembles rocks shaped by wind and water over thousands of years.
In honor of many types of Native American dwellings, the museum's entrance faces east, in the direction of the rising sun. Inside, an electronic welcome sign greets visitors in 150 Native American languages.
Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today, each with its own culture. Native Americans have lived in North, South, and Central America for more than 20,000 years. When European explorers first arrived in North America, they thought they had landed in the East Indies. Those are islands located near Asia. That is why the explorers called the people living in the Americas ""Indians.""
To many Native Americans, the new museum has been a long time coming. ""[It is] long overdue,"" said Lawrence Small, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
Now that it is officially open, Native Americans hope the new museum keeps their culture alive. ""This will be a good education tool for everyone that wants to learn about the Indian people,"" a Cherokee woman told

, or communities of plants and animals. If spiders didn't exist, there would be a lot more insects!
""Spiders are your friends,"" Bradley said. ""They make our life more pleasant.""
Get caught up on some different types of spiders. Spiders come in all shapes and sizes. Crab spiders, jumping spiders, and orb weavers have made Rich Bradley's Ohio count. Find out more about them and other spiders.
Can you guess how this spider got its name? It may not live in the ocean, but it looks like a crab. The crab spider lives on flowers. It can match its body color to the flower's color. That allows it to sneak up on insects.
What a leap! The jumping spider can jump between 10 and 40 inches. To catch an insect, this hunting spider sneaks up on its prey and pounces.
The trap-door spider lives in a tunnel. The spider, common in the southwestern United States, lines the tunnel with silk and fashions a door made of silk and dirt. It peeks out of the slightly open door and grabs passing insects.
The tarantula is a large, hairy spider found mainly in warm regions, including the southwestern United States. Although the tarantula's bite is painful, it is not very poisonous to humans. Tarantulas hunt insects, lizards, mice, toads, and frogs.
E. B. White's famous spider Charlotte was an orb weaver. The orb-weaving spider spins a wheel-shaped web. When an insect flies into the web, the spider races toward its meal.

""This room was used from the Gemini missions all the way through to the space shuttle in the early 1990s,"" said NASA's Gary Kitmacher, my guide.
The Gemini missions took place in the mid-1960s. Their goal was to prepare humans to land on the moon.

734,"Some call his journey remarkable. Others call it just plain crazy. For Christopher Swain, it was the swim of a lifetime.
Swain recently made history as the first person to swim the entire length of the Columbia River. In July 2003, the Oregon man ended a yearlong journey to raise awareness about pollution in that river. His 1,243-mile trip began in Canada and ended where the river meets the ocean-the Pacific Ocean.
Why did he do it? ""Every waterway needs a champion,"" Swain told
. ""I learned as much as I could about the river so I could see what I could do to clean it up.""
In 1805, explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were journeying west to find a passage to the Pacific Ocean. At that time, they described the Columbia River as clear, free flowing, and teeming with, or full of, salmon.
The Columbia River has changed since the days of Lewis and Clark's journey. Today, it is ravaged by
, or damage, the air, water, or land. Chemicals and waste from factories and towns contribute to water pollution. The pollution has caused a drop in the river's salmon population.
that have been built along the river mean the Columbia no longer flows freely. The dams are water barriers that provide electricity, control flooding, and carry water to farms.
The pollution in the river inspired Swain to take action. Wearing out seven wetsuits along the way and battling several colds, Swain braved water temperatures as low as 38 degrees. Followed by a boat, he swam between 5 and 25 miles a day through the polluted water.
""The Columbia River is a contaminated beauty,"" Swain told
. ""It runs through some of the most majestic landscapes on Earth.""
Despite the pollution, Swain is hopeful about the future of the river. During his journey, he spoke with nearly 13,000 people, including 8,000 schoolchildren, about keeping the river clean.
""With all the affection for the river, we have a chance to turn the [pollution problem] around,"" Swain said. ""Kids know that they want clean water.""
Earlier last year, Swain received the International Earth Day Award for protecting the Columbia River. And he hasn't finished making a splash yet! Later this year, he plans to swim in Lake Champlain, which borders Vermont and New York, the Hudson River in New York, and the Charles River in Boston.
How will Swain celebrate Earth Day on April 22? ""I will be in an East Coast waterway on Earth Day,"" he promised.
Each year, people celebrate Earth Day on April 22. They participate in community activities and care for the environment.
This year, the Earth Day theme is ""Water for Life."" Here are some ways experts say that kids can help protect water:
You can conserve water by turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth.
Organize a beach or river cleanup. Beach garbage, such as plastic rings, can get tangled around sea creatures and injure or harm them.
Make sure to put trash in its proper place-not in the water or down a drain.
What does Swain mean when he refers to the river as a ""contaminated beauty""?

This latest discovery has surprised scientists. ""The chances of finding a large, noisy monkey that no one has ever scientifically described before makes this a rare event indeed,"" says scientist Trevor Jones.
Highland mangabeys are shy creatures. Their shyness makes them difficult to spot. That might explain why scientists were unaware that the species had existed. Another reason is that the monkeys live high in the forest
Scientists are working hard to protect the highland mangabey's environment. It is estimated that fewer than 1,000 of the monkeys live in the wild. Scientists say the discovery shows that there is still a lot to learn about Africa.

It's not surprising that fantasy has turned millions of kids into book-worms. ""Fantasy allows children to think about other worlds and contrast them to their own,"" says Allison. ""It stretches their imaginations.""
What exactly makes a story a fantasy? Traditionally, a fantasy tells the story of a single character, the hero, such as Harry Potter. Like Harry, the hero is often unaware of his or her power. After crossing into a different world, the hero is faced with a series of tests.
In a fantasy story, a teacher often shows the hero the tricks of the trade. In
, wise Gandalf protects the hobbit Frodo. Harry, too, is taught by Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts.
Fantasy books typically end with a battle between the hero and the villainand the hero ultimately wins. If Rowling sticks to the fantasy formula, will Harry defeat Lord Voldemort in Book 7 of the series?
The fantasy craze has also hit the big screen, with many books being made into films. Fans of
movies turned out in record numbers. This December, a film version of the classic C. S. Lewis book

The Arctic is the icy, cold region located around the North Pole. In November, scientists from eight countries released a report saying that the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of Earth.
In the report, scientists predict that at least half of the summer sea ice in the Arctic will melt by the end of this century. The scientists blame
for the Arctic thaw. That is the gradual rise in Earth's temperature.
Arctic ice is melting at an alarming rate. Winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen between 4 and 7 degrees Fahrenheit. During the past 30 years, polar bears have lost more than 386,000 square miles of ice--an area larger than the states of Texas and Arizona combined.
More than 20,000 polar bears live in the Arctic regions. Disappearing sea ice threatens polar bears and other cold-weather animals. Polar bears use the ice as a bridge to hunt seals, their primary source of food.
As the sea ice disappears, the mighty
, or hunters, catch fewer seals and risk starvation. Seals also depend on the ice to rest and give birth. Scientists fear that polar bears, seals, and other animals that rely on the ice could be wiped out by the end of the century if the warm-up continues.
Some of the 4 million people who live in the Arctic have also found themselves on shaky ground. As the frozen land thaws, buildings and roads have weakened.
Inuits (IH-nyoo-wets), a group of native people in the region, fish and hunt Arctic animals, including polar bears. They depend on those animals as their main source of food. Inuit hunters are also falling through thinning ice.
Rising sea levels have forced some people in the Arctic to move their coastal villages inland. The report warns that melting ice could cause sea levels to continue to rise--up to 3 feet by the end of this century. Towns and cities along coastlines around the world could flood as a result.
The warm-up also affects other parts of the planet. Arctic ice and snow reflect heat from the sun into space. Without the ice and snow, the planet would be much warmer. ""The polar regions are essentially the Earth's air conditioner,"" said scientist Michael McCracken.
Who cranked up the thermostat on the Arctic? Scientists say human activity is to blame for global warming. People use
, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to power cars, heat homes, and create electricity.
Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Burning those fuels gives off gases that trap heat from the sun and add to the overheating of the Earth.
To protect life in the Arctic, scientists say people need to limit their use of fossil fuels. ""Climate change is not just about the future,"" said scientist Pal Prestud, who worked on the report. ""It is happening now.""
The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Those gases collect in a layer and trap heat from the sun. The layer of gases is like the windows in a greenhouse. The process is called the
Too much of those gases in the air causes temperatures to rise. That is known as

Most kids who play football get minor bruises and scrapes. Some injure their knees and even break bones. Others get head concussions. But a 10-year-old girl died on September 2. Doctors said a football injury probably caused the fatality.
Taylor Davison, who lived in Illinois, liked to play football. She was the only girl who played in a football league of 400 players.
Taylor played full-contact football. During a practice in August, she complained of a headache and fell down. Three days later, she died. Doctors said she died as a result of a severe blow to the head, possibly caused by a tackle.
Doctors do not know how many child athletes are injured on the playing field each year. ""There is a serious lack of data about what types of injuries are occurring, said Dr. Reginald Washington, a doctor of sports medicine.
Although not enough is known about sports-related injuries among children, Washington and other doctors say kids and coaches can follow certain safety tips. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh give this advice:
Coaches should receive first-aid training. They should also be trained to recognize whether a child athlete has a severe head injury.
Leagues should have rules that require kids to take time off from playing after they have suffered an injury-especially a head injury.
To make sure they are safe, kids should always wear the proper safety equipment when playing any sport.

456,"On New Year's Day 2001, Irene Alexander and 2,538 other people gathered at Mount Vernon, George Washington's home in Virginia. They came to honor the slaves who had worked there. On New Year's Day 200 years earlier, 123 of George Washington's slaves had been freed.
Washington's widow, Martha, freed her husband's slaves on January 1, 1801. Martha was carrying out the wishes of the country's first president, who had died on December 14, 1799. In his will he had requested that his slaves be freed after his wife's death.
During the ceremony, Alexander, a descendant of a slave who worked at Mount Vernon, told visitors, ""I hope you all feel, as I do, a sense of joy, a sense of sadness but also a sense of hope that the contributions of good people will always be remembered.""
Jennifer Saxon, a spokesperson for Mount Vernon, told
that Mount Vernon couldn't have prospered without slave labor. ""Slaves did most of the work,"" she said.
When Washington was born, many Americans owned slaves. Those people used slaves to plant crops and perform many other duties. Most people thought slavery was OK. When Washington was 11 years old, his father died and left him ten slaves.
During the American Revolution, which began in 1775, some people began to think that slavery was wrong and should be ended. Washington was one of those people. He vowed never to buy another slave.
In his will, Washington wrote that all his slaves should be freed. ""Upon the [death] of my wife,"" he wrote, ""it is my...desire that all the slaves which I hold in my own right shall receive their freedom.""
To make sure Washington's wishes were carried out, Martha freed his slaves in 1801, a year before she died. Martha, however, kept the slaves she owned when she freed her husband's slaves.
Even though Washington freed the slaves he owned, slavery remained legal in some states for another 64 years, until 1865. Slavery did not end in the United States until after the Civil War ended it.

413,"Assur was once one of the greatest cities in the world. About 30,000 people lived there. A huge temple tower, or ziggurat, stood about 200 feet above the city streets. Assur (or Ashur) was one of the leading cities of Assyria, the center of a great empire.
Today, ancient Assur is in ruins. Desert sand has covered over much of the 3,500-year-old city. Now Assur faces a new threat: water.
Assur is located in what is now Iraq, a country in the Middle East. Many parts of Iraq are covered by desert. Water is hard to find in the desert areas. To increase the amount of water, Iraqi officials are building a dam on the river Tigris.
The dam will trap the river's water. As the water rises, it might flood Assur and many other nearby ancient ruins.
Scientists worry that floodwaters will destroy artifacts hidden beneath the desert sand. Assur has already been the site of some amazing discoveries.
Scientists recently discovered four hidden tombs at Assur. They found ancient coffins, gold, jewelry, and gems. They also dug up the remains of two ancient Assurian queens.
Scientists used modern medical equipment to study the queens' bodies. They learned about some of the medical problems the ancient queens suffered from. The bodies showed evidence of dental cavities, sinus infections, and poor nutrition.
Michael Mller-Karpe, a scientist who studies ancient Assyria, said, ""The Assyrian queens have just begun to speak to us, and we are looking forward to more answers.""
Mller-Karpe and other scientists worry that the new dam may keep them from getting more answers. Even if the new dam doesn't flood Assur, the rising water could damage the ancient city. Moisture could cause the artifacts to crumble.
""You can't save Assur if it's [near] a dam,"" said scientist Peter Miglus. The soil beneath the ancient city would soak up water like a sponge. The water in the soil would destroy what's left of ancient Assur.
For now, scientists are scrambling to uncover the secrets hidden for centuries in Assur and other nearby communities. Meanwhile, some people are looking for ways to save the ancient cities. ""We don't want the slightest damage to Assur,"" one Iraqi official said.

208,"""If I had one wish, it would be to bring peace to Earth and comfort to all the families who lost friends and loved ones [in the terrorist attacks],"" fourth grader Brandon wrote in an e-mail to
Brandon and millions of other kids have come together to help the victims of the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. Those kids have been offering comfort to one another; collecting clothes, food, water, and other supplies to send to rescue workers; and raising money to help the victims' families.
As kids have reached out to help others, they've learned about what their country stands for. English teacher Nan Bartow of New Haven, Connecticut, has been teaching for more than 30 years. She said, ""Kids are more patriotic than ever before.""
Many other teachers agree with Bartow. ""The students are saying, 'We are proud to be Americans' and that they appreciate everything they have,"" said Cynthia Elwood, a principal in Arlington, Texas.
Kids have shown their appreciation by sharing what they have. Here are some of the things they have done:
In Georgia, Parker Pratt, age 10, and Mac Conway, age 9, opened a lemonade stand and collected about $60 for charity.
Teachers and students at the Academy Hill School in Wilton, Maine, declared Friday, September 21, Red, White, and Blue Day. Everyone at the school wore the colors of the American flag to school that day.
In Stow, Ohio, 7-year-old Alexa came up with an idea that enabled her class to raise $113. ""I saw people who were crying because they didn't have houses or anything and they lost their sisters and brothers,"" she said.
In Oklahoma, kids and their parents collected more than 40,000 teddy bears to give kids in 350 schools in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.
""It is especially hard for children to understand what has happened, but they know how to show love,"" said Sue Hale, who helped coordinate the donations. Many kids wrote and attached special notes to the bears they donated. They said the bears and notes would help give thousands of kids hope for a bright future.
If you are looking to help the victims and families of the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. you might contact the following organizations. Each of these organizations has a long history of helping disaster victims.
* The American Red Cross can be contacted at 1-800-HELP-NOW.
* The Salvation Army can be contacted at 1-800-SAL-ARMY.
* The United Way has set up the September 11 Fund to help victims and their families. You can learn more about the fund at
You may also have local chapters of these charities in your community. If so, you can call them and invite representatives to talk to your class about what they are doing to help.

582,"Tourists Put Pressure on World's Monuments and Parks
Some of the World's most important monuments and parks are being loved to death. Many sites around the world are in bad shape because of a recent sharp increase in the number of tourists worldwide. The causes of damage range from everyday wear and tear to pollution to
, or the destruction of property on purpose.
Each year, hundreds of millions of tourists visit special places around the world. In fact, according to the World Tourism Organization, by the end of this year about 668 million people will have made tourist trips. By 2020, the organization said, that number may more than double, to 1.5 billion tourists!
The problem is that a large number of visitors can damage a monument or park. The thousands of cars and buses that carry tourists to a site create air pollution. Air pollution can discolor and damage monuments made of stone and other materials. Huge numbers of tourists also cause garbage to pile up. And sometimes tourists take pieces of monuments away with them as souvenirs.
These are some of the special places that are suffering from too much attention:
. These are two of the biggest national parks in the United States. Millions of tourists each year crowd into these areas. As a result, air pollution, garbage, and other damage have marred these awesome sites.
. Located in Peru, a country in South America, Machu Picchu is the site of an ancient city in the Andes Mountains. A people called the Incas built the city almost 600 years ago for Incan royalty. Garbage tossed aside by tourists, as well as air and water pollution, are now problems at Machu Picchu.
. The Parthenon is a temple that was built almost 2,500 years ago in Athens, a city in the European country of Greece. Air pollution has pitted and discolored the marble that the beautiful building is made of.
. Located near the town of Dunhuang, in north-central China, these caves are covered with delicate paintings and carvings. However, the breath of the 300,000 visitors who pass through the 492 caves each year is damaging the artwork, which is between 700 and 1,700 years old.
To help preserve such important places, new rules are being written by organizations such as UNESCO, which is a part of the United Nations. UNESCO is working with governments worldwide to limit the number of tourists who visit some special sites.
UNESCO is also working to educate sightseers about how to avoid damaging the places they visit. As one student who works with UNESCO said, ""You have to protect the past to reach tomorrow.""
If you are visiting a monument or national park, here are a few rules the U.S. Park Service says you should always follow:
If you are camping, take your trash and leftover food out with you when you leave.
When visiting a monument, don't touch sculptures, paintings, or other artwork.
Leave any artifacts, plants, stones, or other things where they are.
If you see someone damaging a monument or throwing garbage on the ground in a park, tell a park ranger or another park official.

779,"Is Atlantis a myth? For centuries, people have wondered whether this legendary land really existed. A
is a made-up tale that is often accepted as truth. Now an American scientist claims he has discovered the remains of Atlantis on the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.
According to the age-old myth, Atlantis was a place of great wealth. The ancient kingdom gleamed with gold and silver and was a center for art and learning.
Over time, the people there became corrupt and greedy. As punishment, the gods unleashed powerful earthquakes and floods that swallowed up Atlantis and sank it to the ocean floor.
The only account of this legendary lost land comes from the long-ago writings of Plato. He was an ancient Greek writer who lived about 2,500 years ago. People don't know how much of Plato's text is factual, because he wrote about an event that had happened 9,000 years before his time.
Robert Sarmast, the American scientist behind the recent claim, performed sonar tests of the Mediterranean seafloor. Sonar tests use sound waves to find underwater objects.
Sarmast believes that he has found Atlantis in the Mediterranean Sea, between Syria and Cyprus.
Sarmast says his tests revealed human-made walls and structures that matched Plato's description. ""If you compare [my findings to Plato's description], you will be astonished,"" Sarmast told reporters. ""We hope that future expeditions will bring back physical proof.""
A scientist from Germany says the newly found ruins are underwater volcanoes that spewed mud, not the remains of Atlantis. Other scientists say the only location for Atlantis was Plato's imagination.

Plato wrote about Atlantis as an island in the western sea. Many people believe that location meant the Atlantic Ocean.
, or idea, is that the story of Atlantis refers to the ancient Minoan (mih-NOH-ehn) people. They lived on the islands of Crete and Thira, between Greece and Turkey.

Scientists were conducting a study of fish at Meadow Lake in New York City. To their horror, they found a fish with a long body, a snakelike head, and razor-sharp teeth. They counted another and another, until there were five in all. At that point, they knew they had a problem.
Snakehead fish can slither over land from one body of water to another and can breathe air. They dine greedily and can clear a pond of all its fish. They are among the hundreds of

An invasive species is a plant or an animal that does not belong in the area in which it is living. Many invasive species lack

Snakehead fish arrived in the United States from China and Korea, most likely as pets. When their owners no longer wanted them, they threw the fish into nearby lakes and streams. Snakehead fish now live in several states, from Maryland to California.
Snakehead fish aren't the only accidental arrivals. In the Great Lakes region, fingernail-sized zebra mussels hitchhiked from Russia in the water tanks of ships. Now the mussels clog pipes that provide drinking water to homes and schools.
In Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, young emerald ash borers have killed more than 6 million trees. These beetles likely arrived from China in wood packing material carried in ships or airplanes.
And in Hawaii, tiny coqui (koh-KEE) frogs are now a huge problem. The frogs hitched a ride to the ""Aloha State"" in a plant shipment from Puerto Rico. The noisy frogs produce a piercing sound that keeps people awake at night.
Scientists in New York are trying to control the snakehead fish population by increasing the salt levels in the lake. Snakeheads can't survive in salty water.
Robert Wiese of the Fort Worth Zoo also advises people not to release unwanted pets into the wild, which is especially a problem with tropical fish that are put into rivers and lakes. Invasive species, like snakehead fish, disrupt

Nearly 40 percent of elementary schools have either eliminated or are considering eliminating recess, according to the American Association for the Childs Right to Play.
Why? Some school officials say they want students to have more classroom time to learn. They hope that more time in class will help students perform better on standardized tests.
In addition, many schools are cutting recess because they can no longer afford to offer it. Those schools dont have the money to hire lunch aides or to buy sports equipment for the playground.
Most teachers and parents say that recess has a place in school. Nine of 10 teachers say free time spent with friends is an important part of the school day, according to a recent survey conducted by the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA).
Education experts also stress that the benefits of recess outweigh the lost class time. Recess gives students the opportunity to take a break, exercise, and socialize with their friends.
At recess, many students learn how to

The countdown to Election Day has begun. On November 7, Americans will head to the polls to vote in the
Midterm elections happen in the middle of a presidents term in office. (Voters choose a president every four years. The next presidential election is in 2008.)
Members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate meet in the Capitol in what is called a joint session.
Midterm elections give voters a chance to choose people to represent their state in
Members of Congress make up the U.S.
Congress, the legislative branch of government, makes our nations laws.
On Election Day, candidates will compete for 33 of 100 seats in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Elections for governors will also be held in 36 states.
Members of Congress typically belong to one of the two main
in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about government goals. This election will decide whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party controls Congress for the next two years.
Republicans currently have control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Republicans have had the upper hand in the House since 1994. Republicans have also controlled the Senate for most of the past 12 years.
A party controls the House of Representatives or the Senate when its members win a
or more than half, of the seats in it. (See
.) Why is control of Congress so important? The party in power can more easily accomplish its goals and shape U.S. law.
For months, representatives from both political parties have tried to win over voters. Their members have been speaking about important issues, or problems, our country faces. Some of those issues are the war in Iraq, gas prices, and health care. (See
""Our country is facing some serious challenges here and around the world,"" Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told
""At home, our economy has made it harder and harder for working people to make ends meet."" He added that ""the war in Iraq and emerging threats from other nations present new challenges to our national security.""
""Our top priority is to ensure that we continue to keep Americans safe while spreading freedom and democracy abroad,"" Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told
""Republicans will also work to keep taxes and healthcare prices low so that families have more money to spend on things that are important to them.""
Which party will come out on top in this election? Its up to the voters to decide.
Here are some key issues on voters minds this election season.
Recent polls show that Americans support for the war in Iraq has dropped. President George W. Bush and many Republicans say the war is an important part of making the United States safer. Many Democrats say its time to rethink U.S. strategy in Iraq.
Gas prices have been high for the last year. Only recently have they begun to dip. Many voters are worried about the high cost of gas. They want to hear plans for making gas more affordable.
About 45 million Americans dont have health insurance. If they get sick, it will be difficult for them to pay for medical care and drugs on their own. Voters are looking for ways in which the government can make health care more affordable.

Martin Luther King, Jr. at the March on Washington, August 28, 1963.
On a summer day in 1963, more than 200,000 people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to rally for equal rights. There, they heard Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Today, construction of a memorial honoring King is under way about a half mile from the Lincoln Memorial, where King gave that famous speech. The new memorial will be the first on the National Mall to honor an African American.
The groundbreaking ceremony for the King memorial was held on November 13. President George W. Bush, former President William Jefferson Clinton, poet Maya Angelou, and talk show host Oprah Winfrey were among the speakers at the event. ""We give Martin Luther King his rightful place among the many Americans honored on the National Mall,"" Bush told the crowd of about 5,000 people.
King (19291968) dedicated his life to helping others. As a boy growing up in the U.S. South, King witnessed African Americans being treated unfairly. At that time, the South was
or separated by race. Under the law, African Americans were not allowed to attend the same schools as white people and had to sit in the backseats of buses. African Americans also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains.
When King was older, he worked to change those unjust laws. During the 1950s and 1960s, he gave speeches and organized peaceful marches and protests.
Beginning in 1955, King led the famous Montgomery bus boycott to protest segregation. For 381 days, African Americans
or refused to use, public buses in the Alabama city. A year after the boycott began, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregation on buses was illegal.
King gained national attention from the boycott. As a result of his work, civil rights laws were passed.
are personal rights to freedom and equality guaranteed to all U.S. citizens and protected by the Constitution.
The King memorial is scheduled to be completed in 2008. The design uses water, stone, and trees to represent the themes of justice, democracy, and hope. The King memorial will also include a boulder called the Stone of Hope, from which will emerge a 30-foot figure of King. The memorial will contain a circular stone wall chiseled with King's words.
King's dream was for all people to be treated fairly and equally under the law. The design of the memorial is based on a line from his historic ""I Have a Dream"" speech: ""We will be able to hew [cut] out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.""

For example, a rescue team saved a 4-year-old girl trapped under tons of concrete several days after the quake had struck.
Disaster experts say that the quake caused more than $5 billion in damage. It will take years for the people affected by the disaster to recover from it.

The teddy bear is named for a former U.S. president,Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt. He became president in September 1901.
Before becoming president, Roosevelt was an American hero. In 1898, he led a famous cavalry regiment in the Spanish-American War. His regiment was called the Rough Riders. The Rough Riders won an important battle during the war.
After becoming a war hero, Roosevelt was elected as the governor of New York. He then became President William McKinley's vice president. When McKinley was killed, Roosevelt became president.
Roosevelt liked lots of activities. He liked boxing, hiking, horseback riding, hunting, and swimming. When he liked something, Roosevelt would enthusiastically say, ""Bully.""
In 1902, Roosevelt went bear hunting. After several days of hunting, he had not found a bear. His guide finally tracked down a bear and captured it. Roosevelt, however, couldn't bear to shoot the tired animal.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.

is a person who takes the law into his or her own hands. So if a bullied student feels a school isn't helping, that student may act out against others, he said.
Bullying may be one of the causes behind some of the recent shootings in U.S. schools, according to Stephens. Kids at Santana High School, in Santee, California, said bullying may have a part in a recent shooting there.
Santee student Charles ""Andy"" Williams, age 15, is accused of killing two boys and wounding 13 other people at Santana High School on March 5. According to schoolmates, in addition to having other personal problems, Williams had been bullied and teased.
School safety experts say everyone in a school, as well as parents, must work together to make sure no kids are disrespected or treated cruelly.
To stop bullying, some schools have organized
. A peer mediation group allows students who have problems getting along to work the problems out with the help of peers and teachers.
Other schools have sent students and teachers forms asking questions about such problems as bullying and teasing. The answers from the forms help school leaders and parents become more aware of kids' problems and figure out ways to solve them.
Finally, Stephens suggests that there are steps a student who is bullied can take. ""Make it clear that you don't like being bullied and then walk away and tell an adult,"" Stephens said.
Ronald Stephens, of the National Center for School Safety, gives these three tips to remember if you are ever bullied:
If a person is bullying you, tell the person in a firm, loud voice that you don't like what they are doing. Then...
Find an adult (teacher, parent, coach) and tell that adult what happened.

Fourth grader Annie Inglese knows how important it is to get the right amount of sleep each night. ""If I don't get enough sleep,"" she says, ""I have trouble getting up in the morning.""
Sleep experts say that kids who do not get a good night's sleep on a regular basis put their safety at risk. Delaying bedtime for other activities can lead to accidents, such as falling off a bike or getting hurt on the playground.
In addition to preventing injuries, children who get enough sleep on a regular basis tend to get better grades and be in a better mood. ""Sleep is just as important as nutrition and exercise in our overall health,"" says Dr. Carl Hunt, a sleep expert with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Estimates show about 1 out of every 4 adults does not get enough sleep. Sleep experts think that number may be just as high for kids. According to the NIH, children ages 7 to 11 need at least nine hours of sleep each night.
Most kids and families today have busy schedules that can keep them from getting enough sleep. Plus, watching television, chatting on the Internet, and playing video games all compete with valuable sleep time.
Going to bed at the same time each night will help you get a good night's sleep. If you have trouble falling asleep, Dr. Hunt advises you to unwind with quiet time. Reading or listening to soothing music can help bring on sleep.

So can a good night's sleep help Christina do her best playing ice hockey and the flute? Can sleep help
""Getting a good night's sleep is good for your brain and body and helps you grow,"" sleep expert David Dinges told
. ""You're less likely to be tired the next day, you're less grouchy, more alert, and perform better in school and in sports.""
While you're snoozing, your brain doesn't shut down. Your brain stays busy and goes through five stages of sleep each night.
, sleep. It gets that name because your eyes move around quickly under closed eyelids. Your brain becomes very active during REM sleep. Most dreaming takes place during that sleep stage. Your body cycles through REM and non-REM stages several times a night. Each cycle lasts about 90 minutes.
Everybody dreamsalthough scientists don't know exactly why. Scientists have different
, or ideas, about why dreams are useful. One theory is that dreams help make sense of the day's events. Some scientists think that dreams help the brain sort and store information.
The latest evidence shows that dreams may help people master new physical skills, such as playing an instrument or riding a bike. Both dreaming and getting a good night's sleep may also help people improve their problem-solving skills. In one study, scientists divided volunteers into groups to solve a math problem. The group that received more sleep solved the problem more often than the group that didn't receive as much sleep.
Why do we remember some dreams but not others? When you wake up affects how vividly you recall your dreams. If you awaken during REM sleep, you're more likely to remember the details of a dream. If you wake up during another stage, you might not remember your dreams as wellor at all.
Whether or not you remember your dreams, it's important to get into a healthful sleep routine. ""The enemies of sleep are staying up late to play video games or watch TV,"" said Dinges.
Like people, all warm-blooded animals dream. Some animals sleep a little, and others sleep a lot. The amount of sleep an animal requires depends on its needs. Take a look at the sleep patterns of some creatures.

676,"Hours before giant waves pounded coastlines in South Asia, many animals started behaving strangely. In Sri Lanka, elephants trumpeted frantically and fled to higher ground. Bats and flamingos deserted low-lying areas. Many other animals escaped unharmed.
Wildlife experts are amazed that many animals survived the tsunami. The series of huge waves killed thousands of people in South Asia and East Africa about two months ago. Experts say animals might have sensed the approaching waves and moved to higher ground.
""I think animals can sense disaster. They know when things are happening in nature,"" said an official at the national wildlife department in Sri Lanka.
Elephants' sharp senses may have warned them about the tsunami.
Other stories of odd animal behavior before the tsunami have also surfaced. Giant waves flooded low-lying parts of Yala National Park in Sri Lanka, uprooting trees and killing hundreds of people. Wildlife officials reported, however, that few animals died. The park is home to hundreds of animals, including elephants, monkeys, leopards, tigers, deer, and water buffalo.
In Thailand, elephants carrying tourists from Japan bolted for the hills, and other elephants broke free of their chains. In one fishing village, nearly 1,000 locals escaped safely after birds squawked madly.
Although some animals in South Asia successfully fled to higher ground before the tsunami, other animals were not as lucky. Many dogs and other pets lost their owners in the tsunami and are homeless, sick, and without food or water. Cows, goats, and other farm animals are also roaming aimlessly. Many of those animals are drinking polluted water. Rescue groups have been sending animal food and
to the area. Veterinarians are doctors who care for animals.
Why might animals have known trouble was on the way? Forget special powers. Instead, experts say that animals have better senses of hearing, smell, and sight than humans do. Those sharp senses help warn animals when natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes, are about to happen.
""It doesn't surprise me that animals had an early warning of the tsunami,"" animal expert Michael Dee of the Los Angeles Zoo told
. ""The senses of certain species are far stronger than what any human has."" Dee points out that dogs, for example, have a stronger sense of smell than humans and that cats can see better in the dark than people.
Scientists say that animals might have felt the vibrations from the earthquake that set off the tsunami. In addition, many animals, including elephants, pigeons, and dogs, can also pick up
. That is a sound that is too low in pitch for humans to hear.
""Elephants can hear or feel other elephants grumble up to 2 miles away, so they probably felt the earthquake,"" said Dee. ""Their first
would be to move away from the direction of the sound."" An instinct is a natural, untaught behavior or reaction.
Before the tsunami struck, animals may have started to flee because they saw other creatures running. ""Animals take their cues from other animals,"" said Dee.
How animals sense danger has fascinated people for centuries. Most scientists are quick to point out, however, that nothing has ever been proven.
Will animal instincts be used to create a warning system about natural disasters anytime soon? ""I wouldn't count on [it],"" said Dee.
In the meantime, animals are helping out in other ways. For example, elephants are assisting in the cleanup of areas hit by the tsunami.
Scientists say that elephants can pick up vibrations from earthquakes through their broad feet.
Elephants' toenails are in the skin and not attached to the toes.
Elephants' soles have sensitive foot pads that detect vibrations, such as those from an earthquake. That signals elephants to move to more stable ground.
In what other ways might animals' sharp senses be helpful?

According to scientists in England, cookies pick up moisture as they cool after coming out of the oven. The moisture causes the cookies to expand and contract, which results in cracks. The cracks cause cookies to easily break when they're moved or packaged.

Temperatures are on the rise in Antartica. What does that mean for emperor penguins and other wildlife?
Emperor penguins and other Antarctic wildlife ""feel the heat"" as their icy home melts away.
In the hit documentary March of the Penguins,
emperor penguins make an amazing journey. They cross the vast continent of Antarctica, a frozen area that surrounds the South Pole. The penguins leave their ocean homes and cross the ice on a dangerous trip. They are blinded by blizzards and toppled over by strong winds. But each winter, they do this to lay their eggs and raise their chicks.
That cycle of life may be in trouble though. Scientists have discovered an alarming rise in temperatures around Antarctica. ""The region at the peninsula has warmed up about 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 40 to 50 years,"" Wayne Trivelpiece, a scientist who studies Antarctica, told Weekly Reader.
A recent study also shows that the ocean near the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed since the 1960s. A
is a stretch of land surrounded on three sides by water. A change in temperature could spell trouble for penguins, whales, seals, and other creatures at the South Pole.
Although researchers are certain about the increase in temperatures, they are still unsure about the cause. Many scientists blame
the gradual rise in Earths average temperature.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth. Temperatures there rarely reach above freezing. Although it is too cold for humans to permanently live there, many animals swim in the icy waters surrounding the continent. Penguins, for example, waddle across the ice and dive into the cold ocean waters in search of food. They eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called
In warmer water, however, krill have trouble surviving. ""Warming temperatures have led to a decline in sea ice,"" says Trivelpiece. ""Sea ice holds the food that krill need to survive. Without the ice, there is less food for krill and without the krill, the penguins are not surviving.""
These changes could upset the balance of the food chain and endanger larger animals and birds. A loss of penguins could leave leopard seals and whales hungry. (See
.) ""A very small change in temperature [can] completely change the whole food chain,"" says Trivelpiece.
Its not just emperor penguins and other creatures that may be in trouble. People who live thousands of miles away may be affected by melting ice.
As glaciers and sheets of ice melt, they add to the worlds sea level. When ice on land falls into the ocean and melts, it raises the water level. It is like dropping ice cubes into a glass of water. A 4-foot increase in global sea level would drown low-lying coastal areas.

To kick off the cleaning, workers scaled the mountain and sprayed the left side of Jefferson's forehead with water. They also blasted Jefferson's eyelid and jaw with handheld hoses to wash away decades of dirt.
""Apart from the dirt, we are concerned with the lichens,"" Mount Rushmore official Judy Olson told
. Lichens are small plant-like organisms that can grow on hard surfaces, such as rock and bark. They make an acid that can harm the faces. ""The lichen roots are digging into the stone,"" Olson says.
The workers took special care near the cracks on the stone faces. They used pressure washing instead of chemicals. Pressure washing has been used to clean other historical structures, including the Statue of Liberty in New York City and the Coliseum in Rome.

Queen Nefertiti's name means ""the beautiful one has come."" It is not surprising that she was given such a name. Queen Nefertiti has long been admired for her swanlike neck and high cheekbones.
But Nefertiti was more than just a pretty face. She is believed to have been one of the most powerful women who ever lived. She ruled Egypt more than 3,000 years ago. Egypt is a country in Africa.
Mysteriously, no one knows how Queen Nefertiti died. Her remains have never been found--until now, perhaps.
led by Joann Fletcher uncovered three mummies in a tomb in Egypt. (Archaeologists are scientists who dig up ancient objects and study them to learn about the past.) Fletcher believes that one of the mummies is Queen Nefertiti.
Modern science is helping Fletcher prove her idea and identify the face of the mummy. After X-rays of the mummy were taken, scientists put together a computerized version of what the face would have looked like.
What they discovered was amazing! The re-created face resembles a famous sculpture of Queen Nefertiti that was made during her reign.
""If the mummy is who we think it is, it would certainly help to answer a lot of unanswered questions,"" said Fletcher.
Scientists are quick to point out that the computerized version of the face does not prove that the mummy is Queen Nefertiti. The re-created face, however, isn't the only clue to the past.
There are other pieces of the puzzle that make Fletcher's team think the mummy is Nefertiti. First, the mummy's hair had been shaved off. Nefertiti preferred a shaved head so that her crown would fit tightly. A shaved head also helped her stay cool in Egypt's heat. Second, traces of a wig found next to the mummy matched the kind Nefertiti would have worn.
In addition, the mummy's left earlobe was pierced twice. Statues of Nefertiti show her having a double-pierced ear. The mummy's forehead showed the mark of a tight-fitting band--a sign of royalty. Another clue was the mummy's bent arm, which was broken off. Royalty were usually buried with their arms bent.
Not all scientists are convinced that the mummy is Nefertiti.
""If the mummy is female and if it is royal, then you still do not necessarily have Nefertiti,"" one archaeologist told
Another scientist from Egypt expressed doubts that the mummy is even a female. He said that both men and women could have double-pierced ears.
But Fletcher believes that she has found the long-lost queen and has returned Nefertiti to her rightful place in history.
The mummy which may be Nefertiti lies in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. That is an ancient burial ground for royalty. It is located in the desert, south of Cairo (the capital of Egypt) and along the west bank of the Nile River.

The pharaoh and Nefertiti were disliked because they challenged the religion of the time. They began to worship one god instead of many gods. As part of their new religion, they moved from the city of Thebes and built a new capital in the heart of the desert. The new capital was called Akhetaton (ah-keh-TAHT-uhn).
(The modern name is Amarna.) They also made many changes to the style of art and architecture of the time.

322,"Scientists are going ape over orangutans (o-RANG-oo-tanz). They are working to help save these endangered tree dwellers before they disappear from the wild.
In recent years, the red-haired apes have found themselves out on a limb. Wildlife experts warn that they may die out, or become
, within the next 20 years. Scientists estimate that only 30,000 orangutans are left in the wild.
Today, orangutans can be found only in tropical rain forests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, in Southeast Asia. They are
creatures, which means they eat, sleep, and travel mainly in trees.
To search for food, orangutans swing from branch to branch. They like to dine on leaves, flowers, bark, and sometimes insects.
""Orangutans spend most of their time in the trees and won't cross open grounds, so the only way they can [move]... is through the trees,"" said one wildlife expert. ""We need to maintain these forest [areas] so that orangutan populations of the future have the opportunity to continue to survive.""
What is causing the numbers of orangutans to decrease at an alarming rate? The main reason is the destruction of their rain forest
Humans pose the greatest threat to orangutans for a number of reasons, say experts. People cut down trees for lumber. This illegal logging is destroying much of the animals' homes. Many countries, including the United States, buy the lumber. It is often used in shelves, picture frames, and floors.
Forest fires and farming are also to blame. As forests are cleared to make way for plantations, orangu-tans lose parts of their habitat.
In addition, orangutans have fallen victim to the recent boom in the illegal pet trade. People steal baby orangutans from the forest to sell them as pets.
To help bring these animals back from the brink of extinction, wildlife groups are working to protect orangutans and stop illegal logging. The government in the area is also involved in the effort to help orangutans. Police go into national parks to prevent illegal loggers from cutting down trees.
""Help is needed to save these amazing creatures,"" orangutan expert Cheryl Knott told
. ""If we can save the rain forest for orangutans, we can save it for other animals as well.""
The average life span for orangutans is about 50 years. Experts hope that orangutans born today will still be swinging through the trees at that age.
The orangutan got its name--which means ""person of the forest""--for a reason. Orangutans are remarkably intelligent. In the wild, scientists have spotted these clever creatures using sticks as tools to open fruit. Orangutans have been observed using large leaves as umbrellas to shelter themselves from heavy rains. Sometimes, the apes even use leaves as cups, from which they drink water.
Are there any endangered animals in the area where you live? What can people do to help them?

Each year, however, 15 million kids worldwide die from diseases, including hepatitis, cholera, and diarrhea, Arntzen said. Most of the children who get those diseases live in the poorest countries in the world, mainly in Asia, Africa, and South America.
Arntzen says it's impossible to send a doctor to vaccinate kids in every village in the world. Even if doctors could go to every village, many poor people couldn't afford to pay for the vaccinations.
That's why scientists are working on ways to change fruit and vegetable seeds. They want to make vaccines part of the plants, explained Arntzen. If the scientists are successful, people in poor countries could use the seeds to grow food that would protect them from some diseases. That way, an apple a day would not only keep the doctor away, but would keep deadly diseases away as well.

The wolves, however, weren't injured. The sharpshooter had shot special darts at them. The darts contained a drug that put the wolves to sleep.
U.S. government officials picked up the sleeping wolves. They planned to move the wolves to an area far away from people.
The two wolves are part of a program to bring wolves back to Arizona and New Mexico. Until about 1900, the Mexican gray wolf lived in both states. Some of the wolves ate cattle and attacked people. People hunted the wolves because they thought the animals were dangerous. By 1950, few wolves were left in the area.
The U.S. government has brought wolves back to those states. But ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico say wolves are causing problems again.
What's the scariest animal? Is it a grizzly bear, a shark, or a wolf? Or is it something else? Believe it or not, deer are more dangerous.
Deer may seem harmless, but they can cause a lot of trouble. Deer often wander onto busy roads. When they do, they can cause car accidents. In 2001, deer caused 26,000 car accidents. A year earlier, they caused 83 human fatalities.
Ranchers say the wolves that the sharpshooters hit with darts killed 19 calves. The ranchers fear that the wolves might attack people as well.

This copper brooch belonged to one of the Vikings.

The Vikings were pirates and warriors, known for their sea faring voyages. From the late 700s to 1100, the Vikings lived in Scandinavia. That region of Europe includes the present-day countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
Viking sailors spread fear throughout Europe. They raided and conquered coastal villages in Europe and along the Mediterranean coast. During their raids, Vikings captured slaves. They also
, or stole, treasures, such as silver and gold.
For their voyages, Viking sailors crafted swift, narrow
that could navigate the stormiest seas. The Vikings were the master shipbuilders of their time. Vikings also worked as farmers and craftspeople. Others hunted and fished.
The Vikings' claim to fame may have been their fearsome raids, but they were explorers and traders too. They were among the earliest explorers to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to North America.
The Vikings traveled to other parts of Europe, the Mediterranean, Greenland, and North America.
One of the most famous Vikings was explorer Leif Eriksson. He reached North America almost 500 years before Columbus arrived in 1492.
Longships varied in size, but many were between 60 feet and 90 feet in length.
A larger ship could carry about 50 raiders at a time.
Strong winds allowed a longship, which had one large sail, to reach speeds of up to 17 miles an hour.
Vikings used multiple oars to row the ship when there was no wind.
The front end of a longship curved upward and was adorned with a wood carving of a snake's or a dragon's head.
Over time, the Viking raiders lost their power as people learned to defend against their attacks. Today, the remains of Viking villages can be found throughout Europe and North America.
Archaeologists plan to study the burial ground in England to learn more about the life of the Vikings. Based on the objects found, they believe the site was once a Viking settlement.
Vikings were known to bury valuable items with the dead. As one historian put it, the site will allow experts to ""uncover the secrets of a time capsule more than 1,000 years old.""

Museum officials were stunned. The men had left a very important vase. Although the vase was in pieces, the good news was that it could be fixed.
""This is one of the most important pieces from the Baghdad museum, and I am delighted it has been returned,"" said a museum official. ""It is reason for people all around the world to celebrate.""
Why, exactly, would the return of a vase be cause for celebration? It was the famous Vase of Warka. The 5,000-year-old
, or man-made object, is one of the world's first sculptures. The images on the vase are important because they link the past to modern times.
Along with many valuable objects, the vase was stolen from the museum after the fall of Saddam Hussein's government in April.
At that time, mobs of thieves and rioters, or
, tore through the museum. They smashed ancient objects. Thieves ran off with prized treasures. Among the lost objects were carvings, jewelry, paintings, and statues.
One museum official referred to the looting as the ""crime of the century."" He said that it wasn't just a loss for Iraq, but that it was ""a loss for all mankind.""
. That means they could never be replaced. Some of the lost objects dated back 10,000 years, to the beginning of civilization.
Many people blamed U.S. troops for failing to protect the museum as Saddam's government fell. They pointed out that U.S. forces had managed to guard the oil reserves. U.S. government officials defended themselves, saying that American troops were focused on taking control of Baghdad.
Officials estimate that about 3,000 pieces from the museum's entire collection of 170,000 items are still missing. The losses were not as large as experts originally thought. Some valuable pieces were hidden in underground vaults. Other pieces were taken by people for safekeeping and then were returned.
Some of the stolen objects are slowly making their way back to the museum. Museum workers are trying to ensure the safe return of other objects. They began a ""don't ask; don't tell"" policy.
The policy allows thieves-like the ones who brought back the vase-to return stolen goods without punishment. Countries around the world are involved in recovery efforts. They are helping to compile a list of the stolen items. However, as one expert pointed out, ""It's going to be a long time before we know for sure what's missing.""
Modern-day Iraq is the site of ancient Mesopotamia. In Greek,
means ""the land between rivers."" There, about 5,000 years ago, the first cities sprang up between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
The area between the two rivers is often referred to as a cradle of civilization. That's because mathematics, science, and one of the first written languages developed there.
Here are some of the Iraqi National Museum's valuable artifacts and their status at the time
This 5,000-year-old stone statue of a woman praying was still missing.
This life-size marble head of a woman is one of the earliest pieces of sculpture. About 5,000 years old, it was stolen during the looting.
How did looters steal from world history when they ransacked the museum?
Originally thought to be missing, this tablet is a record of the world's earliest writing. It was found on the museum's second floor, away from the riots.

The workers have no time to spare. I'm getting a sneak preview as they prepare for the 77th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.
More than 2 million people will line the parade route. Another 60 million people will watch on TV. I meet with John Piper and his talented team, who produce every detail of the huge parade.
Piper is in charge of the studio. His crew designs and builds the floats and giant balloons that appear in the parade.
The 2003 Macy's parade lineup features 15 giant helium balloons and 27 smaller balloons. Also included will be 29 floats, some of which contain cold-air balloons called ""falloons."" Ten marching bands and 30 groups of clowns will spice up the festivities.
""We don't do anything small,"" Piper tells me.
The first giant balloon to fly in the Macy's parade was Felix the Cat, in 1927.
The parade has featured 170 giant balloons in its history. No more than 15 balloons are used each year.
Kermit the Frog stretches 78 feet, making it the longest balloon in this year's parade.
A record six different Snoopy character balloons have appeared in the parade over the years.
In 1957, a massive downpour caused the Popeye balloon to dump gallons of water on spectators below.
To prove his point, Piper leads me up two flights of stairs. Here, Macy's balloon experts-called ""balloonatics""-work their magic. In one area hang models of the parade's newest giant balloons. The balloons include ""Strike
Up the Band"" Barney, Sesame Street's Super Grover, and an all-new Garfield.
Garfield has flown in 15 Macy's parades, but this year he will have a friend-his teddy bear, Pooky.
In a large room next door, I watch as Piper checks the 49-foot-long Garfield balloon for leaks. On Thanksgiving morning, more than 50 Macy's ""handlers"" will steer the balloon 2.5 miles along the skyscraper-lined streets of New York City.
Downstairs, head painter Beth Lucas puts the final touches on an 8-foot-tall eagle. The giant bronze bird will be at the center of the ""Spirit of America"" float.
Nearby, other workers hammer away from atop a wooden frame that will become the ""Bridge to the Future"" float. The float will feature the newest Hess toy truck and race cars.
All the Macy's floats are weatherproof. When folded, they must be no more than 12.5 feet tall and 8 feet wide. That size allows them to fit through the Lincoln Tunnel on their way from the New Jersey studio to New York City.
Piper tells me that working on the parade is a dream come true. ""When I was a kid, my two favorite things in the world were cartoons and things that fly,"" he adds. ""The Macy's parade puts both of them together.""

472,"Experts hope 2006 will be the year the world is polio-free.
Will polio be declared a disease of the past?
World health groups are fighting a war
with a crippling and sometimes deadly diseasepolio. Their efforts are paying off. Polio has been wiped out in 10 African countries, according to a recent report.
Since mid-2003, nearly 200 children in those 10 western and central African countries were
for life, but no new cases have been reported since last June. When people are paralyzed, they are unable to move different parts of their bodies and may be unable to walk.
The disease raced across Africa and into Asia after people in Nigeria refused the polio
mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think well get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told
She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria.""
Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly
disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havent been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims.
With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world. On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government approved the use of a vaccine that stopped people from getting the disease. Jonas Salk was the doctor who invented the first polio vaccine.
A boy in Africa receives an oral polio vaccine from a WHO (World Health Organization) worker.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world thanks to Salk, it still threatens children in Africa and Asia. Major efforts were recently under way to
or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been
Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door.
To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November.
After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Its uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives.""
Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization.
Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why?
Jonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.
From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Roosevelts death, Salks vaccine was declared officially safe.
In October 2005for the first time in 26 years in the United Statesfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnt at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.

84,"Leaping lizards! Harry Potter is about to fly onto movie screens across the United States. The new movie is called
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
At the beginning of the movie, Dobby the house elf warns Harry that if he returns to Hogwarts, disaster will follow. Real problems begin when someone starts turning Hogwarts students into stone.
Recently, Daniel Radcliffe, the actor who plays Harry Potter, took time out from filming to talk to
. Here's what he had to say.
: How is Chamber of Secrets different from the first movie?
: Harry changes a lot in the second film. In the first film, Harry learns about hate. In the second film, he learns how to deal with hate and has to explore his own emotions. He learns that he has something in common with Lord Voldemort, and he has to cope with that.
: Did you learn any new skills?
: I learned how to sword fight. But Rupert [another child actor in the movie] learned how to drive a car for the flying-car scene. Unfortunately, I didn't get to learn to drive because I was in the passenger seat. We try to make it look realistic.
: How did you film the movie and go to school at the same time?
: I go to school three hours a day, every day. I have a fantastic teacher.
: How have your friends and family reacted to your fame?
: They don't treat me any differently. They see me as Dan. I wouldn't want my friends to see me as Harry.
: In what ways has your life changed since the first movie came out?
: It really hasn't changed that much. I am often recognized as Harry Potter. But I don't mind that.
: When you grow up, do you want to continue acting?
: I think I will take it one film at a time. After this film, I will do the third [Harry Potter] film. After that, we will see how it goes.
If you could play a role in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which role would you play? Why?
: What have you learned about making movies that you didn't know before you played Harry Potter?
: It's hard work. It is a lot of fun, but at the same time it's really a challenge.
: If you could play another character in the movie, who would you like to play?
: I would like to play Gilderoy Lockhart.

Troubled waters are ahead for the world's fish. Those finned creatures and shellfish, such as crabs and clams, may be a rare sight by 2048, according to a fouryear study. The study, recently published in the journal
was conducted by a team of 14 researchers in four countries.
If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
The study warns that ocean life is being wiped out because of overfishing and pollution.
Global warming (a rise in Earth's temperatures) and habitat loss are also to blame for the decline in seafood.
Although the world's sea life is in serious danger, it's not too late to reverse the problem, says the study's lead author, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. The researchers have called for measures to protect current fish populations, such as reducing large-scale fishing and pollution. ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we don't change things,"" Worm told reporters.
The loss of ocean life will cause more than just a shortage of seafood. It could spell disaster for ecosystems too. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that work together as a unit to live. A declining fish population would cause a disaster up and down the food chain. Larger animals, such as seals and dolphins, depend on fish for food. Without enough fish to eat, those animals would be in trouble.

Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.
Is it important to save manatees and other endangered plants and animals? Discuss in class and let us know at

Jesse Coltrane, a 15-year-old student at Camden's Promise, says that kids can help people in need through school and community projects. Like Jesse, thousands of students will be working in their schools and communities to make the world a better place during National Volunteer Week (April 27 through May 3).
This year will mark the 30th anniversary of National Volunteer Week. The theme of this year's week is ""Celebrate Volunteers-The Spirit of America."" As part of this year's week, kids across the United States will be taking part in service projects. Many kids will also participate in community events to honor volunteers.
""When you volunteer, you help America become strong. You become an instant champion!""
""Volunteers learn important skills like teamwork and responsibility,"" said Melissa Helmbrecht, founder of the volunteer organization Champions of Hope.
Champions of Hope is made up of more than 650,000 kids across the country and includes Jesse Coltrane and other students at Camden's Promise. Champions of Hope participants across the country are volunteering to collect food for the hungry, clean parks, and raise money for firefighters.
Champions of Hope started a United Day of Service on September 11, 2002, one year after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. On that day,
star Sean Astin spoke to youths gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., about the importance of civic action. Astin plays hobbit Sam Gamgee in the movie. Astin told
, ""It is our responsibility to keep making the world a better place. We can do that by helping others.""
Sixth-grade student Matthew Malon from Illinois attended the September 11, 2002, rally and has collected food for homeless shelters. Astin's speech on volunteering moved him.
Some students from Camden's Promise also attended the rally. Students Damian Johnson, Keith Bennett, and Tashay Moody agree that it's important for kids to volunteer.As 16-year-old Damian Johnson puts it: ""[Volunteering] makes me feel like I have made an impact on people who don't have as much as I have.""
""How can I make a difference in the world if I'm just an ordinary kid?"" Thirteen-year-old author Sondra Clark answers that question in her fourth book,

The action doesn't stop for actor Sean Astin when the cameras stop rolling. Astin, one of the stars of The Lord of the Rings movies and the father of two young children, is inspiring kids to make the world a better place.
In January, Astin was appointed to the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation. President George W. Bush created the council to encourage volunteerism. He has urged Americans to make a lifetime commitment to volunteering.
Astin tells kids that it's easy to make a difference. As a teenager in Santa Monica, California, he volunteered his time helping preschool students cross the street. He told Weekly Reader, ""I remember feeling that because I was helping someone, I had an incredible responsibility, and it felt great. It made me a better person.""

, a disease that makes it hard to breathe.
For many years, scientists have known that cigarette smoke, dog and cat
, dust mites, and cockroaches can trigger asthma attacks. Dander is tiny bits of fur and skin. Now scientists have added a new culprit to that list--mouse dander.
Scientists studied dust samples from 608 U.S. homes with children ages 4 to 9 who suffered from asthma. The scientists found many things in the dust, including evidence of mice. About 95 percent of the homes had at least one room that had mouse dander.
The scientists then tested the kids in each of the homes to see if mouse dander triggered asthma attacks in them. The dander triggered attacks in 18 out of every 100 kids.
As a result of those tests, Dr. Robert Wood of Johns Hopkins University concluded that mice trigger many asthma attacks. In fact, he said, the ""mouse is second in line [after the cockroach in causing asthma attacks].""
Mouse dander was found in many of the houses, even though not all of them had mice. Sometimes, kids tracked dander from mice and other animals into their homes when they came in from outside. Sometimes, the dander was from mice that had been in the home in the past.
Daniel, who lives in Clarksville, Maryland, suffers from asthma. Last year, scientists collected and studied dust from his home. The scientists found cat dander in the dust, even though his family didn't own a cat. It was cat dander that was triggering Daniel's asthma attacks, said Daniel's doctor.
To keep cat dander out of their home, Daniel and his mother frequently wash the floors, walls, and other surfaces. As a result, Daniel's mother said Daniel hasn't had an asthma attack in the last year.
Many kids who suffer from asthma might be able to breathe more easily if they could find ways to keep the dander of mice, cats, and other kinds of animals out of their homes.

Scientists recently discovered the organism responsible for the disease. It is a fungus that causes oozing red blobs to grow on diseased oak trees. On younger redwoods, it dries up leaves and kills sprouts. According to scientists, redwoods are hosts for the disease. A host is an organism on or in which another organism lives.
The disease first showed up in rhododendron plants in the Netherlands in 1993. Scientists are concerned because the spread of the disease could pose a threat to the redwoods' ecosystem, an environment where plants and animals coexist. Scientist David Rizzo said that anytime you have a strange organism, there is cause for concern.
Coastal redwoods can grow upwards of 360 feet. Some are taller than the Statue of Liberty, which stands about 300 feet.
The diameter of redwoods can measure about 20 feet.
Named California's state tree, the redwood can live more than 2,000 years.
In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Muir Woods a national monument dedicated to protecting and preserving the mighty redwoods.
In 1904, a fungus from Asia began killing chestnut trees in New York. Over the next 50 years, the disease killed about 3.5 billion trees and almost wiped out an entire species. Scientists want to prevent this from happening in California or elsewhere in the United States.
Studies show this disease spreads rapidly during the wet months of spring. The coming months could be vital in tracking the disease. Current weather forecasts predict that this spring will be rainier than the last two springs. ""We have to get familiar with the symptoms and the treatments,"" said another scientist, ""because we don't know how much farther it will spread.""

According to the study, which was paid for by the U.S. government, more than 5 million kids, ages 6 to 19, have suffered some hearing loss. That's more than one out of every ten kids. Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss.
Amanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. ""It was assumed in the past that children wouldn't have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage,"" Niskar said.
Niskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a ""problem for children,"" she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems.
Hearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems.
For example, hearing loss ""can influence [a] child's ability to learn in the classroom,"" Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions.
Niskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead.

In December, 3,000 sculptors and workers began constructing Harbin's winter wonderland. Harbin lies on the Songhua River, which provides the festival with some of its ice. The festival covers 44 square city blocks. Workers used enough snow and ice to fill 90 Olympicsize swimming pools!

The ice festival often has an ice slide that visitors use to get from one part of the city to another.
Visitors to the winter festival can even eat at restaurants made of ice, like this KFC.

In late January, officials fro South Korea traveled to North Korea. Both countries are located in eastern Asia. The reason for their visit was to try get North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Last October, officials in North Korea admitted to a U.S. official that North Korea is building nuclear weapons. That action violates a 1994 agreement to stop the spread of nuclear arms.
Tensions further increased when North Korea's leader, Kim Jong II, opened up nuclear power plants. The power plants had been closed under an agreement that North Korea made with the United States nearly ten years ago. Officials in North Korea say the power plants will only be used to generate electricity.
However, people in the United States and countries near North Korea, like South Korea and Japan, are concerned. They think that North Korea will use the plants make nuclear arms. North Korea recently kicked out U.N. weapons inspectors. That only added to the mistrust.
North Korea is an extremely poor country. Yet it spends most of its money on its army. It relies on help from other countries to feed its starving people.

Economy: many children and families are starving
Area: 38,000 square miles 9about the size of Indiana)

The United States is working with countries in the region, such as South Korea, to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear crisis. South Korea was hoping to help the United States negotiate a peaceful solution. However, officials in North Korea want to discuss the issue directly with the United States.

""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

Two brothers crept carefully through the mountains in China. The boys, along with their mother, sister, and aunt, had fled their home in North Korea. They hoped to find a better life in South Korea.
Like China, North and South Korea are countries in Asia. If the Chinese police had found the family, they would have sent them back to their country to be punished or even killed.
The brothers, Young Hoon* and Young Jun, and their family members walked, rode in cars, and flew on an airplane to reach South Korea. Their journey took about a year.
They were lucky. There are about 200,000 to 300,000 North Koreans now hiding in China. But only about 2,000 of them are expected to make it to South Korea this year.
Young Hoon, Young Jun, and their family members risked their lives to reach South Korea. Why? If they had stayed in North Korea, they faced starvation. Many North Korean children are hungry because their families cannot find food. In fact, over the past ten years, about 2 million people in North Korea have starved to death.
About a year after their arrival, the brothers tell me they are happy in Seoul, the busy capital city of South Korea. I visited Young Hoon and Young Jun at the Hannuri School, an after-school program for teens who have left North Korea and come to South Korea to start new lives.
Teachers at Hannuri help the North Koreans with their schoolwork. Many of the teens did not go to school regularly in North Korea, so they are behind in their lessons.
Even though North and South Korea are neighbors, the two countries are very different. North Korea is very poor. Its leader spends most of the country's money on the army, not on food for the people.
South Korea is more like the United States. The country has enough food for everyone, and most people drive cars, go to work, and eat at restaurants.
Young Hoon, 18, and Young Jun, 15, say that in North Korea they lived in a hut and ate mostly corn and potatoes. In South Korea, their lives are much different. The brothers live in an apartment and eat well. They love movies and video games.
North and South Korea are countries in eastern Asia. Korea used to be one country. It was divided in half after World War II (1939--1945). In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, starting the Korean War (1950--1953). After the Korean War, the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, was set up to divide the two countries. I visited the South Korean side of the DMZ. Everywhere I looked there were soldiers. I wasn't allowed to talk to them because they were on duty.
The brothers tell me about their plans for the future. Young Hoon wants to be a pilot. Young Jun wants to help people. They also hope to do something they never could have even dreamed of while living in North Korea--they want to visit the United States.

With a Spider-Man-like ability to cling to rocks, Scott holds several records. He is the youngest person to climb to the
, or peak, of Half Dome and El Capitan in one day each. Those famous granite peaks are located in Yosemite National Park in California.Now Scott has set his sights higher. This spring, he plans to climb both mountains within 24 hours. Scaling nearly 4,900 feet of rock is equal to climbing four Empire State Buildings in a day.
Only a few experienced adult climbers have accomplished this feat in 24 hours. Climbers may take up to eight days to reach both summits. Leading Scott on his
, or journey, will be a skilled adult climber.
At 3:30 am, Scott will begin climbing a route on El Capitan called The Nose
At 3:30 pm, he will ""top out"" on the summit
At 5:40 pm, after a two hour hike down El Capitan, Scott will begin another two hour trek to Half Dome's base.
At 7:30 pm, Scott will begin climbing the Northwest Face. He will reach Half Dome's summit at 2:30am.
Scott has been climbing mountains since he was 7 years old. He first fell in love with the sport during a family vacation.
Why does Scott like the challenge of the sport so much? He sums it up this way: ""Climbing is fun for me.""
He also points out that climbing has taught him valuable lessons. ""You learn about trying over and over and not giving up.""
Scott Cory plans to become the youngest person to climb both of Yosemite's twin peaks in a single day.

A spectacular tradition of college football takes place before every Florida State University (FSU) home game. A student dressed as the famous Seminole leader Chief Osceola (ah-see-OH-luh) charges down the field on a horse. The student launches a flaming spear into the air, which lands midfield. The fans, a sea of red and gold, cheer wildly.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tried to end that tradition. The NCAA is the organization that oversees college sports. The NCAA banned the use of Native American names, logos, or

Seminole tribes in Florida and Oklahoma objected to the ban. The NCAA then removed FSU from its list of universities that are not allowed to use such names and mascots.

330,"Wild Weather: Is Global Warming Causing Unusual Storms?
Residents of Barrow, Alaska, are stunned when a severe thunderstorm roars through town. The storm shocks the town; it is the first thunderstorm they have ever seen.
For over 36 hours, a wild blizzard dumps about 100,000 tons of snow on a ski course in Austria. When even the ski lifts stop working, the storm puts a world championship skiing competition on hold.
Those are just two of the many cases of wild weather, such as blizzards, tornadoes, hurricanes, and heat waves, that have been taking place around the world. A recent report from the United Nations (U.N.) says that wild weather may become increasingly common worldwide.
The U.N. report blames the unusual weather on
, or a rise in temperature worldwide.
Certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, settle in Earth's atmosphere. Those gases act like the glass windows in a greenhouse, trapping heat from the sun and causing a rise in temperature.
According to the report, during the next century, global warming will cause average temperatures worldwide to increase by 2 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit.
World temperatures have been slowly increasing at least since 1850, when scientists began keeping records of world temperatures. The 1990s were the hottest ten years on record.
Scientists aren't sure what is causing global warming. Most scientists agree that burning gasoline, oil, and coal as fuel is the most important cause. Burning those fuels releases lots of carbon dioxide.
Some scientists, however, say global warming is mainly caused by forest fires, volcanic eruptions, and other natural events that release carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere.
Craig Idso, from the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, said he doubts that worldwide temperatures will increase much more than they have already. According to Idso, an increase in carbon dioxide may be a good thing, since plants need carbon dioxide to grow. By taking in more of the gas, plants ""will grow like gangbusters,"" he said.
The effects of global warming will vary from place to place, scientists say. In the United States, global warming could cause warmer weather in Alaska, more forest fires in California, crop failures in the Midwest, and longer growing seasons in the Northeast.
In the meantime, many companies are working to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere. For example, automobile manufacturers are developing new fuels that could replace gasoline and limit carbon dioxide emissions.
Michael Glantz, from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that people will learn how to live with global warming. ""Society is more robust than we give it credit for,"" he said. ""People may learn to live more comfortably in a new, warmer world.""

The U.S. Congress passed the act last year. As a result, as of February 27,2001, the United States will grant citizenship to adopted kids who are under 18 years old and have one parent who is a citizen.
Every year, U.S. families adopt about 20,000 kids from foreign lands. Kids who were adopted from other countries were not considered U.S. citizens right away. Sometimes, they had to wait years before they could become citizens.
The Child Citizenship Act was written by Rep. William Delahunt. Years ago, he adopted a child, Kara, from Vietnam and knows firsthand how hard it can be for an adopted child to become a citizen. He hopes that the act will encourage more U.S. families to adopt kids from other lands.

Some school officials and parents argue that portable video games defeat the purpose of recessexercise. Lisa Lewis, a parent at Florence Rideout, told the school board that students should be encouraged to ""go out and play"" and not huddle around an electronic game.
In addition, portable video-game systems can stir up trouble. When students bring their gaming gear to school, fights sometimes start or the device gets stolen. Educators hope that keeping video games at home will help keep the peace at school. School officials at Florence Rideout added the video game ban to school rules to satisfy some parents' concerns.

Each year, about 6,000 U.S. kids under age 14 are killed in accidents, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Another 120,000 kids each year are permanently disabled in accidents.
The graph shows the number of kids ages 5 to 14 who were treated in emergency rooms in 1999 for injuries suffered while doing these four activities.
""Summer is the most dangerous time of the year for kids,"" said Dr. C. Everett Koop, who is head of the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Koop added, ""The good news is that families can take simple steps to ensure their kids stay out of emergency rooms.""
The 2001 campaign is paying special attention to scooter-related injuries. Because more kids are riding scooters, doctors expect a rise in scooter accidents.
In 2000, more than 30,000 people went to emergency rooms for scooter-related injuries, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said. Most of those injured were kids age 14 or younger.
Because many scooter accidents result in head injuries, some cities and states have passed helmet laws. The New York City passed a law requiring scooter riders under age 14 to wear helmets. Fourth graders from Connecticut, asked their state government to pass a similar law.
Scooter accidents may be on the rise, but bicycles account for more injuries than scooters or any other product except cars, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign.
In 1999, 340,000 kids age 5 to 14 were treated in hospital emergency rooms for bicycle-related injuries, SAFE KIDS reported. The most common bicycle-related injuries are injuries to the head.
The best way for kids to protect their heads while riding bikes is by wearing helmets. But the National SAFE KIDS Campaign says only 15 percent to 25 percent of kids who ride bikes wear helmets while riding.

, the rovers weigh about 400 pounds each and are about the size of golf carts. The rovers are scheduled to land on the Red Planet in January 2004. Mars is called the Red Planet because its soil is a dark red color.
Don't expect the rovers to find little green aliens on the fourth planet from the sun. Instead, they will be on the lookout for signs that water once flowed on Mars. They will also search for evidence that some ice exists under the planet's surface. Scientists say that evidence of water on Mars can mean that life once existed on this planet.
Unlike Earth, Mars is dusty, very cold, and dry. ""We're going to look for signs that tell us that Mars may have been warmer and wet in the past,"" said a
Still, Mars is more like Earth than any other planet in the solar system. It has mountains, valleys, ice caps, and dry riverbeds.
The Red Planet even has seasons, wind and dust storms, and a rocky surface.
The seven-month journey for the rovers won't be an easy one. So far, only three of nine spacecraft that Americans and Russians have sent to Mars have completed the journey without breaking apart or failing.
The rovers were launched from a rocket and will travel through space in a protective shell. They will use parachutes and air bags to bounce to their landing sites. They will land on opposite sides of the planet.
The rovers are equipped with robotic arms, special tools, and cameras. As part of their mission, they will drill through rocks on Mars' surface and take pictures of them.
Then, they will then send the pictures back to Earth for scientists to study. Each rover can travel about the length of a football field each day.
""We will be using the rovers to find rocks and soils that could hold clues about [the possibility of water in] Mars' past,"" said another NASA scientist.
Missions to Mars typically occur when the two planets are close to each other. Mars recently made its closest pass to Earth in 60,000 years. On August 27, Mars was only about 34 million miles from Earth.

To do our part for this special day,
has donated 800 children's books to a literacy organization in Darien, Connecticut. Called the Book Aid Plan, this group is run by volunteers. They help put books in the hands of people in need around the world.
Book Aid receives letters from people who are setting up schools and libraries in poor areas of the United States as well as in countries as far away as Romania, Thailand, and China.
The organization gets the most requests for children's books. Based on the letters they receive, the volunteers at Book Aid decide which books to send and then pack the boxes.
This year, they will ship more than 50,000 pounds of books to almost 100 different countries. ""We may think a shipment is small, but we'll hear from volunteers saying we tripled the size of their library,"" said Barbara Gardner, the president of Book Aid. ""The books are small tokens that really help people out.""

Officials had believed that the Great Wall was 4,160 miles long. But they recently discovered another 310-mile section of the wall at its western end. The wall now measures 4,470 miles long. That's equal to the distance from Miami, Florida, to the North Pole!
Most of the wall is made of brick. The newly discovered section, however, is made of sandstone and branches.
The Great Wall was originally built to protect China from invaders. It was built in sections and rebuilt many times. As many as three million people worked on the first section of the wall.

How exactly does a new word make its way into the dictionary? It takes about 10 to 20 years for a new word to become a common term used by a lot of people.
Deciding which words make the cut is the job of editors. They spend a lot of their day reading newspapers and magazines to find out what new words and phrases are popular. They also get ideas from the movies and the Internet-and even from slang usage. They enter new words into a computer system.
Noah Webster, America's first dictionary editor, began a similar system. He started putting files of words on cards in Springfield, Massachusetts. There are now millions of words on file. Talk about wordy!

Activity on the sun can affect Earth. It can disrupt communications. It can also cause the
, which are shifting curtains of colored light.
When the sun is very active, dark spots, called
, dot the sun's surface. Each day, scientists can see more than 100 sunspots on the sun. Sunspots slowly change shape and move across the sun's surface.
Sunspots have a temperature of 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit (F). That might seem hot, but it is cooler than the rest of the sun's surface, which is a sweltering 10,000 degrees F. Because sunspots are cooler than the rest of the surface, they look dark--almost like shadows.
When the sun is very active, huge explosions can rip across its surface. Those explosions, called
, propel solar material into space. About three or four days after a flare erupts on the sun, the flare may collide with Earth's atmosphere.
When a flare reaches Earth, it can damage satellites orbiting Earth, power stations, and electrical equipment. In July, a huge flare interfered with communication satellites.
The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth.
A car traveling at 55 miles per hour would take 193 years to get from Earth to the sun.
It takes a beam of light eight minutes to travel from the surface of the sun to Earth.
When solar flares reach our planet, they can make gases in Earth's atmosphere glow. The glowing gases form the northern lights.
The northern lights can be many different colors: red, blue, green, or a combination of colors.
Scientists say the best time to see the northern lights is when the sun is active. People in many parts of the United States should be able to see the northern lights in the night sky this fall. People who live in the northern part of the United States have the best chance of seeing the dancing lights. To see them, the sky must be very dark.
senior editor Fran Downey once saw an aurora (the northern lights) while visiting Washington state. ""It began as a dull green light and got brighter and brighter, until it lit up the sky,"" Downey said. ""In the distance, I could hear coyotes howling at the aurora. It was beautiful.""

One of New Hampshires most famous faces recently became history. In May, the Old Man of the Mountain crumbled to the ground.
The Old Man, of course, wasnt a person but a rock formation that nature carved out thousands of years ago. With its pointed nose, sharp chin, and heavy forehead, the mountainside looked like the profile of an old mans face. A
is a side view of a face.
Located on Cannon Mountain, the Old Man was a popular tourist spot and a favorite among the people of New Hampshire. In fact, the jagged rock face was considered the state symbol. It appeared on state quarters, road signs, and many souvenirs.
The famous landmark stretched 40 feet high and 25 feet wide. Long concerned that it would collapse, officials made several efforts to save the mountain face. However, the heavy snow and strong winds of this past winter finally caused the cliff to collapse.
Now a special state committee has been set up to decide if the stone profile should be replaced with a man-made face. ""He was part of our history, and he can still be a part of our history if we rebuild him,"" said a New Hampshire man who recalled learning about the famous face in the fourth grade.
Do you think the Old Man should be rebuilt? Why or why not?
However, other people dont necessarily feel the same way. ""Mother Nature put him there, and Mother Nature took him,"" said one committee member. ""To put it back up, to rebuild, wouldnt be the same.""

This week Grade 4 looks at where the two major candidates for president stand on
. Both candidates recognize that the world has changed since the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Each candidate has his own plan to make the United States more secure and keep its citizens safe.
President Bush's antiterrorism program has included removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and restoring freedom to the country. He has also worked to stop terrorist groups in Afghanistan.
In October 2001, shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush signed the Patriot Act. The law gives the government more power to investigate suspected terrorists. President Bush believes that the law should be renewed when it comes up for review in 2005.
Bush also created the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 to keep our airports, borders, and ports safe from attacks. He says that he has worked to improve national security at airports through increased screening and advanced equipment.
Senator Kerry promises to continue to track and stop potential terrorists. He voted for both the Patriot Act and the Department of Homeland Security.
Kerry supports the Patriot Act's renewal in 2005 if some changes are made to it. He argues that certain sections of the Patriot Act violate citizens' rights. Some of those parts include allowing the government to wiretap phone conversations and search business and library records.
If elected, Kerry has a plan to protect the country's borders, ports, and airports. He also says that he will work to give police officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel the information and equipment they need to perform their jobs safely and effectively.

In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Montagues and Capulets have just had a fight in a public place in Verona. Prince Escalus stopped it and warned that if it happens again, those involved will be punished by death.
The first set scene begins with Montague asking Benvolio how the fight began.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
Benvolio tells him that servants from both families were fighting and that when he tried to stop them, Tybalt turned on him.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.
After that, lots of other people joined in until the Prince came and stopped the fighting.
Lady Montague is worried about her son, Romeo. He wasn't involved in the fighting but she wonders where he is. Benvolio explains that he saw him skulking about before dawn. Montague says that this is not unusual behaviour for Romeo: people have seen him crying and sighing on his own before daybreak before.
The audience finds out a lot about Romeo before he even walks onto the stage. What are your first impressions of Romeo?
Montague says he has tried to talk to his son, but he won't open up to him.
Parents and children - You might be able to sympathise with Romeo not wanting to talk about his feelings with his father.
He says he is like a flower that never gets to open because it has been stopped from blossoming by a worm that has eaten into it.
This is a simile to show that no one can get near to Romeo whilst he is in such a bad mood.
When Romeo arrives, Montague and Lady Montague leave Benvolio to try and find out why he is in such a bad mood all of the time.
- Time - There are lots of references to time in this play. The events in this play take place in just less than one week. Romeo and Juliet both feel that time drags whilst they are apart from one another.
Romeo tries to explain that he is in love with a girl who doesn't love him back. He doesn't make himself very clear though and Benvolio has to work hard to get him to tell him about it. Romeo comes up with lots of confusing descriptions of love to try and explain how he feels.
The list of opposites in Romeo's speech ('loving hate', 'heavy lightness', etc) are called oxymorons. They give us an important clue to his character. His confusing speech shows us how confusing the world is to him as a young man. It also shows us that Romeo likes to play with language.
""Here's much to do with hate, but more with love""
- Love and Hate - Romeo is commenting on the street brawl that has just happened: it's about hating an opposing family and feeling love and loyalty towards their own. Taken on its own, the line sums up the play as a whole: it's about two families that hate each other, but more about the love between Romeo and Juliet.
Romeo speaks in rhyme to try to describe how he feels.
Romeo's speeches are often in rhyme. He also likes wordplay, metaphors and similes. Romeo loves to talk about love, but does he really know what love is at this point? You could say that Romeo, at this point is 'all talk and no action'.
He says that love is like smoke made from the hot breath of lovers and that the flames are the sparks in their eyes. But if it doesn't work out, love is a sea of tears. He also describes love as a kind of madness and a poison.
- Love - The language that Romeo uses to describe love gives us an idea of what Romeo believes love to be at this point. For him it's about desire, which sounds like lust rather than true love.
Benvolio brings Romeo back to earth with a straightforward question: who is the girl he is in love with?
Whilst Romeo is pouring his heart out, Benvolio's responses could be performed in a number of ways- sympathetic, impatient, humorous. All three work.
Romeo still won't give him a straight answer though.
Romeo and Benvolio are good friends. We can see this through the way they banter with one another.
He tells Benvolio that the girl is very beautiful but she doesn't want to fall in love. It seems that she is very pure and Romeo says that because she isn't interested in men, her beauty will be wasted!
- Love - We never meet Rosaline in the play and only have Romeo's description of her to go by. It's hard to tell whether she really is a very good girl or whether she simply doesn't fancy Romeo!
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste
Benvolio says that the best thing to do is to forget her. He advises Romeo to look at other attractive girls. Romeo swears that he can never forget her; he'll never find anyone as beautiful as her. Benvolio bets that he will.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.

Literal language is explicit, obvious, out in the open and plainly stated. It is a major part of non-fiction texts, but can also be found in fiction.

However, many of our students keep their phone on during the day which can disturb lessons. A number of phone thefts have also occurred recently, both in and out of school.

The Tempest second key extract - Characters
If you get a question about characters in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with the answer.
Question: What do we learn about Miranda in the two extracts?
In the two Key Extracts we learn that Miranda is young and inexperienced, but not necessarily weak. She has a pure heart and sees the best in Ferdinand and even defends Prospero. In the First Key Extract she must do what her father says, even though his behaviour is questionable. In the Second Key Extract, she knows her own mind and goes behind her father's back (or thinks she has) to ask Ferdinand to be her husband.
Miranda can be read as a strong female character. Even though Prospero is a controlling father, Miranda shows from the beginning of the extract that she is beginning to test his power over her.
She relies on her own judgement and questions her father's actions. She stands up for Ferdinand against her father and is on the receiving end of Prospero's ugly temper. She replies with dignity and even tries to excuse her father's bad behaviour to Ferdinand. However, throughout the first extract, she is being unwittingly manipulated by Prospero.
In the second extract she openly defies her father (although it is part of Prospero's plan that she does this). She demonstrates that she is Ferdinand's equal by offering to share his workload. She claims that she is not worthy of him, but then shows her independence by proposing marriage.
Miranda pleads with Prospero to see the best in Ferdinand, but perhaps her father, who is more experienced, is wise to test Ferdinand's love for his daughter. Miranda is open about her feelings for Ferdinand, but in doing so believes that she is betraying her father's wishes. Miranda is sometimes weak and sometimes strong. She is a complex character.
Throughout the two extracts we see Miranda's growing independence. The truth is, however, that although she thinks she is rebelling against her father by following her own heart, her actions are part of Prospero's plans.

Meanwhile, Benvolio tells Mercutio that Tybalt has sent a letter to Montague's house challenging Romeo to a duel. Mercutio jokes about how good a swordsman Tybalt is, comparing him to a dancer. He calls him Prince of Cats. When Romeo turns up, Mercutio makes lots of rude jokes, and Romeo, who is now in a good mood joins in.

Juliet meets Romeo at Friar Lawrence's and they go off to get secretly married.
Meanwhile, Mercutio squabbles with Benvolio. Benvolio is worried that the Capulets might turn up looking for a fight. Tybalt appears looking for Romeo. Mercutio teases him. Romeo arrives and refuses to fight Tybalt. Romeo tells him he loves him!

Romeo seemed to be in love with the idea of love, perhaps even more than he was in love with Rosaline. Apart from saying that she was beautiful, he wasn't very complimentary about her personality.
Romeo is besotted by Juliet; the fact that she is beautiful plays a big part.
Romeo loves the language of love. His speeches are full of confusing imagery as he tries to work out just exactly what love is.
Romeo tries to impress Juliet with his poetic descriptions about love. Juliet's words somehow seem more heartfelt than Romeo's clever poetry.
Montague and Benvolio discuss how moody Romeo has been lately. When he enters the scene, the audience can see for themselves how his mood can swing from despair to humour and back again.
Juliet is a deeply emotional person and is open about her feelings from the start. Romeo seems to get caught up in that wave of her emotion. They go from being complete strangers to committed lovers in a matter of hours.
Romeo stubbornly swears that he could never love anyone other than Rosalinebut as we see in the Second Key Extract, by the very next morning he is planning his wedding to Juliet.
Both characters make decisions quickly and take risks lightly. Romeo and Juliet could both be described as impulsive in their actions.

22,"> The Tempest Summary - Prospero revealed
Prospero has Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian in his power. He has them imprisoned, with other survivors (except Trinculo and Stephano who are still with Caliban) in a trance, by his cave.
He tells Ariel to fetch them to him. He says that although it would be understandable if he took revenge on them, he would forgive them if they were sorry for what they had done to him.
He also tells Ariel that he will soon be free, and tells him he will miss him.
Ariel leaves to fetch the group. Prospero, alone, declares that he will give up his magic, break his magic staff and throw his magic books into the sea as soon as this business is over.
When Ariel brings the men back, Prospero places them in a magic circle. After telling them off for the wrong things they have done, he releases them from his spell, so they can now wake up. In order that they will recognise him as they awaken, Prospero sends Ariel to fetch his Duke's clothing and sword.
The men slowly start to come to their senses. They recognise Prospero, but are amazed to see him in such a strange place.
Alonso is very ashamed of what he has done.

This is one version of the speech. You will find comments beneath each paragraph, explaining what the writer has done well.
I'm sure you've all heard the saying ""we are what we eat"". Have you been into the school canteen recently? The selection is similar to that in many schools: a main meal which is usually meat-based, a variety of burgers and pizzas, a dessert and, for the health-conscious, jacket potatoes with one or two cold fillings. The question we are here to consider today is whether this is a reasonable selection, or whether changes could be made in Grange High School's canteen.
The speech begins dealing with the problem straight away. It starts with a short, familiar phrase and a rhetorical question, to involve the audience and make them listen to the speech. The current selection of food is outlined to set the scene, followed by the main question to be tackled. The opening is very friendly and easy to follow. This is a great start.
A survey conducted recently by Year 9 students suggested that many students are happy with the food on offer. They stated that the burgers and pizzas were their favourite food and that they were ""tasty, filling, cheap and quick"". These choices, sometimes called ""junk food"", are the best sellers and the canteen staff say the profit from these makes it possible to offer some of the less popular options.
The writer now looks at the evidence for keeping junk food. They've imagined a survey and comments from the canteen staff - this is fine as it's relevant and makes sense.
Some students admit that the junk food in the canteen is the only reason they stay in school at lunchtimes. Although we are not allowed off site during school times, it is well known that some students do sneak out to local chip shops and other takeaways. A substantial number of students who took part in the canteen's survey said they would be more likely to do this if the canteen offered more healthy food.
The final argument for junk food is explained. The writer introduces a rather controversial point, but softens it with the phrase 'it is well known...' so that no one is blamed. Again this keeps things formal and balanced.
So far, the writing looks really good, but it seems like the conclusion will be in favour of junk food. Is there any way of balancing the argument? Go to the next page to see how this is done.

The second half of the writing focuses on the points in favour of the healthier options. Again, if you want any further information, click the check ideas button to see our comments.
However, this evidence does not show the whole picture. Many students say they would prefer to see more choice in the canteen. They point out that eating jacket potatoes every day is boring, and that the cold fillings are inadequate in winter. It has been suggested that more sandwiches, salads and a bigger range of hot main meals would be much more appealing. Many of these students currently bring their own food to school simply because they feel there is so little choice. These numbers include Grange High's many vegetarians.
Now the writer moves on to the views in favour of healthy food. The impersonal tone is maintained in the first sentence. The formal connective 'However' is used to signal a change in the argument. The writer returns to the facts - jacket potatoes are the only healthy option - and suggests some alternatives. She builds on the evidence mentioned earlier. She is building up towards her conclusion now.
Nevertheless, it remains true that junk food is popular and easy to produce. If students start going off site they may get injured or into trouble, and the school could be held responsible. Therefore, it seems impractical to ban junk food altogether. But is there another answer? I believe there is: the canteen could offer a wider selection, including healthier options, for one term, and see whether it is successful. If it is, and we see more students using the canteen and eating the healthy options, the canteen could make this change permanent.
This detailed paragraph begins to suggest the solution. Formal connectives are used ('nevertheless' and 'therefore') to signal that the argument is coming to an end. She returns to a personal expression, 'I believe there is...' because she is summing up her findings.
In conclusion, the solution seems clear: if a good selection of food is provided then everyone will be happy - and the canteen will almost certainly gain more customers. Thank you for your time.
The final paragraph is short and direct. It sums up the main conclusion of the speech in a positive way: 'everyone will be happy' and 'the canteen will almost certainly gain...' which leaves the audience with a clear picture of her final point of view. Rather than trying to persuade people one way or the other, the speech has tried to suggest a solution where everyone gains. This isn't always possible, but it can be a helpful way of concluding without sitting on the fence and telling the audience to make up their own minds. As you can probably guess, this is an excellent answer.

b) An essay should always be written using formal language. All of the other situations would suit a more informal style.
Tips to make your informal writing more effective
""Dear reader, I'm really glad you've found the time to open this letter.""
2. It's okay sometimes to use the kind of words that are more usual in speech than writing:
""You don't have to put up with bullying. We'll stick together and make it stop.""
3. Contractions sound more natural in certain types of writing eg a talk to fellow students:
""It's good to know that we're all going to work together on this.""
Don't baffle your reader with too much slang.
Think carefully about structure - informal writing is different to speech and needs carefully planned paragraphs to keep it clear and easy to read.
Sometimes there is opportunity to break the rules of Standard English and use English in unexpected ways. Two good examples of writers who achieve this are poet Benjamin Zephaniah and writer Andrea Levy in her book Small Island.
If you're asked to write a story, it would be a mistake for you as the author to use incorrect grammar and slang - but inside speech marks, your characters can!

Acids, bases, alkalis and metals are found in the laboratory and at home. They can be irritant or corrosive and must be handled carefully.
How acid or alkaline a chemical is can be measured on the pH scale, using indicators like litmus and universal indicator. Acids and bases react together to form salts and other products too.

1. Your group is having an informal discussion about an issue in a book. No one can agree and everyone is talking at once. Do you:
a) Shout the loudest to make sure that everyone hears what you have to say.
b) Seize the opportunity for a nap - no one will notice as they're all too busy arguing.
c) Suggest that you all take it in turns to speak whilst someone writes down everyone's ideas.
2. You've been asked to do a group presentation and there's a girl in the group who is really nervous. She starts to speak, but she suddenly goes silent and bright red. She's forgotten what else to say. Do you:
a) Point at her and burst out laughing.
b) Feel glad that everyone is staring at her and not you.
c) Help her by asking her a question about what she's already said.
3. You've prepared an individual talk on your hobby for homework. Someone else in the class has just given their talk on exactly the same subject. Do you:
a) Just read out what you had written in your notes. You weren't listening to the person who was just speaking, anyway.
b) Screw up your notes and lock yourself in the toilet until the bell rings.
c) Refer back to some of the things the other student said as you go along.
4. Your teacher puts you into pairs and asks you to improvise a missing scene from the play you've been reading. Do you:
a) Say as much as you can to fill the two minute slot you've been given. It doesn't matter if it's irrelevant and it doesn't matter if your partner doesn't get a chance to speak.
b) Allow your partner to do all the talking and keep your reactions to a minimum.
c) Swallow your sense of panic, listen carefully to what your partner says and try and react accordingly, taking turns so that the improvisation makes sense and is balanced.
You are confident and outgoing. You might find yourself going out alone though if you don't try to listen to others more often.

Extract 1 - Act 1, Scene 1, lines 98 to 232
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew. Were you by when it began?
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
I drew to part them. In the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
O where is Romeo? Saw you him today?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun
Peered forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad 
That westward rooteth from this city side,
So early walking did I see your son.
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood.
I, measuring his affections by my own,
Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Being one too many by my weary self,
And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
I neither know it, nor can learn of him.
Have you importuned him by any means?
Both by myself and many other friends:
Is to himself  I will not say how true 
But to himself so secret and so close,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.
See where he comes. So please you, step aside.
Ill know his grievance or be much denied.
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, lets away.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeos hours?
Not having that which, having, makes them short.
Out of her favour where I am in love.
Alas, that Love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Alas, that Love, whose view is muffled still,
Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Heres much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs:
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers eyes;
Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.
What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.
This is not Romeo: hes some other where.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will 
A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.
A right good mark-man! And shes fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Well, in that hit you miss. Shell not be hit
With Cupids arrow. She hath Dians wit,
And in strong proof of chastity well-armed,
From Loves weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide th encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
O, she is rich in beauty  only poor
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
Be ruled by me: forget to think of her.
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
To call hers  exquisite  in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing fair:
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who passed that passing fair?
Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
Ill pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

125,"Here's a brief outline of the different types of sentences (if you want more details, look at
A simple sentence generally has one main verb and communicates one idea. For example:
There can be several words in the verb, so
- has two words in the verb.
- has three words in the verb.
However, in each example there is just one main verb and idea. This is the simplest type of sentence and usually it's very easy to understand.
A compound sentence generally joins two simple sentences together. We typically use words like 'and', 'or' and 'but' to join the ideas. For example:
It was cold but we still went to town.
It was raining and we stayed indoors.
This makes the two ideas equal in the sentence - if we take away one part of it, we are left with a simple sentence again. These are very common when we are speaking and they are not difficult to understand.
A complex sentence communicates more than one idea, so it's like a compound sentence in a way. However, the ideas are not equal. This is because one part is like a simple sentence, so it can stand on its own. The other part can't - it needs something else to support it. For instance, look at this sentence:
You can't persuade me to go to town, no matter how hard you try.
We can take away the first part, but then we are left with:
Now this is not a simple sentence and it doesn't stand on its own - it needs something else to make sense.
We use complex sentences a lot when we speak, but it's important to use them in our writing too. In fact, these are the most difficult sentences to get right.

If the question asks you to comment on how the theme of time is explored, consider these points:
Montague and Benvolio discuss the ""ancient quarrel"" and how it escalated so swiftly because of the quick tempers of servants from each opposing family along with Tybalt's ""fiery"" reaction.
Time passes slowly for Romeo whilst he is in a bad mood. He hides himself away during the daytime.
Romeo is impatient to have a physical relationship and does not want to wait for Rosaline.
Romeo gets over Rosaline quickly and falls for Juliet suddenly. Juliet falls in love just as quickly with Romeo.
Having spent one evening together they are planning their wedding for the next day.
Can love happen so quickly? Maybe Romeo and Juliet have not considered the consequences of their relationship so it was bound to go wrong from the start. Or maybe this a classic example of love at first sight: sudden, powerful, and beyond the control.

Other times they'd run an obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games.

265,"> Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
When you are persuading people, you usually use a different style. You don't need to show both sides - all you have to do is present your ideas. For instance, imagine you had to persuade people to buy a certain toothpaste. You could write about the great taste, or how clean your teeth feel or how white they are. It doesn't really matter what you find to write about as long as you get them to buy it.
But you wouldn't write about other makes of toothpaste. You don't persuade like this, because it sounds like you aren't sure. So the first thing to remember is:
- if you are writing about how great chips are, keep repeating the idea. Convince yourself how good they are - they might even be a healthy option, because lots of doctors are bound to like them and chips wouldn't be so popular if they weren't really great, would they? Once you have convinced yourself, it's much easier to convince others. So next you need to remember to...
- it's always better to hear how good your idea is rather than how bad other people's are. So write about the things that show your ideas in the best light. For instance, aren't chips just great for a quick snack? Why were chips voted the most popular option in our school at lunchtime? And finally don't be frightened to...
- If you don't seem too sure, or if you can't make your ideas stand out, then you aren't really persuading as much as you can. And if that is the case, you need The Persuaders' Toolkit.
- don't worry about saying the same thing again and again - people forget, so repeat yourself and they will remember. Even when you think they might remember, you can always repeat yourself another time.
- using words such as ""we"" or ""I"" always sounds a lot more convincing. We all know that, don't we?
- why would you use questions? Well, they make people think. They also get your readers involved in what you are writing. So will you use them when you persuade? If not, why not?
- words are your ammunition. In seconds, they can make your friends laugh, or your teacher angry, so why not use them properly to persuade your readers?
For instance, don't just write ""the pressure of doing school work"", because there is no real feeling there. Instead, how about: ""the endless trauma, the desperation and the mindless suffering that school work inflicts on students"".

. A simple sentence consists of one clause that has a subject and a verb. A simple sentence puts across one simple idea.
A complex sentence is used to put across more
ideas. A complex sentence contains one main clause that can make sense on its own, and one or more minor clauses that are linked to it.
The main clause is the 'big dog barked' because it has a subject and a verb and makes sense by itself.
The minor clause is 'When I arrived'. Although it is a clause with a subject and a verb, it doesn't make sense on its own, it needs a main clause.
We can add more minor clauses to make a more complex sentence.
We can even split the main clause with a minor clause and still have a complex sentence.

Meanwhile, a nobleman called Paris visits Capulet to ask him if he can marry Juliet. Capulet asks him to wait two more summers, but suggest he romances his daughter and invites Paris to a party that evening. He gives his servant a list of names of people to invite.
The servant can't read. He bumps into Benvolio and Romeo and asks them to read the list for him. Rosaline's name, amongst others, is on the list. The servant doesn't know that Benvolio and Romeo are Montagues and invites them to the party, too.
Lady Capulet is sent to tell Juliet about Paris's proposal. They aren't very close so she asks Juliet's Nurse to stay and listen. Juliet will be fourteen on Lammas-eve, 31st July. Juliet tells her mother that she has never thought about marriage, but promises to take a look at Paris.

English is a language that is constantly changing and evolving. If it didn't, we'd still be speaking like Shakespeare!
- each generation provides words known as 'slang' - often many of these words become accepted into mainstream English eg 'ok' and 'cool'. However, many slang terms lose popularity as a new generation emerges with their own slang words and phrases - making words such as 'phat' and 'groovy' history.
- the multi-cultural society we live in often provides new or adapted words. You might be familiar with the term 'avatar' in online communities but did you know the word is actually Hindi in origin? Has anyone ever said 'gesundheit' after you've sneezed? This is actually a German word, which has become popular in English.
- these are words or phrases that you only hear in a particular geographical area eg do you eat your sausage in a roll, bap or bun? Depending on where you live, it could be any of these. If you're Cornish, you might hear someone from Birmingham or Scotland using different words and grammar to you, even though you're all still speaking English.

Magnets are made from magnetic materials. These are metals that can be magnetised or will be attracted to a magnet. Most materials are not magnetic, but

We say that unlike poles attract, and like poles repel.
How can you test if a piece of metal is a magnet. Seeing if it sticks to a magnet is not a good test, because unmagnetised iron, steel, cobalt and nickel objects will be attracted to either pole of a magnet.
So you can't test for what it is attracted to. But you can test what it repels:
You can only show that an object is a magnet if it repels a known magnet.

Variation and classification - Continuous & discontinuous
Some of the features of the different organisms in a species show continuous variation, and some features show discontinuous variation.
Human height is an example of continuous variation. Height ranges from that of the shortest person in the world to that of the tallest person. Any height is possible between these values. So it is continuous variation.
For any species a characteristic that changes gradually over a range of values shows continuous variation. Examples of such characteristics are:
If you record the heights of a group of people and draw a graph of your results, it usually looks something like this:
The more people you measure, and the smaller the categories you use, the closer the results will be to the curved line. This shape of graph is typical of a feature with continuous variation. Weight and foot length would give graphs similar in shape to this.
Human blood group is an example of discontinuous variation. There are only 4 types of blood group. There are no other possibilities and there are no values in between. So this is discontinuous variation.
A characteristic of any species with only a limited number of possible values shows discontinuous variation. Here are some examples:

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
Romeo and his friends have left the Capulets' party. Romeo has run away from his friends. Mercutio has been shouting rude jokes because he thinks that Romeo has gone off with Rosaline. Mercutio and Benvolio finally give up looking for him and go home.
The second set extract begins with Romeo hiding from Mercutio and Benvolio in Juliet's garden. Romeo thinks to himself that Mercutio can never understand how he feels because he has never been in love.
""He jests at scars that never felt a wound""
He watches Juliet as she stands on her balcony thinking out loud. He thinks that she is like the sun
Romeo uses lots of words and images that relate to light when he describes Juliet.: 'sun', 'stars' 'brightness'.
and that the moon is jealous of her because she is so beautiful. He says that her eyes are like two stars that are so bright that they would stop night-time from being dark if they were in heaven, and the birds would sing because they would think that night was day.
Romeo uses more words and images to do with light to describe Juliet.
He idolises her and compares her to an angel.
When Romeo says that Juliet is like an angel from heaven, on the one hand, he is saying how lovely she is. On the other hand, you could say that he doesn't really see her as a flesh and blood person. He idolises her. Do you believe that he can really love her when he doesn't actually know anything about her? Or do you believe in love at first sight?
Juliet, not realising that Romeo is hiding in her garden, imagines what she would say to Romeo if he were there. She says out loud that she wishes he wasn't a Montague, but says that it doesn't really matter because she loves him anyway, and hopes that he loves her. After all, a name is just a word; it doesn't really mean that much.
If we used another word for a rose instead of the word 'rose', eg 'poo', the rose would still be a rose, it wouldn't smell like poo just because we used that word. In the same way, Romeo is still lovely even though his name is Montague.
When Juliet is thinking these things aloud on her balcony, she doesn't know that anyone else is watching. Have you ever practiced saying something to someone, even though you know that you would never be brave enough to say it?
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet
When Romeo replies, Juliet nearly jumps out of her skin.
""My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself""
When Romeo calls her 'dear saint', Juliet realizes who he is. Romeo called her 'dear saint' at the party.
Juliet is very worried for Romeo's safety; he is a Montague on Capulet property. Romeo uses very poetic and exaggerated language to describe how he managed to climb over the walls.
Romeo has been quite brave and perhaps foolish to break into Juliet's garden. He likes to takes risks and doesn't think clearly about the seriousness of his actions. He uses poetic language to exaggerate his bravery.
He declares that he'd rather die than live never having the opportunity to love Juliet.
Juliet admits that she is embarrassed that Romeo heard the things that she was saying about him. She asks him if he loves her too, but she doesn't give him the chance to answer.
Juliet is worried that she has shown herself to be too keen on Romeo. In Shakespeare's day, nice girls weren't supposed to show that they were interested in boys.
Juliet's speech is very long! Is she nervous or embarrassed? Is she a chatterbox? Is she so excited about her new love that she can't stop talking about it?
Romeo begins to use poetic language about the moon to describe how much he loves her, but Juliet won't let him finish.
Time - Juliet won't let Romeo finish his sentences! Poor Romeo! We already know how much he loves to speak! Juliet's mind is working very quickly. She is excited, but also worried about how suddenly they have fallen in love.
She says that if he swears by the moon, he might turn out to be just as changeable as the moon (the moon changes its shape throughout the month).
She worries that they have fallen in love so quickly.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.
She tries to say goodnight, but she is excited and passionate about her feelings for Romeo and can't seem to stop talking about it.
""My bounty is as boundless as the sea.
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite""
Juliet's use of imagery seems more heartfelt than Romeo's: her love is as deep as the sea, and the sea never runs out. That's passion!
Juliet's Nurse shouts to her from inside the house. Juliet asks Romeo to wait. As she goes into her bedroom, Romeo thinks to himself that their love seems like a dream.
Love - Is this true love? How could it have happened so quickly? Do you believe in 'love at first sight'? Remember, that same evening that he met and fell in love with Juliet, Romeo was moping about saying that he would never love anyone as much as he loved Rosaline! Romeo might argue though that he didn't really know what true love was until he met Juliet.
Juliet comes back out onto the balcony and tells Romeo that if he is serious about her, she will send a messenger out to him tomorrow to find out where and what time they will get married!
Time - events happen very quickly in this play. In less than a week, Romeo and Juliet fall in love, get married and die.
She says goodnight to him as her Nurse impatiently tells her to come inside.
Romeo finds it hard to say goodnight to her.
Romeo said that he was in love with Rosaline in the first extract. Less than a day later, he claims to be in love with Juliet. Has he really thought about the consequences of marrying Juliet. Perhaps, when you are in love, nothing else matters. What do you think?

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to advise
Once you can argue and persuade, it should be easy to advise. The trick is to be gentle - it's no good pushing your ideas at your readers, or trying to impress them. Instead, you should come across as friendly, as someone who just wants to help.
For instance, imagine you're writing to advise someone in Year 9 who is moving house and has to change schools. We know that it won't be easy - they'll have to make new friends and cope with all sorts of changes. So you need to be sympathetic and give some ideas you think could help.
The first thing might be to plan each main idea in a separate paragraph because it's easier to follow like this. Then think about how you want to present your ideas. It might be fine to give some information as an order, such as:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone.
You can add information to this - perhaps explaining why and giving an example of what to do, so now your paragraph looks like this:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone. Most people will be glad to help and it's the quickest way to make friends. You can ask a teacher, but it might be better to ask one of the other pupils. Choose a friendly face if you can, and don't be shy - it might be their first day too.
It is not just the information that makes this a good piece of advice, it's also the style. It includes words like ""might"" and ""can"". These make the ideas softer - they are not in your face and pushing you to agree, they just guide you. And they are very simple to use, so make sure you include words like ""should, can, could, might, ought to and may"" - each one turns an idea into a piece of advice.

Explore, imagine and entertain - Ending short-stories
The other problem some writers have is ending the story. It doesn't matter if it's a happy ending or not, but it has to make sense. There are lots of ways of ending, such as:
, where we have to wait until the final moment until we know. For instance, the spy who manages to stop the bomb two seconds before it explodes.
, where we are fairly sure about something, but in the final part everything changes. For example, we then learn that this is a fake bomb, and the real one is hidden somewhere else and will explode in five minutes.
, where the story stops, but we aren't sure what has actually happened at the end. For instance, the bomb is defused and everyone is safe. But then an army commander reports the theft of another bomb... only this time twice as powerful.
However, there are two endings to avoid:
, where a bomb will inevitably explode and as it does, the narrator wakes up - it was all a dream. Some English teachers don't mind this sort of thing, but others hate it. You have been warned.
, where the secret agent suddenly stops worrying about the bomb, retires, and goes off to play golf. This is even worse, and no-one likes it because the ending has nothing to do with the story.
Whatever kind of story you write, decide on your ending and include it in your plan.
Writing that explores, imagines or entertains depends on being creative. You need to experiment a little and not be frightened to try something new.

The population of each organism in a food chain can be shown in a sort of bar chart called a pyramid of numbers. The more organisms there are, the wider the bar. The producer in the food chain always goes at the bottom of the pyramid of numbers.
Clover is a plant and it is the producer in this food chain. Its bar goes at the bottom of the pyramid:
Energy is lost to the surroundings as we go from one level to the next, so there are fewer organisms at each level in this food chain. A lot of clover is needed to support the snail population. A thrush eats lots of snails, and a hawk eats lots of thrushes, so the population of hawks is very small.
Sometimes the pyramid of numbers doesn't look like a pyramid at all. This could happen if the producer is a large plant such as a tree, or if one of the animals is very small. Remember, though, that whatever the situation, the producer still goes at the bottom of the pyramid.

Bullying is when people are cruel to other people. It can be hurting them, like kicking them, or hurting them using horrible names. It could be other things too. My article for the school magazine is about bullying. I am going to start by saying what the problem of bullying is and then...
The first one is much better - it gets straight to the point and you want to read on. The second version repeats parts of the question, but for no reason. People who are reading the school magazine don't have to be reminded in each article that it is the school magazine. We also know the article is about bullying from the first sentence, but Stuart's definition is poor and the whole article is slow to get started.

The Tempest first key extract - Performance
When you talk about the performance of a play, you should think about how people in the audience feel as they watch it. For instance, the beginning of the first extract is magical and romantic. The tone changes in the middle to one of conflict.
Prospero has lots of asides (thoughts spoken aloud) in the first extract. His role in this scene is made more complex because his character is pretending to be something he is not. The director has to decide whether he wants us to see Prospero as a good father who wants the best for his daughter or a manipulative control freak.
Prospero also speaks to Ariel who is invisible to the other characters on the stage.
When Ariel appears, the director must decide how to present the 'illusion'. Ariel is invisible to the other characters. But it does not necessarily follow that he must be invisible to the audience, too. Try to imagine as many interesting and unusual ways to present Ariel - the 'invisible' sprite - as you can.
When you write about performance, you need to mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:

If the question asks you to comment on how the theme of power is explored, consider these points:
In the first extract, Ariel's songs calm the storm and make Ferdinand believe that his father is dead. This puts Ferdinand in a weak position which makes it easier for Prospero to manipulate him. Ariel's magic powers are responsible for much of what happens in the play.
Ariel only performs his magic so that he can win his freedom. Prospero has power over Ariel because Ariel owes him a debt of gratitude.
It could be argued that Prospero's assertion of power and authority over Ferdinand is unnecessarily harsh.
Prospero is obsessed with power and authority having had his title taken from him by his brother Antonio.
As a prince, Ferdinand's royal power becomes redundant on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero sees Miranda and Ferdinand's love as a power that he can use to manipulate Ferdinand.
Miranda seems powerless under her father's control on the island. She rebels against him, but even her rebellion was part of Prospero's plan.
Miranda and Ferdinand's love is a power that exists independently of magic.

The themes are the basic ideas in Othello - we have already met one - the play deals with the subject of jealousy and revenge. There are others, such as race and foreign cultures or appearance and reality.
Perhaps the most obvious subject or theme in
. Iago is the key to almost everything that happens. He has been passed over for promotion, so he dislikes Othello and must be jealous of Cassio. He thinks Othello might also have slept with his wife. However, we can never be completely sure what motivates Iago to be so destructive - he manages to get Cassio dismissed but then Iago doesn't seem interested in Cassio's job, only in causing more problems. We also learn that Iago has tried many times in the past to steal the handkerchief that means so much to Othello. This tells us that he was planning against Othello long before his promotion was blocked.
Jealousy affects most other characters as well. Othello cannot bear the fact that his wife might be having an affair and Iago cleverly plays on this. For instance, when Othello thinks his wife is honest and needs proof of the affair, Iago asks if he would want to see her 'topped' (i.e. with a man on top of her) but then tells Othello to calm down and that his mind 'perhaps may change'. Of course it won't - Iago presents the worst image possible to Othello knowing the damage it will cause.
Jealousy affects almost all of us at sometime in our lives, and Shakespeare shows the destructive effects it has throughout the play. In fact only two characters seem unaffected by jealousy - Desdemona and Cassio. Desdemona dies, but everyone realises what a good woman she was, and Cassio is rewarded by taking Othello's place as general (and by deciding Iago's punishment).

When a customer signs up they provide basic details such as their name and address.
Loyalty cards provide companies with information about customer spending habits. This information can be used to target customers generally or specifically.
If customers frequently buy bread and milk together, these items may be put nearby each other for customer convenience or, farther apart forcing the customer to walk through the entire store (in the hope they buy additional items along their way).
If a customer frequently buys beans, vouchers offering money off beans will be sent to them (further increasing their loyalty), rather than for products they rarely buy.

Source A: Instructions for treating a broken nose
If you examine a man whose nose is disfigured - part of it being squashed in while the other part is swollen and both his nostrils are bleeding, then you shall say: ""You have a broken nose and this is an ailment I can treat.""
You should clean his nose with two plugs of linen and then insert two plugs soaked in grease into his nostrils. You should make him rest until the swelling has gone down. You should bandage his nose with stiff rolls of linen and treat him with lint every day until he recovers.

Moniza Alvi: Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan
Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. 'Attitude' can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
How do you think this poem should be read?
In a confused voice, as if the girl cannot decide whether she is more Pakistani or English?
Wistfully, as if she regrets having lost her original culture?
Gratefully, as she thinks about the beautiful, exotic gifts?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
In an interview, Moniza Alvi has said:
Growing up, I felt that my origins were invisible, because there weren't many people to identify with in Hatfield at that time of a mixed race background or indeed from any other race, so I felt there was a bit of a blank drawn over that. I think I had a fairly typically English 1950s/1960s upbringing.
When I eventually went to Pakistan, I certainly didn't feel that was home, I'd never felt so English. But I never feel entirely at home in England, and, of course, I'm not part of the Asian community at all. And it feels a bit odd sometimes that because of the group of poems that I've written about my Asian background, I sometimes tend to be identified as a black writer. I tend to think of England as being very culturally mixed now.
But it's important to know where you come from, which is perhaps what I was lacking as a child. I think it's important to know what has gone into your making, even quite far back, I think it gives you a sense perhaps of richness.

453,"The Chartist movement was a curious mix of both classes and ideas. This meant that the two very different Chartist movements, Moral and Physical, also had very different ideas about what tactics would be effective in getting the vote for all men. This Revision Bite will discuss the three main tactics used by Chartists - meetings, petitions and riots.
Chartists met on a national and local level where leaders gave speeches, recruited new members and collected funds. Some meetings were violent and others were peaceful. Many Chartist groups bought their own buildings to use for meetings called
during periods of high unemployment and poverty. They were an attempt to convince Parliament to accept the People's Charter.
There were three petitions presented by Chartists to Parliament in 1839, 1842 and 1848. The first two were rejected and led to violence such as the
. The third one was rejected mainly because it contained many false names and Lovett resigned in disgust when it failed.
Physical Force Chartists believed that violent protests would help them to get the vote. There were a number of violent protests between 1839 and 1848. These included the
. Fighting also took place in Sheffield, Bradford and Dewsbury. It was the violent protests that led to many middle-class people withdrawing their support for Chartism.
In November 1839, 5,000 miners and ironworkers marched on the town of Newport in South Wales. They were led by John Frost - the ex-mayor of Newport. They decided to take over the town of Newport and release the Chartists imprisoned there, including Henry Vincent. The Chartists marched on the Westgate Hotel. The magistrates were warned and soldiers fired into the crowd. Up to 20 people were killed.

Source B suggest that the Chartists and government fought in Newport outside the Westgate Hotel. The Chartists look fierce and organised, while the government men appear to cower in front of the hotel. There is a lot of smoke between the two groups which suggests a lot of gunfire and violence.

1568,"There are four main stages in setting up a new computer system: Analysis - studying the problem; design - designing a solution; implementation - putting the solution into effect and testing it; evaluation - checking that the solution is working as intended. This process is often called systems analysis.
Developing and activating a new computer system is a long process. It is important to break the process down into smaller stages, each one requiring a different set of professional skills.
An important part of this process is the first stage -
. During this stage the systems analyst will investigate how the current system works and what needs to be improved. This involves finding out whether a new computer system is needed at all and exactly what it will be used for.
Analysis is all about looking at how a job is done at present and seeing if the job could be done better or more efficiently by upgrading or developing a new system.
With this goal in mind, the systems analyst might:
a step by step guide, eg a guide to using a piece of software including instructions, example scenarios and screenshots
and any printouts the current system creates
Having investigated the present system, the systems analyst will produce a
. This will look at whether the new system is:
- is the new system technically possible to implement in the time available?
- will the cost of the new system be offset by savings once it is implemented, ie will it save the organisation time, money or increase its performance?
The project will only continue to the next stage if the answer to both of these questions is yes. At this point the decision makers in the organisation, eg the board of directors, decide whether or not to go ahead.
The next step is to draw up a
that outlines exactly what the new system will do. For example, it will mention:
a general term used to describe an application or a program
the term denoting either an entrance or changes which are inserted into a system and which activate/modify a process
the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process
A test plan will be included in the design phase to explain exactly how the new system will be tested and the expected outcomes for each test.
a general term used to describe an application or a program
is usually very complex. Any mistakes made by the designers or programmer can have a dramatic effect depending on what the software is used for.
Usually software is tested with three distinct types of
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
 this is normal data the system should be working with.
 this is data at the boundary between typical data and invalid data.
Invalid data (sometimes known as erroneous data)
 this is data that should cause the system to tell the user that there is a problem with data entered into the system.
Testing helps to ensure that the system always acts as expected.
Implementation is the next stage of developing a new system, after design. This is where the new system is created and installed.
a list of instructions written in a programming language
a general term used to describe an application or a program
a resource - for example, a collection of documents containing all the information a user needs to know about using and getting support with a piece of software
testing the system using the test plan
If the tests are not satisfactory then any problems will need to be corrected and the system tested again.
User documentation will be written to help staff become familiar with the new system. It will include:
a step by step guide, eg a guide to using a piece of software including instructions, example scenarios and screenshots
the term denoting either an entrance or changes which are inserted into a system and which activate/modify a process
the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process
taking a screen shot of what's displayed on screen and saving it in an image file, eg as a *.jpg, *.bmp or *.gif
details of what error messages mean, ie troubleshooting advice
When the system is ready to go on-line there are different ways of moving from the old to the new system:
Running both the old and new system until you are certain the new system is working correctly. Parallel running is likely to be the most expensive as it involves doing the work twice for a period of time. However, it is the safest. If there are any bugs in the new system, you can always go back to the old system while the problems are corrected.
Changing over in a small part of the company to start with. Only when the system is deemed satisfactory will it be rolled out to the rest of the organisation. A supermarket introducing a new 'self-scanning' system might choose to introduce it in two or three stores at first. This is a pilot changeover.
The old system is scrapped and immediately replaced by the new system. With this option there is a danger that there may still be problems with the new system. Even though it is the most risky type of changeover, many companies use this method.
The change over is split into phases or stages. Each stage is introduced one at a time and the old system is kept running to do the remainder of the tasks that have not yet been changed.
Once the system has been installed it will be monitored to check whether it is working correctly. Sometimes problems with a system will not be found until it is being used by a large number of people or an unusual situation occurs.
Evaluation is really re-analysing - starting the same systems analysis process all over again. Many of the same techniques can be used, such as interviewing staff or sending out questionnaires.
Once a system is running correctly it can still need maintenance. This may be because a bug is found or because the company needs a new feature.

Click 'Next' for some background information on this artist.
Born in 1950, Caroline graduated from the Leicester School of Art in 1969 and the Central School of Art and Design, London in 1972. Although Caroline trained as a jeweller she soon diversified into textiles and sculptural installations incorporating clothing as pieces of art which are not intended to be worn. Caroline uses garments to explore ideas about personal identity and the portrayal of hidden feelings and emotions. Her recent work concentrates not only on clothing and textiles but on the space around garments on the body and shadows.
She has been exhibited widely throughout the world. Caroline was the winner of the Jerwood Prize for Applied Arts: Textiles in 1997.
'Dress with Holes' is part of a body of work I made using shadows as an integral part.
Previous work had used the dress as a metaphor for a person, but with these works, I was using the play between object and image to refer to substantial and insubstantial elements.
Shadows of people are both part of them and separate, perhaps the outermost visual boundary of someone, giving a likeness but more usually a distortion. There are many stories, like Peter Schlemihl or Peter Pan, about people trading their shadows with the devil or otherwise becoming separated and the subsequent struggle to reunite with it.
My intention was to give the shadow equal attention to the dress. The silk of the dress was dyed a mid grey and was a lightweight, transparent fabric. Because the silk was so fine the shadow carried the details of overlaps, seams, creases. In the shadow, I painted the inside spaces of the dress on the wall behind, like the neck, cuffs and the hem, so it looks like there might be a lining to the shadow, give a sense of three-dimensions.
I was also interested in the process of completing a work in the space it would be exhibited. These pieces depend on the theatrical nature of traditional art galleries - smooth white walls, controlled lighting. I always started with the light source and worked by placing the dress to get the right shadow.

3123,"Decay is an essential life process, which helps to digest food and recycle materials. Bacteria and fungi are the main groups of decomposer. They release enzymes to break down compounds, so that they can absorb the nutrients. We can preserve our food, for example by freezing or canning, to remove the conditions needed for decay to occur.
Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another.
Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
Intensive farming practices include growing high-yield crops, using fertilisers and pesticides and keeping animals indoors. Food production is increased but there are unwelcome side effects.
Organic farming bans chemical inputs and has a less harmful effect on the environment but often produces less, more expensive food.
Hydroponics is the production of food using nutrient-rich solution rather than soil.
Leaves enable photosynthesis to happen. Photosynthesis is the process by which leaves absorb light and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrate (food) for plants to grow. Leaves are adapted to perform their function eg they have a large surface area to absorb sunlight.
Plants use minerals from the soil to build the complex molecules they need to survive and grow. Poor plant growth may be due to a deficiency of one or more minerals. Tests can be done to establish which mineral is deficient or a general purpose NPK fertiliser added.
Plants have two different types of 'transport' tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots.
The element carbon is the present in all living organisms. It's recycled through various processes, which are described in the carbon cycle.
Nitrogen is essential for the formation of amino acids to make proteins. The nitrogen cycle describes the ways in which nitrogen is recycled.
Osmosis is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low water concentration through a partially permeable membrane. Osmosis takes place in all living cells.
Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis through their root hair cells. Plants use water for several vital processes including photosynthesis and transporting minerals.
All substances are made from atoms. Each atom is made of a nucleus - containing protons and neutrons - surrounded by electrons.
The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. The elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in ascending order of atomic number.
The mass number of an atom is the total of protons plus neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and hence different mass numbers) are called isotopes of that element.
A covalent bond is formed between non metal atoms, which combine together by sharing electrons. Covalent compounds have no free electrons and no ions so they don't conduct electricity.
The Periodic Table is an arrangement of the elements in order of atomic number. Elements in the same vertical column are in the same group or family and have similar chemical properties.
Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid using electricity. When ionic compounds are molten or dissolved in water the ions are free to move.
When sulfuric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen is produced at the cathode (negative electrode) and oxygen at the anode (positive electrode). Aluminium is extracted from the mineral bauxite using the process of electrolysis.
All matter is made of atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements, and each one has a symbol. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other.
When atoms of different elements join together they make a compound. Compounds are represented by formulae that show how many atoms of each element are in the compound. Formulae can be worked out from the charge of the ions that make up the compound.
Chemical reactions can be written down as balanced chemical equations.
The Group 1 elements in the Periodic Table are known as the alkali metals. They include lithium, sodium and potassium, which all react vigorously with air and water.
The reactivity of the alkali metals increases down the group. Flame tests are used to identify alkali metal ions in compounds.
The Group 7 elements are also known as the halogens. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, which all have seven electrons in their outer shell.
In a displacement reaction a less reactive element is
Ionic bonding occurs between positive and negative ions, which attract each other and bind together to form ionic compounds. For example, sodium chloride consists of Na
Each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions held in place by electrostatic attraction and forming an ionic crystal lattice. The ions in a crystal lattice are very strongly bonded - a high temperature is required to melt the crystal.
The physical properties of different metals make them useful for different purposes. For example, aluminium conducts heat, which makes it a useful material for making saucepans and gold is shiny, which makes it an attractive material for jewellery.
Metal particles are held together by strong metallic bonds, which is why they have high melting and boiling points. The loose electrons in metals can all move together through the metal  creating an electric current.
The elements in the middle section of the Periodic Table are the transition elements. They're all metals with typical metallic properties eg conducting heat and electricity. They often form coloured compounds.
Transition metal carbonates undergo thermal decomposition - a reaction in which a substance is broken down into at least two other substances by heat.
Transition metal hydroxides are insoluble in water. They can be precipitated out of a transitional metal compound solution using sodium hydroxide solution.

Sometimes it is hard, when devising drama, to imagine what a character might

Jamie needs to give far more explanation. He should use business terms and show he understands what fixed costs are.
They have to pay Ashley's father each month, as well as the loan from the bank. They may have other costs, like the cleaning materials they buy to run their business.
Morag started her answer quite well, mentioning both loans which, as fixed costs, have to be repaid. The cleaning materials, however, form part of the variable, rather than the fixed costs.
Costs which have to be paid, regardless of the level of output, are called fixed costs. Martin and Ashley have the fixed costs of repaying Ashley's dad 50 a month, and they probably pay bank interest on the loan. Their pay is a fixed cost. They might want to consider paying themselves piece rate, to help their business survive. The road tax and insurance on the van are fixed costs they have to pay. They have already bought the van, so this is a sunk cost, and no longer a fixed cost they have to pay.
Rani's answer would probably get a A grade. She has answered the question well, and has shown she can use business terms like fixed costs. She has thought about the pay they only receive when they have the business, and correctly counted it as a fixed cost.

Sporting events and sports personalities are bigger, brighter and more branded with big money sponsorship deals than ever before; just look at major events like the Premier Leagues Barclays Bank partnership. Then theres our perception of sport through the eyes of the media; what you read and see isnt always the truth and can often be affected by international politics. Today, many athletes are role models and celebrities in their own right. Well, who hasnt heard of David Beckham?
To support an event, activity or person by providing money or goods.

Most competitions have sponsors names included in their title:
Some sports stadia have sponsored names. For example:
Most clubs and teams have sponsors. For example:

It is always easier to get sponsorship if a sport or event receives media attention. High profile events gain greater amounts of sponsorship than those with no coverage.
There are pros and cons of sponsorship:
Increased publicity, status increased by being linked to success and glamour. Increased sales of their products
Negative events (drug use, cheating, crowd trouble) may affect your reputation
Free clothing and equipment or payment for wearing sponsor's clothing and using their equipment. Can concentrate on training without financial worries.
May be tied in to a contract including appearances at sponsors' events.
Financial support in addition to admission fees etc.
Dates, times, clothing may be changed to suit the sponsor.
a collective name for images, video and audio
coverage of sport is widespread. By listening to commentators, pundits and watching replays we improve our knowledge and understanding. Participation in sports covered by the media is always higher than for those that are not.
When watching sport on TV it is important to understand that the director of the programme will have an influence on what is seen and said. You should always analyse what you see and develop your own opinions about events.
Media coverage has many pros and cons:
Attendances may rise as people want to see the 'stars'
Gives viewers a close-up view of the action
Attendances may drop - more people watch from home
Some sports get lots of exposure, while others get none
Events can be sensationalised to promote the media (TV channel, newspaper etc), rather than the sport
Changes to playing season (eg rugby league)
Changes to the rules (eg badminton, volleyball rally-point rules, tennis tie-breaks)
NB Some of these may not been seen as disadvantages by those involved, but they do show the influence of the media.
The conduct of players, officials and spectators has an effect on the image of individual sports and the expectations of behaviour by those involved in them. Compare some examples of conduct in sports:
Golfers are expected to own up to anything they do wrong
- Players are expected to own up to anything that they do wrong and even disqualify themselves.
- Diving by players to get a free kick or penalty is increasing and almost everyone is complaining about it. But accepting the rewards when cheating benefits
- Opposition fans sit and stand together and there is usually a friendly atmosphere. Police presence and stewarding is light. Video surveillance is almost unheard of.
- Although most supporters enjoy the company of the opposition's fans, they are segregated to avoid outbreaks of violence by a minority. Groups of fans taunt each other with insults. Police presence and stewarding is very well organised. Video surveillance is used to identify troublemakers who are banned from future matches. All-seater stadia are required for all Premier League and international matches.
- The laws of the game penalise players for arguing with the referee although some acts of violence are dealt with as part of the game. Etiquette requires that the players always clap each other off the field and problems are left on the pitch.
- Players often surround the referee to argue with decisions. Acts of violence are often made worse by other players becoming involved and fans continuing to inflame the situation by booing players. Some disagreements on the pitch are continued and fights can break out in the tunnel after the game.
Do the fans encourage players to play well or behave badly? Or do the players incite the fans to celebrate or abuse each other?

A sportsperson who is paid to take part in sport.
. Tennis and rugby union are examples of sports that attempted to remain amateur but are now ' open' which means no distinction is made between amateurs and professionals. One of the reasons was the widespread abuse of hidden payments to amateurs following the worldwide increase in money for sport from the media.
Key differences between amateurs and professionals are:
Participation is more important than the result
Winning is the most important thing. The more they win, the more they earn
Political and financial issues that have affected international sports events
Despite the many advantages of hosting a major international event host nations must be prepared for difficulties. The Olympic Games has suffered from a number of different types of problem. These include:
Race issue: Black Power - 1968, Mexico City
Boycott by some nations - 1984, Los Angeles
For the exam you should know a little bit about each of these and you should keep up-to-date with events as they happen.
The 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies suffered problems relating to high ticket prices which prevented many locals from attending whilst matches were played in near empty stadiums. In addition the media coverage and police action surrounding the death of Pakistan coach, Bob Woolmer, took attention away from the matches.
The 2008 Beijing Olympics have generated lots of media intest and the 2012 London Olympics and future Football and Rugby World Cups will create many discussion points over the next few years.
The role of local and national sports providers
funded facilities are paid for by national and local government out of taxes and National Lottery funding. They can be found throughout the country.
They are available for everyone to use and are relatively cheap.
They include sports/leisure centres, swimming pools and outdoor pitches.
Some schools share facilities with the local authority for lessons and extra-curricular activities.
funded facilities are set up by private companies that try to make a profit. They are often members-only clubs. Members pay fees to join and use the facilities.
They are likely to be more expensive.
They include sports/fitness clubs, golf and tennis clubs.
Some schools pay to use private sports clubs for lessons and extra-curricular activities.
Local authorities encourage participation in sport by employing sport development teams including School Sports Coordinators who arrange events, assist with coaching and develop links with clubs in the area of schools.

may have one theme or many. Understanding the themes makes the text more than 'just' a text. It becomes something more significant because we're encouraged to think more deeply about the story - about how it connects to real-life issues, and about what it might mean to us.
The boys try to construct a civilisation on the island; but it breaks down in blood and terror because the boys are suffering from the terrible disease of being human.
A central, unifying idea that runs through a text or performance.
is that of things breaking down. This is shown in a number of ways. Violence replaces peace, friends turn into enemies, life ends in savage death. Everything degenerates.
The boys are on the island because the plane that was evacuating them from Britain during a fictional nuclear war was attacked. Piggy reminds Ralph:
""Didn't you hear what the pilot said? About the atom bomb? They're all dead.""
Ralph is proud of his father - a commander in the Navy. So, the
A person portrayed by an actor in a play; an individual in a narrative or non-fiction text; a real or imaginary individual's personality or reputation
who tries hardest to keep peace comes from a home that revolved around war.
We know that the civilisation from which they were trying to escape is being destroyed. When Roger stops himself throwing stones at the littluns, we're told:
""Roger's arm was conditioned by a civilisation that knew nothing of him and was in ruins.""
The dead parachutist who lands on the island was gunned down during an overhead battle.
Ironically, the naval officer who comes to their rescue is himself involved in the war. The boys may have been saved from life on the island, but what sort of life are they going back to?
Violence is always present. It starts as a game, but grows more horrific throughout the novel. For example:
When he first finds out Piggy's name,
""Ralph danced out into the hot air of the beach and then returned as a fighter-plane, with wings swept back, and machine-gunned Piggy.""
When the first pig is killed, Jack boasts,
""Kill the pig. Cut her throat. Bash her in.""
The boys become like wild and savage animals: when Jack hunts a pig he is
; Ralph becomes like a hunted animal, not a boy, at the end:
""He raised his spear, snarled a little, and waited.""
The murder of Simon is particularly horrific because it involves
the other boys - they get caught up in the frenzied chant:
""The crowd ... leapt onto the beast, screamed, struck, bit, tore.""
All the friendships and good relationships on the island break down, either through bullying and violence or death.
Ralph and Jack seem to be friends at the start, yet Ralph knows Jack is hurt when he is not elected chief. This rivalry for power is at the root of some of the violence.
Ralph finds it hard even at an early stage to get things done. He and Simon are left to build the third shelter by themselves, because everyone else is too busy having fun. The community spirit of the assemblies is hard to maintain.
Even the littluns' games involve violence and broken friendships. Once Roger watches them playing:
""Percival had gone off, crying, and Johnny was left in triumphant possession of the castles.""
As pressure builds, the boys find that they have to take sides. When Jack defies Ralph and goes off alone, he challenges,
""Anyone who wants to hunt when I do can come too.""
He ignores Ralph's effort to make peace.
Jack's tribe becomes ruled by fear. Most boys don't want to be involved, but have no option. He keeps control by intimidating them and bullying them, such as when he ties up and beats Wilfred.
Roger rules by terror too. When Samneric are captured,
""Roger advanced upon them as one wielding a nameless authority.""
The island is first seen as like paradise, too good to be true. Ralph thinks:
""Here at last was the imagined but never fully realised place leaping into real life""
However, the island is soon found to contain many dangers. For example, coconuts fall from the trees and just miss injuring Roger, the sun burns them, and the isolation is a curse.
Ralph reflects at the end that the island once had a
All this echoes the Bible story of the Fall of Man, when Adam and Eve were cast out of Paradise as a punishment for disobeying God. The island becomes a burnt wasteland, as if as a punishment for all the violence committed by the boys.
The language used by the boys progressively degenerates.
At the start of the novel the youngest boys are called

of how far the violence has come. The pig was killed by Jack and his hunters and the head is put on a stick as an offering to the 'beast'. Only Simon really appreciates that the 'beast' is actually the evil inside the boys themselves and it is that which is breaking things up.
So, the title of the novel reinforces the idea that we all have something of the 'devil' within us - and that the 'devil' can be released all too easily.

Converting from one metric unit to another
Perhaps the most common metric conversions are between mm, cm, m and km.
1 m = 100 cm = 1000 mm
1 km = 1000 m = 100 000 cm = 1 000 000 mm
, so 1 km = 1000 m
Once you are confident with conversions between mm, cm, m and km, converting units of mass and capacity is eaier.
1 km = 1000 m, so 1 kg = 1000 g
1 m = 100 cm, so 1 l (litre) = 100 cl (centilitres)
1 m = 1000 mm, so 1 g = 1000 mg (milligrams)
A packet of biscuits weighs 150 g. Find the weight of 12 packets of biscuits:

These were shaped by her upbringing, relationship with Shelley, and her reading of the works of many famous authors and philosophers. These ideas can be summed up in the main
The novel begins with Walton describing his own voyage of discovery, which he hopes will lead him to the North Pole. On meeting Victor, he hears of another tale of discovery, that of the secret of creating life itself.
The Monster is also on a path of self-discovery, and all three characters share a powerful desire to acquire knowledge - a desire that ultimately leads two of them to their deaths, and which very nearly kills Walton.
The Monster quite naturally seeks knowledge about where it came from and how to survive in a hostile world. Through patient
, it learns how to speak and read. But the knowledge it gains only leads it to curse its existence.
It knows that it can never be accepted in the world of man, yet craves human company and the love of the father who abandoned it. Finally, through learning of the 'sanguinary (bloody) laws of man', the Monster is taught that it can be acceptable to kill in some circumstances. This knowledge leads to the deaths of many innocent people.
Robert Walton was brought up by his uncle, and is self-taught in the art of sea-faring. This is despite his father's dying wish that his uncle forbid him from embarking on a life at sea. His determination to succeed, shown by his willingness to work ""harder than the common sailors during the day (and devote his) nights to the study of mathematics medicine... and physical sciences"", leads him to believe he can be the first to discover the sea passage to the North Pole. However, his real motivation is self-glory, fuelled by overwhelming ambition. This leads to him failing to assess the dangers of his voyage and knowingly putting the lives of his crew at risk.
Victor Frankenstein also puts others' lives at risk, as well as his own, through his ambitious pursuit of knowledge. He neglects his loving family and allows his health to suffer greatly in his obsession to discover the secret of creating life out of death.
Shelley makes it clear she believes knowledge such as this cannot lead to good. Some benefit may have come from finding a way to the North Pole, but no good is shown to come from Victor's creation of the Monster.
She shows Victor's 'success' to have severe and tragic consequences that should serve as a warning to scientists, past, present and future, that knowledge is a very dangerous thing and should only be used for the good of mankind - and certainly not personal gain.

2073,"Obviously designers have to think about what people want from a product. But consumer demand is a complex matter. Consumers are influenced by fashion, by public perceptions, by moral attitudes, and by changing lifestyles.
Product designers need to consider all these factors, as well as making sure the product conforms to current laws and standards.
Design is influenced by what people want, and what people want is affected by
. These influences come in the shape of current lifestyles and fashions, and the influence of design from other times and other cultures.
Market influences are partly caused by the fact that people want to have the same products as their friends. You and your friends will have similar interests, which designers have to understand if their products are to fit in with your lifestyle and sell well. Designers of mobile phones know that they have to design phones which will not only meet you and your friends' needs, but also make the right kind of 'design statement' about you the users.
At the same time, however, people want to be individuals, to stand out from the crowd, and express themselves by, for example, wearing clothes that look and feel unique. Designers need to understand this desire, otherwise their products will not sell.
Consumer choice is the idea that consumers should have a wide range of products to choose from, because different consumers will want different styles, different performance, and different prices when considering a purchase. Consumer choice is an influence on design, because designers need to know what their potential customers are looking for if they are going to design and make successful products.
Car manufacturers, for example, will design and make the same model of car in many slightly different versions, to suit individual drivers' different tastes.
Companies use market research to find out what people want. Interviews or questionnaires are used to gather people's views on the products they like, the functions and features they require, and the amount they would be prepared to pay. Sometimes the research is carefully focused on a particular group of people - eg women, people of a certain age-range or salary level - who have been identified as key potential consumers.
The results of the research are then passed on to the designer, whose job it is to design products which meet these consumer expectations. When designing your own products, you also need to do some basic market research to find out your potential users' requirements.

who work for local councils. These laws allow consumers to get their money back if goods are found to be faulty or if products do not perform in the way claimed by the manufacturer.
You need to know about the following three pieces of legislation:
This replaced the 1973 Fair Trading Act. Its most important provisions are:
control of monopolies (where a single business has a 25% share of the market or more, and is damaging competition)
control of mergers (where two or more companies join together, which might have adverse effects on competition and the public interest)
control of 'rogue traders' - giving the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) power to take action against businesses that persistently breach civil or criminal law when dealing with consumers
prohibiting the manufacture and supply of unsafe goods
making the person who manufactures or sells a defective product responsible for damage it causes
allowing local councils to seize unsafe goods and suspend the sale of suspected unsafe goods
prohibiting misleading price indications - eg, giving misleading information about discounts or sale prices
Makes it an offence for a trader to make false or misleading statements about goods or services. The Act carries criminal penalties and is enforced by local authorities' Trading Standards Officers. This Act makes it an offence for a trader to

When designing your own product, you also need to ensure it will meet safety standards.
Product designers should also take into account
whenever they design or make a product. 'Moral issues' refers to any adverse impact the product might have on other people. 'Environmental issues' refers to any adverse impact the product might have on the environment. In practice, since people must live in the environment, it's difficult to separate these things out from each other.
The list below outlines some of the key moral and environmental questions a designer should ask themselves about their product.
Is the cost of the product justifiable?
Does the product make efficient use of natural resources?
Are there any waste products which could pollute the environment?
Can the product be recycled after use?
Having considered the potential moral and environmental impact of a product, a designer may decide to use alternative processes, materials or chemicals. The use of alternatives may mean that some parts of the product need to be re-designed, or an alternative manufacturing process needs to be used.

The shape, size and colour are important factors when packaging a product. The marketing department will want to make the packaging attractive and distinctive. Coke's packaging is dominated by red. This helps consumers to recognise a product instantly, when they are in a shop. The same applies to the shape of the packaging. Deodorants and shampoos, for example, come in all shapes and sizes. Remember that the actual product is inside the container, so the packaging and advertising are all that will attract us to try a product in the first place.
Large manufacturers understand the importance of their brand name. Kellogg's, Adidas and Microsoft are all household names which we associate with quality. As a result, we are likely to buy one of their products when we go shopping rather than an untried or unknown one even if it is say, a supermarket's

is to give a product a distinctive image which will differentiate it from similar products. An expensive perfume or aftershave might be sold in an elegantly designed bottle. This sort of packaging suggests quality and would be targeted at a person with taste. Even if the product itself was not very good, the packaging alone could give the impression that it was.
The success of a product through branding can lead to
Choosing and continuing to buy your favourite brand.
. A positive buying experience results in repeat sales. Consumers tend to stick to a product if we like it. This in turn can lead to a trust in other products under the same brand name.
There are so many products on the market, many of them similar to each other, that the decision to make a first time purchase can be a difficult process. If we don't know about the product already, we take advice from people who do or we read the magazine reports about it. Without personal recommendation, we rely on advertising and the product's packaging to help us make a buying decision.
In a highly competitive market, the marketing department try to make their products stand out against the rest. A supermarket is a good example of this, with shelves full of almost identical products to choose from. The challenge facing the package designer is how to grab our attention so we make an

Fizz should make sure their name is clearly shown on the packaging. Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one. As they want to sell to schoolchildren it would be a good idea to use bright colours on the packaging.

Fizz should make sure their name is clearly shown on the packaging to make sure their product stands out. Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one as opposed to another similar product. As they want to sell to schoolchildren it could also be a good idea to use bright colours on their packaging as this has been a very successful way of attracting children in the past.
Saf's answer shows that she understands packaging quite well as she gives good reasons. She could, however, have been a little more detailed and used business terms. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade.
Fizz should make sure their brand name and logo are clearly shown on the packaging to help the consumer recognise their brand and to differentiate the product. This would allow Fizz to take advantage of brand loyalty. Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one as opposed to another similar product. As their target market is schoolchildren it could also be a good idea to use bright colours on their packaging and perhaps even a cartoon character, as these have been very successful ways of attracting children in the past.
Marlon's answer is very thorough. He gives good reasons for his suggestions and uses the correct business terms, like 'brand loyalty' and 'differentiate the product'. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.

This is an example of 'sustainable agriculture'. It benefits small farmers and enables them to use their land efficiently. The projects use cheap, appropriate technology to increase yields in ways that make farmers more independent and conserve their natural resources.
Farmers in 50 developing countries have adopted sustainable techniques and some have experienced increased yields. By combining science with traditional knowledge, sustainable agriculture could meet the long-term food needs of developing countries without damaging the environment.
Genetically modified (GM) foods, for example, could change food production methods. They allow more food to be produced in a smaller area using fewer resources. Some people are against GM crops and question whether it will reduce hunger in LEDCs and are concerned about the impact on the environment.
In the 1960s high-yielding varieties of crops were used to increase food production - this became known as 'The Gene Revolution'. In the Gene Revolution, genes from one plant were copied and inserted into another to give it new characteristics. This allowed foods to be developed to suit specific environments and food demands.

Pip is both the hero and narrator of the story, looking back reflectively on the lessons life has taught him. He is critical of the mistakes made by his younger self.
Dickens starts with Pip weeping for his dead family in the churchyard, establishing him as an orphan for whom we feel sorry and protective.
Pip is a good person. He steals a file and food for the convict, but feels guilty about it. He helps Herbert Pocket to get a job. He helps Magwitch, even though it means the end of his dreams of being a gentleman.
Pip's efforts to be a gentleman almost destroy him - he says horrible things to Biddy and is ashamed of Joe. But he maintains our sympathy because he hates himself for it.
Pip's 'training' to be a gentleman was merely learning to eat properly and wear the 'right' clothes - showing that at the time he mistakenly thought that being a 'gentleman' was about surface wealth and manners (when really it was about inner character and worth).
Two things 'save' Pip. Firstly, luck dashes his dreams. Secondly, those who love him stick by him.
In the end, Pip finds happiness in hard work, 'sufficient' income, and doing the decent thing. Pip is an autobiographical projection of Dickens himself. By 1860, Dickens' marriage had failed, and he had worries about his children, and his business. In
he tells us the conclusions of an older, wiser man with experience of setbacks - that happiness is not about being successful, but being good.
In the novel, Magwitch is a father-figure to Pip. (Remember that Dickens' own father was imprisoned.)
Although Magwitch is a convict and 'a fearful man', he is decent enough to take the blame for Pip's theft (which in those days was a hanging offence). This reflects the novel's theme that a real gentleman is not someone who has money and manners, but someone who does good.
In the churchyard where Pip begins his recollections, Magwitch - also an orphan - is first made 'aware of himself' stealing food. It is suggested to us that his poor start in life condemned him to a life as a criminal.
Because Magwitch is a criminal, Pip feels he cannot keep his money, so Magwitch's return means the end of Pip's fortune.
Although he is horrified to meet him at first, Pip comes to love Magwitch as a good and noble man. In the end, he brings the dying Magwitch happiness by telling him Estella is his daughter and that he (Pip) loves her.
Magwitch's story carries the social message of
: that poverty creates crime, and many criminals are decent people who are just unlucky.
is as much Magwitch's story as it is Pip's.
Miss Havisham is a mother-figure to Pip, but taunts and abuses him. (Remember that Dickens disliked his own mother.)
Miss Havisham is a purposefully 'unreal' character. Time has stood still for her: she wears fantastic clothing and looks like a waxwork. Many writers describe
as a 'fairy story', in which Miss Havisham plays the part of Pip's imperfect fairy god-mother.
Miss Havisham also supplies the 'silver fork' element of the novel - stories about rich people that fascinated the poor.
Miss Havisham is a connecting thread for the storyline:
She was swindled by Compeyson, which condemned his partner, Magwitch, to jail.
She adopted Magwitch's daughter, Estella, but encouraged her to break Pip's heart.
Her employment of Pip gives him his yearning to be a gentleman. But she pays for Pip to be apprenticed to a blacksmith, which is the cause of his dissatisfaction.
It is at Satis House that Pip first meets Jaggers, and it is this which leads him to guess, wrongly, that Miss Havisham is his secret
Someone that helps or supports a person or group, usually by offering financial aid.
In Chapter 38, Estella rejects not only Pip's love but also Miss Havisham's, and breaks both of their hearts.
At the end of the novel, Miss Havisham sees she has hurt Pip because she was hurt, and seeks his forgiveness.
In the end, Miss Havisham is consumed by fire (a Christian image of cleansing, as well as punishment).
Although she harms Pip, the reader forgives her because she is clearly psychologically damaged, repents of her actions and dies such a horrific death.
Her name means 'star' - which is associated with beauty and love, yet at the same time is cold, distant and unobtainable. Pip, in his desire to be a gentleman, is 'reaching for the stars', but doomed to fall short.
Perhaps Dickens associated Estella with his teenage, starlet lover Ellen Ternan (the 'ell' of Ellen is picked up in the name Estella). Did this give special vibrancy to his descriptions of Pip's yearning love?
Estella is beautiful and rich, but these are her only qualities. She is otherwise shallow and cruel.
Biddy is the opposite to Estella, who represents the shallowness of money and manners.
tells of how Pip is at first beguiled into wanting Estella, but discovers that Biddy is better.
The reader can forgive Estella because, like Miss Havisham (who trained her to hate men), she too is psychologically damaged. Also, she warns Pip from the start that she has a cold heart and will never love him. Pip's
In the final chapter, after Estella's unhappy marriage to the brutal Bentley Drummle, she tells Pip she has learned good character: ""I have been bent and broken but - I hope - into a better shape.""
On the advice of friends, and to make the book more popular, Dickens rewrote the ending to read: ""'I saw no shadow of another parting from her"" - allowing Pip and Estella to stay together.
Orlick is the irredeemably evil element in
- giving it a Gothic atmosphere of threat and foreboding.
Orlick's favourite phrases are: ""I'll be burned"" and ""I'll be jiggered (meaning 'caught on a sharp hook')"" - conjuring up violent and frightening images.

3857,"We often use formulas without even noticing. For example, we might convert miles to km by multiplying by 1.6, or find the circumference of a circle by multiplying pi by the diameter.
km = 1.6 x miles is an example of a formula.
We have already seen that km = 1.6 x miles and C =
 d are examples of formulas. There are many others that we use regularly in other subjects. Sometimes we have to construct our own formula:
A taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00. Write down a formula for the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles.
Travelling 1 mile would cost 2 + 50p.
Travelling 2 miles would cost 2 + 2 x 50p.
Travelling 3 miles would cost 2 + 3 x 50p.
So travelling for 'n' miles will cost 2 + n x 50p.
The formula is C = 2 + (n x 50p)
A rectangle has a width of x and a length of 2x.
Write down a formula for the perimeter (P) in terms of x.
P = 2x + x + 2x + x
Did you remember to include all 4 sides?
To recap, the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles, when a taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00 is:-
C = 2 + (n x 50p)
To find the cost of the taxi for a journey of 20 miles, replace 'n' with 20.
C = 2 + (20 x 50p)
What is the cost of hiring this taxi for 16 miles?
Remember that C = 2 + (16 x 50p)
The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.
r, so we divide both sides by 2
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c
Rearrange the formula to make 'c' the subject.

the number of shells is the same as the period number.
As you go across each period from left to right the outer shell gradually becomes filled with electrons. The outer shell contains just one electron on the left hand side of the table, but is filled by the time you get to the right hand side.
the number of electrons in the outermost shell is the same as the group number.
Each element in a group therefore has the same number of electrons in its outer shell.
to this rule, since although it comes after Group 7 it is not called 'Group 8'; and it contains helium, which has only two electrons in its outer shell.
Working out electronic structure from the Periodic Table
Here's how to use the Periodic Table to work out an electronic structure:
Find the element in the Periodic Table. Work out which period it's in, and draw that number of circles around the nucleus.
Work out which group the element is in and draw that number of electrons in the outer circle - with eight for Group 0 elements (except helium).
Fill the other circles with electrons (remember: two in the first, eight in the second and third, 18 in the fourth).
Finally, count your electrons and check that they equal the atomic number.
Working out electronic structure from the atomic number
of an atom is the number of
it has. This is the same as the number of electrons. If we know the atomic number we can work out the arrangement of the electrons.
Fill the shells starting from the smallest and going outward.
For example silicon has atomic number 16. So we have to fill the shells with 16 electrons. That makes 2 in the first (to fill it), 8 in the second shell (to fill that) and 6 left to go into the third shell. So silicon has electronic structure 2.8.6

The story seems to be told from Nick's viewpoint. Although it is told in the third person - both characters are referred to as 'he' and 'she' - the story remains with Nick after Marjorie has left, so we get his reaction to the break-up, but not hers.
Nick has planned to break up with Marjorie, and has discussed it with Bill beforehand - Bill asks: ""Did she go alright?"" You could see Nick as being unfair, since he has planned this and still goes on the fishing trip with her.
Nick seems to be quite aggressive at times in the story: when responding to things Marjorie says, and picking arguments.
He does not have the courage to break up with her outright - he has to pick an argument first. It is Marjorie who asks the definitive question.
Earlier in the story, is Nick trying to break the idea to Marjorie gently when he comments that the fish will not ""strike"" - in other words, they will not commit, like him?
Hemingway only directly mentions what the characters are feeling once or twice. He uses the word 'afraid' to describe Nick's feelings when he is talking to Marjorie. What do you think he is afraid of?
After Marjorie has gone, Nick seems upset. He tells Bill the break-up went fine, but is described as ""lying, his face on the blanket"". The 'lying' is
- is it about the position of his body or the truth of his words?
She seems more inclined to romance, likening the broken down mill to a 'castle'.
She also tries to draw Nick into a shared past, referring to it as 'our ruin'.
Hemingway says she ""loved fishing. She loved fishing with Nick."" The repetition seems to put emphasis on his presence being important to her. Nick says he has taught her everything about fishing. She has learned about it for his sake.
Marjorie is perceptive. She tells Nick he does not have to 'talk silly', and asks him: ""What's really the matter?""
She is very calm and collected throughout the story. She acts with dignity even when being dumped, and when he is snapping at her. When he says that love is not 'fun' anymore, she does not argue or protest. She merely leaves in dignified silence.
Bill is Nick's friend. Hemingway uses him to show what Nick is feeling, instead of telling us directly.
Bill knows that Nick is upset. When Nick tells him to 'go away', Bill moves a little way away, but remains in calling distance.
At the end, Bill's attitude to the picnic basket and fishing rods is very relaxed and casual - highlighting the tension in Nick's behaviour towards both earlier in the story.

4189,"Chemistry usually works with materials on a large scale. Even just a gram of a chemical consists of millions of millions of millions of molecules and chemical reactions affect all the particles in the sample.
. The individual fullerene molecules or nanotubes have different properties from the bulk material.
The nanotubes structure allows it to be used as a vessel for transporting a drug into the body. A molecule of the drug can be placed inside the nanotube cage which keeps the drug wrapped up until it reaches the site where it's required. In this way, a dose that might be prohibitively damaging to other parts of the body can be delivered safely to, say, a cancerous tumour.
The structure of nanotubes involves a massive surface area. Spreading a catalyst, atom by atom, on the surface of a nanotube provides a huge surface area where reactants can come into contact with the catalyst.
The examples above might be described as molecular manufacturing or nanotechnology. Building a product molecule by molecule, positioning molecules one at a time or producing nanoscale features by removing matter from a bigger structure may enable us to do things which only a short time ago were undreamed of.

Megan is in the headteacher's office, with the Head (DSL/R). The Head gives the victim's account of what happened. As she tells her account the lights dim and Megan joins the group CS, and re-enacts the scene as the lights go up. The commentary fades out as the scene is played. Freeze. Megan rejoins the Head in her office with her Head bowed. The Head asks what she has to say. She apologises, and says that she's ashamed etc. The Head brings in the victim, and Megan has to apologise - the victim doesn't answer.
Megan is now a mother, whose daughter has been accused of bullying. The scene takes place in the headteacher's office. Megan is horrified to hear of what her daughter has done, and tells of what happened when she was at school. Lights dim. She joins group CS and re-plays the scene. Freeze. She returns to the headteacher's office and it is still in the past (slightly dimmer lighting than previously). The scene unfolds, with a telling off and a statement by (young) Megan about how she feels about what she's done and what her parents will say. Freeze. Lights fully up and the scene is now today. Megan's daughter is told about what happened in the past, and is thoughtful. The headteacher asks that Megan's daughter be excluded from school for a day, to think about what will happen in the future.
These scenes will need more than three actors. Again, they focus on Megan's regret, and the guilt she feels about being a bully.

6076,"Farmers started to work scientifically for the first time during the 1830s. Many new improvements were the result of individuals, such as Justus von Liebig, experimenting, observing and explaining how crop yields could be enlarged and improved.
The main improvements introduced in the 1830s, which were the main characteristics of High Farming, covered fertilisers, drainage and steam power coupled with support from government initiatives.
Illustration of a bird with guano (bird droppings)
- a scientist called Sir John Lawes started the production and use of phosphate fertilisers and super phosphates, which were initially by-products of industrial processes. The other most commonly used fertiliser from the 1830s onwards was guano (bird droppings) from the Andes Mountains in Peru. Soil in Britain became richer and produced higher yields as a result.
- new steam-operated machines were invented that could lay drainage pipes in straight lines. These drainage pipes cleared water from flooded fields and subsequently improved the quality of agricultural land in Great Britain.
- steam became the new method of powering farming machinery, which made the agricultural process more efficient. Examples of new steam-powered machinery included ploughs, seed drills, threshing machines and from 1852 onwards, steam-powered reapers. Unfortunately, most of these new steam-powered machines were invented in America and were not practical for use on the smaller enclosed British fields in the late 19th century.
- for the very first time, the government gave out 28 million in loans to help farmers use these new techniques and ideas on their fields. The government also forced remaining open land to be enclosed.

2197,". This is when a character reacts to something - it's not quite the same as a soliloquy because it's a comment on what is happening around them. However, the other characters are not aware of it and it's as if the speaker is confessing. So in Act 2, Scene 1 Iago sees Cassio take Desdemona's hand and his asides tells us he has decided to 'ensare' Cassio with 'tricks', which is exactly what he does later on.
- Othello hides away to hear Cassio talk, Iago hides to watch Roderigo's attack on Cassio and even Desdemona's body is hidden until Emilia 'draws the bed-curtain' to reveal her lying there.
- it seems completely unimportant at first, it is just a handkerchief which Desdemona has dropped. But we soon realise that Iago has been trying to get hold of it for a long time, and it is a

6456,"Where no profit or loss is made ie where total revenue = total costs.
point is when a firm begins to make a profit. It will make a loss if it produces and sells output below this level.
The breakeven point for a firm is when total costs equals total revenue. Expenditure and income are the same and the firm makes neither a profit or a loss. If the firm can sell at production levels above this point, it will be making a profit. If sales fall below this point, it will be making a loss. Establishing the breakeven point helps a firm to plan the levels of production it needs to be profitable.
Before you can calculate the breakeven point, you need to identify the firm's costs. These include:
Renting an office block is part of a company's fixed costs
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
are constant and do not change however many goods are produced. They include rent and insurance.
Wages paid to employees are part of a company's variable costs
These change according to output eg raw materials.
include raw materials and wages. You need to calculate the variable costs per unit. These costs increase in direct proportion to the number of units produced.
By adding the firm's variable costs and fixed costs you can work out the
Fixed costs plus variable costs make total costs.
The firm's variable costs are added to the fixed costs and these make the total costs.
You need to establish how many units are to be produced.
You need to know the selling price of the units.
Once you have the above information, you can begin to calculate the breakeven point. You do this either by using a chart or an equation.
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
These change according to output eg raw materials.
You may find it helpful to work through the
Here is how to work out the breakeven point, using the example of a firm manufacturing compact discs. You can assume the firm has the following costs:
You first construct a chart with output (units) on the horizontal (x) axis, and costs and revenue on the vertical (y) axis. On to this, you plot a horizontal fixed costs line (it is horizontal because fixed costs don't changewith output).
Then you plot a variable cost line from this point, which will, in effect, be the total costs line. This is because the fixed cost added to the variable cost gives the total cost. To do this, you multiply:
variable cost per unit  number of units
In this example of the CD manufacturing firm, you can assume that the variable cost per unit is 2 and there are 2 000 units = 4,000
Once you have done this, you are ready to plot the
The value of sales at a given output ie sales price multiplied by output.
sales price  number of units (output)
If the sales price is 6.00 and 2.000 items were to be manufactured, the calculation is:
6.00  2,000 = 12,000 total revenue
Where the total revenue line crosses the total costs line is the breakeven point (ie costs and revenue are the same). Everything below this point is produced at a loss, and everything above it is produced at a profit.
Fixed costs: 10,000, Variable costs: 2 per unit, Sales price: 6 per unit
If you read downwards, it tells you how many units you need to produce and sell at this price to breakeven: 2,500 CDs
If you read across, it tells you how much money you must spend before you recover your outlay: 15,000
As with any calculation, it is easy to make a mistake. There are two simple equations you can use to double-check your answer. You can calculate the breakeven point in:
Either way, the result should be the same.
For the breakeven point in costs/revenue, you then multiply the breakeven point in units, which you have just calculated, by the sales price.
If you look at the breakeven chart, you will see this is the correct answer.
Breakeven analysis is a favourite exam topic. In an exam, you could be asked to complete a breakeven chart. With these two equations, you'll be able to double check your calculations, get them right and improve your marks.
Use the example of the CD manufacturer above and plot your own chart with the same costs, but this time with a different total revenue line:
You should have calculated a breakeven point of 2,000 units and a costs revenue of 14,000.
If you have made a mistake, calculate the breakeven point in units, and then in costs/revenue again and double check your calculations again.

3430,"Website designs vary from basic ones set up by users as a hobby to sophisticated designs that represent large international companies. Before designing a website, you should take a look at other websites to help you decide how your webpages should look.
You should also read the project brief carefully. Make sure you do exactly what the examiners want. There is no point in doing any more - if they say five pages, only do five pages.
Normally, on a website there is a title bar at the top, a menu on the left and then the main information appears in the big space on the right.
Stick to a simple, clear page layout
Try to avoid flashy things like sound, scrolling banners and animated text/graphics. These might look 'cool' to you, but, unless they are really suitable for the purpose and audience, they are more likely to lose you marks than earn you marks.
The examiners will be looking for a consistent house style throughout each publication you produce.
A good example of this can be seen on the BBC GCSE Bitesize website. GCSE Bitesize uses the same font, sizes and layout throughout the site. This gives a much more professional impression than constantly chopping and changing between different pages.
Ideally, you should come up with a few ideas for fonts, layouts and colour schemes and then test them on members of your target audience. Remember to include details of this testing when writing your reviews and evaluations. Always remember the publication has to appeal to your target audience!
Have consistent left-hand navigation on each page.
Don't have too much text on one page - people don't like scrolling down pages.
Break text up using bullet points, short paragraphs and tables. It's more difficult to read text on screen than it is on paper.
Keep graphics to a minimum. Graphics increase the page weight and increase the time pages take to download.
Take a look at the image below. It's a classic example of a badly designed website! Make sure you avoid using garish colours and patterned backgrounds.
Bright colours and poor quality photographs are not very attractive
Here are some important rules to stick to when writing text for a website:
Stick to a single font colour and size on your website. Try to stick to black text on a white or light-coloured background.
Arial size 12 is easy to read on websites. Try not to use a smaller sized font.
Remember the intended audience. Always test your website on users.
Do not use underlining on webpages. Users will think it is a hyperlink and get confused when it doesn't link to another website.
Keep it simple. Be consistent across the whole website.
Webpages need file names. This allows you and visitors to your website to identify each webpage.
There are several rules you need to stick to when naming webpage files.
Use correct file extension names, eg .htm .html or .shtml.
Do not use symbols, eg + & % in file names.
Do no put spaces in your file or folder name. Use either dashes (-) or underscores (_)
Name your files sensibly. Video_intro.shtml, video_movie.shtm are easier to identify than page1.shtml, page2.shtml etc.
Webpage file names should mean something to you and the user
Keep html, image, flash and other media files in separate folders.
Put images in a folder called images, put audio files in a folder called audio.
There should be an index.shtml file in the site folder.
Do not create folders that contain too many or too few files.
All screen-based publications are likely to need some images. The things to keep in mind when selecting images are:
For the current eportfolio, you are only allowed to use jpg, png, gif and tif. You may need to use a graphics package to convert the graphic to a suitable format.
If they are copyright images, you will actually lose marks for putting them in (you could email the person who holds the copyright, but this can take months to sort out).
If not, use a graphics package to re-size or crop them. Editing inside Powerpoint or a website package is likely to spoil the way the graphic appears.
Have you updated your list of sources?
Each time you add a graphic to a publication, you should update your list of sources.
Can you use some of your own graphics?
It's a good idea to create some graphics. This could be with a digital camera or by doing some original artwork on the computer.
How much memory do the graphics take up?
Remember your eportfolio has a maximum size so keep an eye on individual graphics to make sure they are not too big.
At all times, make sure the graphic is suitable for the intended audience and purpose.
Before creating a website, make sure you know the difference between relative and absolute links.
These point to where the file you want to link to is saved. For example, Jeff is saving his files on his school network. He has a file called intro.html for which the absolute link is:
Look at the image below to see the folders in which intro.html sits.
The problem with absolute links is that the examiner will not have access to your schools server. When your folder and files are copied across to the exam boards server, any absolute links will not work.
For example, Jeff hands in his folder called
to the examiner. In this folder is another folder called
. The examiner, therefore, has access to everything stored within the jeffd201 folder. Now look at the absolute link again - everything that has been handed into the examiner is in bold:
The part that is not in bold represents the school's server, which the examiner
Therefore, you must use relative hyperlinks (the part in bold) when linking your webpages together.
As you have read above, an example of a relative link in Jeff's folder is:
This hyperlink just describes where the file (intro.html) is relative to the current file  in this case, in a subfolder called webpages.
Relative links make it easier to type hyperlinks  youre less likely to make errors. Files can be moved from a local system (your school server) to another server (the examination board).
Remember that the examiner will not have access to your school server. Never refer to the server, or absolute address when you use hyperlinks.
Now look at the image below taken from the examiner's computer. Notice how Jeff's files and folders have been copied on to the exam board's server.
The absolute link for Jeff's file has now changed to:
But notice how the relative link is still the same:
It is crucial to thoroughly test your presentations and websites, as well as all the publications you produce.
First, check that all the links work. It is best to copy the website or presentation onto another device (like a memory stick or CD) and try it out away from the school network - this will show if you have used absolute hyperlinks by mistake. All the links must work before you submit your work for marking and moderation.
Secondly, test your publication with members of the target audience.
Listen carefully and improve your publication accordingly.
One good way of doing this is to prepare a checklist for the reviewer to fill in. Include questions like:
Was the information at the right level?
Finally, write the results of your tests in the review section of your eportfolio. Remember to say how well your publication meets the needs of the audience and include ideas on how it can be improved.

Images on websites can improve the look and style of the page. However, you must be careful to save images in the correct format.
The two main formats for web images are gif and jpg.
These are used for images that have only a few colours, such as line drawings, text and logos.
Images with few colours should be saved as a gif file
These are used for images or photographs that include details and more colours.
If you save a photo or graphic in the incorrect format, how the image looks will be affected. Look at the images below. When the fish photo is saved in a gif format, colours and details are lost.
When the bitesize graphic is saved incorrectly as a jpg, unwanted colours appear and the looks less sharp. Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.

In the extract from Karimah's work journal, shown below, you will see how she has explained her work to others. This was a statement she included with her exhibition of coursework. Along with her other notes and explanations, she was able to help others understand how she had developed her ideas and work.

My art exhibition shows a series of artwork that I have created which all deal with my journey from Nigeria to England. During the term, I have created a series of art pieces that concentrate on the theme of 'Identity'. In the art pieces, I explore the journey that I have made from Nigeria to live in England. The reason that I have focused on this subject under the title of 'Identity' is because, the journey I have made was a life changing journey and it is a significant part of my identity.
I first started exploring this journey by creating self portraits, this was to develop my skills and ideas in art to help me to become more advanced. I then planned and created a collage of Africa. This collage shows the journey that I made to England from Nigeria, through symbols, colours and pictures used to represent the contrasting countries. The main elements that I included in my collage work is that England has a cool calm atmosphere and climate whilst Nigeria is hot and roars with excitement and noise. Nigeria has a beautiful collection of exotic animals that run wild and free, whilst in England the animals are locked up in a zoo. The environment in England is clean and fresh but in Nigeria, it is dirty and humid. I chose to show my journey this way because it is an effective way of showing the striking difference between England and Nigeria.
After the first collage I realised that collage is my strongest point in art and I began to produce a series of mixed media pieces that featured collage. 'Tree of Life' is a piece where I used a symbol of a tree to represent my life growing out of a symbol of Africa. In 'The first self portrait collage' I used maps to show the physical part of my journey. 'The second self portrait collage', is a piece where I used the different flags of England and Nigeria to show my journey and the comparison between England and Nigeria.
I have linked my theme of 'Identity', with numerous artists because they have all been exploring a similar theme to me. Gerard Quenum is an African artist who uses dolls to symbolise identity, Richard Long, an artist who expresses his journeys through photographs, Louise Bourgeois who deals with her identity by using memories of her childhood, Frida Khalo a Mexican artist who uses powerful images to show her identity and Henri Matisse who uses his knowledge of African art and refines it into a simpler form in his pieces of art. I have been to the National Gallery, the Tate Modern, the October Gallery, the Century City exhibition and the library to learn about artists that may have connections with my theme.
I have been exploring my cultural and family background through family photographs. This is because the photographs prompt ideas for units of work and they tell different stories through the atmosphere or pose in the picture.
The journey in the art pieces is presented in mixed styles of aboriginal art and African art. I do this to experiment with the different ways of presenting my journey to viewers and to give a variation in the techniques and arts styles that I use.
My progress whilst creating units of artwork has improved dramatically compared to the beginning of term where I was unable to develop and explore ideas. Overall, I am pleased with the way that I have managed to link all my units of artwork together all under the topic of 'Identity'. I have improved my art skills from the beginning of the term, when I had very little art skills. I am glad that I can now expand and explore ideas, compared to when I first started art and I could not develop an idea because of lack of experience and knowledge of art.

Human gestation is around 40 weeks although infants can survive if born earlier than this. Other mammals have different gestation times depending on their size, the number of offspring and how independent they are when born. Large animals with a small number of independent offspring have the longest gestation.
When humans are born, their heads are relatively large, and their legs relatively short. Through childhood their bodies grow faster than their heads until they reach maturity. To check that development is happening at normal rates, infants regularly have their mass and head circumference measured.

5815,"W B Yeats: Song of the Old Mother
Yeats wrote a great deal about the passage of time, and of youth and beauty giving way to old age and death.
A central, unifying idea that runs through a text or performance.
. The poem contrasts two types of human endeavour: the young women's dreams of love and obsession with appearance; and the hard, grinding, thankless work that is the Old Mother's lot.
An interesting cross-current is set going by our uncertainty about who the young women are.
Are they the Old Mother's own children? If so, their idleness is easier to forgive. Perhaps in her youth the old woman herself dreamed of love, lay late in bed, and obsessed about whether her ribbons matched. Perhaps, as old people often do, she has forgotten what it's like to be young!
Or are they the children of the old woman's rich employers? If they are, we are more likely to view them as spoilt and selfish young people whose idle lives are made possible only by the drudgery of poor servants like the Old Mother.
And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress:
While I must work because I am old,
And the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold.'

Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint.
Both express love. Shakespeare writes to his mistress, Hopkins writes about a much-loved landscape.
Shakespeare mocks the common cliches that poets use about their mistresses - lips redder than coral, breasts whiter than snow, etc - to emphasise the reality of his love. Hopkins also wants to get away from the cliched use of language - by inventing words, like rollrock and twindles, to pinpoint his meaning.
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint, and both express danger as well as beauty.
However, in Clarke's poem man has caused the destruction already (cutting hay kills the field mouse; war is taking place in Bosnia) - Hopkins' poem is a plea to stop man from causing destruction.

to convey their message. The central image for Clarke is the field mouse, which represents all the innocent, vulnerable people in the world who are killed or injured. Inversnaid represents all areas of wet and wilderness in the world that mankind could jeopardise.
Both poems describe watery river scenes, but while Perch is purely a vivid word-picture, Inversnaid contains more of an explicit 'message'.
The language in Perch has many similarities with the Hopkins poem: combination words and word-plays (alder-dapple, finland of perch) dialect and obsolete words (grunt, slub, runty, adoze) and lots of sound devices. The unorthodox grammar of on hold / In the everything flows and steady go of the world (where the last 8 words make up a giant compound noun) is very like Hopkins.
While the Hopkins poem is full of movement, and ranges over the landscape, the Heaney poem stays very still and focused on the almost motionless fish, adoze in the current.
How does the rhythm and rhyme scheme of Perch compare with that of Inversnaid?
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint, describing an experience which is for the poet is intensely present.
Both poets use an extended image to put their point across. The canary-yellow cotton jacket is the central image in Homecoming. A row over the jacket caused the family row; the reconciliation is likened to putting the jacket back on. For Hopkins, the darksome burn represents all areas of wilderness in the world that could be vulnerable to man.

In females, the two sex chromosomes are the same. They are XX.
Gametes are sex cells. The male gametes are the sperm, and the female gametes are the eggs.
Gametes contain one set of genetic information, while body cells contain two sets of genetic information.
Fertilisation is the joining or fusion of a male gamete and a female gamete. The new cell that is formed divides over and over again by mitosis. This creates the many cells that eventually form a new individual.

The first attempt in Britain to improve roads started in 1663. This was when the Turnpike Trust was set up. The trusts had one simple aim:
to charge people to use newly improved roads
and then the money raised from the tolls was used to pay for the upkeep of the roads.

A carriage passes through the toll gate while engineers survey the road
As you can see from the illustration, the road engineers built
gates across the entrance of the roads
and then toll keepers collected tolls from people using the roads. People were charged different tolls depending on the method of transport they were using. This money was then meant to be used to maintain the roads.
Some trusts did maintain their roads and

For example, during the Rebecca Riots in Wales (1842-44) rioters dressed as women burned down toll keepers' cottages and tollgates in protest at road tolls.

It is not easy to picture this without drawing a sketch. Have a look at the diagram below:
A has an x-coordinate of 1. B has an x-coordinate of 4. So, to get from A to B, we move along 3 units.
A has a y-coordinate of 1. B has a y-coordinate of 5. So, to get from A to B, we move up 4 units.
We have created a right-angled triangle. So to find the length of AB we use Pythagoras theorem.

729,"This Revision Bite will help you understand the different types of production costs and how to calculate them.
A manufacturing company's production department will need to consider the quality and quantity of a product in relation to cost. If a firm wants to make a profit, it has to know what it is spending as well as what it is earning. Here are some of the costs it needs to know to do this:
Now look at each of these costs in more detail:
These costs do not change however many units of a product are made. Factory rent, insurance premiums and administration salaries stay the same, whether the factory is working at full capacity or producing nothing. The owner of the business may have taken out a loan to buy equipment or refurbish a building. The loan will have to be repaid whether or not the business has customers.
the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process
changes. For example, the amount of raw materials needed varies as the levels of output go up or down.
The employee is paid according to the number of units produced.
wages also fluctuate, depending on the employees' efficiency and the demand for the company's products.
The fixed costs and the variable costs are added together to establish the total costs. The fixed costs remain constant, but the variable costs increase in direct proportion with output.
The amount spent on producing one extra unit. It is the increase in total cost when one more unit is produced.
is a way of measuring how much more it will cost a company to make one more individual item. Here is an example:
A company produces compact discs. It has produced 99 CDs and the total costs have amounted to 999. If the total costs increase to 1,000 when the hundredth CD is made the marginal cost of the last CD is 1.00.
The firm knows that now each CD should cost only 1.00 or less to produce. As the cost per unit usually decreases with a rise in output, it should become cheaper to produce each one. The firm may be able to offer a more competitive price to customers.
The example of the CD shows the benefits of economies of scale, where mass production results in a lower unit cost. The reason is that the fixed costs do not change and are spread across a greater level of output.
The amount spent on producing each unit of output. It is calculated by dividing the total level of cost by the level of output.
helps a firm to monitor its progress, and makes it easier to set prices. It is calculated by dividing total cost by total output.
Using the example of the compact disc firm above:
This might seem expensive, but if the firm produces another hundred units at a marginal cost of 1.00 per CD, its average cost will fall radically:
The firm can use this information to decide whether it is worth accepting a new order for goods.
The examiner will want to see that you understand what the different costs are, how they are calculated, and why it is important for a firm to work them out. You will be expected to apply your understanding to a real life situation.
A company will always incur costs, no matter how efficient it is. Wages,

, transport and power all have to be paid for. The company needs to establish all its costs to ensure it doesn't lose money.
Read the case study and answer the question below
Martin and Ashley started their window cleaning business with 1,500 they borrowed from Ashley's dad, and a 550 bank loan. They used the money to buy a second hand van and cleaning equipment. Ashley's dad doesn't charge any interest. They pay him back 50 a month. They also have to pay the bank 50 a month over two years. They don't get many bookings in winter when the weather is bad. Martin and Ashley aim to pay themselves 50 a month each.
What costs do Martin and Ashley have to meet even when they have no customers? (10 marks)
When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page.
They have got to pay back the money they borrowed.
Jamie needs to give far more explanation. He should use business terms and show he understands what fixed costs are.
They have to pay Ashley's father each month, as well as the loan from the bank. They may have other costs, like the cleaning materials they buy to run their business.
Morag started her answer quite well, mentioning both loans which, as fixed costs, have to be repaid. The cleaning materials, however, form part of the variable, rather than the fixed costs.
Costs which have to be paid, regardless of the level of output, are called fixed costs. Martin and Ashley have the fixed costs of repaying Ashley's dad 50 a month, and they probably pay bank interest on the loan. Their pay is a fixed cost. They might want to consider paying themselves piece rate, to help their business survive. The road tax and insurance on the van are fixed costs they have to pay. They have already bought the van, so this is a sunk cost, and no longer a fixed cost they have to pay.
Rani's answer would probably get a A grade. She has answered the question well, and has shown she can use business terms like fixed costs. She has thought about the pay they only receive when they have the business, and correctly counted it as a fixed cost.
