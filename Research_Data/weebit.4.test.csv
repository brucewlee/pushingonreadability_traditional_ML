3698,"etwork) capable phone line can provide connection speeds of up to 64Kbps (single channel) or 128Kbps (dual channel) using a terminal adapter often referred to as an ISDN
a piece of hardware that connects a computer to the Internet
. The terminal adaptor removes the need to convert
data measured at discrete intervals, eg a digital watch typically moves from displaying one second to the next without displaying the values in-between
signals to analogue signals before theyre sent down the telephone line, this results in a more reliable
a computer's or another internet-enabled device's connection to the Internet
ine) provides connection speeds of up to 24
and uses a telephone line to receive and transmit
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
The speed that data can be transferred is dependent on a number of factors:
Phone lines were designed to carry voice signals - not data. Signal quality can vary between lines and whilst it doesnt affect voice signals, it
The distance between your house and the
a system of electronic components that connects telephone calls and has been adapted and expanded to facilitate connections to the Internet too
has an effect on the speed at which data is transferred. A distance of 4Km is considered the limit for ADSL technology, beyond which it may not work.
a device for connecting computers and other network capable devices together to form a network
Internet access over ADSL. This is usually provided by your
Internet Service Provider - needed in order to access the Internet, they also provide services such as web space and email
Phone calls can still be made whilst connected.
Cable companies do not use traditional telephone lines to provide broadband Internet access. They have their own
, a combination of co-axial copper cable and
cable that carries data transmitted as light
With their purposefully built infrastructure cable companies are able to provide speeds of up to 50Mbps - considerably faster than the highest available ADSL speed (24Mbps).
modem/router is needed for broadband Internet access over cable. This is usually provided by your ISP.
The making and receiving of phone calls is not affected because the telephone line is not used.

1375,"Martin Parr talks about why he loves using a camera and how he decides what to take and which photos to use.
Martin Parr was born in Surrey in 1952 and is an acclaimed documentary photographer and photo-journalist.
He studied at Manchester Polytechnic and since then has used photography and film to take a critical look at mass tourism, food and the family amongst other subjects.
Martin Parr still shoots in medium-format colour but has experimented with fill-in flash and a 35mm ringflash camera.
His work can be poignant and joyful at the same time and conveys his natural curiosity:
Photography is the simplest way of articulating how I feel about the world.
I don't crop my pictures. I just move in and out with my feet. So if I want to get closer I won't change lens I'll just get nearer to the subject.

4446,"of memorable, exaggerated, meaningful characters. You can look below at all the characters, but before you do go back through the plot and try to make your own notes about the characters featured here.
Pip is both the hero and narrator of the story, looking back reflectively on the lessons life has taught him. He is critical of the mistakes made by his younger self.
Dickens starts with Pip weeping for his dead family in the churchyard, establishing him as an orphan for whom we feel sorry and protective.
Pip is a good person. He steals a file and food for the convict, but feels guilty about it. He helps Herbert Pocket to get a job. He helps Magwitch, even though it means the end of his dreams of being a gentleman.
Pip's efforts to be a gentleman almost destroy him - he says horrible things to Biddy and is ashamed of Joe. But he maintains our sympathy because he hates himself for it.
Pip's 'training' to be a gentleman was merely learning to eat properly and wear the 'right' clothes - showing that at the time he mistakenly thought that being a 'gentleman' was about surface wealth and manners (when really it was about inner character and worth).
Two things 'save' Pip. Firstly, luck dashes his dreams. Secondly, those who love him stick by him.
In the end, Pip finds happiness in hard work, 'sufficient' income, and doing the decent thing. Pip is an autobiographical projection of Dickens himself. By 1860, Dickens' marriage had failed, and he had worries about his children, and his business. In
he tells us the conclusions of an older, wiser man with experience of setbacks - that happiness is not about being successful, but being good.
In the novel, Magwitch is a father-figure to Pip. (Remember that Dickens' own father was imprisoned.)
Although Magwitch is a convict and 'a fearful man', he is decent enough to take the blame for Pip's theft (which in those days was a hanging offence). This reflects the novel's theme that a real gentleman is not someone who has money and manners, but someone who does good.
In the churchyard where Pip begins his recollections, Magwitch - also an orphan - is first made 'aware of himself' stealing food. It is suggested to us that his poor start in life condemned him to a life as a criminal.
Because Magwitch is a criminal, Pip feels he cannot keep his money, so Magwitch's return means the end of Pip's fortune.
Although he is horrified to meet him at first, Pip comes to love Magwitch as a good and noble man. In the end, he brings the dying Magwitch happiness by telling him Estella is his daughter and that he (Pip) loves her.
Magwitch's story carries the social message of
: that poverty creates crime, and many criminals are decent people who are just unlucky.
is as much Magwitch's story as it is Pip's.
Miss Havisham is a mother-figure to Pip, but taunts and abuses him. (Remember that Dickens disliked his own mother.)
Miss Havisham is a purposefully 'unreal' character. Time has stood still for her: she wears fantastic clothing and looks like a waxwork. Many writers describe
as a 'fairy story', in which Miss Havisham plays the part of Pip's imperfect fairy god-mother.
Miss Havisham also supplies the 'silver fork' element of the novel - stories about rich people that fascinated the poor.
Miss Havisham is a connecting thread for the storyline:
She was swindled by Compeyson, which condemned his partner, Magwitch, to jail.
She adopted Magwitch's daughter, Estella, but encouraged her to break Pip's heart.
Her employment of Pip gives him his yearning to be a gentleman. But she pays for Pip to be apprenticed to a blacksmith, which is the cause of his dissatisfaction.
It is at Satis House that Pip first meets Jaggers, and it is this which leads him to guess, wrongly, that Miss Havisham is his secret
Someone that helps or supports a person or group, usually by offering financial aid.
In Chapter 38, Estella rejects not only Pip's love but also Miss Havisham's, and breaks both of their hearts.
At the end of the novel, Miss Havisham sees she has hurt Pip because she was hurt, and seeks his forgiveness.
In the end, Miss Havisham is consumed by fire (a Christian image of cleansing, as well as punishment).
Although she harms Pip, the reader forgives her because she is clearly psychologically damaged, repents of her actions and dies such a horrific death.
Her name means 'star' - which is associated with beauty and love, yet at the same time is cold, distant and unobtainable. Pip, in his desire to be a gentleman, is 'reaching for the stars', but doomed to fall short.
Perhaps Dickens associated Estella with his teenage, starlet lover Ellen Ternan (the 'ell' of Ellen is picked up in the name Estella). Did this give special vibrancy to his descriptions of Pip's yearning love?
Estella is beautiful and rich, but these are her only qualities. She is otherwise shallow and cruel.
Biddy is the opposite to Estella, who represents the shallowness of money and manners.
tells of how Pip is at first beguiled into wanting Estella, but discovers that Biddy is better.
The reader can forgive Estella because, like Miss Havisham (who trained her to hate men), she too is psychologically damaged. Also, she warns Pip from the start that she has a cold heart and will never love him. Pip's
In the final chapter, after Estella's unhappy marriage to the brutal Bentley Drummle, she tells Pip she has learned good character: ""I have been bent and broken but - I hope - into a better shape.""
On the advice of friends, and to make the book more popular, Dickens rewrote the ending to read: ""'I saw no shadow of another parting from her"" - allowing Pip and Estella to stay together.
Orlick is the irredeemably evil element in
- giving it a Gothic atmosphere of threat and foreboding.
Orlick's favourite phrases are: ""I'll be burned"" and ""I'll be jiggered (meaning 'caught on a sharp hook')"" - conjuring up violent and frightening images.
After Joe (who represents pure good) defeats Orlick in a fair fight, Orlick later creeps back and attacks Mrs Joe from behind (a cowardly and brutal act).
Orlick earns Pip's disgust when he 'dances at' (that is, makes eyes at) Biddy, which frightens her.
Throughout the story, Orlick resents and bullies Pip.
In Chapter 53, he lures Pip to the sluice-house, where he tries to kill him. This chapter is pure Victorian
A play or film characterised by exaggeratedly emotional or overdramatic scenes.
. Orlick - ""with a mouth snarling like a tiger's"" - has ceased to be a real person and become a fairytale 'villain'.
asserts that the middle-class virtues of cleanliness, kindness, hard work, temperance and gentleness make a true 'gentleman'. Some writers see Orlick as the middle-class fear of 'the masses' - dirty, cruel, lazy, drunken and violent.
shows how Pip is wrong to be ashamed of him, and how he comes to realise Joe's true worth.
, the opposite of Estella, is a kind and intelligent girl.
by Estella, but discovers Biddy is a better choice.
is cold, ruthless and unfeeling. He washes his hands continually (like Pilate in the Bible) to try to cleanse himself of the bad things he is doing. Dickens' portrayal of Jaggers shows he saw being a lawyer as a dirty business.
demonstrates the lesson of the novel: that it is better to be friends with good people who want to be friends with you, than to idolise those who do not want to be your friend.
- who is evil, like Orlick - is the cause of all the suffering in
, and receives his just desserts in the end.
is a fairly two-dimensional 'bad person'. Jaggers calls him ""the Spider"". Dickens gave him the name 'Bentley' as revenge on a publisher who had cheated him.
represents the very worst in middle-class Victorian England: he is affected, opinionated and hypocritical.
loves the sound of his own voice and is hilariously ridiculous. He follows his dream as much as Pip, and ends up acting in a pantomime.
teaches Pip how to be a gentleman. His wife Belinda is pretty and should have married 'well', but is an incompetent housekeeper. In Chapters 22-23, Mrs Pocket and her two nurses, Flopson and Millers, introduce some slapstick comedy (mostly at the expense of the poor baby).
At the end of the novel, Pip persuades Miss Havisham to leave her money to the decent Matthew Pocket, rather than her other 'friends', who only want her money.
is Jaggers' clerk. His main comic feature is having a mouth like a letterbox, which grows wider when he is stressed. At work, he is severe and formal. At his home (which he has converted into a mock-castle), he is kind and generous, and his mouth relaxes.

6002,"There are already ways in which we can reduce the air pollution caused by the burning of fuels, and others may be developed in the future. New applications that result from scientific research are subject to official regulations and laws.
Coal is an example of a fossil fuel
The fossil fuels include coal, natural gas and the products from the fractional distillation of crude oil, such as petrol and diesel. When any fossil fuel is burned, one of the combustion products is carbon dioxide.
amounts of fossil fuels have been burned each year. This has led to an increase in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air. Many scientists believe this is causing
Global warming refers to the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's surface. In the last 100 years it is believed to have risen by 0.6 degrees C. There are estimates that in the next 100 years, the global temperatures could rise by as much as 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.
One way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air is to burn
fossil fuels. Unfortunately, we depend on the burning of fossil fuels for heating, electricity generation and transport. If we are to burn less fossil fuels, we will need alternatives for these essential activities.
Clouds of smoke and other combustion products are emitted from chimneys
Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.
to produce electricity are one of the main contributors of carbon dioxide in the air.
One way to reduce the air pollution caused by power stations is to
. Some ways to do this are:
turning off lights when you leave a room
using a microwave instead of an electric oven
from 2006 about saving energy in the home.
Power stations give out sulfur dioxide which is a cause of
Acid rain is rain that contains a high level of acids. These acids can contaminate drinking water, damage plants and water creatures and buildings. It is believed to be caused by pollution and, maybe, natural activity such as volcanic eruptions.
. The amount of sulfur dioxide given off by a power station can be reduced by:
removing sulfur from natural gas and fuel oil
removing sulfur dioxide from the flue gases emitted by coal-burning power stations
Coal-powered stations give off solid particulates. These can also be removed from the flue gases.
Atmospheric pollution caused by the exhaust gases given out by motor vehicles can be reduced by:
Exhaust gases given out by motor vehicles causes atmospheric pollution
burning less fuel by having more efficient engines
using catalytic converters, which convert nitrogen monoxide to nitrogen and oxygen, and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide

7418,"Gases such as hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia and chlorine can be made using chemical reactions. These gases are collected in different ways, depending upon their density and solubility in water. They can be identified using different tests.
If a gas is less dense than air, it is often more convenient to collect it in a gas jar or test tube by upward delivery. The gas produced in a chemical reaction is passed through a delivery tube into the gas jar, where it rises and takes up the space at the top of the jar - pushing the air in the jar down, and out at the
This works well for hydrogen and ammonia, which are both less dense than air. The equipment must be used in a fume cupboard when ammonia is collected, because ammonia is harmful and has a sharp, choking smell.
If a gas is denser than air, it is often more convenient to collect it in a gas jar or test tube by downward delivery. The gas produced in a chemical reaction is passed through a delivery tube into the gas jar, where it sinks and pushes the air out of the
This works well for carbon dioxide and chlorine, which are both denser than air. The equipment must be used in a fume cupboard when chlorine is collected, because chlorine is toxic and has a sharp, choking smell.
Sometimes gases are collected over water. The gas produced in a reaction is bubbled through a trough of water and into an upturned gas jar filled with water. The bubbles of gas collect in the top of the gas jar and push the water out of the bottom. If enough gas is produced it completely replaces the water in the gas jar. A glass lid is then slid under the gas jar, which is then removed from the trough of water and turned the right way up.
This works well for insoluble gases such as hydrogen, or gases that do not dissolve easily in water, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. Ammonia and chlorine are readily soluble in water and are not collected this way.
You need to know how to collect gases produced in reactions by upward and downward delivery, over water and using a gas syringe. You need to be able to explain the method of collection if you are given information about the density and solubility of the gas concerned.
The table summarises the ways in which hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia and chlorine may be collected. Note that all these gases may be collected using a gas syringe.
You need to know how to test for hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia and chlorine.
A lighted wooden splint makes a popping sound in a test tube of hydrogen.
A glowing wooden splint relights in a test tube of oxygen.
A lighted wooden splint goes out in a test tube of carbon dioxide but this happens with other gases, too. It is better to bubble the test gas through limewater - calcium hydroxide solution. Carbon dioxide turns limewater cloudy white.
Ammonia has a characteristic sharp, choking smell. It also makes damp red litmus paper turn blue. Ammonia forms a white smoke of ammonium chloride when hydrogen chloride gas, from concentrated hydrochloric acid, is held near it.
Chlorine has a characteristic sharp, choking smell. It also makes damp blue litmus paper turn red, and then bleaches it white. Chlorine makes damp starch-iodide paper turn blue-black.

2681,"Different species compete to survive and breed. The size of a predator population depends on the size of the prey population, and the reverse is true as well. Mutualism benefits both species involved in the relationship, but parasitism only benefits the parasite, not the host.
Habitats have limited amounts of the resources needed by living organisms. Organisms must
with others in order to get enough of these resources to survive. If they are unsuccessful and cannot move to another habitat, they will die.
Some of the resources that animals compete for:
Animals may also compete for mates so that they can reproduce.
Remember that plants make their own food using
photosynthesis is the process where green plants use water and carbon dioxide and sunlight to produce carbohydrates (stored energy) and release oxygen (as a by-product).
, so they do not compete for food. Here are some of the things that plants do compete for:

3857,"We often use formulas without even noticing. For example, we might convert miles to km by multiplying by 1.6, or find the circumference of a circle by multiplying pi by the diameter.
km = 1.6 x miles is an example of a formula.
We have already seen that km = 1.6 x miles and C =
 d are examples of formulas. There are many others that we use regularly in other subjects. Sometimes we have to construct our own formula:
A taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00. Write down a formula for the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles.
Travelling 1 mile would cost 2 + 50p.
Travelling 2 miles would cost 2 + 2 x 50p.
Travelling 3 miles would cost 2 + 3 x 50p.
So travelling for 'n' miles will cost 2 + n x 50p.
The formula is C = 2 + (n x 50p)
A rectangle has a width of x and a length of 2x.
Write down a formula for the perimeter (P) in terms of x.
P = 2x + x + 2x + x
Did you remember to include all 4 sides?
To recap, the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles, when a taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00 is:-
C = 2 + (n x 50p)
To find the cost of the taxi for a journey of 20 miles, replace 'n' with 20.
C = 2 + (20 x 50p)
What is the cost of hiring this taxi for 16 miles?
Remember that C = 2 + (16 x 50p)
The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.
r, so we divide both sides by 2
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c
Rearrange the formula to make 'c' the subject.
[To work this out: y = mx + c, so subtract mx from both sides.]

6813,"There are three main production methods used in manufacturing: one-off, batch and mass production.
, this is where a single item is required - for example a suspension bridge or a custom-made engine for a racing car. The unit cost is high for this method, as the production system needs to be changed for each different unit.
This occurs where quantities of an item are sold regularly - for example a local baker producing many batches of specialist loaves each day for sale in local shops. Batch production will involve producing and storing the components which will make up the end product, eg the batch production of
Products that sell in high volume, nationally or internationally, are manufactured on production or assembly lines. The initial set-up cost (or capital investment) of mass production is high, due to the specialist equipment used - but the cost is spread across a very large number of products, so the
is low. When a mass-production line runs continuously round the clock, it is called

3877,"Owen's anti-war sentiments contrast starkly with the work of other poets.
Owen makes clear to the reader that he is unconvinced by the rhetoric of previous poets who have declared the glory of dying in war. Poems such as Tennyson's
offer a final message of glory and bravery, with sacrifice for one's country a noble and desirable end. Wilfred Owen's poem
rejects 'The old Lie'. Owen experienced war, and so his poems are more closely reflective of the views of the serving soldiers.

6222,"""he was a skinny, vivid little boy, with a glance coming up from under a hut of straight hair that hung down, black and course""
""He walked with an accustomed tread through the fruit trees""
The first time we meet Simon, he is in his choir robes. He faints on the beach because of the heat and Jack mocks him. We know he is delicate. He has epilepsy.
""a skinny, vivid little boy, with a glance coming up from under a hut of straight hair that hung down, black and course""
. His hair hides his face, which hints to us he is secretive.
He is imaginative: he sees the buds on the bushes as
He is helpful and works for the good of others; he is the only one to stick with Ralph to make the shelters. He is kind to the littluns and finds fruit for them.
The others recognise he is 'different' to them in some way. Ralph says
""a secret place in a clearing full of flowers and butterflies""
, and is sufficiently at one with the jungle to walk in it alone at night. He is at one with nature and he has no fear.
He seems able to prophesy - he is the first to suggest that
""You'll get back to where you came from""
He is the most perceptive about the beast. He says
""maybe there is a beast... What I mean is... maybe it's only us""
. He is the only one to see that the problems on the island stem from the boys' relationships with each other, not from an outside force. Yet nobody understands what he's trying to say.
When the Lord of the Flies 'speaks' to him this idea is reiterated: the voice in Simon's head says
""Fancy thinking the Beast was something you could hunt and kill!... You knew, didn't you? I'm part of you?""
He is killed just as he is about to reveal the truth. It is ironic that he is the only one who finds out that the 'beast' was a dead parachutist, but is denied passing on the message because the group of boys think, in their frenzy, he is the beast.
Simon's close relationship with nature seems to carry on even after he is dead:
"" The waves turned the corpse gently in the water. ... Softly, surrounded by a fringe of bright inquisitive creatures, itself a silver shape beneath the steadfast constellations, Simon's dead body moved out towards the open sea""

are the dominant factors in determining which crops will grow and which animals are suited to the landscape.
Arable farming is common in the south-east where the summers are warm and the land is low, flat and fertile. The south-east also has good transport links and farms are close to markets in towns and cities such as London.
Human factors such as finance and proximity to markets are important to market gardening. It is common in East Anglia where fruit, vegetables and flowers are grown.
Hill sheep farming takes place in the north and west of Britain in highland areas such as Snowdonia and the Lake District. There are cool summers and high rainfall. The climate and steep land make these areas unsuitable for growing crops.
Dairy farming is common in the south-west and the west of England where the climate is warm and wet. There are also good transport links and good access routes to markets in these areas. The land may be flat or hilly, but not too steep.
Mixed farming is found in areas where the climate and relief suit both crops and animals. It needs to be warm, but not too wet, and the soils need to be fertile and flat. Mixed farms need good transport links and accessibility to markets.

1066,"Fold mountains occur near convergent or compressional plate boundaries. Examples of fold mountains include the Alps, Rockies, Andes and Himalayas.
Where an area of sea separates two plates, sediments settle on the sea floor in depressions called geosynclines. These sediments gradually become compressed into sedimentary rock.
When the two plates move towards each other again, the layers of sedimentary rock on the sea floor become crumpled and folded.
Eventually the sedimentary rock appears above sea level as a range of fold mountains.
Where the rocks are folded upwards, they are called
. Where the rocks are folded downwards, they are called
. Severely folded and faulted rocks are called
High mountain ranges, eg Mont Blanc which is 4810m above sea level.
Contrasting microclimates on north facing (ubac) and south facing (adret) slopes.

1227,"There are already ways in which we can reduce the air pollution caused by the burning of fuels, and others may be developed in the future. New applications that result from scientific research are subject to official regulations and laws.
Coal is an example of a fossil fuel
The fossil fuels include coal, natural gas and the products from the fractional distillation of crude oil, such as petrol and diesel. When any fossil fuel is burned, one of the combustion products is carbon dioxide.
amounts of fossil fuels have been burned each year. This has led to an increase in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air. Many scientists believe this is causing
Global warming refers to the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's surface. In the last 100 years it is believed to have risen by 0.6 degrees C. There are estimates that in the next 100 years, the global temperatures could rise by as much as 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.
One way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air is to burn
fossil fuels. Unfortunately, we depend on the burning of fossil fuels for heating, electricity generation and transport. If we are to burn less fossil fuels, we will need alternatives for these essential activities.

1264,"The French Wars between 1793 and 1815 had a knock-on effect on British agriculture. The price of wheat soared when the French blockaded ships carrying supplies to Britian, but what were the social, economic and political effects of the French Wars on British agriculture?
Between 1793 and 1815 Great Britain went to war with France. British farmers experienced a time of
during the war because French wheat was no longer imported into Britain. This was because Napoleon was attempting to starve the country by stopping (blockading) ships delivering wheat to Britain.
Britain had not been able to grow enough food to feed the growing population under the open-field system. From 1750 onwards, the country had been forced to rely on
mainly from France to feed the population.
During the French Wars, the price of bread in Britain rose because there was not enough wheat coming from abroad.
made landowners and tenant farmers realise that if they could change their farming methods and grow more food, then they would be able to sell more wheat and make more profits.
During the French war, Britain relied on home-grown wheat
Effects of the French Wars on agriculture
The French Wars had social, economic and political effects on British agriculture:
- the British population almost doubled during the French Wars and this created a higher demand for food. During the war years, early wheat yields could not satisfy British demand and farmers had to change their farming methods to make a profit.
- landowners were certain that the more grain they produced, then the more profit they would make. They borrowed money from banks to improve their land and used new techniques, which increased their crop yields. Farmers paid high interest rates to get loans, but their profit made it worthwhile. The amount of British grain produced increased by 40 per cent during the French Wars.
- during the French Wars, the price of British bread rose much faster than wage increases. Rising food prices and the loss of common land caused by enclosures left squatters and labourers with hardly any food to survive on.
Remember - the French Wars made British landowners and tenant farmers very rich, but when the war ended, they became very worried that cheap grain exports would start to arrive from France once again. This would cost them money.
To help remember the effects of the French Wars try to sort them into the social, economic and political ways that they affected different areas of Britain:

6230,"The text in your exam may be quite long, like this one, so make sure to read it at least twice.
When you are required to fill in word gaps in your exam, remember to begin by filling in the easiest of the gaps, so that when you get to the harder ones you have fewer words to choose from.
Read the sentences with the gaps very carefully, word by word, so you know exactly what they mean.

678,"Humans grow at different rates at different stages in their lives. Growth is very rapid in the womb and in the first two years of life. Puberty is another stage when growth and development is rapid.
Dependent on others for food and care
Peak health and fitness but no increase in height
Human gestation is around 40 weeks although infants can survive if born earlier than this. Other mammals have different gestation times depending on their size, the number of offspring and how independent they are when born. Large animals with a small number of independent offspring have the longest gestation.
When humans are born, their heads are relatively large, and their legs relatively short. Through childhood their bodies grow faster than their heads until they reach maturity. To check that development is happening at normal rates, infants regularly have their mass and head circumference measured.

2503,"If tourism is to be sustainable then the impacts on local people, the economy and the environment need to be balanced. To achieve this there needs to be cooperation between different interest groups. In The Lake District, this includes:
The National Trust (who own a proportion of the land).
Possible strategies to achieve sustainable tourism could be:
Restricting the number of cars and visitors  although this would have an impact on income from tourism.
Fundraising to repair damage done to the natural environment and footpaths  but who should pay?
Education of local people and tourists about sustainable tourism  but who will pay for this?
Underpinning any sustainable strategy is the successful involvement of the local people. With their cooperation, positive outcomes are far more likely.

It is vital that you test your webpages in different web browsers.
If you are building a webpage in a package such as Dreamweaver, you can preview your page in different browsers within the package.
You can download a number of browsers using the useful links below.
You must consider bandwidth when you are designing your images. If you are designing a website with lots of images, it is important to think about how long these images will take to download to a user's
an application used to browse the Internet or view web pages
The higher the bandwidth, the faster the images will download. Large image files can take up a lot of
Bandwidth measures the amount of data that can transfer through a communications channnel over a given period of time.
, so it is important to reduce the file size of your images when saving them to use on a webpage. A

The fineness of detail that can be seen in an image - the higher the resolution of an image, the more detail it holds. It is measured in dots per inch (dpi).
of the image, the clearer it will be. You should aim to use the highest possible resolution. You must be careful though, as an image with a high resolution will often take longer to display, due to the large file size.
You should also consider where the image will be seen. Will it be projected onto a screen? Will it be viewed from a computer screen? Will it be on a TV screen? How big will the display be?
of the screen. The aspect ratio is the ratio of the
of the screen. A standard television, for example, has an aspect ratio of 4:3, while a widescreen television has an aspect ratio of 16:9.

5734,"In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!

7357,"In Unit 1, you will devise drama from the
you have been presented with. In Unit 2, you may be asked to devise drama based upon the
a piece of work your group has devised.
This Revision Bite will help you understand the
of devising a piece of drama work.
Imagine you've been set a piece of work titled '
things that set off a reaction in the nervous system - for example, light, heat, sound, gravity, smell, taste, or temperature. The singular is stimulus
of a piece of drama is very important. .
Imagine your drama opens with three characters on stage, each with an opening line:
Character 1: I was 18 the first time I drove a car, that was when my dad gave me my first lesson.
Character 2: The first time I drove a car was on my 17th birthday - my parents had bought me a series of driving lessons.
Character 3: The first time I drove a car was when I was 15, and me and my mates stole one - it was also the last time I drove one anywhere.
'. The first statement is clear. The second statement is similar to the first one and sets up the audience expectation for the third statement. The third statement starts off following the pattern set, but then brings in a
that gives the audience a bit of a shock.
In what way would you stage the opening of this piece of drama using the short piece of script above? See the next page for ideas.

5878,"Club dance music of the late 20th and 21st centuries has many different forms, including drum and bass, hip-hop, garage, R and B, trip-hop, house, rave, techno, ambient and europop. You won't have to know all the differences between these styles, but you will need to be able to pick out the main musical elements and comment on the use of technology in GCSE questions.
Club dance music always makes use of technology. In particular :
: where a pattern, usually in the bass or drum part, is repeated constantly.
: where a voice or a sound clip has been processed by a computer to distort it.
, an echo effect on the voice, and
, where the voice is given a synthesised effect.
: a DJ technique where the hand is put on the vinyl disc and moved backwards and forwards on the turntable.
: This is a process on the computer where fast notes are automatically put into time by shifting the note to the nearest (usually) semiquaver. The effect of this is that the music is always completely in time with the beat.
: Where each part of the music (bass, drums, main vocal etc.) is recorded on its own track. It means, for example, that a singer can perform the main vocal and later perform the backing vocal as well (overdubbing).

212,"The formula for the relationship between currents in a transistor is
Determine the value of the emitter current (Ie) flowing through a transistor if the base current = 0.015 amps and the collector current = 0.16 amps.
Ie = Ib + Ic = 0.015 + 0.16 = 0.175 amps
The formula for calculating a transistor's current
the amount of amplification of the input voltage - ie how much bigger the output voltage is compared to the input voltage
A transistor has a current of 0.2 amps and 0.09 amps flowing through the collector and the base respectively. Determine the value of the current gain. Note that gain has no units because it is a ratio.

3582,"This Revision Bite is about how people communicate with each other in a business setting.
It will help you understand why communication is such an important issue and examines various methods of getting a message across in different situations.
Communicating means passing on information, or receiving it from somebody else. Imagine the problems that could occur if this is not done carefully. Here are some examples of what might go wrong:
Delivering the wrong items to a customer.
Delivering correspondence on the wrong date or to the wrong address.
Management using incorrect data when making decisions.

1173,"This modern story about conflict between a mother and her teenage daughter was published in 1991. The mother is the narrator of the story, so we only see things from her point of view.
""You're not here any longer so how can I speak to you?""
A woman who is deeply upset lies in her daughter's darkened bedroom. She clutches a pair of new white trainers that were a present for her daughter.
In the first sentence, we discover that the narrator is telling the story to another character - the daughter - but the daughter is not there to hear it. This style of writing is sometimes called a
An extended speech performed by one person only
, because there is only one character speaking or thinking.
Her 15-year-old daughter has run away from home. The woman worries that her daughter may have to beg for food to survive, or that she has been forced to become a prostitute.
We are told there was an argument between the father and daughter. Bad language was used on both sides.
The doctor has signed the narrator off work; she is taking medication. The mother aims to pretend to the outside world that everything is okay, but fears her daughter may be dead, or at least living on the streets.
We learn more about the argument. The daughter is brought home drunk at 3am. The father calls her a 'dirty slut'.

Temperature is how hot or cold something is, for example the atmosphere or the sea. Use a thermometer to see how many degrees Celsius/centigrade it is above or below freezing point (0 degrees C) .
Precipitation is the term given to moisture that falls from the air to the ground. In the UK, the most common form of precipitation is rain, but snow, hail, sleet, drizzle, fog, and mist are also precipitation.
Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. Air can only hold a certain amount of water before condensation and precipitation occurs. Humidity is measured as a percentage, relative to the saturation point where the air can hold no more water vapour (ie 100 % humidity).
Atmospheric pressure is the weight of air resting on the Earth's surface. Pressure is shown on a weather map with lines called isobars. Low pressure occurs when air is warm and rises. High pressure occurs when air becomes colder and sinks.

is the average weather conditions - temperature, pressure, precipitation and humidity - expected for a certain place. Climate is based on the average weather experienced over 30 years or more.
Climate refers to what is expected to happen in the atmosphere rather than the actual conditions. It is possible for the weather to be different from that suggested by the climate.
Climatic conditions in an area can be affected by the landscape, relief and activities taking place (both human and natural). Climate can alter over time and space.
Within a climatic region, the climate may vary from place to place - eg the top of a hill, the sunny side of a hill, the shaded side of a hill and the bottom of a hill. These areas with their small variations are called
The science of monitoring and studying the atmosphere and predicting its weather and climate is called

Temperatures drop the further an area is from the equator. Due to the curvature of the earth. In areas closer to the poles, sunlight has a larger area of atmosphere to pass through and the sun is at a lower angle in the sky. As a result, more energy is lost and temperatures are cooler.
In addition, the presence of ice and snow nearer the poles causes a higher
Albedo is a measure of how much sunlight a surface reflects.
. This means that more solar energy is reflected, also contributing to the cold.
Locations at a higher altitude have colder temperatures. Temperature usually decreases by 1 C for every 100m in altitude.
Oceans heat up and cool down much more slowly than land. This means that coastal locations tend to be cooler in summer and warmer in winter than places inland at the same latitude and altitude. Glasgow, for example, is at a similar latitude to Moscow, but is much milder.
. A warm ocean current called the
keeps Britain warmer and wetter than places in continental Europe.
The prevailing wind is the most frequent wind direction a location experiences. In Britain the prevailing wind is from the southwest, which brings warm, moist air from the Atlantic Ocean. This contributes to the frequent rainfall. When prevailing winds blow over land areas, it can contribute to creating desert climates.
The British Isles have variable weather that changes from day to day between different regions and within different regions. Consequently it is very difficult to predict or forecast the weather.
Britain has four distinct seasons of fairly equal length - spring, summer, autumn and winter. In winter it is colder and wetter and the days are shorter than in summer.
Different parts of the UK experience slightly different regional climates. These can be summarised as:
- cool summers, mild winters, heavy rain all year.
- cool summers, cold winters, steady rain all year.
- warm summers, mild winters, light rain all year, especially summer.
- warm summers, mild winters, heavy rain all year, especially winter.
The variability of weather and climate in different regions of the British Isles is due to the different air masses that meet over the Isles. Each air mass brings with them different characteristics, as shown in the map below.
Prevailing winds and climate zones in the UK
are greatest along the south coast of England (average of 1750 hours of sunshine per year) and are least in mountainous areas (average less then 1000 hours).
Scotland has shorter winter days and longer summer days than the rest of the UK, because it is further north. In the north of Scotland there are four more hours of daylight in mid-summer than in London.
On average it rains one in three days in the UK. However, rainfall varies greatly from region to region. It is generally wetter in the west than the east and wetter in the highlands than the lowlands. The wettest place is Snowdonia in Wales (average annual totals exceeding 3000 mm of rain a year), followed by the Highlands of Scotland, the Lake District, the Pennines and the moors of southwest England.
Parts of the east, such as East Anglia, receive less than 700 mm a year.
In most places in the UK it will rain twice as much in winter months as in summer months. Although in central and south-eastern England, and parts of southeast Scotland, July and August are often the wettest months of the year. In London and Birmingham it will thunder on average 15 days a year, compared to less than 10 elsewhere in the UK.
Average temperatures in UK are warmer at lower

and colder at higher altitudes. Average yearly temperatures at low altitude vary from 7C in The Shetlands, in northern Scotland, to 11C on the southwest coast of England. The coldest (and highest) place is Ben Nevis - altitude: 1344m - where the average temperature is less than 0C.
The coldest months are January and February and the warmest are July and August. In summer Scotland will be about three degrees cooler than England. The average daily maximum temperature at Glasgow in July is 19C compared with 22C in London.
Scotland tends to be worse affected by severe weather than the rest of the UK. Snow is more common in highland regions than in lowland areas, so while snow might fall on the south west of England less than 10 days a year, it will fall on the peaks of the Cairngorm Mountains over 100 days a year.
Gale-force winds (winds of more than 34 knots or 17.2 metres per second) are most commonly caused by
In meteorological terms, a depression is an area of low air pressure.
travelling across the Atlantic Ocean. These depressions may pass close to or over Scotland, with Orkney and Shetland experiencing the strongest winds. Occasionally they can reach hurricane force, eg the storm in October 1987.
Climate graphs show average rainfall and temperatures typically experienced in a particular location. The temperature is shown on a line graph, and rainfall on a bar graph. They are usually represented on the same set of axes with the months of the year along the base.
Look at the shape of the graph. Is the temperature line steep or gentle? Does it change throughout the year and/or look almost flat?
Look for extremes  quote the highest and lowest temperature and rainfall and the month in which it occurs. Remember to quote units, eg Celsius or millimetres.
Can you identify the seasons when most rain or least rain falls? Or when the highest and lowest temperatures are experienced?
Work out the temperature range by subtracting the lowest figure from the highest figure.
Add the rainfall totals for each month together to work out the total annual rainfall.
Have a go at describing these climate graphs:

5973,"William Blake: The Little Boy Lost / The Little Boy Found
is about a boy walking with his father through marshy land at night. He becomes separated from his father and is obviously in danger. Even the
that might have provided him with some light disappears, so he is left alone in total darkness.
is about the finding of the lost boy, who has been following a 'wandr'ing light'. God appears and leads him back to his mother, who has been searching for him. Strangely, she was searching for him in the dale, not the fen. This could be interpreted as meaning she was in the wrong place and would not have found him without God's help.

1588,"Setting up home on the Plains was not an easy option for those considering a new start in life in the middle of the 19th century. But there were
desperate (or adventurous) people prepared to overlook the difficulties.
Before 1860, few people moved west to try to settle on the Great Plains. The poor soil and harsh climate discouraged them (along with the fact that the Plains were officially 'Indian territory'), land was expensive to buy, and anybody wanting to go west faced a long, dangerous and uncomfortable journey.
After 1865, thousands of settlers moved onto the Plains.
went there to start a new life as freemen, or to escape economic problems after the Civil War.
flooded onto the Great Plains, seeking political or religious freedom, or simply to escape poverty in their own country.
from the eastern seaboard - where the population was growing and land was becoming more expensive - went because it was a chance to own their own land.
- such as tradesmen and government officials - who hoped to make their living from the farmers who had moved onto the Plains.

For your exam, you will need to feel confident when dealing with fractions. This section will help you to recognise equivalent fractions and practise simple calculations.
It is easy to add fractions when the numbers on the bottom are the same.
All you need to do is add the tops of the fractions together.
Sometimes you need to cancel down the answer to its simplest terms.
When the numbers on the bottom are not the same to start with, you use equivalent fractions to make them the same.
The numbers on the bottom of the fractions are not the same. You can use equivalent fractions to make them both equal 20.
You subtract using the same methods you use for adding.
8 and 10 both divide into 40. So re-write the fractions using 40 as the number on the bottom of each one.

5139,"Most tasks allow you to write or talk about how language is used in the play. So imagine your title is: 'How does Beatrice change during the course of
?' There are all sorts of references you can make to language:
When we first meet Beatrice, she seems to be a clever, independent woman. She speaks openly, not waiting to be asked, and seems to like making fun of Benedick in particular. She compares him with ""a disease"", and her repartee makes even the messenger afraid of her. Throughout the play she uses puns, such as saying Claudio is ""civil as an orange"". This shows her witty nature, because she plays on the similarity between ""civil"" and ""Seville"": he is either polite or bitter (just like the oranges from Seville).
This combines much of what we have covered so far. It starts to answer the question without filling up the page with irrelevant facts, plot details and fancy technical terms. Remember, you do not have to tick off the language terms like a trainspotter. Instead, show you appreciate some of the techniques Shakespeare used, and the effects they have on his audience.

For your exam, you will need to feel confident when dealing with fractions. This section will help you to recognise equivalent fractions and practise simple calculations.
It is easy to add fractions when the numbers on the bottom are the same.
All you need to do is add the tops of the fractions together.
Sometimes you need to cancel down the answer to its simplest terms.
When the numbers on the bottom are not the same to start with, you use equivalent fractions to make them the same.
The numbers on the bottom of the fractions are not the same. You can use equivalent fractions to make them both equal 20.
You subtract using the same methods you use for adding.
8 and 10 both divide into 40. So re-write the fractions using 40 as the number on the bottom of each one.
To multiply fractions, you need to multiply the top numbers together, and multiply the bottom numbers together. Remember that you cannot cancel numbers that are both on the top of a fraction. Have a look at the example below.
OR cancel between the top and the bottom then multiply:
The 5s do not cancel because they are both on the top of the fraction.
Dividing a fraction by a whole number
of the original fraction, which would make the answer
The rule to remember when dividing fractions is that you
turn the fraction you are dividing by upside down, and multiply.
So going back to the previous example we can work this out by turning the

3552,"Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. Attitude can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
A good way to decide on the tone of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
Angrily, to show the poet's attitude to the fact that nothing has changed?
Or in a resigned way, as if he knows that it's almost too much to hope that things can change?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
Tatamkhulu Afrika wrote this about his poem:
Nothing's Changed is entirely autobiographical. I can't quite remember when I wrote this, but I think it must have been about 1990. District Six was a complete waste by then, and I hadn't been passing through it for a long time. But nothing has changed. Not only District Six... I mean, we may have a new constitution, we may have on the face of it a beautiful democracy, but the racism in this country is absolutely redolent. We try to pretend to the world that it does not exist, but it most certainly does, all day long, every day, shocking and saddening and terrible.
Look, I don't want to sound like a prophet of doom, because I don't feel like that at all. I am full of hope. But I won't see it in my lifetime. It's going to take a long time. I mean, in America it's taken all this time and it's still not gone... So it will change. But not quickly, not quickly at all.

3485,"There are four main types of industrial production -
production - which have progressively larger scales of operation. ICT is now important in virtually every type of commercial design and production, with different types of computer-control of design and making processes grouped together as
Computer Aided Design - a system which helps the user produce accurate drawings.
The different production methods may have different design requirements, but most commercial designers have three roles: a
relating to the performance of a product - its 'fitness for purpose'
relating to shape, style, colour, pattern and other aspects of a product's visual appeal
role and an organisational role. Designers need to be aware of the standards and conventions which regulate industrial design practices.
There are four main types of industrial production methods:
is when only one product is made at a time. As every product is different, one-off production is labour intensive. Products may be made by hand or a combination of hand and machine methods.
is when a small quantity of identical products are made - from two up to about 100. Batch production may also use a lot of labour, but jigs and templates are used to aid production. Batches of the product can be made as often as required. Often the machines can be easily changed to produce a batch of a different product.
production is when hundreds of identical products are made, usually on a production line. Mass production often involves the assembly of a number of sub-assemblies of individual components. Some parts may be bought from other companies. There is usually some automation of tasks (eg by using
the use of computers to control cutting and shaping machines. CNC for short
machines) and this enables a smaller number of workers to ouput more products.
production is when many thousands of copies of identical products are made. The difference between this and mass production is that the production line is kept running 24 hours a day, seven days a week to maximise production and eliminate the extra costs of starting and stopping the production process. The process is highly automated and few workers are required.
Computer-aided design and making are nowadays commonplace in industry. ICT is most often used in mass production, as computer control makes it possible to produce many identical items very quickly. But ICT is also useful in small batch and even one-off work, as computer control also enables complicated shapes to be produced more accurately than by hand.
The box summarises the many roles of ICT in industry:
Data can be stored electronically and retrieved easily.
Designs can be modelled on-screen and viewed from any angle.
Reaction to outside forces, such as wind flow and pressure can be modelled.
""Zoom"" facilities can allow for the whole product or one detail to be easily seen.
Libraries of standard components can be stored electronically and integrated into new designs.
Control sequences can be simulated before working on the actual material.
CNC (Computer Numerical Control) manufacturing is usually more accurate.
You need to know and understand a number of terms used to describe aspects of ICT in design and production. They are:
Different production methods - eg, one-off, batch, and mass or continuous production - have somewhat different design requirements, related to the differences between types of product, client expectation, and the scale of operation. In particular there are differences in the relationship between the designer and the
person or organisation that wants a product manufactured - eg a retailer.
, who gives the designer his or her brief.
individual. Individual products may be made by hand or a combination of hand and machine methods. As every product is different, one-off production is labour intensive.
production the designer is frequently the maker as well. The client is usually the end-user of the product, and will have high expectations about the quality of the product. The designer will nearly always have a direct relationship with the client, so it is essential that the designer is fully conversant with the end-user's requirements.
production method for making a small quantity (between two and about 100) identical products.
production the process of designing is more formalised, but the number of people involved may still be quite small. The client may be the user, but is more likely to be another company who sell the product. The designer will not necessarily have any contact with the end-user of the product.
production method for making hundreds of identical products, usually on a production line. Also called repetitive flow production.
production method for making many thousands of identical products. The difference between this and mass production is that the production line is kept running 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
flow production the processes of designing and manufacturing are much more formal. Making of changes can become slower. There is little or no contact between the designer and the client. The designer is therefore dependent on other people feeding back the end-users' views.

Market research is the gathering of data or information concerning consumer opinions about a product or service
is about telling people about a new or improved product, and/or persuading them to buy it. Advertising can take many forms, including:
direct mail (ads sent out in the form of leaflets, mail shots, emails and texts)
Industrial design and manufacturing processes of products must conform with the following

guidelines or specifications which are widely agreed and commonly accepted, but do not necessarily have the force of law
, designed to protect consumers from inferior, misleading or unsafe goods and services:
law which protects consumers where the following are not acting in their interest: monopolies, where businesses have 25 percent of the market, mergers, where two companies plan to join together, and rogue traders, where the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) will take action against persistent offenders. In 2003 the Enterprise Act replaced the Fair Trading Act.
law which protects the public by: prohibiting the manufacture and supply of unsafe goods, making the maker or seller of defective products pay for damage it causes and allows councils to seize or suspend the sale unsafe goods.
law which makes it an offence for a trader to make false or misleading statements about goods or services. The Act carries criminal penalties and is enforced by local authorities' Trading Standards Officers.

Conventions are ways of doing things - for example, technical drawings - which conform to a common standard. Using conventions saves time and ensures that a drawing means the same thing to anyone who sees it. The BSI standard for drawings is

How does the relationship between Eddie and Catherine change during the first act of the play? Give reasons for your answer.
Explain the background to the relationship and show what the relationship is like at the start of the play.
Para 2 - The relationship at the start of the play
Discuss Eddie's reaction to Catherine's new skirt and her new job, and what this shows about his feelings for her.
You could also mention Beatrice's view of the relationship at his point - she gives us the first hints that Eddie is over-protective.
Para 3 - Impact of Rodolpho's arrival
Discuss how the arrival of Rodolpho immediately changes the state of Eddie's feelings for Catherine. As she becomes more attracted to Rodolpho, Eddie becomes more desperate to prevent his rival taking Catherine away from him.
Para 4 - Contrast Eddie's and Catherine's feelings for each other
Comment on the difference between Catherine's innocent fondness for Eddie and his shameful love for her. Give examples to show how we know what each of them is feeling.
You could also mention Alfieri's view of Eddie's love and how Alfieri understands it was impossible for Eddie to control.
Para 5 - Fight at end of Act I
Examine the fight at the end of Act I when Catherine makes it clear that she loves Rodolpho more than Eddie. How does this prepare us for Act II?
Look forward to what will happen in Act II. Briefly summarise how what we have learnt about the relationship so far prepares us for the fatal ending.

141,"> Measures - Speed, distance and time
Speed is worked out by dividing the distance travelled by the time taken:
If you travel at 70 km in 2 hours. What is your average speed?
Speed = 70  2 = 35 km/h
The distance in km and the time in h, so the units for speed are km/h.
If you know the speed, you can work out the time or the distance by re-arranging the equation.
hours at an average speed of 4 miles/h. How far will you have walked?
Distance = 4  1.5 = 6 miles

278,"Behaviour can be investigated in the field or in the laboratory.
It can be observed and measured, and experiments can be designed to test how it works.
Human behaviour is affected by many variables. It can be more difficult to study than the behaviour of other animals.
Fieldwork does not always mean you have to work in a field. It means investigations that take place outside the laboratory.
Some scientists spend many hours watching and studying the behaviour of animals. They may be interested in how the animals live alone, group into families or form large groups such as herds.
Scientists can tag sharks to study their behaviour.
Animals can signal to each other. For example, they may call to each other to warn of danger. Some scientists are interested in such signals. They record and study them to try to work out what the signals mean.
Some animals migrate over large distances to find food or nesting sites.
Animals can be tagged by attaching tracking devices to them. Tagging lets scientists follow the journeys the animals make.
The work of Lorentz and Pavlov has been mentioned in this Revision Bite. These scientists studied animal behaviour under controlled conditions.
The behaviour of woodlice is often studied in schools. Several woodlice are put into a choice chamber with four different conditions:
The woodlice are left on their own for a while, and then the number of animals in each quarter is counted. Woodlice prefer dark and damp conditions. The quarter of the choice chamber with these conditions contains most or all of the woodlice.

79,"The following table shows the times of the buses from Cambridge to Duxford and Whittlesford:
a) I want to go to the Duxford Imperial War Museum. Which bus should I catch from Cambridge?
b) The 0805 from Cambridge is running 6 minutes late. What time does it reach Pampisford?
c) If I arrive in Sawston at 0932, what time do I leave Cambridge?
d) How long does the journey from Great Shelford to Duxford Wheatsheaf take?
a) The only bus which goes to the Imperial War Museum leaves Cambridge at 0835.
b) The 0805 usually arrives in Pampisford at 0838. So if it's running 6 minutes late it will arrive at 0844.
d) The bus leaves Great Shelford at 0722 and arrives at Duxford Wheatsheaf at 0745. So it takes 23 minutes.

1. This is an extract from the Anthony Shea Community School newsletter:
During the past three years, mobile phones have become more and more popular. Growing numbers of our students bring them to school, and parents encourage this as they can stay in touch with their children and know they are safe. However, many of our students keep their phone on during the day which can disturb lessons. A number of phone thefts have also occurred recently, both in and out of school. I would like to call a meeting to discuss this issue with staff, parents and students. I don't want to ban them, but we must agree on how they can be used sensibly and safely.
Write a speech to be given at this meeting analysing the advantages and disadvantages of allowing mobiles in school and suggest how they can be used sensibly and safely.
2. Read this extract, which considers the issue of horror movies:
As a parent, I have constant battles over TV and films. My children feel they should be allowed to watch whatever they want, no matter how violent, gory or creepy. They say it's just entertainment, and that it has no effect on them. I don't agree! Many of the films are rated 18, and my oldest is 14. I'm afraid my kids will become more aggressive and uncaring towards people, or that they might end up seeing something which really disturbs them.
Write an article for your school magazine commenting on why horror movies are popular with teenagers and explaining the advantages and disadvantages of parents banning them at home.

337,"The environment, the Earth and the universe
The weathering of rocks by chemicals is called chemical weathering. Rainwater is naturally slightly acidic because
from the air dissolves in it. Minerals in rocks may react with the rainwater, causing the rock to be weathered.
Some types of rock are easily weathered by chemicals. For example,
are made of a mineral called calcium carbonate. When acidic rainwater falls on limestone or chalk, a chemical reaction happens. New soluble substances are formed in the reaction. These are washed away and the rock is weathered.
Chemical weathering can hollow out caves form and make cliffs fall away.
are hard rocks that are weathered only slowly. Still some of their minerals do react with the acids in rainwater to form new, weaker substances that crumble and fall away.
When fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas are burned,
escape into the air. These dissolve in the water in the clouds and make the rainwater more acidic than normal. When this happens, we call the rain '
Acid rain makes chemical weathering happen more quickly. Buildings and statues made from rock are damaged as a result. This is worse when the rock is limestone rather than granite. Acid rain also kills trees and fish.

535,"> Linear sequences - Finding the nth term
Linear sequences - Finding the nth term
Sometimes, rather than finding the next number in a linear sequence, you want to find the 41
Writing out 41 or 110 numbers takes a long time, so you can use a general rule.
To find the value of any term in a sequence, use the n
1st = 5 (5  1); 2nd = 10 (5  2); 3rd = 15 (5  3)
term is 5  n or 5n
term, work out 5  10 = 50. To find the 7
term, work out 5  7 = 35
term is 5  41 = 205 and the 110
term is 5  110 = 550
term of this sequence: 2, 4, 6, ... ?
term = 20. To work this out, n = 10, so 2n = 2  10 = 20

224,"A food chain shows the different organisms that live in a habitat, and what eats what.
A food chain always starts with a producer, which is an organism that makes food. This is usually a green plant, because plants can make their own food by photosynthesis.
A food chain ends with a consumer, which is an animal that eats a plant or another animal. Here is an example of a simple food chain:
Take care - the arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating. If you get the arrows the wrong way round, instead of showing that humans eat cows, you are showing that cows eat humans, and that grass eats cows.
There are several words used to describe the organisms in a food chain. Study this food chain:
The plant is the producer and the animals are consumers.
Notice that the first consumer in the chain is also called the primary consumer, the next one is the secondary consumer and the one after that is the tertiary consumer.
A consumer that eats plants is called a
, and a consumer that eats other animals is called a
is an animal that eats both plants and animals.
A predator is an animal that eats other animals, and the prey is the animal that gets eaten by the predator. In the food chain above:
the frog is a predator and the grasshopper is its prey.
the hawk is a predator and the frog is its prey.

471,"> Food chains - Toxic materials in the food chain
Food chains - Toxic materials in the food chain
Toxic materials are poisonous. Some quickly break down into harmless substances in the environment. Others are
and do not break down. Instead, they accumulate in the food chain and damage the organisms in it, especially the top predators.
Mercury compounds were used until quite recently to make
(chemicals that kill the insects that damage crops) and special
that stop barnacles growing on the hulls of ships.
Unfortunately, when it gets into the food chain mercury damages the
of mammals, including humans. The diagram shows how mercury can accumulate in the food chain.
Tiny plankton in the sea absorb the mercury compounds. When the plankton are eaten by small fish, the mercury they contain stays in the fish. As the fish need to eat a lot of plankton, the concentration of mercury in them becomes higher than its concentration in the plankton.
The small fish are eaten by larger fish, and these are eaten by still larger ones, such as tuna fish. This creates a high concentration of mercury in the tuna. People eating contaminated tuna may get mercury poisoning. Mercury is now banned from many chemical products and mercury use in industry is carefully regulated.
DDT is an insecticide that can pass up the food chain from insects to small birds, and then from the small birds to birds of prey, like hawks. It can accumulate in the birds of prey, giving them a large amount of DDT. Concentrations of DDT in birds causes weakness in their eggs, and reduces their population. DDT is now banned because of this.

256,"> Decimals - Place value and ordering decimals
Decimals - Place value and ordering decimals
We use a decimal point to separate units from parts of a whole (like tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc).
0.1 is a tenth, 1/10 of a unit
0.01 is a hundredth, 1/100 of a unit
0.001 is a thousandth. 1/1000 of a unit
In 52.13, the value of the figure 1 is 1/10 , and the value of the figure 3 is 3/100.
When ordering numbers, always compare the left digits first.
Eg Which is greater, 2.301 or 2.32?
Both numbers have two units and three tenths, but 2.301 has no hundredths, whereas 2.32 has two hundredths. Therefore, 2.32 is greater than 2.301.
Another way to look at it is to add a zero to the end of 2.32 (this doesn't change its value as it's after the decimal point).
The two numbers are now 2.320 and 2.301 and it is quite easy to see that 2.320 is bigger (just as 2 320 is bigger than 2 301).
Q1. In the number 3.546, what is the value of the figure 4?
Q2. Place the following numbers in order, smallest first: 3.2, 3.197, 3.02, 3.19
A1. The value of the figure 4 is 4/100.
A2. Did you get 3.02, 3.19, 3.197, 3.2?
All the numbers have three units, so start by comparing the tenths. 3.02 has no tenths, 3.197 and 3.19 have one tenth, and 3.2 has two tenths. Therefore, 3.02 is the smallest and 3.2 is the largest.
You could also write the numbers as 3.020, 3.190, 3.197 and 3.200 and compare them.

97,"> Drama - Showing moods and emotions
Being able to recognise changes in mood and emotion in a script is important as you need to convey this to your audience.
Using these methods, decide how you would express the emotion of anger.
What happens to your face, body and voice when you feel angry? How do you walk when you're in a bad mood? Which gestures do you use to show someone you're angry with them?
Frown, tightly clenched jaw, a tight mouth or even bared teeth.
Tense shoulders, a swift and purposeful walk almost like a march.
Strong and forceful gestures. Perhaps even clenched fists.
Either very loud and out of control or very quiet and menacing.
Maybe if you're very angry you won't pause often, you'll talk very quickly without giving the other person a chance to talk. Or the pauses might be long - a deafening silence!
Now try this with other emotions, eg surprise, excitement, happiness, sadness. See how your body, face and voice change with each emotion.
Another way to practise emotions is to do mood walks - put all the elements together to develop a walk that represents each emotion, then greet (or growl at) people with the appropriate tone of voice.
Don't be such a drama queen! Try this activity.

185,"To multiply 237 by 4 without using a calculator, you can set it out like this:
Start with 4  7, which is 28, so write the 8 and carry the 2 to the tens column.
4  3 = 12, but remember to add the carried 2 to get 14. Write the 4 and carry the 1 to the hundreds column.
4  2 = 8, and we add the carried 1 to get 9.

533,"In algebra, a letter can be used to represent a number that you do not know. This gives us algebraic terms, like 2x and 5y.
When algebraic terms are put together by mathematical operations such as + and - we get an algebraic expression, like 2x + 5y +3z.
We can simplify algebraic expressions by collecting 'like terms'.

382,"> Magnets and electric current - Electromagnets
When an electric current flows in a wire it creates a magnetic field around the wire.
we can strengthen the magnetic field. Electromagnets are made from coils like this.
We can make an electromagnet stronger by doing these things:
The magnetic field around an electromagnet is just the same as the one around a bar magnet. It can, however, be reversed by turning the battery around.
Unlike bar magnets, which are permanent magnets, the magnetism of electromagnets can be turned on and off just by closing or opening the switch.

> Changes in the environment - Humans
Humans are very successful living things. We compete with other organisms for many natural resources. These include:
The worlds population of humans is increasing all the time. In the year 1800 it was about
, and now it is more than
More people mean more use of natural resources, and bigger changes to the environment. The graph shows population growth over the last 200 years.
Humans use machines to move large amounts of earth to make new roads and buildings. We straighten rivers and build walls to stop them flooding. In some countries, such as the Netherlands, land is reclaimed from the sea. Barriers are built and water is pumped out. New dry land forms for people to use.
We also large areas of land for quarries. These are large holes in the ground where rocks containing useful metals are taken out.
The environment is also changed when land is flooded to make reservoirs for drinking water or hydroelectric power schemes. The animals and plants that live in the forest or on the land lose their habitat. They may die out in that region as a result.
Humans have been cutting down trees for thousands of years. We do this to clear land for farming and building, and for wood to use as a fuel or building material.
as long as forests are allowed to replace themselves, or are replanted after felling, but often this is not done. The result is that the worlds forests are steadily shrinking.

Character - Using quotations and useful phrases
When quoting from a text, remember to:
Quotes of three words or less can be used in the sentence you're writing - for example ...
when the writer talks about the ""futility of life"" he means
Longer quotations need to be included on a line of their own and with a space before it (known as an indent).
Short, well-chosen quotations are better than long, vague ones.
Remember that certain words and phrases are helpful when you're explaining an idea in some detail, especially if you are commenting on implicit meaning. The following list shows some of those phrases.
Some other words and phrases that may be useful are those that help move your argument on. These are called connectives. Here are some examples:

. They do not melt, but the minerals they contain are changed chemically, forming

Metamorphic rocks may form from rocks heated by magma
Remember that metamorphic rocks are not made from melting rock. (Rocks that do melt form igneous rocks instead.)

566,"> Measures of average - The mean
The mean is the most common measure of average.
To calculate the mean add the numbers together and divide the total by the amount of numbers:
Mean = sum of numbers  amount of numbers
Five friends compare their marks in a French test. These are shown below:
Mean = (41 + 54 + 79 + 26 + 65)  5
Check your answer by asking yourself if it looks about right. If you had forgotten to divide by 5 then the answer would have been 265, which would not have made sense. Always check that your answer seems sensible.
A die is thrown 10 times. The following results are obtained:
3, 5, 1, 2, 6, 4, 2, 5, 6, 1
To find the answer, add the numbers together and divide by the amount of numbers:
Mean = (3 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 5 + 6 + 1)  10

Analyse, review and comment - The differences
, you need to remain objective, detached, balanced, fair and avoid just giving your own opinions in your conclusion. An analysis:
Offers a balanced examination of an issue or text
Investigates an issue or text's key points
Unlike a review, it's not solely focused on pros and cons or good and bad
is more subjective and personal. Personal knowledge and authority will make your conclusions count. However, you will still need to support your points with valid reasons. A review
Draws a conclusion, saying whether something works for its audience and purpose
gives purely subjective and personal views on a topic. If you're asked to give one in class, you should still be authoritative providing support for your views. A comment:
Uses the first person narrator  I think, In my opinion, I really like this
Although other comments may not, you should support your ideas with evidence when you comment in class.
Make all that writing make sense. Try this!

Extract 1 - Act 1, Scene 1, lines 98 to 232
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew. Were you by when it began?
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
I drew to part them. In the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
O where is Romeo? Saw you him today?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun
Peered forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad 
That westward rooteth from this city side,
So early walking did I see your son.
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood.
I, measuring his affections by my own,
Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Being one too many by my weary self,
And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
I neither know it, nor can learn of him.
Have you importuned him by any means?
Both by myself and many other friends:
Is to himself  I will not say how true 
But to himself so secret and so close,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.
See where he comes. So please you, step aside.
Ill know his grievance or be much denied.
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, lets away.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeos hours?
Not having that which, having, makes them short.
Out of her favour where I am in love.
Alas, that Love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Alas, that Love, whose view is muffled still,
Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Heres much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs:
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers eyes;
Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.
What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.
This is not Romeo: hes some other where.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will 
A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.
A right good mark-man! And shes fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Well, in that hit you miss. Shell not be hit
With Cupids arrow. She hath Dians wit,
And in strong proof of chastity well-armed,
From Loves weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide th encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
O, she is rich in beauty  only poor
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
Be ruled by me: forget to think of her.
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
To call hers  exquisite  in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing fair:
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who passed that passing fair?
Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
Ill pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

265,"> Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
When you are persuading people, you usually use a different style. You don't need to show both sides - all you have to do is present your ideas. For instance, imagine you had to persuade people to buy a certain toothpaste. You could write about the great taste, or how clean your teeth feel or how white they are. It doesn't really matter what you find to write about as long as you get them to buy it.
But you wouldn't write about other makes of toothpaste. You don't persuade like this, because it sounds like you aren't sure. So the first thing to remember is:
- if you are writing about how great chips are, keep repeating the idea. Convince yourself how good they are - they might even be a healthy option, because lots of doctors are bound to like them and chips wouldn't be so popular if they weren't really great, would they? Once you have convinced yourself, it's much easier to convince others. So next you need to remember to...
- it's always better to hear how good your idea is rather than how bad other people's are. So write about the things that show your ideas in the best light. For instance, aren't chips just great for a quick snack? Why were chips voted the most popular option in our school at lunchtime? And finally don't be frightened to...
- If you don't seem too sure, or if you can't make your ideas stand out, then you aren't really persuading as much as you can. And if that is the case, you need The Persuaders' Toolkit.
- don't worry about saying the same thing again and again - people forget, so repeat yourself and they will remember. Even when you think they might remember, you can always repeat yourself another time.
- using words such as ""we"" or ""I"" always sounds a lot more convincing. We all know that, don't we?
- why would you use questions? Well, they make people think. They also get your readers involved in what you are writing. So will you use them when you persuade? If not, why not?
- words are your ammunition. In seconds, they can make your friends laugh, or your teacher angry, so why not use them properly to persuade your readers?
For instance, don't just write ""the pressure of doing school work"", because there is no real feeling there. Instead, how about: ""the endless trauma, the desperation and the mindless suffering that school work inflicts on students"".

386,"Here are two examples of instinctive behaviour in animals:
Instincts are useful because they do not have to be learned and they can be complex, like the examples above. Instincts let animals form groups for protection, choose mates, fight to be in charge, and show many other behaviours.
Reflexes are a type of instinct. They happen automatically because of a particular stimulus. For example, if your hand touches something hot by accident, it automatically and quickly moves away. You do not have to learn to do this.

When the school bell rings at the end of break time, the students leave the playground and go to their lessons. People may say that the students are acting on instinct. But they would be wrong.
An instinct is a behaviour that happens automatically without any learning needed. The students have learned that the bell is a signal to do something, so leaving the playground when the bell rings is not an instinct. It is learned behaviour.

So if you're answering a question, state your point, back it up with a piece of evidence and then explain it.
Try out the PEE method. Here's an extract from 'Holes' about Stanley and the prison work camp.
Find two features of Stanley's character and explain how they are suggested. Write your answer down and then compare it to ours.
Stanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for a while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed animals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it. Sometimes he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games. Maybe he'd make some friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake.
Check our ideas on the extract by clicking the button below.
He is willing to make the best of a bad situation.
The writer suggests that Stanley spent long periods, when younger, playing alone with stuffed toys.
Stanley thinks that he will have the chance to make friends and 'at least he'd get to swim in the lake'.
The writer lists the sort of games Stanley played with his stuffed toys at 'Camp Fun and Games' in a way that suggests he was playing on his own - the toys became his friends.
He is going to a boy's prison work camp, but, instead of thinking about the horrors he might face, he shows that he is hopeful and ready to make the best of things.

If you place a set of numbers in order, the
If there are two middle numbers, the median is the mean of those two numbers.
Find the median of each of the following sets of numbers:
a) 2, 4, 7, 1, 9, 3, 11
b) 4, 1, 3, 10, 6, 9,
1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11
The middle number is 4. Therefore the median is
there are two middle numbers (4 and 6), so we find the mean of these two numbers. The median is therefore:
If there are n numbers, the median will be the (n + 1)  2 = th number
If there are 3 numbers, the median will be the (3 + 1)  2 = 2nd number.
If there are 4 numbers, the median will be the (4 + 1)  2 = 2
Rachel records the number of goals scored by her five-a-side team in their first 20 matches.

As the height of bar represents frequency, label the vertical axis 'Frequency'. The labelling of the horizontal axis depends on what is being represented by the bar chart.
Leon conducts a survey to find the number of people in each of the cars arriving at his school gate between 8.30am and 9.00am. His results are shown in the bar chart below:
a) How many cars contained 1 person?
b) How many cars contained more than 3 people?
c) Why there are only a small number of cars containing 1 person?
cars contained more than 3 people (10 + 4 = 14)
c) Most cars would be driven by parents bringing their children to school, only a few would contain just a teacher or a sixth former.

271,"> Preparing, planning and checking - Punctuation
The most important thing with punctuation is to make sure your sentences are correctly marked at the start and end:
The starts are easy; they should all have capital letters.
The endings have full stops (or the equivalent, such as question marks). However, endings cannot have commas. Commas are only used inside sentences, never right at the end of one.
One quick way to check is to read your work to yourself (it doesn't have to be aloud). If you 'run out of breath' or need to pause in your reading to add emphasis, ask yourself whether a comma or a full stop is needed. If so, put one in.
Other areas which often cause problems are:
If you have included the actual words that somebody speaks, make sure you put them inside speech marks. Remember to close the speech marks as well as open them!
Always use question marks when writing a question whether it is direct or rhetorical. Look out for rhetorical questions in persuasive texts eg ""How long will it be until all our countryside is destroyed?"". Writers use rhetorical questions to emphasise a point and they do not expect the reader to genuinely answer the question.
Be careful when using exclamation marks as overusing them can spoil a text. They should be used only to show excitement, surprise, shock or humour eg ""Stop the car!"" she yelled.
To show when a letter has been missed out:
Remember: ask your teacher for some advice if you feel unsure about any aspect of punctuation.

247,"Is silencing parents a winning idea for kids' sports?
Loud parents are a growing problem at youth sporting events. Nearly 60 percent of people think that parent behavior in youth sports is worse today than it was five years ago, according to the National Association of Youth Sports. ""Parents are trying to yell and scream to make their kids play better, and that just doesn't work,"" sports expert and former coach Gregory Dale told
Dale and other sports experts are fans of an idea called ""Silent Saturdays."" Silent Saturdays are special game days during which parents aren't allowed to yell, scream, shout, or even speak. They can only clap to celebrate good plays and whisper to each other. Sports programs from California to New Jersey have instituted Silent Saturdays. Is quieting the sidelines a good call?
Silence helps keep parents' behavior under control.
Some sports leagues think zipping parents' lips is a great idea. The Dynamo Soccer Association in Bourbonnais, Illinois, started having Silent Saturdays last year. ""We're not trying to punish parents,"" Dynamo Soccer board member Ben Smith told
""It's just a stress-free day for the kids.""
At first, some parents were skeptical, or unsure, of the idea. But Smith says the quiet games were a big success. Instead of shouting, parents held encouraging signs and applauded. Everyone could hear the kids talking to each other on the field during the games. ""There was no negative criticism throughout the day,"" adds Smith. This year, the Dynamo board is considering two Silent Saturdays, and nearby soccer leagues are giving the program a try.
Parents should be allowed to cheer on their kids.
Silence doesn't work for everyone. For example, two grandparents in Bourbonnais were disappointed because they had traveled to cheer at their grandkids' game, but they had arrived on a Silent Saturday. Some experts think keeping family members quiet isn't the solution. ""Parents hate it,"" Jim Thompson, head of Positive Coaching Alliance, told
""If you want parents to be positive, this is not the best way to do it.""
Thompson says the solution is to train parents to cheer in a way that promotes
or fair play. Thompson prefers ""Honor the Game Days"" to Silent Saturdays. What's the difference? ""Rather than telling parents to be quiet, at Honor the Game Days, [we tell parents] how to support their kids,"" he says.

761,"Eleven-year-old Josh Cook from Ohio became hooked on pocket bike racing last year. Josh races his pocket bike, or mini motorcycle, on a private track. He also makes sure to wear protective gear and safety equipment, such as a helmet and heavy boots, whenever he rides.
Pocket bikes, also called pocket rockets, have found their way onto city streets. Pocket bikes are the most recent craze sweeping the country. Yet this pint-size fun is causing big trouble.
Police in cities from Los Angeles to Boston are concerned about the safety of kids riding the popular pocket bikes. At less than 2 feet tall, the mini motorcycles are low to the ground.
""The minibikes are extremely dangerous,"" Los Angeles police officer Ron Fisher told
. ""They are so low to the ground that it makes the rider invisible from a drivers viewpoint.""
The mini motorcycles, which are powered by lawn mower engines, are also noisy. They typically reach speeds between 25 and 40 miles an hour. That is about the same speed a car travels on local streets.
Although it is legal to buy the bikes, it is against the law to ride them on public streets in many states. Police have been giving tickets to illegal riders. In some cases, officers
This has some kids and parents upset. They argue that the companies selling the mini motorcycles dont inform buyers that they cant be ridden on public streets.
Fisher says the majority of pocket bike riders on the street are 9 and 10 years old. Officials in some states are working to pass laws to limit who can ride the bikes. The officials say that kids should have to wait until they have a drivers license.
Pocket bike racing has been a popular sport in Europe. It has caught on in some communities in the United States during the past few years.
Josh and other pocket bike racers agree that the mini motorcycles are not meant to be ridden on city streets. He told us that if people are interested in riding pocket bikes, they should find ""an organized race track.""

324,"The results are in for the backpack survey. At the beginning of the school year, we asked you how much weight you carry in your backpack. Nearly 3,500 of you responded to our online poll.
Health experts recommend that kids not carry more than 15 percent of their body weight.

38,"You're probably familiar with this saying: An apple a day keeps the doctor away. There has been a lot of health advice in the news lately about what is good for your body. Sometimes it becomes difficult to tell what is true and what is considered a myth.
is a made-up story that is passed down from generation to generation. Myths often become accepted as the truth. Weekly Reader spoke with a few health experts to find out the truth behind some common beliefs.
: An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
: Although eating this fruit won't cure an illness, apples are a healthful food choice. ""[Apples] are good for you,"" said nutrition expert Dr. Melvin Heyman. ""They contain nutrients.""
are vitamins and minerals that your body needs to stay healthy. Apples are also a good source of fiber, which can decrease the risk of heart disease later in life.
: You should let a cut breathe.
: Contrary to popular belief, cuts do not need to breathe. ""The open cut or scrape should be covered,"" said skin expert Dr. Amy Harned. According to Dr. Harned, it's important to wash the wound first. Then, apply an antibiotic ointment and cover the cut with a bandage. Leaving a cut uncovered can allow germs to infect it.
: Eating carrots will improve your eyesight.
: Carrots are rich in vitamin A, which helps keep your eyes healthy. According to eye expert Dr. Timothy Wingert, ""Eating carrots will not improve your eyesight. But eating carrots is part of a well-balanced diet. Carrots have nutrients that help your eyes to function properly."" Carrots also make a tasty snack.
: You can hurt your eyes by sitting too close to the TV.
: There is some truth to this advice. According to Dr. Wingert, sitting too close to the television for long periods of time makes eyes tired and can cause eyestrain.

347,"With a dino-like head, this fierce ancient crocodile might have looked like the computer image (above the skull), scientists say.
Scientists have reported the discovery of a terrifying ancient sea creature. The 13-foot-long monster appears to be part crocodile and part T. rex. The creature likely roamed the Pacific Ocean about 135 million years ago, during the Age of the Dinosaurs. Scientists nicknamed the crocodile ""Godzilla,"" after the film monster.
of the skull, scientists created a computer image of Godzilla. Fossils are ancient remains of plants and animal preserved in rock. The crocs fossil was discovered in 1996 in Argentina, a country in South America. After studying the fossil for 10 years, scientists recently published their research.
Unlike other ocean crocs of the time, Godzilla had a short, high snout and a mouthful of large, jagged teeth for devouring other animals. Other crocodiles had long, thin snouts and smaller teeth. Scientists say Godzilla was a top ocean
an animal that feeds on other animals. It most likely dined on other large creatures rather than small fish. ""We are calling him the chico malobad boy of the ocean,"" says one of the researchers.

203,"The Mayon volcano in the Philippines has roared dangerously to life. A
is an opening in Earths surface through which molten rock, ash, and other materials blast out. Volcanoes erupt because of a buildup of heat and pressure deep within Earth. Volcanoes occur where Earths plates push together or pull apart.
For weeks, Mayon has threatened thousands of people who live near the volcano. Repeated eruptions of hot ash and fiery lava have destroyed crops and forests. Experts warn that more violent eruptions could happen at any time.
Mayon is the most active volcano in the Philippines. Scientists consider a volcano active if it has erupted within the last 10,000 years. A dormant volcano is ""sleeping"" but is expected to erupt in the future. An extinct volcano is not expected to erupt again.

2,"School-age kids need at least nine hours of sleep each night.
Fourth grader Christina Moore from Belmont, Massachusetts, has a busy schedule. Along with doing her homework, she plays ice hockey and takes flute lessons. Once bedtime rolls around, she is usually exhausted. Like most kids her age, Christina has some strangeand sillydreams.
characters ate leftover casserole in my kitchen and wouldn't give any to me,"" Christina told
. ""In another dream, a group of parents were so unhappy with their kids' grades that they pushed them off a building into a salad filled with French dressing!"" Whenever she gets sick, Christina has the same dreamsomeone is chasing her through a forest.
What do those dreams mean? No one quite knows for sure, but scientists are getting closer to solving the puzzle. They are using new technology to study how the sleeping brain works.
Although there are still many mysteries about sleep, scientists know that everyone needs sleep to boost brain power and keep the body healthy. School-age kids need at least nine hours of sleep each night to perform their best in school.
So can a good night's sleep help Christina do her best playing ice hockey and the flute? Can sleep help
""Getting a good night's sleep is good for your brain and body and helps you grow,"" sleep expert David Dinges told
. ""You're less likely to be tired the next day, you're less grouchy, more alert, and perform better in school and in sports.""
While you're snoozing, your brain doesn't shut down. Your brain stays busy and goes through five stages of sleep each night.
, sleep. It gets that name because your eyes move around quickly under closed eyelids. Your brain becomes very active during REM sleep. Most dreaming takes place during that sleep stage. Your body cycles through REM and non-REM stages several times a night. Each cycle lasts about 90 minutes.
Everybody dreamsalthough scientists don't know exactly why. Scientists have different
, or ideas, about why dreams are useful. One theory is that dreams help make sense of the day's events. Some scientists think that dreams help the brain sort and store information.
The latest evidence shows that dreams may help people master new physical skills, such as playing an instrument or riding a bike. Both dreaming and getting a good night's sleep may also help people improve their problem-solving skills. In one study, scientists divided volunteers into groups to solve a math problem. The group that received more sleep solved the problem more often than the group that didn't receive as much sleep.
Why do we remember some dreams but not others? When you wake up affects how vividly you recall your dreams. If you awaken during REM sleep, you're more likely to remember the details of a dream. If you wake up during another stage, you might not remember your dreams as wellor at all.
Whether or not you remember your dreams, it's important to get into a healthful sleep routine. ""The enemies of sleep are staying up late to play video games or watch TV,"" said Dinges.
Like people, all warm-blooded animals dream. Some animals sleep a little, and others sleep a lot. The amount of sleep an animal requires depends on its needs. Take a look at the sleep patterns of some creatures.
like their sleep. They live in eucalyptus trees in Australia. Koalas dine on a steady diet of eucalyptus leaves, which are not very nutritious. To store up their energy, koalas snooze up to 18 hours a day.
don't need pillows because they sleep only 2 hours a daymostly standing up. They only lie down to dream. A giraffe doesn't lie down that much because it would take too long to get up if a predator were to approach.
sleep and swim at the same time! They need to keep breathing while they rest, so they let one-half of their brain sleep and keep one eye open. Dolphins rest for 7 hours a day on and off, switching sides of the brain they shut down.
What are other ways kids can get into a healthful sleep routine?

105,"If you had to choose one invention you couldn't live without, which would it be-the toothbrush, car, cell phone, or microwave oven? That was the question asked of American teens and adults in a survey conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
The toothbrush emerged as the number-one invention that Americans can't live without. Following closely in second place was the car.
These findings show that important inventions do not have to be complicated. ""In today's high-tech society, we thought people would be voting for the high-tech inventions,"" said Kristin Joyce, a spokesperson at MIT. ""The results show that simple, low-tech inventions are important to people.""
The toothbrush has a long history, dating back to the 15th century. According to the American Dental Association, the first toothbrush was invented in 1498. To make the brush, a Chinese emperor placed hog bristles in a bone handle.
In 1938, nylon bristles replaced pig bristles. Dentists today are eager to remind people that while the toothbrush has taken the throne as king of the invention list, it still needs its handy sidekick-dental floss.

533,"After nearly two decades of rest, a sleeping giant has started to awaken. Mount St. Helens in Washington state is showing signs of life and has left scientists scrambling to determine if it will blow its top.
""Volcanoes are just like people--they're awake and active, and they go to sleep,""
. A volcanologist is a scientist who studies volcanoes.
In September, Mount St. Helens began blowing large
, or clouds of steam, thousands of feet into the air. The 8,364-foot mountain is not the only restless volcano in the country. Scientists are also paying close attention to awakened volcanoes in Alaska and Hawaii.
U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Geological Survey
Steam blasts from a crater on Mount St. Helens in October 2004.
Volcanoes can remain quiet for years and then erupt violently, sometimes without warning. Using the latest technology, scientists hope to better
Mount St. Helens is located in Washington.
Scientists say Mount St. Helens is one of the most closely monitored volcanoes and the most active volcano in the lower 48 states. Mount St. Helens is also among 13 active volcanoes that are located in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. That range is home to several powerful volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier and Mount Hood.
Although scientists say a large eruption at Mount St. Helens is unlikely, they are cautious because of the volcano's history. Officials have sealed off a 5-mile area around the volcano.
Mount St. Helens erupted with tremendous force in May 1980, blowing more than 1,300 feet off its top and killing 57 people. The blast destroyed thousands of acres of forest and scattered ash for thousands of miles. Mount St. Helens continued to rumble until 1986 but has been quiet since that time.
How can scientists tell when a volcano will awaken from its slumber? ""We measure earthquake activity, changes in the mountain, and volcanic gases,"" said Driedger.
Although scientists can't tell exactly when or with what force a volcano will blow its top, they rely on advanced equipment to help them predict eruptions. Special devices called
are installed around volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens to detect earthquakes. Earthquakes always strike before a volcano erupts.
Volcanoes are mountains where hot, liquid rock called magma deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure can cause magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the crater at the top of the volcano and vents, or cracks, along its side. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called lava. Once lava cools, it hardens into rock.
Scientists use special global positioning instruments to measure movements on the slopes of the mountain--a clue to the buildup of
. Magma is red-hot molten rock located inside the volcano. It is called
when it pours out of the volcano.
As magma rises, volcanoes release carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Sensors on helicopters test the air for gases that signal rising magma. ""The gases are like telegrams that tell us what's going on inside the volcano,"" said Driedger.
More than 500 million people around the world live near active volcanoes. Monitoring volcanoes is a dangerous job, but scientists take precautions to stay safe.
""By watching volcanoes, we learn how they work,"" said Driedger. ""The more we know, the better prepared we can be to save property and lives.""
Besides volcanoes, what natural disasters are hard for scientists to predict? Why?

127,"Trained rats may soon be used to find survivors who are trapped after disasters.
A team of scientists might be ditching the phrase ""oh, rats!"" from their vocabulary. They are experimenting with ways that rats may help find people who are buried as a result of earthquakes or other disasters.
Like dogs, rats have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out survivors. The rodents are also small enough to crawl almost anywhere. Dogs can be limited in their searches because of their larger size.
The scientists trained the rats to recognize the scent of people. To do that, researchers implanted electronic devices into the brains of the animals.
The electronic devices affect the rat's brain so that it picks up the scent of a person and then plans how to locate the person. Signals from the rat's brain are relayed to a radio transmitter that scientists attach to the rodent's back.
Rescue teams then will be able to track those signals and follow the rat's path. That will help rescuers determine where to start digging for survivors. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next nine months.

350,"Where the Wild Things Are!: A Numbers Puzzle
Counting giant pandas in the wild is no easy task. Just ask a team of scientists who recently put their detective skills to the test.
The scientists trekked through dense forests in central China to search for clues of giant pandas. China, a country in Asia, is the only place where giant pandas live in the wild.
After spending four years in the country's mountainous region, scientists completed the largest
of giant pandas ever done. A census is a population count.
The results of the census surprised scientists! They counted about 1,600 giant pandas living in the wild in China. That is double the number originally thought to live there. ""We found giant pandas living in areas we didn't know had any,"" scientist Colby Loucks told
Although the news is hopeful, Loucks and other scientists are quick to point out that giant pandas still need protection. They are among the most
animals. That means there are very few left in the wild.
Human activity is the main reason the pandas are threatened. Their
, or home, is being destroyed as people cut down trees to get wood and to make farmland.
Giant pandas must eat a lot of bamboo to get the nutrients they need. Pandas spend up to 14 hours a day eating bamboo, because it is not very nutritious.
, or go into a long sleep, in the winter, because they can't store up enough fat on a bamboo diet.
A newborn panda weighs between 3 and 5 ounces and is about the size of a stick of butter.
Each front paw on a panda has an extra wrist bone that acts like a thumb to help the panda grasp bamboo shoots.
Scientists needed to collect clues to count pandas because the shy creatures are hard to spot in their natural environment. ""Giant pandas are very hard to see in the wild,"" said Loucks. ""They hide in the thick
Bamboo provides giant pandas with their main source of food. Each animal consumes about 80 pounds of this plant's stems and leaves a day.
In fact, the giant pandas' survival is linked to eating bamboo. If bamboo disappears in an area, giant pandas there risk starvation.
To collect clues, scientists combined the latest technology with old-fashioned tracking skills. Each time they spotted a clue, such as a panda paw print in the mud or fur on the bark of a tree, they entered their finding into a computer. Computer mapping helped them pinpoint the locations of the giant pandas.
How will the census results help protect pandas? Scientists hope their findings will lead to the creation of more
for giant pandas. Nature reserves are areas of forest that are protected from development. Currently, China has 40 nature reserves.
""Pandas live in the same place as other animals,"" said Loucks. ""If we conserve the panda habitat, we conserve [the habitat of other animals] too.""
Why is it important for scientists to track endangered animals?

349,"Would you spend a month in a small room with 2,700 scorpions? That's what a woman from Malaysia did recently. Malaysia is a country in Southeast Asia.
Malena Hassan, age 24, set a record by living with a roomful of scorpions, which are poisonous, for 30 days.
During her monthlong ordeal, Hassan was stung seven times and as a result, suffered from a high fever.

557,"From our planet, you can see Earth's single moon in the evening sky. Imagine living on a planet that has 17 moons! That's the number of moons that orbit Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. Scientists spotted a 17th moon orbiting Jupiter while they were looking for comets.
Scientists say the newly discovered moon is 3 miles wide. It is the smallest of Jupiter's known moons. Scientists used to think that Leda, a moon discovered in 1974, was Jupiter's smallest moon. Leda is between 5 and 10 miles wide.

406,"Imagine having time for a game of chess in between your math and social studies lessons. It's not as surprising as you would think. Chess is catching on in elementary schools across the country. Students at Sky Oaks Elementary School in Burnsville, Minnesota, learn chess as part of the curriculum. ""It's fun to play,"" said Alex Powell, a fourth-grade student at Sky Oaks.
Chess is a game of skill between two players. It likely began during the 7th century in India. The object of the game is to
, or trap, the other person's king.
Studies show that playing chess sharpens critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. ""It helps kids with their schoolwork,"" said Alex's teacher, Ray Nyberg. ""They have to think and be analytical.""
Principal Patrick Flinn says that Sky Oaks has been teaching chess sessions to students for more than 15 years.

137,"Standing atop a hill this summer in the dense jungles of Guatemala, a country in Central America, scientist Arthur Demarest felt his feet sink into the jungle vines.
Demarest plunged into a deep, tangled snake hole up to his armpits. Hearing snakes slithering around him, Demarest froze. For half an hour, the scientist didn't move, waiting for the snakes to settle down so he could climb out safely. While stuck in that snaky situation, Demarest looked around and realized the pit was actually part of a jungle-covered three-story building.
As soon as he got out of the hole, Demarest and his team of scientists explored the hill. They found that it was an ancient palace built by the Maya people. The Mayan civilization covered parts of Mexico and Central America, and reached its greatest power between the years 250 and 900.
Demarest's team also discovered a city surrounding the palace. The Maya people called the city
, which means ""place of serpents."" The palace at Cancun was built more than 1,300 years ago by the Mayan king Tah ak Chaan.
So far, Demarest and his team have counted 170 rooms in the palace, which has 11 courtyards and covers an area the size of two football fields. Because of its sturdy limestone walls, the palace is in extremely good condition, Demarest said.
Demarest said Cancun is different from other Mayan cities. Unlike the other Mayan cities, Cancun doesn't have temples or evidence that there was warfare. ""The basis of power among the Mayan [kings] was religion and warfare,"" explained Demarest. ""Apparently, Cancun needed neither.""
The drawing shows an artist's idea of what the Cancun palace might have looked like.
Demarest said the city must have been very powerful. But its leaders were more focused on
, or widespread buying and selling, than on religion or warfare.
Located near the Pasin River, Cancun was a thriving trading center for the Maya. ""That river,"" Demarest said, ""was really the superhighway of the Mayan world.""
Jade, a semiprecious stone, is everywhere at the site, Demarest said. Scientists even uncovered the remains of a woman who had jade false teeth! Finely carved jade statues were found in the graves of workmen.
Demarest estimates that it will take about 10 to 15 years to
, or dig out, Cancun. In his 20 years of uncovering Mayan ruins, he said, Cancun is ""by far the most spectacular.""
The snakes must think so, too. ""A buried palace is exciting to us,"" said Demarest, ""but it's even more exciting to snakes. They love it! This place is full of snakes.""
Why might studying ancient cities be important?

556,"Scientists are thrilled about some tiny, furry finds. They have discovered two new species of lemurs on Madagascar, an island located off the southeast coast of Africa.
The endangered animals are found only in Madagascar and a few of the country's nearby islands. Madagascar is home to some of the world's most
, or unusual, plants and animals. Lemurs live mainly in forest trees and are
One of the newly discovered creatures has wide eyes, is small enough to fit in a hand, and bounces from tree branch to tree branch in the dark. Its name in Malagasy means ""good man."" Malagasy is the official language of Madagascar. The animal was named after scientist Steve Goodman. He has been studying the tiny creatures in Madagascar for 20 years. It is truly an honor to have an animal named after me,"" says Goodman.
The other species is a giant mouse lemur with a bushy tail. It was named in honor of Madagascar's children. Its name in Malagasy means ""child."" The scientists chose that name to remind Madagascar's children to care for the many plants and animals in their country.
Finding a new lemur species is rare because many of the tiny creatures have become extinct. The recent find means that there are now 49 known species of lemurs in the wild.

23,"Did you know that the average child will spend more time in front of the television than at school this year? That's according to the TV-Turnoff Network.
Beginning April 21, millions of children and their families across the country will trade some TV time for other activities. They will zap off their television sets for an entire week.
April 21 through 27 is the ninth annual TV-Turnoff Week. ""The idea of the week is to encourage people to take a break from TV,"" said Frank Vespe of the TV-Turnoff Network. ""One of the things we learn is that TV is taking away from other things that we might do for fun.""
The goal of the week, according to its organizers, is to help kids discover other activities they enjoy. Then kids may make lasting changes in their lives.
Health experts warn that too much television can have negative effects on kids. Children who spend too much time watching television often get too little exercise. They also don't perform as well in school as do children who watch less TV.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
1. This is the ninth year of TV-Turnoff Week.
2. Many kids like to watch TV.
3. TV-Turnoff Week lets kids discover other activities they enjoy.
So think about what you might do if you zapped off your television set for an entire week. Would you read a book? Head outside to ride your bike? Play a board game with your mom or dad?

563,"Students at Kirkpatrick Elementary School in Nashville, Tennessee, had a day they won't forget anytime soon. They got to chat with President George W. Bush. The president visited the Nashville school in early September.
Many students who participate in free tutoring sessions at the school have improved their grades and reading skills. The free tutoring sessions fall under the president's No Child Left Behind law. Bush was at the school to congratulate the principal and teachers for helping students perform better.

665,"In San Francisco, baseball last season went to the dogs-- Portuguese water dogs, that is.
A team of six Portuguese water dogs helped the San Francisco Giants every time the baseball team played at home at Pacific Bell Park. The dogs are members of the Baseball Aquatic Retrieval Korps (BARK). They retrieved home run baseballs hit into nearby McCovey Cove.
BARK uses Portuguese water dogs because they are excellent swimmers. The dogs have webbed feet and use their tails as rudders. Portuguese fishermen use these swimming hounds to herd schools of fish into nets and deliver messages between ships.

167,"The Amazon rain forest is disappearing at an alarming rate.
Toucans and other creatures hold on as their rain forest home dissappers.
fly among the forest. Emerald tree boas curl up on branches to stalk prey. Endangered jaguars slink through the thick brush in search of food. These are just a few of the thousands of animals that call the Amazon rain forest home.
A tropical rain forest is warm and has heavy rainfall. The Amazon, in South America, is the largest rain forest in the world.
Yet the Amazons future is grim. Farmers are rapidly destroying this lush landscape.
has been huge problem in the Amazon since the 1960s. Deforestation occurs when farmers and loggers cut down trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Until recently, scientists thought the rain forest was losing about 5,800 square miles a year. However, using the latest satellite technology, researchers have discovered that the Amazon is shrinking at about twice that rate.
Why should we worry about a rain forest that is thousands of miles from where we live? Deforestation reduces the rain forests
or the variety of plants and animals in a particular area. The Amazon is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant diversity. It is home to the biggest flower in the world, a bird-eating spider, and a monkey about the size of a toothbrush.
Scientists estimate that they have identified only a small number of all species that live in the rain forest. As loggers and farmers destroy the forest, animals and plants may become extinct before they are discovered.
Deforestation affects people too. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines we need come from the rain forest.
The Amazon is often called the ""lungs of the world."" Its trees clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans. Carbon dioxide is a
Greenhouse gases trap the suns heat close to Earth. Without the trees in the rain forest, the Earths climate would become much hotter.
Stopping the destruction of the rain forest is not an easy task. Brazils government recently created two national parks in the Amazon rain forest. The governments efforts placed 3.7 million acres of rain forest off-limits for development. The protected area is more than twice the size of Maryland.
Others think that this is not enough. ""The single most important factor contributing to forest loss is population growth in Brazil,"" scientist Jim Bowyer of the University of Michigan told
""People make the forest their home. All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive.""
Scientists estimate that if deforestation continues at its current rate, the rain forest may survive only another 40 to 50 years. ""We need to address the real causes of deforestation, like poverty and population growth,"" says Bowyer. ""Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest.""

496,"It's hatching time. About every three years, female rattlesnakes lay eggs. Those eggs hatch between August and October, when the baby snakes break through their soft shells and start to slither around.
Baby rattlesnakes don't have rattles until weeks after they hatch. The rattles form over time as the snakes repeatedly shed their skin.
A baby rattlesnake sheds its skin for the first time about two weeks after it hatches. A rattlesnake shakes its rattle to warn other animals that it is nearby.
Many baby rattlesnakes don't live to become adults. Because of the babies' small size, other animals

345,"Benjamin Franklin once said, ""A penny saved is a penny earned."" For the people of Boston and Philadelphia, Franklin's pennies have come to mean a lot.
When Franklin died in 1790, he left money to both cities. Franklin chose those two cities because he was born in Boston and lived most of his life in Philadelphia.
Franklin left the money to help people who need it. ""I wish to be useful even after my death,"" Franklin wrote. He knew that his money would grow in value over time if it was invested right.
Before he died, Franklin made sure that the money would not be wasted. He left specific instructions on how the money should be used.
For the first 100 years, the money was used for loans to young people who wanted to learn technical skills. After the first 100 years, the money was used for education and public works. After 200 years, most of the money was given to the state governments that support each city.
Today, the money Franklin left in his will is worth millions of dollars. It has helped pay for education, equipment for fire departments, and the building of a museum.

452,"Right now, 53 million kids--more kids than ever before--are in school in the United States. So many kids are now attending school that many communities don't have enough schools for all of them. To solve that problem, some communities are sending kids to school in old stores, car dealerships, and malls!
The number of kids in school is increasing. In 15 years, eight million more kids than today will attend U.S. schools. Educators wonder what to do with all those kids. ""We need to figure out where we will put these children and who will teach them,"" said Richard Riley, U.S. Secretary of Education.
Educators say 10 million additional teachers will be needed to teach those kids.
Mesa, Arizona, is typical of many communities that have more kids than school space. Mesa has 84 schools and 550 classroom trailers parked around those schools. And still there isn't enough room for all the school-age kids.
To solve its space problem, officials in Mesa are building new schools. The community is also recycling old stores into schools.
This year, 700 elementary students in Mesa are attending the new Pedro Guerrero School, which used to be a supermarket. Where families once shopped for vegetables, kids now learn reading, history, science, and math.
Cassandra Fernandez attends the new school. The fifth grader's mother, who used to shop at the store, was worried when she heard that the city planned to turn it into a school. ""I thought, how are they going to make that [store] into a school?"" she said. Cassandra's mother, however, now likes the school and all the new equipment in it.
Mesa isn't the only community that has recycled old buildings into schools. Schools in Georgia, New Jersey, Ohio, and other states are also recycling schools. Recycling old buildings into schools is less expensive and takes less time than building new schools. Recycling schools also helps the environment by leaving space for trees.

31,"visits India and finds hope after tragedy
A year after the devastating tsunami that hit southern Asia, rebuilding efforts continue in full force.
Each day, 10-year-old Sarjm walks through the hot sand and past
the rubble where homes used to stand. He can see and even taste the ocean. The ocean used to make him happy. It provided fishermen like his father a way of making a living.
But on December 26, 2004, the ocean turned black and changed his village. It left behind destruction and fear. A memorial outside his school is a constant reminder of the 49 schoolchildren who lost their lives in the tsunami that struck on that date.
Debris of beach resorts washed away in the December 26 Indian Ocean tsunami at Khao Lak, Thailand, seen December 30.
The young boy talks about how his older brother and younger sister were both ""taken by the black wave."" Clapping his hands together, he told
Sadly, it is a story shared by thousands of other children. Sarjm lives in Kottapalli, a fishing village located at the southernmost tip of India. India was one of 12 countries devastated by last years tsunamione of the worst natural disasters in history. The series of gigantic waves, which resulted from an undersea earthquake, flattened coastlines and reduced fishing villages to rubble. More than 280,000 people died.
Now, one year later, many people are still homeless. But slowly, smiles are returning, and laughter once again rings through some of the fishing villages. Relief agencies have been working to help rebuild homes, schools, and lives with donations from people around the world.
Some of those donations came from American students who
or came together, to raise money to help people affected by the tsunami. From schools in small towns to those in big cities, students held bake-a-thons, participated in read-a-thons, and even sold their own belongings at garage sales. The pennies, quarters, and dollars are helping rebuild homes and bringing hope to children whose hearts and lives were shattered.
Nine-year-old Selso, who lives in a fishing village near Sarjms village, was one of those children. Before the tsunami destroyed his home, Selso, his sister, and his three brothers had never had a toilet or electricity in their house. Their house had only two rooms, and at night they all slept together on the dirt floor. ""We knew people who died, but my family was lucky,"" Selso told Weekly Reader. ""We only lost our home.""
Selsos mother used to worry about scorpions and snakes getting inside, but now all that has changed. Volunteers from Habitat for Humanity worked with Selsos family to construct a new home with electricity and plumbing. Habitat for Humanity volunteers build homes with families who have suffered. The organization plans to build 10,000 homes in the area during the next two years. ""This is the happiest day for my family,"" says Selsos dad, Michel. ""My children now have a safe, dry home where they can do their homework.""
With the help of relief agencies, some schools have also opened. Many are housed in temporary locations under thatched roofs. Classrooms are also beginning to receive textbooks and other much-needed supplies.
""When a school opens in a disaster zone, everyone feels a sense of hope,"" said Carol Bellamy, the executive director of the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), after the disaster. The U.S. Agency for International Development is another organization that has helped build playgrounds where children can enjoy new equipment.
As rebuilding efforts continue, many children remain terrified of the ocean. Volunteers have worked with Sarjm and other kids to talk about what happened. ""I was afraid to go back to the ocean,"" Sarjm says, ""but we were taught that the tsunami was very rare and would not happen again. I am not afraid to look at the water anymore.""
Why is it important to feel safe? What makes you feel safe at home? at school?
After the tsunami, countries in southern Asia began to put together a plan for a warning system in the Indian Ocean. Earlier this year, the U.S. government also announced a plan to improve the U.S. warning system by 2007. Under the plan, the number of devices that monitor waves from a tsunami will be increased. The warning system would provide an alert for U.S. coasts ""within minutes, and in some cases, within seconds of a tsunamis formation,"" according to scientist John Marburger.

95,"On March 16, Michael Yachinich of Chicago Heights, Illinois, heard a smoke alarm go off on the stairs to his upstairs bedroom. Michael, age 7, quickly went into the living room where his mother was sleeping. He woke her up, and the two quickly left the house. They ran to a neighbor's house and called 911. The fire was quickly contained by firefighters.
Michael had recently participated in his school's ""Great Escape"" project for Fire Prevention Week. Michael and his family knew how to exit their home safely during a fire. Firefighter Terrence Campbell of the Glenwood Fire Department said that Michael showed good fire safety behavior. He acted quickly to help his mom leave the house and report the fire, as well as by using a home escape plan to escape danger. ""I feel that his actions from the 1999 ""Great Escape"" project helped Michael know what to do,"" Campbell said.
An escape plan also helped save the lives of the Walker family in Ontario, Canada. Shortly after 3 a.m. on February 18, 1999, a fire began in the ground floor apartment below the Walker apartment. The family awoke to find their apartment filling with smoke.
Everyone reacted immediately. The family put their home fire escape plan into action, and everyone left the building right away and went to their meeting place outside. By the time they got there, flames were racing through the apartment.
Earlier in the school year, 9-year-old twins Ashley and Ryan Walker participated in their school's ""Great Escape"" fire safety program. Mr. Walker says the twins helped the family know what to do when the fire began. ""They pushed the fire procedures,"" he said. ""They learned them at school and had us practice how to get out.""
Although the idea of a fire starting in your home is scary, you can use the prevention skills taught in your school to keep fires from starting in your home. But, if a fire does start, you can prepare your family and yourself by having a ""Great Escape"" plan and practicing it at least twice a year!

Entire communities used to shut down each summer between 1930 and the early 1950s as families kept their kids indoors. Parents feared their children would be exposed to a disease called
. The disease crippled many people and sometimes caused death.
Thanks to Jonas Salk, polio has been almost wiped out worldwide. Salk was a doctor who invented a
to prevent the disease. Vaccines are shots or medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Salk's vaccine was officially declared safe on April 12, 1955. In honor of the 50th anniversary of that event, a new exhibit will open on April 12 at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. The exhibit is called ""Whatever Happened to Polio?""

people, causing them to lose movement in different parts of their body.
The museum's exhibit will look at the history of polio and the development of the vaccine. Included among the objects to be displayed are the leg braces worn by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who suffered from the disease.
""The introduction of a successful polio vaccine in 1955 was one of the most significant events of the 20th century,"" said museum director Brent Glass.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world, it still threatens children in Africa and Southeast Asia. The new exhibit will focus on current efforts to
, or give vaccines to, children in those places.
One of the most famous victims of polio was Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted polio and was confined to a wheelchair, although he was able to stand and take a few steps while wearing leg braces. The president declared a war on the disease.

144,"Nine-year-old Ben Duskin is reaching out to kids who have a serious disease called cancer. Ben invented a video game for kids about fighting cancer.
Ben, who is from California, is no stranger to the disease. He learned that he had a type of cancer called leukemia when he was five years old.
Why did Ben invent the video game? When he was in the hospital, he relied on video games to take his mind off being sick. That inspired him to help other kids who have cancer.
The result is ""Ben's Game""--named after its creator. The game takes place inside the body and stars a boy hero who moves around the screen on a skateboard. The boy is modeled after Ben. The object of the game is to blast cancer cells.
Thanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Ben's idea became a reality. The foundation helped Ben work with a software designer to create his video game. Ben's game is now available free online. To play, visit

706,"For years, scientists have known about a huge hole in a layer of Earth's atmosphere. It's called the ozone hole. It is located above Antarctica. This year, the hole did something surprising. It split in two!
Earth's atmosphere is made of several layers. Ozone is a gas that makes up one of those layers. That layer stretches from 6 miles to 30 miles above Earth's surface.
Ozone is an important gas. It protects life on Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. Without ozone, life couldn't exist. The dangerous solar rays are called ultraviolet rays, or UV rays. UV rays can cause sunburn and skin cancer.
The pie chart shows the two most abundant gases in Earth""s atmosphere.
Scientists first noticed the ozone hole in the 1970s. Since then, each year, the hole has opened above Antarctica for a few months in the fall. The largest hole formed in 2000. It was three times larger than the United States. This year, unusually severe storms caused the hole to split, say scientists.
Cold temperatures in the atmosphere over Antarctica and chemical pollution cause the ozone hole. Chemicals that used to be in aerosol cans, air conditioners, and refrigerators made the pollution. To protect the atmosphere, people stopped using those dangerous chemicals in the mid-1990s.
Although the chemicals are no longer used, they stay in the atmosphere for a long time. Scientists say the ozone hole will continue to form for a long time. But it should start getting smaller.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.

How exactly does a new word make its way into the dictionary? It takes about 10 to 20 years for a new word to become a common term used by a lot of people.
Deciding which words make the cut is the job of editors. They spend a lot of their day reading newspapers and magazines to find out what new words and phrases are popular. They also get ideas from the movies and the Internet-and even from slang usage. They enter new words into a computer system.

. A habitat is a place in nature where a plant or an animal lives. For their research, scientists studied fish called three-spined sticklebacks that live in rivers and streams in England.
Scientists also found that to make friends, the sticklebacks rely on senses other than vision. Scientists believe that fish use their sense of smell to find familiar fish.

On average, kids ages 4 to 12 receive $18 a week. Here's how kids get that money:
Many adults think that kids spend their money as soon as they get it. That may be true for some young people, but not for 9-year-old twins Gabriel and Dylan Greene.
For the past three years, Gabriel and Dylan have taken part in Save for America. Save for America is a program that teaches kids the importance of saving money. The program also teaches kids
Last year, 750 schools and 90,000 kids took part in Save for America. Combined, those kids saved $1 million. Since the program began 12 years ago, kids have saved nearly $50 million!
One of the schools that takes part in the Save for America program is Setauket Elementary School, Setauket, New York. Every two weeks that school has Banking Day. Nearly 200 kids from the school deposit money on Banking Day, including Gabriel and Dylan.
Each boy deposits about $5 in his bank account on Banking Day. So far, Gabriel has saved $350, and Dylan has saved $340.
The kids who participate in Save for America save money and learn valuable lessons that they will use for the rest of their lives. Dylan explained that he has learned that saving money for the future can help him obtain the things he wants and lead a better life as an adult.
Save for America also helps kids sharpen their math skills. Gabriel said the program has improved his skills, especially in addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
The kids who take part in Save for America can use their money for a variety of things. Gabriel recently withdrew some of his savings to buy a new scooter. However, he's saving most of his money for college.
Dylan also has reasons for saving his money. ""You should save up all the money that you need,"" he said, ""and you should give some of the money [to] the kids in America that need more [food, clothes and other necessities].""

385,"Rosa's paws are big, her nose is wet, and her coat is fluffy. But she doesn't live a dog's life. The 9-year-old shepherd is a land mine-detection dog.Rosa's nose has sniffed out some of the world's 50 million
. Land mines are explosive devices left in the ground from wars.A land mine can explode if someone touches it, killing or injuring the person. Children often mistake the land mines for toys.
Now Rosa's job is to teach U.S. children about the dangers of land mines so they can help fight the problem. I recently caught up with the clever canine at Paradise Valley Elementary School, located in Casper, Wyoming.I watched as Rosa did her job sniffing out some fake land mines. ""She's cool,"" gushed fifth grader Josh Yelton.
Rosa's visit kicked off the Children Against Land Mines Program, also known as CHAMPS. The goal of the program is to raise money to buy, train, and transport mine-sniffing dogs.Wyoming students raised $5,000 in quarters in just a few short weeks, and adults chipped in an additional $8,000. The money will help sponsor a new dog.
A dog's sense of smell and smarts make it the best land-mine locator. In fact, a team of six humans can search about 120 square feet of land in a day. A team of six dogs can search up to 3,000 square feet in a day's time.
The pooch paid for by the Wyoming students will be named Wyoming. That dog will help find buried land mines in Sri Lanka, a country off the southern coast of India.
Land mines not only injure and kill many people, but they also
, or stop, people from moving around freely. For example, the lush fields of Sri Lanka should be filled with crops. Instead, many fields lie unplanted. Farmers are afraid that mines litter their fields. Wyoming's job will be to help get rid of those land mines.
A Sri Lanka government official told me what a huge effect Wyoming and other mine-sniffing dogs will make in his country.
He said, ""The best part of the CHAMPS program will be when all the land mines have been removed.""
In what other ways do dogs help humans?

449,"How about cruising around town in a Hello Kitty cab? If you live in Japan, that's possible. Ten Hello Kitty cabs recently hit the streets outside Tokyo, the capital of this Asian country.
The cabs are popular with Hello Kitty fans, who don't have to pay more for their fun ride. The fares are about the same as those for a regular cab ride. The cabs also come equipped with free umbrellas, ponchos, and tissues featuring the cartoon cat.

521,"Hawaii is famous for its fiery volcanoes and rivers of lava. According to legend, those volcanoes were created by the goddess Pele, who made the fiery mountains by driving her digging stick into the ground.
Such legends are important to native Hawaiians. Today, however, ancient gods are a part of a fiery debate in this land of spirits.
Mauna Kea is an extinct, or dead, volcano on the island of Hawaii. According to an ancient Hawaiian saying, Mauna Kea ""is the astonishing mountain that stands in the calm."" These days the 13,700-foot-high peak is anything but calm.
, scientists who study space, say the mountain peak is a perfect spot to place telescopes.
Currently, scientists use 13 telescopes in a special 11,000-acre area called the Science Reserve on Mauna Kea. Using those telescopes, scientists have made several important astronomical discoveries. The scientists who use the telescopes pay a fee to the University of Hawaii, which built the observatories.
The use of the mountain for scientific research, however, is the source of a debate between scientists and some native Hawaiians. Some Hawaiians believe that the top of Mauna Kea is sacred, or an important place to their religion. They believe that the peak is the home of the snow goddess Poli'ahu.
According to officials at the Center for Hawaiian Studies, the university is making money from the site without sharing much of the money with native Hawaiians.
""We don't get a penny from Mauna Kea, and it's our land,"" said Jon Osorio, of the Center for Hawaiian Studies.
University officials say that a master plan, completed in June, addresses native Hawaiian concerns. The goals of the plan include educating people about Mauna Kea. It also states how many telescopes the university can build in the future.
According to observers, the debate will not end soon. A 1968 agreement gives the university control of the area until 2033. Until then, native Hawaiians will fight for what is theirs while scientists keep studying the skies.
, which is a type of government led by a king or queen. In 1778, Hawaii had its first contact with Europeans when English Captain James Cook landed on the islands. He named them the Sandwich Islands. Cook was later killed by Hawaiian warriors when he returned to the islands.
Over the next 100 years, more foreigners, including Americans, arrived on the islands. A struggle for power ended in 1893 when American plantation owners helped overthrow Queen Liliuokalani. By 1900, Hawaii had officially become a U.S. territory. A

758,"Talk about a bird's-eye view of an ostrich farm!
visited the Westcoast Ostrich Show Ranch near Cape Town, South Africa. South Africa is a country in Africa.
Ostriches are the world's biggest birds. They have plump, round bodies covered with feathers, and long, skinny necks covered with soft fluff. Male ostriches weigh up to 350 pounds and can grow up to 8 feet tall. That's a foot taller than basketball player Shaquille O'Neal!
Ostriches don't fly. Instead, they use their wings to attract mates, alert other ostriches to danger, and keep their balance. Being stuck on the ground doesn't slow ostriches down, though. They can run as fast as a car can travel--up to 50 miles an hour for about 30 minutes.
At the farm in South Africa, the ostriches roam an area of flat land almost the size of 200 football fields. The workers at the farm take care of the ostrich eggs--the biggest of all bird eggs. At almost 3 pounds, each egg is about the size of a football. Even though an ostrich egg looks fragile, it is very strong. You could put a 300-pound weight on the egg without cracking its shell. Believe it or not, even a baby elephant could sit on an ostrich egg!

49,"This greeting wishes others good fortune and happiness in the Chinese New Year. People kick off the holiday on February 18 this year.
The Chinese calendar is split up into months based on the
or moon, cycle. The Chinese New Year begins on the first new moon falling between January 21 and February 20. It ends on the full moon 15 days later, when the moon is brightest.
People in Chinese communities around the world celebrate the holiday with music, dancing, fireworks, feasts, and parades. At celebrations, people wear red clothes and give children red envelopes with money for good luck. Red is considered a color that wards off bad luck.
The Chinese New Year ends with the Lantern Festival. On that night, children carry lanterns in a parade under the light of the full moon. The highlight of the Lantern Festival parade is the traditional dragon dance, when dancers guide a long, colorful dragon made of silk, paper, and bamboo through the streets.
Each year in the Chinese calendar is named after one of 12 animals. Legend has it that people born in each animal's year inherit some of that animal's qualities. This year is the Year of the Pig. People born in pig years are considered honest, kind, and well informed.

169,"According to reports, many U.S. cities are going to the rats. The number of rat sightings is up in the past year. For instance, in Boston, rat complaints are up by 40 percent. In Chicago, rat sightings are up almost 50 percent.
Rats have always lived in cities. The rodents live off food and waste that people throw away. Recently, however, rat populations have grown because many communities don't have the money to pay for rat-control programs, said Jerry Hershovitz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Such programs keep rat populations down.
Rats can carry diseases that can make people seriously ill, so controlling the rat population is important.
The solution to the rat problem is to limit their food supply, say experts. For example, people in cities should use garbage cans that rats cannot get into.

392,"In many ways, David Bocchichio is a typical teacher. He works long hours, and students say he is always available to help. But he has given more than time and knowledge. He recently gave one of his kidneys to the mother of three of his students.
Evelyn Arroyo is the mother of three girls who were students at Hockanum Elementary School in East Hartford, Connecticut, where Bocchichio teaches. Last year, Bocchichio learned from Arroyo's daughters, Leslie, Juanita, and Iris, that their mother was sick with kidney disease.
The diagram shows some of the organs in the human body. The diagram shows the kidneys in front of other body organs so you can see them. The kidneys are actually behin these organs.
The kidneys filter waste from the body and make urine. Although a person has two kidneys, he or she needs only one to stay alive. People who have diseased kidneys may need a
to stay alive. In a kidney transplant operation, doctors remove the diseased kidney and replace it with a working kidney.
In the United States, many people suffer from kidney disease. According to Arroyo's doctor, David Hull, more than 47,000 people are waiting for kidney transplants. For many of those people, finding a kidney is a problem.
Some of Evelyn Arroyo's relatives offered a kidney, but their kidneys did not match the tissue that made up Arroyo's kidneys. Arroyo's family feared she might die before a matching kidney was found.
That's when Bocchichio volunteered one of his kidneys, which matched Arroyo's tissue. During the operations, which took place in January, doctors removed one of Bocchichio's kidneys and put it inside Arroyo.
After the operations, Arroyo told Bocchichio, ""I want to thank you again for this chance to live for my beautiful girls;... you're my angel.""
Word of the operations' success quickly spread through Hockanum Elementary School. ""I am very proud of what he has done,"" Principal Ismael A. Torres told

260,"A new U.S. law requires that schools provide healthier choices for students.
Public schools across the country are going on a health kick. Thanks to a new federal law, students are saying farewell to fatty foods and hello to better eating habits in school. They are also exercising more during the school day.
Its up to schools to decide how they will comply with the law. Many districts are
or requiring, that schools provide healthier choices for lunch. In Tennessee, most schools have removed sugary snacks and soft drinks from vending machines. In their place are more nutritious choices, such as granola bars, nuts, water, and juices.
In Florida, Missouri, and Texas, some schools have new rules that restrict desserts such as cupcakes and lollipops from parties. Instead, school officials are encouraging teachers and parents to provide more nutritious treats.
To get kids to exercise more, the northwestern Minnesota district of Perham Dent has added more physical activity to the school day. Many school districts are also making sure that kids have recess every day.
The goals of the new law are to promote good health and to combat
Obesity is the condition of being very overweight. Experts say the percentage of young people who are overweight has tripled since 1980. Being obese can lead to serious health problems later in life.
""We know that adults who are very overweight get sick more often and lose time at work,"" Julia Lear, the director of the Center for Health and Health Care in Schools, told
""The best thing to do is get kids in the habit of getting lots of exercise and eating healthy meals.""
The food pyramid helps people make good food choices. A rainbow of stripes represents the five food groups. The thin yellow stripe stands for fats and oil. A healthy diet consists of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and calcium-rich foods, such as milk and cheese. The climber is a reminder to be active for at least 60 minutes each day.

83,"Many people hate bugs. They can't stand to let the creepy crawlers near them. But some people find bugs fascinating and tasty.
Each year, the Great Insect Fair is held in State College, Pennsylvania. Thousands of people attend the fair to look at bugs, touch bugs, and even eat bugs.
Dorothy Blair is a nutrition expert. She says the fair teaches visitors that insects are an important source of food for people in some other countries.
Visitors to the fair can munch on stir-fried mealworms, cooked wax moth larvae, and chocolate-covered crickets, which are called Chocolate Chirpies.
""Last year, we ran out of Chocolate Chirpies. We had to make about 6,000 of them this year,"" Blair said.
Many of the fair's visitors are kids. Emily Paulson, age 7, played with a millipede at the fair. The large bug crawled up her arm. She said, ""It's sort of like a comb crawling up your arm. It was neat!""

710,"Alhaji Babah Sawane was only 10 years old when a rebel group kidnapped him in his African country of Sierra Leone. Taken from his family, he was forced to learn how to fire a rifle. He fought in an army for the next two and a half years.
Peacekeepers from the United Nations (U.N.) helped to free Alhaji. In 2001, he addressed the U.N., asking that organization to help children around the world who are forced to fight in war zones.
""We ask this body on behalf of Sierra Leone to do all they can to bring our sad story to an end,"" he said. ""We want to be able to move about freely in all parts of the country.""
Sierra Leone is just one of an estimated 41 countries around the world that use child soldiers. While the most offenses occur in Africa and Asia, the problem also exists in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East.
Most children who become soldiers come from very poor countries. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers estimates that 300,000 children are fighting as soldiers. In some countries, boys and girls as young as 8 years old are being recruited, or called upon, to fight.
Protecting children in war and conflict zones has become a top job for the United Nations. And the U.N. has made significant progress. In a report issued in December 2002, the U.N. named 28 governments and armed groups that use children to fight their battles.
International law prohibits countries from using children who are younger than 15 years old in combat. However, several U.N. conventions condemn, or do not approve of, having anyone under 18 serve as a soldier. If a country recruits child soldiers, it is violating, or breaking the rule of, international agreements.
Why us it important for governments around the world to protect children?
The U.N. wants to save children like Alhaji Babah Sawane from suffering. The report sends a strong message to governments everywhere: They will be held accountable for their actions.

122,"In October, a colorful object blazed through the sky over several states. Hundreds of people in Colorado, Utah, and Idaho saw the bright light. Many of them called local authorities to report what they saw.
""We've gotten several reports of [a] brilliant white light the size of a basketball with blue flames turning to orange,"" said one police official.
The people had seen an unidentified flying object, or UFO. Many people think that UFOs are spacecraft from other planets. Actually, a
is anything that you see in the sky and cannot identify. Usually, even the most mysterious UFOs are eventually explained.
Experts say the UFO seen in October was most likely a meteor, or space rock streaking through Earth's atmosphere. Other UFO sightings, however, remain a mystery.
For years, the U.S government has been studying UFO sightings. Much of the information that the government has gathered on UFOs is top-secret.
Now a new group wants the government to tell everyone what it knows about UFOs. The group is called the Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFI).
""It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the real nature of this phenomenon,"" said John Podesta. Podesta is a former White House official and a CFI member.
The members of CFI asked the government to release information about specific UFO sightings. One such sighting happened in December 1965.
On that cold night, people in western Pennsylvania saw a bright light streak through the sky. The light looked liked it crashed behind some hills.
The mysterious object might have been a rock from space. A space rock that crashes into Earth is called a meteorite. However, several witnesses claimed that soldiers searched the area where the object ""crashed."" They say the soldiers loaded a car-sized object onto a truck, placed a tarp over the object, and drove it away-never to be seen again.
The members of CFI claim that the U.S. government has never released information about the sighting and the object. ""We can't come up with a reason why this information is being withheld. The government won't even acknowledge that the incident took place, but we know that it did,"" said one CFI member.
For now, the exact nature of some UFOs remains a mystery. CFI members hope that the answer lies in secret government papers. They say they are only searching for the truth and they want everyone to know the truth.

326,"Many schools across the country are closed on November 11 to observe Veterans Day. This holiday is set aside to honor people who have served the United States in war.
According to the Pentagon, 150,000 American troops served in the war against Iraq, and 130,000 troops remain overseas. The Pentagon houses the four branches of the U.S. military, which include the Army, Marines, Navy, and Air Force.
On November 11, many ceremonies will take place to thank the members of the U.S. military who helped remove Saddam Hussein from power. They will also remember veterans who served in other U.S. wars.
Master Sergeant Emma Krouser served in the 3rd Infantry Division that led the assault on Baghdad. She described her experience in Iraq this summer.
""The people were waving flags... and giving soldiers the thumbs-up sign,"" Krouser told

139,"Are you ready to take a ride on
? This new movie is about a boy who boards a magical train to the North Pole.
is based on the classic children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. To make the book into a movie, filmmakers used a new type of technology called performance capture.
spoke to Douglas Chiang about his work on
. Chiang created the artwork for the movie to capture the feeling of the book.
: What does a production designer do?
Douglas Chiang: I get to play with the visual design of the movie. I read the script, come up with ideas, [draw] them on paper, and show the director.
: Do you have advice for kids who want a job like yours?
DC: Study the basics. You need to learn how to draw properly, then worry about techniques.
DC: It's really about believing in yourself and believing that anything is possible.
This latest technology helped filmmakers to get the movie to resemble the beautiful paintings in the children's book. How does performance capture work? Tiny sensors, which look like mini jewels, captured the actors' movements.
Actor Tom Hanks performed with 150 sensors attached to his face. He also wore special body gear with more sensors. Hanks acted on a stage that resembled the inside of a black box.
While Hanks acted inside the black box, special cameras picked up light reflected from the sensors. The cameras then sent the information to computers.
Finally, Hanks's performance was placed into a computerized setting of the book. What the audience will see on the screen is part real and part computer animation.
is the first movie shot this way. It enabled Hanks to play five characters, including the boy and the conductor!

135,"Almost 1 billion people dont have clean water, a report finds.
What do you do when youre thirsty? Chances are you get a glass of water from the sink. Not everyone can do that. In fact, almost 1 billion people around the world dont have clean drinking water.
A boy in Africa stands near a water pump. It is the only source of water in his village.
Thats the finding of a new report by world aid groups. The study looked at the living conditions of people around the globe. Many have to walk hours each day to collect water from rivers. Often that water is not safe to drink, because its dirty.
About 2.6 billion people dont have safe places to go to the bathroom, the report says. Lakshmi, 11, lives in a poor village in India. That is a country in Asia. For a long time, her school did not have bathrooms. She and her classmates had to use bushes outside.
World leaders say its important for kids such as Lakshmi to have good
or cleanliness. Drinking clean water and washing your hands after using the bathroom can help prevent diseases.
pipes around the world. To install is to set up. The pipes give people water in their homes. Aid workers also teach people how to
or clean, rainwater. They are even building bathrooms. Thats made a difference for Lakshmi. My school has toilets now, she says.
Still, there is a lot more to do, aid worker Clarissa Brocklehurst says. We must act now as one ... community to [supply] water and [good hygiene] for all.
How much water do you use? A lot! On average, each American goes through about 100 gallons of water a day. Thats enough to fill 1,600 drinking glasses! Here are some tips to
Keep your pearly whites clean, but be sure to shut off the faucet while you brush. That can save about 8 gallons of water a day.
Put away that rubber ducky. Taking a bath can use up to 70 gallons of water, while showering uses just 10 to 25 gallons of water.
In one day, a faucet can drip more than 20 gallons of water, and a leaky toilet can waste 200 gallons! Ask an adult to stop the drips.
How would your life be different without running water in your home?

214,"On March 27, hundreds of colorful kites will fill the sky over the National Mall. That is a park in Washington, D.C., where a kite festival will be held. Nearly 25,000 people attend the popular event each year. This year's theme is ""Kites Around the World.""
""Kites are something people celebrate all over the world,"" event organizer Brandi Rose told
. ""The festival is a way to bring all of the
together in one place,"" she said. The culture of a group of people refers to their way of life, ideas, and traditions.
Some people have built their own kites for the festival. ""I chose to build a Japanese fighter kite,"" said Mike Van Meers. ""In 17th-century Japan, the kites were built with bamboo and paper. I'm building one with modern materials.""
Experts think kites were first made in China more than 2,000 years ago. Legend has it that a Chinese farmer invented the kite. On a very windy day, he tied a string to his hat. He held the string to keep his hat from blowing away.
Traders from China spread kite flying to other parts of the world. ""Kites come in all different shapes and sizes,"" said Van Meers. ""Every culture is unique, and every culture has a different style.""
The kite gets its name from a bird of the same name. Kites are graceful, soaring birds with long, narrow wings. These birds were once common in England. In the 1600s, kids in England made toys that sailed through the sky when pulled with a string. When the toys moved, they looked like the gliding birds.
Why is learning about different cultures important?

215,"Does your pup seem pooped? You might be the tired one!
Researchers have learned that dogs can catch yawns from humans. A recent study found that pups often yawn after
In the study, a human researcher yawned in front of 29 dogs. Most of the pooches yawned back. Until this study, scientists thought people could make only other people and chimpanzees yawn.
Experts say the results are a sign that dogs can feel
. That is the ability to understand how someone feels, such as bored or sleepy.
Dogs are amazingly good at reading humans signals, researcher Atsushi Senju told

116,"Whoa! Dont look down! The newly opened Mike OCallaghanPat Tillman Memorial Bridge is the second-highest bridge in the United States. The bridge rises 890 feet above the Colorado River. It connects Arizona and Nevada.
The arch took nine years to build. The bridge is made from 16 million pounds of steel and 2 million feet of cable.
David Goodyear helped design the bridge. He cant get enough of the archs views. Its just such a fabulous setting, he says.
The bridges backdrop is the Hoover Dam. It was completed in 1935. The dam is considered a construction
or something that causes wonder. The dam stores water from the river. That water is used to make electricity.

14,"Afraid of heights? Stay away from the Burj Khalifa (BERJ kuh-LEE-fuh)! It is now the tallest building in the world.
The tall tower opened with a big show of fireworks on January 4. It is located in the United Arab Emirates. That is in the Middle East.
Rising 2,716 feet above the ground, Burj Khalifa is more than half a mile high. Thats almost 18 times taller than the Statue of Liberty! The tower has about 160 floors. Fifty-seven elevators
or carry, visitors up. The building includes a hotel and four swimming pools.
The giant skyscraper towers above the rest. Until recently, Taipei 101 in Asia was the worlds tallest building. Taipei 101 is 1,667 feet tall. Thats about 1,000 feet shorter than the Burj Khalifa.

9,"The day when pigs fly has finally come! In November, Charlotte, a 300-pound pig, flew on a passenger jet from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Seattle, Washington.
Maria Tirotta Andrews said she had special permission from the airlines to have her pig fly with her. But airline officials are now saying that the pig should not have flown in the passenger section. Airline and government rules say animals should not
or walk about, while aboard a plane.

265,"Do you ever wonder what it would be like to fly? Since 1992, the Young Eagles program has been giving kids free airplane rides in the sky.
The program has the goal of giving a million kids a ride before December 17, 2003. That is the 100-year anniversary of the Wright brothers' first flight.
The Wright brothers made history one day in December 1903. On that day, their dream of flying came true. They flew the first engine-powered airplane. Today, the Young Eagles program lets kids experience that same thrill of flight.

316,"Koalas eat about a pound of eucalyptus leaves each day.
The koala is a picky eater. To choose what to eat, it just follows its nose.
The menu for koalas is always the sameleaves! They eat only the leaves of eucalyptus (yoo-kuh-LIP-tuhs) trees. Sound boring? Not to a koala! There are thousands of these trees in Australia. The only problem is that leaves from some trees can make koalas very sick.
How does a koala know which leaves to choose? Scientists recently discovered that koalas learn from experience. After eating leaves that make them sick, the animals use their sense of smell to remember to avoid that type of leaf.
Scientists were not surprised to learn that koalas
means ""to like better."" Large trees have more leaves and offer better shelter to koalas.
A mother koala sits in a eucalyptus tree and holds her joey.
A marsupial is an animal that has a pouch in which to carry its young.
It looks like a small pink jellybean.
After a joey is born, it crawls into its mother's pouch. The joey drinks only its mother's milk for the first six months.
However, no matter how large the tree, koalas will not eat from one that makes them sick. They would rather go hungry than eat leaves from these trees, say scientists.

To a koala, a forest is a tricky mix of good and bad leaves. Scientist Ben Moore says, ""It's like having to choose between 1,000 restaurantsor trees, in the koala's casespread all over town, without a restaurant guide.""

453,"A United States vice president is a heartbeat away from the most powerful position in the world. A vice president must be ready to become president if the current president dies or cannot finish his or her term in office.

242,"Is your backpack weighing you down? If the answer is yes, you are not the only one. Millions of kids load their backpacks full of heavy books and other supplies. American kids carry an average of 20 pounds on their backs!
Studies show that wearing a heavy backpack can cause back and shoulder injuries later in life. Experts say that kids get more injuries when they wear their backpacks over one shoulder. Wearing both shoulder straps evens out the weight.

678,"Have you seen a yellow-and-black salamander? How about a scarlet frog? Scientists havent spotted either species in more than 20 years.
What happened to them? Are the creatures still out there, or are they
? Something that is extinct is gone completely.
Those are questions that scientists hope to answer. They recently set out around the world in search of those and other long-missing
An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Frogs, toads, and salamanders are amphibians.
Where in the world is this green frog?
The experts are looking for about 100 species. They are searching at least 14 countries on five continents. They will look for the salamander in North America. They hope to find the scarlet frog in South America. Theyre also looking for species in Africa, Asia, and Australia.
Scientists are hopeful that theyll find the amphibiansand soon! If the creatures are out there, they may need help. Many amphibians are
Something that is endangered is at risk of becoming extinct. The animals face dangers including pollution and diseases. Loggers cut down the forests where they live.

Scientists hunt for missing amphibians is under way. Read about some of the species they hope to find.
This salamander is a mystery to scientists. Experts found a few of the critters more than 100 years ago, but none have been seen since.
Experts first discovered this frog in 1914 in eastern Australia. It may be extinct because of disease and habitat loss.
Scientists hope to find this spotted toad in rivers and rain forests in Ecuador. The animal faces threats including pollution and disease.
Why might scientists want to keep track of the worlds animal species?

695,"Get ready to sing Happy Birthday! On July 9, a new nation will be born.
That country may be called the Republic of South Sudan. It is in Africa. Earlier this year, southern Sudans people voted to become an
or free, country. They recently announced the results of the election.
The future nation is currently part of Sudan. That is the largest country in Africa. More than 2 million people in southern Sudan voted to
from northern Sudan. To separate is to pull apart.
The north and the south had been at war on and off for more than 50 years. Most people in the north follow a religion called Islam (iss-LAHM). People in the south practice Christianity and other religions. Some of the fighting happened because Sudans government tried to make people in the south follow Islams rules.
Soon, southern Sudans people will govern themselves. It wont be easy, world leaders say. The area is very poor. More than half of southern Sudans population lives on less than $1 a day. Many people do not have access to clean water.
A man works on an oil rig in southern Sudan.
The young nation will be rich in one thing, thoughoil. Southern Sudan produces about 375,000 barrels of oil a day. The south used to share its oil money with the north. Now it will keep the money and pay the north to help move the oil.
Southern Sudans leaders are hopeful about the future. We are a ... nation that has just been born, says official Pagan Amum. And like a human baby, we are
[or weak] but have the [chance] to become great.
247,105 square miles (slightly smaller than Texas)
7.5 million to 9.7 million people (about the same size as New Jersey)
What challenges might southern Sudan face? Why?

299,"Talk about lost and found! A team of scientists recently discovered some tiny critters in Indonesia. They are called pygmy tarsiers (PIG-mee TAWR-see-uhrss). Indonesia is a country in Asia.
Pygmy tarsier: Sharon Gursky-Doyen; Map: Leigh Haeger
Scientists thought this little creature was lost forever.
, or completely gone. Thats because no one had seen the animals alive for about 70 years.
. Primates are an animal group that includes humans, apes, and monkeys. The little fur ball is less than 4 inches long. It weighs about 2 ounces. It has wide eyes, big ears, and a long tail.
Scientists caught three pygmy tarsierstwo males and one female. They attached radio collars to their necks. Then they released the animals. When scientists return to Indonesia, they will track the collars to find and study the creatures.
Professor Sharon Gursky-Doyen helped find the critters. She told

407,"This year marks the 50th anniversary of a famous decision that changed American history. It all started with a court case called
In 1951, Linda Brown from Topeka, Kansas, was in third grade. She was one of many African American kids who were forced to attend schools separate from those for white students. Linda's school was miles away from her home. She was not allowed to attend a whites-only school that was just a few blocks away.
Linda's parents and 12 other families sued the Kansas school system. The case was taken all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
On May 17, 1954, the Court ruled that it was unfair to have separate schools for black and white students.

757,"Scientists say changing cows' diets may make the planet healthier.
Everyone knows that burping is rude, but cows do it all the time. They do it every 40 seconds! The noisy burst of gas is more than just bad manners. It's bad for the environment.
. That is a colorless, odorless gas. Methane is one of the gases that contribute to global warming. Global warming is the slow rise of Earth's temperature. Scientists say one cow releases up to 150 gallons of methane a day!
All that belching adds up. There are 100 million cows in the United States. They are responsible for 20 percent of the nation's methane production.
The methane is produced in cows' stomachs when they digest their food. The gas comes out when cows exhale.
Experts are worried about the planet. ""[Cows, and other animals'] contribution to environmental problems is on a [huge] scale,"" officials wrote in a report.
Scientists are trying to figure out ways of lowering cows' methane production. Some researchers say they have created a pill that could do that.
Other researchers want to change cows' diets. Some scientists think cows should eat more natural sugar. Other researchers want to add extra fats from coconuts or sunflower seeds to cattle feed. That could make cowsand the planethealthier!

442,"What would you get if you crossed a dinosaur, a bird, and Bugs Bunny? You might get a bucktoothed dinosaur. Scientists recently found the remains of such a dinosaur in China. The dino has birdlike wings and two large buckteeth!

64,"Twelve-year-old Sydney Davis knows how popular wristbands have become as a way of raising money. She thought,
Sydney Davis has had diabetes since she was 5 years old. She is one of 18 million people in the United States with this illness. In a person with diabetes, the body makes little or no
. Insulin helps the body use the sugar in food for energy.
Sydney came up with the idea to put the slogan ""Cure Diabetes Today"" on blue wristbands. She and her friend Daniel Rosen, 13, who also has diabetes, sold the wristbands in their New Jersey community. After only a month, they had sold 10,000!
Soon after, the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center in New York began selling the wristbands on its Web site. The bands became an even bigger hit! ""We made over $100,000 already,"" Sydney told

or types, of ocean creatures off the coast of Indonesia. That is a country in Asia. The new species live in the Birds Head Seascape. It is part of the ""Coral Triangle."" The Coral Triangle is a big area in the Indian Ocean. It is home to more than 1,200 species of fish and almost 600 species of corals.
The discoveries include 24 species of fish, 8 species of shrimp, and 20 species of

200,"If you are mailing thank-you notes after the holiday season, each note will cost you a penny more. Starting this month, the U.S. Postal Service has increased the price of first-class stamps to 34 cents. The one-penny increase will raise about $2.5 billion (that's eight zeroes!) for the U.S. Postal Service.

561,"You may think of your cat as just a pet, but if you lived in ancient Egypt, you might consider the animal a god! Egypt is a country in Africa. Cats were considered
or holy, in that country long ago. In fact,
there recently found a building dedicated to a cat goddess. An archaeologist is a person who studies ancient people and cultures.
The building is 200 feet high and 49 feet wide. It is more than 2,000 years old and is filled with about 600 cat statues. Many are of the cat goddess Bastet (below). Ancient Egyptians prayed to her to protect women and children.
The cat building shows that animals were honored in Egypt longer than people realized, explains Mohammed Abdel-Maqsood. He led the team of archaeologists who made the discovery. This is one of the most important discoveries in [this part of Egypt] in the last hundred years, he says.

28,"Too much chocolate may be unhealthy for you, but researchers have found a way to make the treat good for the environment.
This veggie vehicle can reach 135 miles per hour!
in England are using chocolate to power the worlds first Earth-friendly race car. An engineer is a person who designs and builds things. England is a country in Europe.
The vehicle is named WorldFirst. Engineers built the car with
parts. Something that is renewable can be used again.
WorldFirst can run on fuel made from chocolate and vegetable oils. The car zooms from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds.
The fuel isnt the only part of the car that can be bought at a grocery store. WorldFirsts steering wheel is partly made from carrots and other vegetables. The cars mirrors are part potato, and the seat is made with soybean oil. Does that sound nutty? You bet! WorldFirsts brakes will be made with cashews.

746,"A boy pens a butterfly book and helps animals.
Erik Uebelacker has caught the writing bug! It all began in the second grade. Thats when the student from Bel Air, Maryland, learned a fun fact about butterflies.
They taste with their feet, Erik told
I was surprised when I heard that, so I decided to [write about it].
Write he did. Today, Erik, 10, is the author of a book. The book is called
The fifth grader has sold more than 700 copies of his book. Erik has donated the $3,100 in
he made to a wildlife group that protects endangered animals. Profits are earnings.
Because of his efforts, Erik was recently chosen as one of the top kid volunteers in the country. He was picked by an awards program. It is called the Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes.
Erik became interested in butterflies funny feet in science class. He learned that the fliers have taste
in their feet. An organ is a body part. When the butterflies stand on leaves, their feet taste them. If the leaves taste good, the critters will lay their eggs on them.
In Eriks book, butterflies that wear shoes taste only shoes. Everything might taste like dirty socks to them, he explains.
or print, another book. If he does, the young writer says, he will continue to give away his earnings. My favorite part about writing is donating the money ... to a good cause, Erik says. I just feel inspired.
What cool tricks do butterflies have up their wings? Read to learn more about the critters.
Butterflies can see green, red, and yellow. They can also spot things humans cant, such as patterns on flowers.
Butterflies may look colorful, but parts of their wings are clear. The wings are covered in scales.
Some butterfly species can fly to heights of 10,000 feet. Most species fly about 12 miles per hour.
Why might some people want to donate money instead of keeping it for themselves?

264,"Why do some plants and animals die out?
Venice is a famous city in Italy. It is built on small islands. To get around the city, people travel by boat. Over the years, Venice has been sinking slowly into the sea. Water levels are rising and causing flooding. The city needs help to stay above water.
The government of Italy has a plan to save the city from floods. Government officials want to build a system of gates. The gates would block the seawater from flooding the city.
The gates would take about ten years to complete. If the plan is a success, Venice will be saved from being swallowed by the sea.

514,"In 1971, President Richard Nixon set aside the third Monday in February as Presidents' Day. This day is meant to honor the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln (February 12) and President George Washington (February 22).
Some people observe the birthdays of all past presidents of the United States on Presidents' Day. This year, Presidents' Day is February 19.
Including President George W. Bush, 42 people have been president of the United States. (President Grover Cleveland served two separate terms. He is counted as the 22nd and 24th president.) That means that the birthdays of 42 presidents can be remembered on Presidents' Day.
President Bush was born on July 6, 1946.

324,"Mount Rushmore is huge. Each president's head is as tall as a six-story building!
The faces of Mount Rushmore are bright and shiny now. They were washed this summer for the first time in 65 years!
Mount Rushmore is a national memorial in South Dakota. It is a rock carving of the faces of four American presidentsGeorge Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln.
Cleaning the huge carving was no easy task. For weeks, workers climbed over eyeballs and under nostrils. They sprayed the rock with hot water.
The cleaning removed years of dirt. However, the main goal of the job was to remove
(LIGH-kenz). A lichen is a plant that grows on rocks and trees. The lichen roots dig into the rock and can cause cracks.
The work was a success, say officials. They believe the carving will be around for a very long time. And thanks to workers, it is also squeaky-clean.

552,"Hundreds of jumbo jellyfish are invading the Sea of Japan. Each creature weighs about 450 pounds and is 6 feet wide!
Scientists arent quite sure what has caused the jellyfish boom, but it is a huge problem. It is affecting the fishing industry in Japan, China, and South Korea.
The jellyfish break fishing nets. They also poison fish caught in the nets.
The three countries recently held a meeting to find ways of dealing with the problem. In the meantime, some people are making the best of it by eating the giant jellyfish! In parts of China, they are a prized food.

241,"What did Casey Sokolovic decide to do when she learned that sea turtles were in trouble? A lot!
The student from Winterville, N.C., founded a program called Help Them LAST. That stands for Love a Sea Turtle. Casey, 11, raises money for the ocean swimmers. She does everything from selling turtle-shaped cookies to organizing fund-raising events at her school. So far, Caseys program has raised about $2,500 for a local center that cares for sea turtles.
The reptiles are at risk of losing their
or home. People overcrowd the beaches where sea turtles lay their eggs. Some of the animals are killed or
by boats. To be injured is to be hurt.
Casey is always coming up with new ways to help sea turtles. Recently, she teamed up with a coffee company to raise money for the animals. She also hopes to create a sea turtle Web site.

455,"U.S. President Barack Obama wants to bring our country up to speed.
That is technology that allows computers to link to the Internet without using wires. About two-thirds of U.S. homes have wireless Internet. The president hopes to bring the technology to the rest of Americans.
Having wireless Internet could change how schools and businesses run, Obama says. The technology could help kids finish their schoolwork from home, he recently explained. Also, firefighters could quickly download information on their way to burning buildings.
The plan will go to Congress for approval. If it passes, Obama will work to bring wireless Internet to towns that dont have it. He will also build a special wireless network for police and other emergency workers.

Coral reefs are important to ocean life. The reefs are home to thousands of
, or kinds, of sea creatures. ""If you didn't have the reefs, you wouldn't have the fish or the pretty sponges or soft corals that wave back and forth,"" said scientist Richard Dodge.
Coral polyps create hard skeletons around themselves. The skeletons form coral reefs. The skeletons are made of calcium. Calcium is the same thing that makes up your skeleton! When coral polyps die, they leave behind their skeletons. Young polyps attach themselves to the old skeletons.
A recent report says many coral reefs in U.S. waters are in bad health. The polyps that make the reefs are in danger of dying. Scientists, such as the ones in Florida, are trying to save the reefs.
Coral reefs face many threats. Millions of tourists visit coral reefs every year. People kill corals by simply touching them. Ships that drop anchors on the reefs can damage them. Other threats include storms, pollution, and disease.
Scientists want to make the public aware of the threat to coral reefs. They are using the report on coral reefs to do just that. ""It's a valuable tool for raising public awareness about the global decline of these unique treasures,"" said government official Craig Manson.

306,"The Exxon Valdez oil spill was one of the worst oil spills in U.S. history
One of the worst oil spills in U.S. history happened in Prince William Sound, off the coast of Alaska. On March 24, 1989, the oil tanker
hit some rocks. The damaged ship spilled about 11 million gallons of oil into the water.
Oil polluted about 1,000 miles of Alaskan coastline. Many kinds of animals, such as seals, killer whales, ducks, otters, and fish, died because of the spill.

A hurricane is a large, powerful storm that forms over an ocean. A hurricane has strong winds and a lot of rain. When a hurricane moves over land, it can cause a lot of damage.
Between August and late September, four hurricanes hit Florida. The storms left many people without electricity. Some families even lost their homes.
Students at Mintz Elementary wanted to help those families. They donated hundreds of items and more than $2,000 to the Red Cross! That is an organization that helps people in need.

""These new dietary guidelines represent our best ... advice to help Americans live healthier and longer lives,"" said one government official.

480,"Welcome home, Hua Mei (HWAH MAY)! Hua Mei is the first giant panda born in the United States to survive and go to the panda's homeland of China.
Hua Mei, now 4 years old, was born at the San Diego Zoo in California.
In 1996, China loaned her parents to the United States. The two nations agreed that any cubs born in the United States would be sent to China.
A few months ago, Hua Mei arrived in China by airplane. Now she lives in a protected nature center with other pandas. ""She seems quite happy to be in the land of her ancestors,"" said one spokesperson.

142,"The U.S. Mint will release the last five state quarters this year!
Many kids are checking their coins for new state quarters. This year, they can complete their collections. The
will release the last five of the 50 state quarters starting this month. The U.S. Mint is the place that makes coins.
The 50 State Quarters Program began in 1999. Since then, the U.S. Mint has made five new state quarters each year. The coins are released to the public in the order in which each state became part of the United States.
The front, or heads side, of each state quarter is the same. They all have a picture of George Washington. He was the first president of the United States. He became president in 1789.
The back, or tails side, of each state quarter is
(yoo-NEEK). That means one of a kind. The design shows something special about that state. ""The program teaches people about the rich history of the states,"" says Michael White. He is a spokesperson for the U.S. Mint.
Many kids and adults started collecting coins in 1999 because of the new state quarters. ""It is, by far, the most popular and successful program in U.S. Mint history,"" says White. ""More than 140 million Americans collect them.""
Until 1965, quarters were made of silver. Today, quarters are made of copper and nickel.
New Jersey's quarter has a picture of George Washington on each side.
Coins last for about 30 years. Paper money lasts only about 18 months.
The main office of the U.S. Mint is in Washington, D.C. Offices are also located in five other cities across the United States. Study the map to learn more.
The U.S. Mint in Philadelphia is the largest mint in the world!

188,"Martin Luther King Jr. Was a Leader
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King addresses a group of followers.
Martin Luther King Jr. worked to help many people. He became a famous leader. Today, people in the United States remember him with a special holiday.
Martin Luther King Jr. grew up in the South. In the South, black people were treated differently than other people. Some black people had to use different bathrooms and water fountains from the ones used by other people. Many black people also had to sit in the back seats of buses.
Martin Luther King Jr. stood up for people who were treated unfairly. He worked to stop the unfair treatment. King wanted all people to be treated the same, no matter how they looked or what they believed.
Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a national holiday. On this day, people work to honor Martin Luther King Jr. Today, some people are building a
for him. A memorial is a special statue or place that honors a person. The memorial for King will be built in Washington, D.C. near the Potomac River. The memorial will help people remember Martin Luther King Jr.
How will you celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day?

597,"On September 15, a runner will carry a torch into the Olympic stadium in Sydney, Australia. When the runner arrives, the 2000 Summer Olympic Games can begin!
The torch traveled for 128 days from Greece, a country in Europe. It was carried by more than 13,000 people. The torch was carried on an airplane, in a helicopter, and on a camel's back. It was even carried by a diver underwater!
The torch is special because the smoke from the torch's flame does not pollute the air. Empty fuel cans and leftover fuel will be used again.
The torch also has a built-in safety system. If the torch is turned upside down or left lying on the ground, the flame goes out.
The torch will light the Olympic flame in Sydney. The flame will burn until the Games are finished on October 1.
More than 100 countries will send their best athletes to compete in the Olympics. The United States will send at least 200 athletes to the Games.
The top three finishers in each event win a medal. First-place finishers win a gold medal, second-place finishers win a silver medal, and third-place finishers win a bronze medal.
The first Olympics took place long ago in Greece. The Olympics helped keep peace among different groups of people.

309,"Most bats nap in caves or trees. One kind of bat naps in a strange place. It snoozes inside the leaves of a bug-eating plant! That is what scientists recently discovered.
A Hardwickes woolly bat naps in a pitcher plant leaf. Can you spot the bat?
The plants leaves are shaped like cups. They trap bugs inside. The bat is safe there. It stays hidden from
. A predator is an animal that eats another animal for food.
The bat leaves behind something that helps the plantpoop. It becomes food for the plant.

416,". Mammals are animals that drink milk from their mothers. Whales live in oceans. There are many kinds of whales. Whales are some of the biggest animals alive.
. Krill are tiny animals that look like shrimp. The humpback opens its mouth and takes in water and krill. Grooves in the whale's throat stretch to help it hold a lot of water and food. Then it pushes the water out and eats the krill.
All whales, like blue whales, breathe air through
. A blowhole is an opening on top of a whale's head. The blowhole is closed when the whale is under the water. When the whale comes to the top, its blowhole opens. The whale breathes out, making water spray into the air. Then the whale breathes in and goes under the water again.
Killer whales breach, or jump out of the water.
. A breaching whale jumps up out of the water. Then it comes down and makes a huge splash!
No one is sure why whales breach. Some people say that they do it just for fun!

42,"You cant see them, but millions of pieces of junk are flying around Earth. The junk is called
(deh-BREE). It includes parts of old satellites. The largest piece of debris is part of a rocket about the size of a car. The tiniest pieces are flecks of paint.
The debris can damage working satellites. It can also hit old satellites and break them apart. That creates more space trash.
Scientists are tracking the pieces of debris in space. However, that is not easy. All working satellites and debris are moving very fast, and in all different directions, says NASA scientist Nicholas Johnson. NASA is the U.S. space agency.
Can scientists solve the space junk problem? Countries around the world have agreed to reduce the amount of new space junk, says Johnson. We are working on getting rid of the old stuff, but we havent figured out how yet. The good news is that we caught this before it started to get out of hand.
The dots show objects in Earths orbit that are being tracked by scientists.

460,"Scientists are hopping with joy. They recently found a new
, or type, of frog. It lives in Colombia. That is a country in South America.
The frog is very small. It is less than an inch long. Its skin is a golden color.
Scientists say the frog is part of a group called poison dart frogs. The frog's poison may injure or kill an animal that eats it. That is why poison dart frogs are so colorful. Their bright colors warn

523,"Veterans Day is November 11. It is a time to
brave Americans. To honor is to show great respect.
Veterans are men and women who have served in the
. The armed forces are five groups that keep our country safe. They are the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps (KOHR), and Coast Guard.
About 25 million veterans live in our country today. Many of those people have fought in wars. They have also served in times of peace.
Many cities have parades on Veterans Day. Bands play music and march down the streets. Veterans march too.
People wave American flags. The flag is a
of our freedom. A symbol is an object or a sign that stands for something else. What other symbols of our country can you name?

 He started writing in a journal at age 16. He had good handwriting. He wrote about what he did each day.
 He was a soldier and a farmer before he became president.
 He had many dogs and horses. He also had a parrot named Polly.
 At the age of 22, he started to lose his teeth. When he became president, he had only one tooth left. He wore false teeth.
 He never lived in the White House. Why? It had not been built yet. Work on the White House was started in 1792. It was finished in 1800.
Abraham Lincoln was our 16th president. He was born in Kentucky on February 12, 1809. He was president from 1861 to 1865.

 He had goats, dogs, and a cat named Tabby. Tabby was the first cat to live in the White House.
 He was the tallest president. He was 6 feet 4 inches tall.

They are active at night. They sleep during the day.
Many owls, bats, and snakes are nocturnal. They have special ways to find
in the dark. Prey is an animal that is hunted by another animal for food.
Owls can see well at night. They also have great hearing. The feathers on the edge of their wings are soft. That lets owls fly quietly. They can sneak up on their prey. Owls hunt mice and other small animals.

Most bats eat insects. Bats have a special way of finding food. They make high-pitched sounds. The sounds bounce off insects and return to the bats. That lets the bats know where to find the insects.
Pit vipers are snakes. They sense the heat of other animals. Their heat sensors are inside holes on their faces. The holes are called pits. They help the snakes find their prey in the dark. Pit vipers eat frogs and other small animals.
How might being nocturnal help animals survive?

300,"More than 100 spiders are crawling around a museum in California. The Natural History Museum created a world just for those spiders in its greenhouse. A
Visitors can see many different kinds of spiders, such as the golden silk spider. That is one of the largest spiders in North and South America. Golden silk spiders build strong webs.

79,"School has changed in some ways over time. Lets learn about those ways.
Schools did not always have computers. How is school today different from school many years ago?
Then: Many schoolhouses had only one classroom. Students of all ages learned together.
Now: Most school buildings have many classrooms. Students in each class are about the same age.
Students listened carefully to a phonograph. That is a machine that plays recordings.
Students use computers during lessons. They wear headphones to listen and learn.
Then: Students raised their hands to answer questions. The teacher called on students to respond.
Now: Students still raise their hands to answer questions. That is one way school has not changed.

81,"Earth Day is a time for people to think about taking care of Earth. People can celebrate Earth Day by keeping plants and animals healthy. They can also help keep Earth clean. But taking care of Earth is important all of the time. Turn the page to see how you can be Earth-friendly every day!
Each person in the United States makes about 4 pounds of trash per day! So landfills, or places where people dump trash, are starting to get full. People should reduce, or make smaller, the amount of trash they throw away.
Paper takes up the largest amount of space in most landfills. Paper does not easily biodegrade, or break down. But paper is easily recycled, or used again, after going through a special process.
Recycle by taking old newspapers or old homework to a recycling center.
Some trash in landfills could be used for other things! Instead of throwing trash away, people should find more ways to reuse it, or use trash again.
Reuse the top of a pizza box as an easel. Use the bottom part of the box to store your art supplies.
Many times people forget to respect, or care for, Earth. One way to show respect for Earth is to use less water, electricity, and gasoline.
Respect Earth by turning off the water faucet while you are brushing your teeth.

545,"Tagging horseshoe crabs increases our understanding of their migration, survival, and abundance.
The horseshoe crab population in the United States is going down. Scientists say that too many horseshoe crabs are being caught by fishermen. Fishermen use horseshoe crabs to catch fish.
Scientists fear that many animals will be endangered if there are too few horseshoe crabs. Many animals eat horseshoe crabs.
To help the horseshoe crab, the government has made a rule saying how many crabs each state can catch. States must not catch more than that number. Scientists say the rule may mean there will be more horseshoe crabs soon.

623,"How do bugs exchange thoughts and ideas?
If insects could talk, what might they say? I found food. Are you a relative? Watch out for danger! Of course, insects dont talk the way people do, but they do
with one another. That means they exchange information.
A bee does the waggle dance. It walks in a figure eight and shakes its body. The farther away the food, the longer the bee shakes. The direction in which it walks tells other bees the way to the food.
Honeybees get food from flowers. When a honeybee finds a field of flowers, it flies back to the hive. The bee tells the other bees where to find the food. How? It dances! The round dance shows that food is nearby. If the food is far away, the bee performs the waggle dance. That dance shows the location of the food.
Fireflies have a chemical inside their bodies. It makes light. Fireflies flash lights at one another. Each
or kind, of firefly has a different flash pattern. That helps the insects find members of their own species. The flash pattern also helps male and female fireflies find one another
Grasshoppers send messages by chirping. They often rub a back leg against a wing. That causes a vibration and makes sound. Mostly male grasshoppers make sounds. They chirp to attract females. Each species of grasshopper has its own call. Some grasshoppers make sounds to warn other males to go away.
A leaf-cutter ant carries a piece of a leaf back to its nest.
Ants give off scents to pass along messages. If an ant finds food, it goes back to its nest. The ant leaves a scent trail along the way. Other ants follow the trail to find the food. They walk with their antennae to the ground. Why? Ants smell with their antennae. Ants can also leave a special scent to warn about danger.
What are some ways that people communicate besides talking?

525,"Hundreds of cows are visiting U.S. cities. But they are not real cows. The cows are statues dressed in costumes. Some look like clowns. Some wear cowboy boots! These crazy cow statues are starring in an art show called Cow Parade 2000.

622,"Our national anthem is ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Did you know that the song is about a 200-year-old flag? Workers from a museum in Washington, D.C., are trying to make the flag look new again.
Fixing the flag is a big job. The flag is 42 feet long and 30 feet wide! Workers lie on their stomachs on a platform above the flag.
The workers have removed material that covered the back of the flag. The workers had to cut 1.7 million stitches!

254,"Students raise their voices over green beans.
Lunch is now much tastier at Wright Elementary School in Nevada. The menu changed, thanks to a class of second graders.
The students did not like eating green beans. What did they do about it? They wrote letters to the school's food service.
""The food is great, but there's one problem. The kids don't like green beans,"" wrote one student. Another letter said, ""We love lunch, but we were wondering if you can pretty please change the green beans.""
The food service officials read all the letters. They asked the kids for their help. Read the steps below to see how students changed the lunch menu. Now all the kids can enjoy the new vegetable choices.
How many colors do you eat? Brightly colored fruits and vegetables are healthy. Experts say kids should eat a rainbow of colors. Each color helps the body in a different way. Read the chart to learn more.
Along with fruits and vegetables, what are other healthy foods? Why is eating healthy food important?

52,"Lava is flowing out of a volcano in Hawaii. The volcano is named Kilauea (kee-lah-WAY-ah). It is one of the worlds most active volcanoes. It has been erupting for more than 25 years!
Scientists are keeping a close watch on Kilauea. They want to make sure people living nearby are safe.
The lava from Kilauea goes into the Pacific Ocean. The lava cools. Then, it hardens into rock. The rock forms new land over time.
Many people visit Kilauea each year. This is one of the few places in the world where you can get really close to an actively erupting volcano, says scientist Jim Kauahikaua (koh-wah-hee-KOH-wah). Its really cool.

214,"2008 is the Chinese Year of the Rat.
February 7 is Chinese New Year! The celebration lasts 15 days. Each Chinese year is named after one of 12 animals. This is the Year of the Rat.
People prepare for the holiday before the actual day. They clean their homes and decorate them with flowers and poems. The poems are happy messages of good luck. People also put out bowls of tangerines, oranges, dried fruits, and candy to wish visitors a sweet new year.
On the first night of the celebration, families and friends gather for a special meal. Many people wear new red clothing. They eat foods such as dumplings, fish, and long noodles. Sweet, sticky rice cakes are a favorite treat.
The Chinese New Year celebration ends with the Lantern Festival. It includes music, dancing, and fireworks. Kids carry lanterns in a parade under the light of a full moon. The highlight of the parade is the dragon dance. Dancers carry a long dragon made of silk, paper, and bamboo through the streets. The dragon may stretch more than 100 feet!

. Polluted water has harmful chemicals or trash in it. Those things can get into water in many ways. For example, chemicals can get into water if a factory dumps them into a river. Because water travels in a cycle, it can carry those chemicals into the ocean, the air, and the ground. Trash can get into our water when people dump it in the wrong places. Trash in the water can be very harmful to animals and plants.
You can help keep Earth's water clean too! Everything you do affects Earth's water in some way. Take a look at these tips.

Pick up trash you see on the ground and don't litter.

--The liquid falls from the clouds to the ground as rain or snow.
--The rain or snow ends up in rivers, lakes, and oceans again.
