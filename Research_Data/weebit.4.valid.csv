Alan Davie: 'To a Celtic Spirit, 1'
Alan Davie is a prominent Scottish artist well known for his work in a range of mediums including drawing, painting, and screenprinting.
He was born in 1920 and graduated from the Edinburgh Royal College of Art in 1940. After serving in World War II he began teaching in Edinburgh and in 1947 became a professional jazz musician.
In 1948 he took up a travelling art scholarship from the college and travelled throughout Europe in 1948-9. In Venice he met
, an influential art collector, who introduced him to
. Whilst exhibiting in New York in 1956 he befriended other artists including
Jackson Pollock, Willem De Kooning and Mark Rothko
His work continues to be widely exhibited across the USA and Europe.
and reflects the artist's love of jazz music, non-western cultural symbols, ancient religious and ethnic influences.
My ideas are intuitive and most ideas come from my thoughts. The art I create is no way expressive or impressionist, it just comes from an artist drive I have to keep on creating.
The work of art seems to be something thrown off, a by-product of the process of being and working. Art just happens, like falling in love.
When I am working, I am aware of a striving, a yearning, the making of many impossible attempts at a kind of transmutation  a searching for a formula for the magical conjuring of the unknowable. Many times the end seems just within reach, only to fly to pieces before me as I reach for it.
I paint because I have nothing, or I paint because I am full of ideas ... or I paint because after I last painted, something appeared miraculously out of it.
The titles are not necessarily directly linked to the image, they are more often terms I have to use to catalogue the artwork I have created.
Inside is a place of magic; resounding, surrounding, where big hanging works in progress are constantly being transformed and re-worked, making a shifting environment of developing moods, spaces, colours, forms, poetry fragments, script, signs and symbols, laughing, singing.

81,"Moniza Alvi: Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan
Moniza Alvi: Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan
Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. 'Attitude' can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
How do you think this poem should be read?
In a confused voice, as if the girl cannot decide whether she is more Pakistani or English?
Wistfully, as if she regrets having lost her original culture?
Gratefully, as she thinks about the beautiful, exotic gifts?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
In an interview, Moniza Alvi has said:
Growing up, I felt that my origins were invisible, because there weren't many people to identify with in Hatfield at that time of a mixed race background or indeed from any other race, so I felt there was a bit of a blank drawn over that. I think I had a fairly typically English 1950s/1960s upbringing.
When I eventually went to Pakistan, I certainly didn't feel that was home, I'd never felt so English. But I never feel entirely at home in England, and, of course, I'm not part of the Asian community at all. And it feels a bit odd sometimes that because of the group of poems that I've written about my Asian background, I sometimes tend to be identified as a black writer. I tend to think of England as being very culturally mixed now.
But it's important to know where you come from, which is perhaps what I was lacking as a child. I think it's important to know what has gone into your making, even quite far back, I think it gives you a sense perhaps of richness.

5674,"When chemicals react with each other, different chemicals are made. One of the best ways to describe what is happening is by writing a chemical equation.
A chemical equation tells you which chemicals reacted together (the
) and the new chemicals that were made in the reaction (the
The simplest equation is a word equation. For example:
A symbol equation gives more information about what is happening in the reaction:
Each of the reactants and products is shown as a formula. This formula shows how many atoms of each element are present.
The formula for sodium is Na - the same as its symbol.
, because the halogens exist as molecules of two atoms (
Each of the Group 1 halides has a formula with one symbol for the metal and one for the halogen. So, for sodium chloride the formula is NaCl.
The numbers in front of the formulae are there to
the equation. This gives the same number of atoms of each element on each side of the equation.
For the exam you will be expected to know the following formulae:
Halides of Group 1 metals - for example:

104,"Metals are very useful. Ores are naturally occurring rocks that contain metal or metal compounds in sufficient amounts to make it worthwhile extracting them. For example, iron ore is used to make iron and steel. Copper is easily extracted, but ores rich in copper are becoming more difficult to find. Aluminium and titanium are metals with useful properties, but they are expensive to extract. Most everyday metals are mixtures called alloys.
The outer layer of the Earth, on top of the mantle. It is between 6 and 48 kilometres thick and includes the continents and the ocean floor.
Substances formed by the chemical union (involving bond formation) of two or more elements.
such as gold, iron oxide and aluminium oxide, but when found in the Earth these are often mixed with other substances. To be useful, the metals have to be extracted from whatever they are mixed with. A
is a rock containing a metal, or a metal compound, in a high enough concentration to make it economic to extract the metal.
The method used to extract metals from the ore in which they are found depends on their reactivity. For example, reactive metals such as aluminium are extracted by
Electrolysis is the decomposition (separation or break-down) of a compound using an electric current.
, while a less-reactive metal such as iron may be extracted by
Reduction is a reaction in which oxygen is removed from a substance. Reduction also means a gain in electrons.
Thus the method of extraction of a metal from its ore depends on the metal's position in the reactivity series:
Metals - in decreasing order of reactivity

2508,"German 19th-century scholar, who founded Marxism (key theory of Communism).
People should contribute to the public wealth according to their ability, but receive according to their needs.
The means of production should be owned equally by the whole community (hence communism), not as in capitalism where individuals (who might be very rich) own the means of production and leave the rest of society to be poor and oppressed wage slaves.
A deterministic interpretation of history, which said that society must inevitably develop through successive stages of slavery, feudalism, then capitalism, ending up with the violent overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a communist society.
They should work to overthrow capitalism throughout the world by means of a revolution by the proletariat (workers).
Class was a feature of capitalist society, and should be destroyed and replaced by a society of equals.
The economy should be planned - controlled by the government.
Lenin changed Marx's ideas to add that a Communist government first had to be a dictatorship which was essential in order to bring in the communist state safely.

4343,"All the alkali metals react vigorously with cold water. In each reaction,
is produced. The speed and violence of the reaction
as you go down the group. This shows that the reactivity of the alkali metals increases as you go down Group 1.
When lithium is added to water, lithium floats. It fizzes steadily and becomes smaller, until it eventually disappears.
lithium + water  lithium hydroxide + hydrogen
When sodium is added to water, the sodium melts to form a ball that moves around on the surface. It fizzes rapidly, and the hydrogen produced may burn with an orange flame before the sodium disappears.
sodium + water  sodium hydroxide + hydrogen
When potassium is added to water, the metal melts and floats. It moves around very quickly on the surface of the water. The hydrogen ignites instantly. The metal is also set on fire, with sparks and a lilac flame. There is sometimes a small explosion at the end of the reaction.
potassium + water  potassium hydroxide + hydrogen
The hydroxides formed in all of these reactions dissolve in water to form alkaline solutions. These solutions turn universal indicator purple, showing they are strongly

How other people work - examples to help with AO3
We have split Gamze's work journal into two halves, so you can see her research development and then the final ceramic pieces she created.
She started work by studying things from the sea from first-hand experience. She looked at shells, coral, fish, sea creatures, seaweed etc, and used water colours, pen and pencil.
Gamze looked at pictures of sea life in books, and at artwork by different artists. She planned to work in ceramics and so she also looked at the work of ceramicists like Kate Malone.
Gamze also developed her ideas by looking at work from different times and places in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Renaissance knowledge about the body and disease
The Early Modern Age was an exciting time for medicine, with knowledge of the human body progressing in fundamental ways - although the causes of disease remained a mystery.
Two key practitioners moved knowledge forwards in the Early Modern Age:
Follower of Vesalius in graveyard, searching for bodies to dissect
, whose patron was Charles V of Spain. He trained at Louvain, Paris and Padua universities, and ransacked cemeteries and gibbets for bones and for bodies to dissect.
. He also realised that the famous doctor Galen could be wrong, when he discovered that the great man was mistaken about there being two bones in the jaw, and about how muscles were attached to the bone.
He became professor of medicine at Padua University. He said that medical students should perform
""... our true book of the human body is man himself.""
He published 'Fabric of the Human Body' (with high-quality annotated illustrations).
- who discovered the principle of the
through the body. He trained at Cambridge and Padua universities, and became doctor to James I and Charles I of England.
He calculated that it was impossible for the blood to be burned up in the muscles (as Galen had claimed).
He published 'Anatomical Account of the Motion of the Heart and Blood', which scientifically proved the principle of the circulation of the blood. This book marked the end of Galen's influence on anatomy.

4518,"can be used as the starting point to calculate the quantities of
Step 1: write down the balanced symbol equation
Sulfuric acid is neutralised by sodium hydroxide, to make sodium sulfate and water, according to the following equation:
Step 2: work out the relative formula mass
The relative formula masses of the reactants and products can be worked out using relative atomic masses obtained from the periodic table.
relative formula mass = (2 x 1) + 32 + (4 x 16) = 98
NaOH relative formula mass = 23 + 16 + 1 = 40
relative formula mass = (2 x 23) + 32 + (4 x 16) = 142
O relative formula mass = (2 x 1) + 16 = 18
Step 3: work out the masses of reactants and products
The masses of reactants and products can now be worked out from the equation:
98 + (2x40) = 142 + (2x18)
98 + 80 = 142 + 36
These numbers can now be applied to
- grams, kilograms, tonnes, and so on. Now try the questions below.
What mass of sulfuric acid reacts with sodium hydroxide to produce 10g of sodium sulfate?
is made from 10 x (98  142) = 6.9g of H
What mass of sodium sulfate is made when 5.0 tonnes of sodium hydroxide is reacted with sulfuric acid?
80 tonnes of NaOH is used to make 142 tonnes of Na
5.0 tonnes of NaOH is used to make 5 x (142  80) = 8.875 tonnes of Na

41,"An electronics product can be thought of as a
with inputs, processes and outputs. The most common method of manufacturing electronic products is the batch method - though one-off production and continuous-flow production are also important.
ICT is used extensively in electronics manufacturing. The use of machines that are controlled by computers is called computer-aided manufacture or CAM.
Electronics systems diagrams are used to show how the parts of a product work together. Many electronic products are made up of a number of standard system circuits (circuits that are common to many different products), such as sensors, amplifiers, timers, counters and output devices.
System diagrams usually take the form of a
in which each part of the electronic system is represented by an input, a process or an output.
The block diagrams below shows two types of system.
has no feedback mechanism, so the accuracy depends on how well the system was set up before hand.
electronic systems use sensors to provide feedback. This means that if the output is not satisfactory, the inputs or processes can be altered.

3160,"(Mishnah and Gemara collected together) describe different roles for men and women.
Traditionally women have a sacred role - they bear children, run the home and take responsibility for their childrens Jewish upbringing. The woman passes on Jewish values and it is because of the mothers Jewish faith (not the fathers) that a child is born Jewish.
While Jewish law excuses women from some religious duties (eg, they dont have to wear the
Fringes on the corners of the Tallit (prayer shawl).
Small leather boxes containing passages from the Torah, strapped to the forehead and arm for morning prayers on weekdays.
) there are some duties that women are obliged to carry out like the lighting the
is the day of spiritual renewal and rest commencing at sunset on Friday, terminating at nightfall on Saturday.)
. Men and women sit separately in Orthodox services and women cannot take an active part in this worship. Some Jewish women today accept these limitations, but they are as well-educated as men and choose to combine a career with family responsibilities.
Progressive Jews (which includes Jews of both liberal and reform traditions) think that this attitude is wrong and treat women equally in all respects, so they too can become rabbis (Jewish teacher) if they choose to do so.

7593,"This Revision Bite will give you practice in creating and structuring a presentation about a famous person in five key sections: introduction, past, present, future and concluding opinion.
In your presentation exam you should speak for about one minute in Irish on a topic you have prepared, then you will be asked questions in Irish about what you have said. You are usually allowed to take a prompt card into the exam with you with five brief points on it and as many pictures as you like, to help you remember what to say.

For his presentation Samus has written five paragraphs about Peter Canavan, but the order of the paragraphs has been jumbled up.

2529,"is not just a book about a man who creates a Monster. Mary Shelley intended her readers to learn from her tale. It contains many of her ideas on how people should behave. These were shaped by her upbringing, relationship with Shelley, and her reading of the works of many famous authors and philosophers. These ideas can be summed up in the main
The novel begins with Walton describing his own voyage of discovery, which he hopes will lead him to the North Pole. On meeting Victor, he hears of another tale of discovery, that of the secret of creating life itself.
The Monster is also on a path of self-discovery, and all three characters share a powerful desire to acquire knowledge - a desire that ultimately leads two of them to their deaths, and which very nearly kills Walton.
The Monster quite naturally seeks knowledge about where it came from and how to survive in a hostile world. Through patient
, it learns how to speak and read. But the knowledge it gains only leads it to curse its existence.
It knows that it can never be accepted in the world of man, yet craves human company and the love of the father who abandoned it. Finally, through learning of the 'sanguinary (bloody) laws of man', the Monster is taught that it can be acceptable to kill in some circumstances. This knowledge leads to the deaths of many innocent people.
Robert Walton was brought up by his uncle, and is self-taught in the art of sea-faring. This is despite his father's dying wish that his uncle forbid him from embarking on a life at sea. His determination to succeed, shown by his willingness to work ""harder than the common sailors during the day (and devote his) nights to the study of mathematics medicine... and physical sciences"", leads him to believe he can be the first to discover the sea passage to the North Pole. However, his real motivation is self-glory, fuelled by overwhelming ambition. This leads to him failing to assess the dangers of his voyage and knowingly putting the lives of his crew at risk.
Victor Frankenstein also puts others' lives at risk, as well as his own, through his ambitious pursuit of knowledge. He neglects his loving family and allows his health to suffer greatly in his obsession to discover the secret of creating life out of death.
Shelley makes it clear she believes knowledge such as this cannot lead to good. Some benefit may have come from finding a way to the North Pole, but no good is shown to come from Victor's creation of the Monster.
She shows Victor's 'success' to have severe and tragic consequences that should serve as a warning to scientists, past, present and future, that knowledge is a very dangerous thing and should only be used for the good of mankind - and certainly not personal gain.

2210,"Public health is about avoiding the spread of disease within a particular society - often through providing water to help people keep themselves, their animals and their surroundings clean. The Egyptians stressed the importance of cleanliness, but this was for
reasons, not in order to keep the population at large healthy.
Archaeologists have discovered that the Egyptians had simple baths and toilets. Egyptian men and women took great care over their
and appearance, and there is evidence that they used eye make-up that helped protect their eyes from diseases. They slept under mosquito nets.
, kept themselves scrupulously clean. They regularly washed themselves, their clothes and their cups.
The Egyptians didn't use cleanliness to ward off disease, however, but instead
a public health system in the modern sense of state-organised sewers, public hygiene or medical care.

4915,"Harmony can be defined as a pleasing arrangement of parts. In art and design, harmony is something that is pleasing to the eye. It engages the viewer and creates an inner sense of order, a balance in the visual experience.
Balance can be defined as the way the elements are arranged to create an equilibirium in an artwork. The three types of balance are
When one side of a composition is reflected in the other. It can also be referred to as formal balance.
When one side of a composition is not reflected in the other. Asymmetrical balance is created when one part of a composition differs from the other without destroying it's overall harmony.
When a composition is based on a circle extending out or towards a central point.
A good composition draws all the elements together to form one harmonious and balanced piece.

2826,"Compare your answer with the hints below:
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Both poems are about water when it is dangerous. Clarke describes a near-drowning while Heaney describes the savage sea in a storm.
In Clarke's poem the water seems to subtly hide its dangers (e.g. satiny mud blooms in cloudiness) but Heaney recognises its force and violence - the flung spray hits the very windows.
Clarke uses the image of water to question our powers of memory, whereas Heaney uses it to show the power of nature.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Like Heaney, Whitman describes a violent storm at sea.
Like Clarke, however, Whitman hints at the supernatural. His references to demoniac laughter and the savage trinity seem on the surface more threatening than the fairytale references in Clarke's poem.
We question the endings of both poems. We wonder about the dim weird forms that Whitman sees and about the lost things that Clarke imagines drowned in the lake.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Yet for Clare, the water is innocent. It is part of the beauty of summer as it supports the wildlife: marsh marigolds and water lilies, moor hens and insects. Clarke also suggests the beauty of the water (e.g. long green silk), but for her it could be hiding something potentially sinister, while for Clare it is simply the clear lake.
The sonnet form suggests Clare's love of the water, while Clarke's use of alternating stanzas and half rhyme suggests an uncertainty. She cannot be sure what is under the water; she cannot be sure of her memory.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

4852,"Generators can be turned directly, for example, by:
When electricity is generated using wave, wind, tidal or hydroelectric power (HEP) there are two steps:
Generators can be turned indirectly using fossil or nuclear fuels. The heat from the fuel boils water to make steam, which expands and pushes against the blades of a
. The spinning turbine then turns the generator.
These are the steps by which electricity is generated from fossil fuels:
Heat is released from fuel and boils the water to make steam.
The turbine turns a generator and electricity is produced.

Any piece of writing. More widely, a text can be anything that conveys meaning - eg, a film, tv programme, advert, website, or image.
. A text may have one theme or many. Understanding the themes makes the text more than 'just' a text - it becomes something more significant, because we're encouraged to think more deeply about the text, to work out what lies beneath its surface.
The title of the book comes from a poem by the 18th century Scottish poet Robbie Burns. It is about a mouse which carefully builds a winter nest in a wheat field, only for it to be destroyed by a ploughman. It is written in Scots

The mouse had dreamed of a safe, warm winter and is now faced with the harsh reality of cold, loneliness and possible death. There is a parallel here with George and Lennie's joyful fantasy of a farm of their own, and its all-too-predictable destruction at the end of the story. Perhaps the is also meant to suggest to us how unpredictable our lives are, and how vulnerable to

The two main themes in 'Of Mice and Men' - foreshadowed by the reference to Burns' mouse - are loneliness and dreams. They interlock: people who are lonely have most need of dreams to help them through.

Loneliness and Dreams in Of Mice and Men
George is not lonely during the novel, as he has Lennie. He will be lonely afterwards, without his best friend.
George and Lennie share a dream - to own a little patch of land and live on it in freedom. He is so set on the idea that he even knows of some land that he thinks they could buy.
Lennie is the only character who is innocent enough not to fear loneliness, but he is angry when Crooks suggests George won't come back to him.
George and Lennie share a dream - to own a little patch of land and live on it in freedom. Lennie's main desire is to tend the soft-haired rabbits they will keep.
She is married to a man she doesn't love and who doesn't love her. There are no other women on the ranch and she has nothing to do. She tries to befriend the men by hanging round the bunkhouse.
She dreams of being a movie star. Her hopes were raised by a man who claimed he would take her to Hollywood, but when she didn't receive a letter from him, she married Curley.
When Candy's ancient, ill dog was shot, Candy has nothing left. He delayed killing the dog, even though he knew deep down that it was the best thing, as he dreaded losing his long-time companion.
Candy joins George and Lennie's plan of owning a piece of land. His savings make the dream actually possible to achieve.
Crooks lives in enforced solitude, away from the other men. He is bitter about being a back-busted nigger. He is thrilled when Lennie and Candy come into his room and are his companions for a night.
Crooks dreams of being seen as equal to everyone else. He knows his civil rights. He remembers fondly his childhood, when he played with white children who came to his family's chicken ranch, and longs for a similar relationship with white people again.

5727,"The poem is about the experience of crossing Westminster Bridge early in the morning and seeing the calmness and beauty of the city of London. The poem describes the city in a very positive way, communicating its power and 'splendour'.
Wordsworth suggests that the view of the city is a rival for anything naturally occurring: 'Earth has not anything to show more fair' is the opening line.
The use of the word 'smokeless' in line 8 gives the reader a clue about why this scene is so powerful. Under normal circumstances, the smoke from homes and factories would have obscured the view of the city; it is as if the speaker is experiencing the true beauty of the city for the first time.

7363,"The narrator's mother is anxious - she believes her daughter should have lots of sleep.

She tries to create light for her family (candles at supper...) but
assumes her daughter's guilt. Although she says she believes her daughter's denial, we get the feeling she does not.

Examiner's advice - break down your answer
Hace dos meses pasaste une semana en un colegio espaol
The question does give you most of your introduction, but don't forget to change the verb to refer to yourself.
If necessary, add something extra to set the scene.
Where times or parts of the day are referred to, extend them to make suitable expressions of time.
You are writing about what the Spanish school was like, so use the imperfect tense. Use the first person plural to say what we did.
Sometimes you may have to change the tense from the one in the notes.
You may need to use the verb comer instead of the noun
Be prepared to make some guesses of your own. If there was no canteen where did the pupils eat? Probably at home!
Did you do the homework as well? If not, refer to Marisol and show you can use a different verb ending.
Don't just stick to the notes here. Add something to introduce the next point. It's time to give your opinion.
If necessary, add something extra to set the scene.
Remember to change the tense to fit.
Which expressions of time should you use?
Don't forget to put an article before the days of the week.
You are now talking about the situation generally, so you probably need to use the present tense.
Remember to compare Spanish and English holidays.
Show that you know the difference between
Take this opportunity to put in another different tense.
You will generally be told about how many words to write. Take note of this because you won't get any more marks for writing too much and you may lose marks for writing too little.
Use what you're given. The question and the notes both give you lots of language that you can use in your answer.
Remember to adapt the information in the question so that any verbs and pronouns refer to whoever you're writing about.
If you have to work from notes, think about the way they would be set out in English and what you would have to add.
Think carefully about what tense and what person of the verb to use. Once you have decided, make sure that you use that tense and person every time it's appropriate.
After you have finished, check your work for verb endings and tenses.
In a piece of writing, numbers are generally written as words.

7341,"When there is a chemical reaction, air pollutants are produced. You can understand how these pollutants are formed by looking at what happens to atoms during these chemical reactions.
A compound is a substance formed by the chemical union (involving bond formation) of two or more elements.
tells you how many atoms of each element the molecule contains. The table below shows the formulae of some compounds, together with the number of atoms of each element in each molecule and a diagram of each molecule.
The table shows the formulae of some compounds, with the number of atoms of each element in the molecule.
A small (subscript) number after a symbol tells you how many atoms of that particular element are in the molecule. If there is only one atom of an element in a molecule, we do not write the number 1 after the symbol. For example, the water molecule H

4132,"Chromosomes are made from DNA. Genes are short sections of DNA. Genetically identical cells are produced by a type of cell division called mitosis. In sexual reproduction, a male gamete fuses with a female gamete to produce a new cell. This is called fertilisation. Gametes are produced by a type of cell division called meiosis. They contain a single set of chromosomes, whereas body cells contain two sets of chromosomes.
The material inside the nucleus of cells, carrying genetic information. DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid.
(deoxyribose nucleic acid) molecules are large and complex. They carry the genetic code that determines the characteristics of a living thing.
Except for identical twins, each persons DNA is unique. This is why people can be identified using DNA fingerprinting. DNA can be cut up and separated, forming a sort of 'bar code' that is different from one person to the next.
The basic unit of genetic material inherited from our parents. A gene is a section of DNA which controls part of a cell's chemistry - particularly protein production.
is a short section of DNA. Each gene codes for a specific protein by specifying the order in which amino acids must be joined together.
Rod shaped bodies found in the nucleus of cells that contain genetic information (DNA).
The diagram shows the relationship between the cell, its nucleus, chromosomes in the nucleus, and genes.
Mitosis is the type of cell division that leads to growth or repair. When a cell divides by mitosis:
each cell is identical to the other one, and the cell they were formed from
two daughter cells form with identical chromosomes to the parent cell
Human body cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes in the nucleus. One of these pairs controls the inheritance of gender - whether offspring are male or female:
In males, the two sex chromosomes are different. They are XY.
In females, the two sex chromosomes are the same. They are XX.
Gametes are sex cells. The male gametes are the sperm, and the female gametes are the eggs.
Gametes contain one set of genetic information, while body cells contain two sets of genetic information.
Fertilisation is the joining or fusion of a male gamete and a female gamete. The new cell that is formed divides over and over again by mitosis. This creates the many cells that eventually form a new individual.

Gametes are formed from cells in the reproductive organs by a type of cell division called meiosis.

729,"This Revision Bite will help you understand the different types of production costs and how to calculate them.
A manufacturing company's production department will need to consider the quality and quantity of a product in relation to cost. If a firm wants to make a profit, it has to know what it is spending as well as what it is earning. Here are some of the costs it needs to know to do this:
Now look at each of these costs in more detail:
These costs do not change however many units of a product are made. Factory rent, insurance premiums and administration salaries stay the same, whether the factory is working at full capacity or producing nothing. The owner of the business may have taken out a loan to buy equipment or refurbish a building. The loan will have to be repaid whether or not the business has customers.
the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process
changes. For example, the amount of raw materials needed varies as the levels of output go up or down.
The employee is paid according to the number of units produced.
wages also fluctuate, depending on the employees' efficiency and the demand for the company's products.
The fixed costs and the variable costs are added together to establish the total costs. The fixed costs remain constant, but the variable costs increase in direct proportion with output.
The amount spent on producing one extra unit. It is the increase in total cost when one more unit is produced.
is a way of measuring how much more it will cost a company to make one more individual item. Here is an example:
A company produces compact discs. It has produced 99 CDs and the total costs have amounted to 999. If the total costs increase to 1,000 when the hundredth CD is made the marginal cost of the last CD is 1.00.
The firm knows that now each CD should cost only 1.00 or less to produce. As the cost per unit usually decreases with a rise in output, it should become cheaper to produce each one. The firm may be able to offer a more competitive price to customers.
The example of the CD shows the benefits of economies of scale, where mass production results in a lower unit cost. The reason is that the fixed costs do not change and are spread across a greater level of output.
The amount spent on producing each unit of output. It is calculated by dividing the total level of cost by the level of output.
helps a firm to monitor its progress, and makes it easier to set prices. It is calculated by dividing total cost by total output.
Using the example of the compact disc firm above:
This might seem expensive, but if the firm produces another hundred units at a marginal cost of 1.00 per CD, its average cost will fall radically:
The firm can use this information to decide whether it is worth accepting a new order for goods.
The examiner will want to see that you understand what the different costs are, how they are calculated, and why it is important for a firm to work them out. You will be expected to apply your understanding to a real life situation.
A company will always incur costs, no matter how efficient it is. Wages,
Raw materials are anything naturally occurring in or on the earth/in the sea before being processed. These are obtained through primary activities such as mining, fishing, forestry and farming.
, transport and power all have to be paid for. The company needs to establish all its costs to ensure it doesn't lose money.
Read the case study and answer the question below
Martin and Ashley started their window cleaning business with 1,500 they borrowed from Ashley's dad, and a 550 bank loan. They used the money to buy a second hand van and cleaning equipment. Ashley's dad doesn't charge any interest. They pay him back 50 a month. They also have to pay the bank 50 a month over two years. They don't get many bookings in winter when the weather is bad. Martin and Ashley aim to pay themselves 50 a month each.
What costs do Martin and Ashley have to meet even when they have no customers? (10 marks)
When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page.
They have got to pay back the money they borrowed.
Jamie needs to give far more explanation. He should use business terms and show he understands what fixed costs are.
They have to pay Ashley's father each month, as well as the loan from the bank. They may have other costs, like the cleaning materials they buy to run their business.
Morag started her answer quite well, mentioning both loans which, as fixed costs, have to be repaid. The cleaning materials, however, form part of the variable, rather than the fixed costs.
Costs which have to be paid, regardless of the level of output, are called fixed costs. Martin and Ashley have the fixed costs of repaying Ashley's dad 50 a month, and they probably pay bank interest on the loan. Their pay is a fixed cost. They might want to consider paying themselves piece rate, to help their business survive. The road tax and insurance on the van are fixed costs they have to pay. They have already bought the van, so this is a sunk cost, and no longer a fixed cost they have to pay.
Rani's answer would probably get a A grade. She has answered the question well, and has shown she can use business terms like fixed costs. She has thought about the pay they only receive when they have the business, and correctly counted it as a fixed cost.

4899,"Some music is written with 'block' chords, some music has weaving parts around the tune, while some has no harmony at all. These are all examples of
Music that has no chordal accompaniment, where different instruments or parts play or sing the same notes is described as in
Here is an example of unison: a male choir singing a traditional Armenian hymn.
This literally means 'sounding together'. Homophonic music is played in block chords. Sometimes, homophonic music is called chordal music, it means the same thing.
Here is an example of music with a homophonic texture, written by Henry VIII.
This literally means 'different sounds or voices'. Polyphonic music has parts that weave in and out of each other. Sometimes this is called contrapuntal music - it means the same thing.
Polyphonic music may contain an element of imitation, where one voice or instrument copies what has just been played by another. (Think of a roundsong like
Listen to this example of music that has a polyphonic texture, from JS Bach's
A fugue is a special type of polyphonic texture. Fugues always begin with a tune that is played on a solo instrument/voice or by instruments/voices in unison. This tune is then played by all the other instruments or voices in turn but not necessarily at the same pitch.
Here is an example of a fugue. Notice how the solo starts the fugue tune and then the other voices join in one at a time.
A capella music is always for voices. It describes vocal music that has no instrumental accompaniment.
A capella music can be polyphonic, homophonic or unison - so you might see a piece of music described as 'homophonic a capella' or 'polyphonic a capella'.
The words 'a capella' in Italian mean 'In the style of the chapel'. This is because early music for the church was for unaccompanied voices.
Listen to this example of a capella singing - yodelling from Gabon in Africa.
This is a melody which can be sung or played on an instrument, with an accompaniment. A song with piano accompaniment falls into this category.
Here is an example of melody and accompaniment:
This texture is when a solo is heard which is immediately answered by another tune played or sung by a group. It is used a lot in popular music, jazz music and music from other cultures.
Here is an example of a call-and-response song from Latin America
Listen to this extract of music by Mozart that only uses the words 'Kyrie Eleison' and 'Christe Eleison' and comment on the textures voices and instruments you hear.
: The music starts with just one instrument and one voice. The other voices and instruments then join in one at a time. At the end, all the instruments and voices play their own tune starting at different times.
Talvin has obviously heard that the voices have tunes starting at different times, but has not gone into enough detail about it. He didn't mention any instruments or voices by name and couldn't mention any of the textures by name either.
: The music starts with just the trombones and the bass voice. This type of texture is called 'unison'. The alto voice then joins in making the texture weave in and out. The voices sing Kyrie Eleison. A high voice then comes in singing a tune to the words 'Christe Eleison' which adds to the weaving style. There are timpani and strings in this piece. At the end, all the voices are weaving in and out of each other.
This is a good answer by Sarah. She has named one texture, unison. She heard that the music was 'weaving' but didn't use the proper word 'polyphonic'. She has also correctly identified one voice and an instrument.
: The music begins with the trombones and bass voices in unison. The voices sing the words 'Kyrie Eleison'. The alto voices then join in with faster notes singing the words 'Christe Eleison'. The texture is now polyphonic. The Soprano voices then sing the 1st tune (that the basses sang at first) to the words 'Kyrie Eleison' while the tenor voices sing the tune that the altos sang earlier to the words 'Christe Eleison'. The texture is still polyphonic. Timpani are heard to add emphasis to the bass part. Towards the end, all the voices sing both tunes to both sets of words in a polyphonic texture. Overall, the music has two tunes. The style is a fugue, where the tunes overlap each other.
Geeta has used the proper words to describe the textures and the voices/instruments used in this excerpt. She spotted that each set of words 'Kyrie Eleison' and 'Christe Eleison' has its own tune. Finally, she correctly identified the piece of music as being a fugue.

5266,"A lot of everyday items are made from polymers. Many of these polymers are not biodegradable - microbes cannot digest them and they take a long time to break down. Polymers are usually disposed of by burying them in landfill sites or burning them in incinerators. These methods of disposal cause environmental problems, and waste valuable resources.
The properties of polymers depend on the structure and bonding found in their molecules. Smart materials such as Gore-Tex have more useful properties than other polymers.
Polymers are large molecules formed from many identical smaller molecules (monomers).
. Addition polymers are formed from alkenes. For example:
ethene can polymerise to form polyethene, which is also called polythene
a typical use of polythene is for a plastic shopping bag or plastic bottle
a typical use of polystyrene is for insulation and protective packaging
Some polymers are not made from alkene monomers. These are called condensation polymers. Nylon and polyesters are like this. They can be drawn into very fine fibres and woven into cloth for clothing. Often, natural fibres such as cotton are mixed with nylon or polyester fibres to make a soft but hard-wearing cloth.
One of the useful properties of polymers is that they are unreactive, so they are suitable for storing food and chemicals safely. Unfortunately, this property makes it difficult to dispose of polymers. They are often buried in landfill sites or incinerated - burned.
Waste polymers are disposed of in landfill sites. This uses up valuable land, and suitable sites often fill up quickly.
Polymers release a lot of heat energy when they burn. This energy can be used to heat homes or generate electricity. But there are problems with incineration. Carbon dioxide is produced, which adds to global warming. Toxic gases are also produced, unless the polymers are incinerated at high temperatures.
Polymers have recycling symbols like this one for PVC to show what they are
Many polymers can be recycled. This reduces disposal problems and the amount of crude oil used. But first the different polymers must be separated from each other. This can be difficult and expensive.
Most polymers, including poly(ethene) and poly(propene), are not biodegradable. This means microorganisms cannot break them down, so they may last for many years in rubbish dumps. However, it is possible to include chemicals that cause the polymer to break down more quickly. Carrier bags and refuse bags made from degradable polymers are already available.
Nylon has some desirable properties. It does not let ultraviolet light pass through it, and it is:
Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.
Gore-Tex has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.
Teflon is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.
Gore-Tex fabric is a sandwich of materials
Structure and properties of polymers - higher
Strong covalent bonds join atoms to each other in individual polymer molecules. Weak intermolecular forces attract polymer molecules towards each other. The properties of solid materials like polymers depend on:
the strength of the forces between these molecules
A polymer will melt when the intermolecular forces are overcome. The stronger the forces, the more energy is needed to break them, and the higher the materials melting point.
Many polymers, such as poly(ethene), contain long molecules that lie side by side. These can uncoil and slide past each other, making the material flexible. Long polymer chains have stronger forces of attraction than shorter ones: they make stronger materials.
Cross-linking is where the polymer chains are chemically joined together in places, by covalent bonds. The polymer molecules cannot slide over each other so easily. This makes materials tougher and less flexible, and they cannot be easily stretched. Cross-linking also gives materials high melting points.
Vulcanised rubber has cross-links. Its polymer molecules are cross-linked by sulfur atoms. It is tough but flexible, and used for making tyres.

Source A: Instructions for treating a broken nose
If you examine a man whose nose is disfigured - part of it being squashed in while the other part is swollen and both his nostrils are bleeding, then you shall say: ""You have a broken nose and this is an ailment I can treat.""
You should clean his nose with two plugs of linen and then insert two plugs soaked in grease into his nostrils. You should make him rest until the swelling has gone down. You should bandage his nose with stiff rolls of linen and treat him with lint every day until he recovers.
Source B: Instructions for treating swellings in the body
When you come across a swelling of the flesh in any part of the body of a patient and your patient is clammy and the swelling comes and goes under the finger, then you must say to your patient: ""It is a tumour of the flesh. I will treat the disease. I will try to heal it with fire since cautery heals.""
When you come across a swelling that has attacked a channel, then it has formed a tumour in the body. If when you examine it with your fingers, it is like a hard stone, then you should say: ""It is a tumour of the channels. I shall treat the disease with a knife.""
Once you have read the sources on Egyptian surgery, look for evidence that the Egyptians:
kept their patients properly informed in a measured and professional way
wrote down what they knew so that knowledge could be passed on
'If you examine a man whose nose is disfigured...'

2967,"Like many female characters in the story, Justine is an orphan who cares for other people before herself.
She is brought up in the Frankenstein family home, and acts as their servant.
She is especially fond of Victor's youngest brother, William, and feels responsible when he is murdered by the Monster.
Justine is very beautiful. This beauty angers the Monster when it finds her sleeping, as it knows it will never be allowed to love anyone so attractive. The Monster then places the locket around her neck, knowing it will lead to her being put on trial for the murder.
She is bullied into confessing by a priest. Her calmness and virtue are emphasised and contrasted with the immorality of those who should know better - like Victor, the priest and the judge.

5803,"To get high marks in your exam you need to be able to pick out quotations from the poems that
the points you make. The selection of a quotation is one way the examiner will know if you really understand the poem and if you are able to construct an argument and if you have thought about your ideas.
Make sure you develop your point by commenting about the quotation you've selected -
Make a point, support it with a quotation and then explain how the language used helps to add to the line's effectiveness.

What is the connection between forces and motion?
of air resistance and friction pushing backwards.
You need to know how these forces compare if you are to predict what will happen to the speed of a moving object.
the counter forces, there is a resultant force forwards. This will make the car
the counter forces, there is a resultant force backwards. This will make the car
If the driving force is the same as the counter forces, there is no resultant force, and so no change in velocity.
If the car is already moving, it will carry on at a steady speed in a straight line.

3442,"Read the sources below by Petrarch and Mirfield on suspicion of doctors.
I know that your bedside is besieged by doctors, and of course this fills me with fear. As Pliny said, in order to gain fame they buy it with our lives. They learn their art at our cost, and even our death brings them experience; only a doctor can kill without punishment. Remember what it says on the gravestones: ""I died of too many doctors"".
A letter from the poet Petrarch to Pope Clement VI (c.1350)
Medical men are well educated, for I do not think that an illiterate man can do the work of a doctor. Even so, at the present time, ignorant amateurs and even worse and more horrible worthless and presumptuous women, grab the profession and abuse it and make mistakes and kill people. You need three qualifications to be a doctor nowadays: to be able to lie cleverly, to seem honest, and to be able to kill without caring.
Johannes de Mirfield, 'Flowers of Bartholomew' (c.1375). (Mirfield, a monk and a doctor, copied this from a book written by the Italian surgeon Bruno of Calabria in 1252)

, due to the combination of high rainfall and impermeable rock.
V shaped river valleys formed by the numerous surface streams. Valley sides are steep due to the resistant nature of the granite.
Contour lines are found close together on a map.
The land is at a higher altitude than the surrounding area due to the resistant nature of the rock.
Most of the large settlements, eg Tavistock, and Ashburton are found near the outskirts of Dartmoor.

. Kaolin, also known as china clay, is a product of hydrolysis and is used in ceramics and papermaking. The industry is very important for employment and the local economy.
. Granite blocks were used for dry stone walling, buildings and road stone. Many quarries are now abandoned.
. Dartmoor is a National Park. It is popular for walking, camping and pony trekking and over 10 million people a year visit the area.
. The soils are poor and acidic, and frequently used for sheep farming rather than growing crops.
. Copper and tin mining used to be common. The metals were found in thin 'veins' within the granite.
Quarrying, mining and china clay extraction can leave scars on the landscape. This makes it less attractive for both tourists and locals.
Tourism causes pollution and congestion on the roads. Tourist activities can sometimes lead to conflict with locals.
Tourists buying second homes pushes property prices up which means locals cannot afford to buy. Rural poverty is becoming a problem in areas such as Dartmoor.

523,"> Graphs - Plotting y = ax + b using tables
Graphs - Plotting y = ax + b using tables
To plot a graph, you need to find some coordinates that satisfy the equation of the graph.
Plot the graph of y = 2x + 1
We need to choose values for x and see what value of y they give.
y = (2  -2) + 1 = -3
y = (2  0) + 1 = 1
y = (2  2) + 1 = 5
You can show this in a table:
You can now plot these points and join them to give the graph of y = 2x + 1:
In order to see this content you need to have both

Electric current and voltage - Current in series circuits
The current is the same everywhere in a
. It does not matter where you put the ammeter, it will give you the same reading.
All three ammeters give the same reading in this series circuit
The current in a series circuit depends upon the number of cells. The more cells you add, the greater the current.
The more cells, the greater the current
You might think that the current gets less as it flows through one component after another. But it is not like this. The current is not used up by the components in a circuit. This means that the current is the same everywhere in a series circuit, even if it has lots of lamps or other components.

499,"> Drama - Drama from your imagination
Taking part in drama doesn't always involve learning lines from scripts - often you'll be asked to improvise. Usually you will work in groups or pairs to devise a piece of drama from your own imagination. You'll need to be able to think on your feet and become a different character.
This might sound difficult, but you've probably improvised before without realising it - in games you used to play as a child. If you've ever played pirates, nurses or superheroes when you were younger, you were improvising - although don't think running around your classroom with a tablecloth for a cape pretending to be Superman will impress your drama teacher - it probably won't!
As with any English work, you need to think about your audience when you devise drama. Your drama needs to entertain them and keep their attention. Your drama also needs to be believable - your audience is likely to become disconnected if your story or characters are too far fetched.
The story of your drama begins with your character. Ask yourself: what does my character feel, think and react?
Here are two ideas for a character:
You are a journalist who has uncovered a story that will have big consequences and you're about to tell the world. Would your character be confident or scared?
You are a global superstar - singer, actor and producer - and paparazzi follow your every move. You live a glamorous and privileged life, but what are the secrets behind the smiles?
When you have decided on your character, you need to create a scene.
Here are some ideas for a scene based on the characters above. Can you think of any more?
You're about to appear on the most popular morning TV programme and expose your discovery when you suddenly receive a startling phone call. Who is on the phone? What do they say? How do they make you feel?
You've landed a part in a popular soap but you don't get on with the other actors. Should you tell the press the truth or pretend that you all get along?
You've been working late in the library just double checking a few facts for your article when you notice a menacing looking man watching you. Does your character panic or keep calm? Do they run or confront the man? Maybe they are being paranoid?
The press have published some false rumours about you and you're really upset. Your agent has secured a slot on a popular chat show to give your side of the story. Do you accept the offer or decide to lie low? How do you feel?
Your article has been published and has been a massive hit. You're receiving job offers from high profile newspapers and magazines and your life is about to change for the better. How do your family react? What do you decide to do?
You've found out that one of the other band members is planning to leave the group and go solo. You confront them - can you persuade them to stay, or would it be better for everyone if they left?
When you have a rough idea of your character and scene, you can think about what your character might say. If you're given time to prepare you should write a short script. If working in pairs or a group, you could improvise the scene first to get more ideas.
You may be allowed to use props to make your scene more realistic and interesting. Only use a prop if it is relevant, otherwise it could end up distracting you and your audience. If you decide to use props and costumes, always practice with them first.

493,"> Introduction to formulas - Like terms
Algebraic terms that have the same letter are called like terms. Only like terms can be added or subtracted.
So 9b, -7b and 13b are like terms, but 6t, 5x and -11z are not like terms.
When like terms are added and subtracted it is called
The Khan family and the Norman family visit the zoo together - there are 8 children and 7 adults in the group. Because there are more than 10 people, the families can take advantage of a special offer - 1 child can be admitted free of charge.
for the cost of child admission, and
3g + 3k + 5g + 4k - g
Simplified = 3g + 5g - g + 3k + 4k =
A term, like a number, belongs with the
that sits in front of it. So in the expression 2k - g, g belongs with the - sign that sits in front of it, so it is - g; and 2k belongs with the + sign that sits in front of it, making it + 2k.
Collect all the like terms together, eg, re-write the expression 3g + 2k + 5g + 4k - g with all the g s and all the k s together: 3g + 5g - g + 2k + 4k
When you add or subtract terms, keep each term with their + or - sign.
Simplify 4x + y - 2x + 6y.
Re-write the expression by putting the like terms next to each other. remember to keep the plus or minus signs with the terms they belong to.
4x + y - 2x + 6y
= 4x - 2x + y + 6y

210,"> Food chains - Pyramids of numbers
The population of each organism in a food chain can be shown in a sort of bar chart called a pyramid of numbers. The more organisms there are, the wider the bar. The producer in the food chain always goes at the bottom of the pyramid of numbers.
Clover is a plant and it is the producer in this food chain. Its bar goes at the bottom of the pyramid:
Energy is lost to the surroundings as we go from one level to the next, so there are fewer organisms at each level in this food chain. A lot of clover is needed to support the snail population. A thrush eats lots of snails, and a hawk eats lots of thrushes, so the population of hawks is very small.
Sometimes the pyramid of numbers doesn't look like a pyramid at all. This could happen if the producer is a large plant such as a tree, or if one of the animals is very small. Remember, though, that whatever the situation, the producer still goes at the bottom of the pyramid.
An oak tree is very large so many insects can feed on it
Fleas are very small and lots of them can feed on a rabbit

16,"Pythagoras' Theorem states that for all right-angled triangles,
'The square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides'
. (The hypotenuse is the longest side and it's always opposite the right angle)
the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides.
and angle A is a right angle.
Pythagoras' Theorem only works for right-angled triangles, so you can use it to test whether a triangle has a right angle.
Which of the following triangles is right-angled?

28,"The multiples of a number are those numbers that it will divide into exactly.
For example, the multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30,....
The multiples of 7 are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42,....
1  5 = 5, 2  5 = 10, 3  5 = 15, 4  5 = 20.
Therefore, the multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20,....
What are the first five multiples of 11?
Remember that the first multiple is always the number itself.

Explore, imagine and entertain - Original ideas
There's no formula for having a brilliant idea. What you really need is an idea to start with. Then you need to make this idea a little different. This is the creative part, taking something that appears very ordinary and turning it into something unusual.
For example, you may be asked to write a description of a coastline. You might start to think straight away about a crowded beach - children playing, deck chairs, sun shining, happy sounds. But if you stop for a moment, you realise that's been done before. It's OK, but it's not very creative.
What about turning that on its head - not crowded, but deserted? Not summer, but winter? Not lovely and inviting, but covered in oil and polluted? It's not a pretty picture, but it's original - and that gives impact.

592,"> Constructing triangles and bearings - Bearings
Suppose you were in the middle of nowhere, and there were no signs or landmarks to help you find your way. Would you know how to find your way home? Someone might tell you via phone or radio to 'walk to your left', or 'turn through 60 and then start walking', but how would they know which way you were pointing in the first place?
One way of describing direction from a point is to use
A compass always points north. Bearings are measured from the
So when someone tells you to walk on a bearing of 120, you should face north, turn clockwise through 120 and start walking.
The angle between the north line and the flight path of the aeroplane is 30. We say that the aeroplane is flying on a bearing of 030 from Heathrow Airport.
Click 'Play' to see the direction change in the diagram below. Click 'Pause' to see the bearing.
In order to see this content you need to have both
Bearings are always described using three figures. So for less than 100 put an appropriate number of 0s in front. Eg 020, 037, 002, 007.

253,"> Approximation - Rounding to a given number of places
Approximation - Rounding to a given number of places
Decimal places are counted from the decimal point:
So, the number 5.1492 has four decimal places and 4.34 has two decimal places.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places, look at the number in the next decimal place.
If it's less than 5 round down
If it's 5 or more, round up
Q1. Round 7.2648 to 2 decimal places (d.p.)
Q2. Round 8.352 to 1 decimal place
To round to two decimal places, look at the number in the third decimal place. It's a 4, so round down.
To round to one decimal place, look at the number in the second decimal place. It's a 5, so round up.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places then the answer must have that number of decimal places, even if you have to add some zeros.
For example, rounding 3.40021 to two decimal places gives 3.40 (2 d.p.).
You need to write both decimal places, even though the second number is a zero, to show you rounded to two decimal places.
Remember to look at the number after the one you're interested in. If it's less than 5, round down. If it's 5 or more, round up.

Electric current and voltage - Series & parallel circuits
There are two types of circuit we can make, called
The components in a circuit are joined by wires.
if there are no branches then it's a series circuit
if there are branches it's a parallel circuit
In a television series, you get several episodes, one after the other. A series circuit is similar. You get several components one after the other.
If you follow the circuit diagram from one side of the cell to the other, you should pass through all the different components, one after the other, without any branches.
If you put more lamps into a series circuit, the lamps will be dimmer than before.
In a series circuit, if a lamp breaks or a component is disconnected, the circuit is broken and all the components stop working.
Series circuits are useful if you want a warning that one of the components in the circuit has failed. They also use less wiring than parallel circuits.
In parallel circuits different components are connected on different branches of the wire. If you follow the circuit diagram from one side of the cell to the other, you can only pass through all the different components if you follow all the
In a parallel circuit, if a lamp breaks or a component is disconnected from one parallel wire, the components on different branches
. And, unlike a series circuit, the lamps stay bright if you add more lamps in parallel.
Parallel circuits are useful if you want everything to work, even if one component has failed. This is why our homes are wired up with parallel circuits.

Acids, bases and metals - Reactions of acids with bases
A chemical reaction happens if you mix together an acid and a base. The reaction is called
, and a neutral solution is made if you add just the right amount of acid and base together.
Metal oxides and metal hydroxides are two types of bases. For example copper oxide and sodium hydroxide.
Here are general word equations for what happens in their neutralisation reactions with acids.
are always produced. The mixture usually warms up a little during the reaction, too. The exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used.
Carbonates and hydrogen carbonates are two other types of base. They also make a salt and water when we neutralise them with acid. But this time we get
The reaction fizzes as bubbles of carbon dioxide are given off. This is easy to remember because we see the word 'carbonate' in the chemical names.
These are the general word equations for what happens:
a salt + water + carbon dioxide
a salt + water + carbon dioxide
Farmers use lime (calcium oxide) to neutralise acid soils.
Your stomach contains hydrochloric acid, and too much of this causes indigestion. Antacid tablets contain bases such as magnesium hydroxide and magnesium carbonate to neutralise the extra acid.
Bee stings are acidic. They can be neutralised using baking powder, which contains sodium hydrogen carbonate.

Explore, imagine and entertain - Ending short-stories
The other problem some writers have is ending the story. It doesn't matter if it's a happy ending or not, but it has to make sense. There are lots of ways of ending, such as:
, where we have to wait until the final moment until we know. For instance, the spy who manages to stop the bomb two seconds before it explodes.
, where we are fairly sure about something, but in the final part everything changes. For example, we then learn that this is a fake bomb, and the real one is hidden somewhere else and will explode in five minutes.
, where the story stops, but we aren't sure what has actually happened at the end. For instance, the bomb is defused and everyone is safe. But then an army commander reports the theft of another bomb... only this time twice as powerful.
However, there are two endings to avoid:
, where a bomb will inevitably explode and as it does, the narrator wakes up - it was all a dream. Some English teachers don't mind this sort of thing, but others hate it. You have been warned.
, where the secret agent suddenly stops worrying about the bomb, retires, and goes off to play golf. This is even worse, and no-one likes it because the ending has nothing to do with the story.
Whatever kind of story you write, decide on your ending and include it in your plan.
Writing that explores, imagines or entertains depends on being creative. You need to experiment a little and not be frightened to try something new.

. Think of a playground see-saw. The pivot is the thing in the middle of it. When no-one is on the see-saw it is level, but it tips up if someone gets onto one end. Turning forces around a pivot are called
It is possible to balance the see-saw again if someone else gets onto the other end and sits in the correct place. This is because the turning forces are balanced. We say the moments are equal and opposite.
, we need to know two things:
the distance from the pivot that the force is applied.
This is the equation for working out a moment:
Imagine that a force of 10 N acted on a see-saw 2 m from the pivot. This is how we would work out the moment:
Notice that the unit of moment is
(newton metre). Don't get confused with a 'newton meter', which is another name for a forcemeter.
Here is an example of balanced moments. 10N at 2m from the pivot is balancing 20N at 1m from the pivot. The objects create moments of 20Nm that are equal and opposite, so the see-saw is balanced.
A see-saw will balance if the moments on each side of the pivot are equal. This is why you might have to adjust your position on a see-saw if you are a different weight from the person on the other end.
If a nut is difficult to undo with a short spanner, a longer spanner will help. This is because there will be a bigger moment on the nut, when the same force is applied further from the pivot.
Using the same principle you can increase the moment applied by a lever or a crowbar, and this can help you move heavy objects more easily.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - Marriage & murder
Meanwhile, Benvolio tells Mercutio that Tybalt has sent a letter to Montague's house challenging Romeo to a duel. Mercutio jokes about how good a swordsman Tybalt is, comparing him to a dancer. He calls him Prince of Cats. When Romeo turns up, Mercutio makes lots of rude jokes, and Romeo, who is now in a good mood joins in.
The Nurse warns Romeo not to mess Juliet around. He tells her that the wedding will be that afternoon at Friar Lawrence's place. The Nurse is really excited.
When the Nurse arrives back at the Capulet's house, Juliet is beside herself with impatience. The Nurse teases her and makes her wait for the good news.
Juliet meets Romeo at Friar Lawrence's and they go off to get secretly married.
Meanwhile, Mercutio squabbles with Benvolio. Benvolio is worried that the Capulets might turn up looking for a fight. Tybalt appears looking for Romeo. Mercutio teases him. Romeo arrives and refuses to fight Tybalt. Romeo tells him he loves him! (It's because Tybalt is now his relation through marriage, but he can't tell anyone that because the wedding is still a secret!) Mercutio fights Tybalt in Romeo's place. Romeo gets between them and, as a result, Mercutio is fatally wounded. He dies cursing both families. Romeo's grief at his friend's death quickly turns to rage. He kills Tybalt. Remembering Prince Escalus's warnings, Benvolio begs Romeo to run away.
Lady Capulet wants Romeo to be put to death for murdering Tybalt, but Prince Escalus points out that Tybalt killed Mercutio. He orders that Romeo should be sent away from Verona and not allowed back.

473,"Writing the speech is only half the task - the next part is presenting it.
The idea of presenting a speech might make you nervous but some people make speeches every day as part of their jobs. Think about your teachers - they regularly stand up before you and present to the class.
You might notice that some teachers are more interesting to listen to than others. It is not necessarily what they say that keeps you interested, but often how they say it. What do your teachers do to keep your attention? Make a list then compare it with the tips below.
Your listeners will switch off if they can't hear you. Use a loud and clear voice, and if you're unsure if your audience can hear you at the back - just ask ""Can you hear me at the back?""
If you speak too quickly, you won't be clear. If you speak too slowly, your audience is likely to go to sleep. Vary your pace for effect and use dramatic pauses where appropriate.
If you speak like a robot, in the same boring tone, your audience will quickly drift off. Speak naturally and use the pitch of your voice to show your emotions.
You don't have to gurn at your audience! But if you don't look like you're interested in what you have to say, your audience won't be either.
Again, keep it natural, but if you stand like a statue, you won't be very interesting to watch or listen to. On the other hand, too much arm flapping and leg hopping will distract your audience from the point you're trying to make.
Use them, but use them effectively. They need to be big enough to see, interesting to look at and relevant to what you are talking about. Don't be tempted to make a big poster to hide behind!
Choose words that are interesting, descriptive and appropriate to your audience. Don't baffle your audience with jargon or slang or lots of big words that are too difficult for anyone else to understand.
If it's appropriate to your audience and task, try to use Standard English. You don't have to be too formal or put on a silly accent, just speak in a way that is easy for everyone to understand.
Most people feel nervous about speaking formally in front of other people. Here are some tips to help you conquer your nerves:
Write your speech out in full and read it several times - this will help you gain confidence in the content.
Prepare small cards with key points of your speech. By now you should be familiar with your speech so these points will help you keep to your structure. Avoid the temptation to read your speech in full - the idea is to test your speaking skills, not your reading skills!
Practice your performance before the real thing. Try practicing at home on your own, and then in front of family or friends. If you have visual aids, be sure to practice using them.
On the day, take a deep breath, smile and try to enjoy it.

547,"Probability is often based on surveys, because you get a more accurate measure of probability by basing your calculation on a large number of results.
Alex is doing some reporting for his local paper. The subject of his article is 'holidays'.
As part of his report he decides to question 10 of his friends whether they prefer caravanning or camping holidays. Seven out of 10 say that they prefer caravanning, so Alex writes the dramatic headline you see above.

! To estimate probabilities from the results of surveys, you must gather a large number of results.

Rocks gradually wear away. This is called weathering. There are three types of weathering:
Remember, when you answer questions about weathering, mention what is causing the weathering and what it does to the rock.
Physical weathering is caused by physical changes such as changes in temperature, freezing and thawing, and the effects of wind, rain and waves.
a little, and when a rock gets cold it
a little. If a rock is heated and cooled many times, cracks form and pieces of rock fall away. This type of physical weathering happens a lot in deserts, because it is very hot during the day but very cold at night.
Wind, rain and waves can all cause weathering. The wind can blow tiny grains of sand against a rock. These wear the rock away and weather it. Rain and waves can also wear away rock over long periods of time.
Water expands slightly when it freezes into ice. This is why water pipes sometimes burst in the winter. You might have seen a demonstration of this sort of thing at school - a jar filled to the brim with water eventually shatters after it is put into a freezer.
The formation of ice can also break rocks. If water gets into a crack in a rock and then
and pushes the crack further apart. When the ice melts later, water can get further into the crack. When the rock freezes again, it expands and makes the crack even bigger.
This process of freezing and thawing can continue until the crack becomes so big that a piece of rock falls off.

229,"should introduce the subject. The writer wants to catch the reader's attention and hint at what is to come. If the beginning is poor, the reader could lose interest quickly and stop reading.
section presents the main ideas, thoughts, actions and so on. These will often be presented in stages or with several twists and turns of argument.
generally sums up the piece of text, or makes a final point, or brings a conclusion to a story.
It can add to your marks in a test if you show a plan of how you are going to answer a long question.
A writer will usually plan not only what they are going to write, but also how they are going to write it. For example, how would a writer plan a magazine article about the benefits of health and fitness?
Imagine you are writing a plan for a magazine article about fitness and health.
Beginning: do people need to be fit?
Health angle  unfit people can need more health care
Ending: get fit and eat healthy food and you will benefit
This is an example of quite a straightforward plan. Each box contains a summary of a paragraph and they are organised in a way that steers the reader through a journey. Obviously, the more complex the issue, argument, story, and so on, the more complex the plan will be.

The Tempest first key extract - Characters
There are four characters in this first extract and all but Ariel appear again in the second extract.
He has power over the magic spirits that exist on the island.
He used to be the Duke of Milan until he was usurped by his brother, Antonio.
He conjures the storm that shipwrecks the King of Naples, along with his brother Antonio.
He wants justice for having been exiled on the island twelve years ago.
Part of his plan is, with Ariel's help, to make Miranda fall in love with Ferdinand through magic.
She has been alone on the island with her father, Caliban and Ariel for twelve years.
Ferdinand is the first man she has ever seen.
She does not understand why Prospero is being so unreasonable to Ferdinand.
Her father controls her but it could be argued that she has an independent spirit.
He can make himself invisible and perform magic.
He is an obedient servant to Prospero.
When Prospero arrived on the island, Ariel was trapped in a pine tree by the witch, Sycorax, Caliban's mother. Prospero set him free.
Ariel's song convinces him that his father is dead.
His father is the King of Naples.
He is in love with Miranda and prepared to become Prospero's slave for her sake.

Energy transfer and storage - Energy basics
Energy can be stored or transferred from place to place in different ways. Let's look at some examples.
things have kinetic energy. The heavier a thing is and the faster it moves the more kinetic energy it has. All moving things have kinetic energy, even very large things, like planets, and very small ones, like atoms.
A vibrating drum and a plucked guitar string transfer energy to the air as
. Kinetic energy from the moving air molecules transfers the sound energy to your eardrum.
Thermal energy is what we call energy that comes from
. A cup of hot tea has thermal energy in the form of kinetic energy from its particles. Some of this energy is transferred to the particles in cold milk, which you pour in to make the tea cooler.
release energy. For example, when an explosive goes off, chemical energy stored in it is transferred to the surroundings as
energy in moving charges in wires. For example, electrical energy is transferred to the surroundings by the lamp as
energy because of its position above the ground and the pull of gravity. This energy is called
. This is the energy it would release if it fell. As the rock falls to the ground, the gravitational potential energy is transferred as kinetic energy.

356,"Imagine that you are buying a t-shirt for 9.99, a pair of socks for 1.49 and a belt for 8.99 The cashier charges you 23.47. You feel that this is too much - but how do you know?
One way of finding out whether you have been over-charged is to estimate what the total amount should be. Round the different prices into easier numbers - 9.99 is approximately 10, 1.49 is approximately 1.50 and 8.99 is approximately 9 - and you can do the calculation quickly in your head.
10 + 1.50 + 9 = 20.50
This is almost 3 less than the cashier asked for, so obviously you have been over-charged.
By rounding the actual values to more manageable numbers, you can estimate the answers to many problems:
3 + 3 + 1 = 7

34,"Cube numbers are formed by multiplying a digit by itself three times.
For example 2 cubed is 2  2  2 = 8
3 cubed is 3  3  3 = 27
4 cubed is 4  4  4 = 64
Each cube number can be represented by a cube made up of unit cubes.
Use your calculator to find the next six cube numbers (from 5 onwards) - then check your answer.
125 = 5  5  5, 216 = 6  6  6, etc.
So the next six cube numbers are:
125, 216, 343, 512, 729 and 1000

401,"> Listening - Showing you are listening
It sounds weird, but you can show that you are a good listener by talking! The trick is to know what to say and when to say it.
Good listeners show that they are listening by:
Making eye contact with the person that is talking to them
Using facial expressions to show that they understand or are reacting to what is said
Allowing the person who is speaking finish before they respond
Repeating, in their own words, what the person has said to show that they understand
Referring back to comments that have already been made
Read this conversation between Abdul, Emily and Matt. Can you find any examples of good listening skills?
In a classroom. General classroom noise in the background.
In a fight, right, who do you think would win -
(Interrupts) Shut up, Abdul! I'm trying to concentrate.
There's four of them. They'd take him down. Knock him cold.
So you're saying that Tinky Winky and Laa-Laa have a violent streak?
No, but if they had to, if they were forced - them against him - the Teletubbies would have it, any day of the week.
Because it would be four against one?
Yeah, the Teletubbies are a team. Bob's a Larry.
We'd better be quiet. We're annoying her.
Choose the statement that is most true:
Emily is the best listener, because she says the least and she's just trying to get on with her work
Matt shows that he is listening because he asks questions to make sure that he understands what Abdul really means, and he is sensitive towards Emily's feelings.

149,"Antibiotics are medicines used by doctors when harmful microbes have made you ill. They are substances that harm bacteria. Some antibiotics stop the bacteria reproducing and others kill the bacteria directly.
Antibiotics are helpful to treat diseases caused by bacteria, such as tuberculosis and food poisoning. They do not harm viruses, so antibiotics cannot treat diseases such as colds and flu, which are caused by viruses.
Antibiotics only work against bacteria, not viruses
When you are infected by a microbe, it takes time for your body to start fighting the infection. It does this by making enough white blood cells with the correct antibody. During this time, you continue to feel unwell.
You begin to recover when enough antibodies have been produced. After the microbes have been killed, the amount of antibodies goes down again. But some of the white blood cells that produce the correct antibody remain in your blood.
infection by the same microbe, your body makes the correct antibodies much faster, because of the white blood cells that remain from when you had the first infection. The microbe doesn't get a chance to make you ill this time, and we say that you are

Vaccines contain a dead or weak form of the disease-causing microbe, or some of its antigens. In response to the vaccine your immune system produces white blood cells with the correct antibody to kill the microbe, so you become immune without falling ill.
You are likely to have been immunised against several microbes, viruses and bacteria, including the ones that cause diphtheria, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, meningitis, measles, mumps and tuberculosis. Girls are also immunised against rubella.
Vaccination works against diseases caused by both bacteria and viruses.

If you are asked how many days there are in a week, you would find the answer easy - there are 7. How about the number of days in two weeks? Again, the answer is fairly straightforward - there are 14.
What happens when you are asked how many days there are in three weeks, or four or five? If you know the formula you could work this out.
1 week is 1  7 days = 7
2 weeks is 2  7 days = 14
3 weeks is 3  7 days = 21
4 weeks is 4  7 days = 28
So, the formula to work out the number of days is:
number of days = number of weeks  7

594,"is a category within the classification system. Living things of the same type belong to the same species. For example, humans are one species and dogs are another species.
Individuals of the same species can reproduce to make more individuals of the same species. Two individuals belonging to different species cannot normally reproduce together. If they do, their offspring is usually infertile and unable to reproduce.
For example animals called ligers are produced when a male lion and a female tiger reproduce. But a liger cannot have offspring. This means that lions and tigers are different species.
All people are human. They belong to the same species. Your friends and classmates may have different eye colour and hair colour. Some will be boys and some will be girls. Some will be tall and some will be shorter. The presence of differences between living things of the same species is called variation.

Remember that an element is one type of atom, like carbon, gold or chlorine. We will look at three ways that atoms can exist.
The atoms of some elements do not join up with other atoms. They stay as
The element helium is like this. Helium is an unreactive gas. Helium atoms do not join up with each other or any other element.
element join together we get a molecule of that element.
Oxygen is like this. Two oxygen atoms join together to make an oxyen molecule. Most of the oxygen in the air is in this form. Hydrogen and chlorine also have molecules with two atoms.
Some elements have molecules with more than two atoms. Sulfur atoms can make molecules of eight atoms joined together.
A compound is made when atoms of
This means that compounds will always exist as molecules, not separate atoms. The diagrams show some molecules of common compounds.

598,"> Electric current and voltage - Introduction
Electric circuits can be series or parallel. You need to know the symbols we use to draw circuit diagrams.
An ammeter measures electric current, in amps, by measuring how much charge is flowing in the circuit. A voltmeter measures, in volts, the difference in electrical energy between two points of a circuit.

261,"Manatees often graze in shallow waters off the coast of Florida. These seadwelling plant eaters play with divers and swimmers. The huge animals are often called sea cows because of their large size.
Manatees were once thought to be on the edge of
or dying out completely. In the 1970s, there were only about 1,000 manatees left. Today, there are more than 3,000.
As a result, Florida recently removed the manatee from its list of
Endangered species are animals or plants that are at risk of dying out.
The first laws protecting this slow-moving marine mammal were passed in the late 1970s. Those laws made hunting, capturing, or killing manatees illegal.
As Floridas human population grew, however, manatees faced more threats. Last year alone, 396 manatees died in Florida, according to the states Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Many manatees have been injured or killed in collisions with boats. Others have gotten tangled in fishing gear. Manatees are also threatened because of the loss of their
As builders develop along the coastline, they destroy the manatees natural homes.
Environmental factors, such as red tide, have also taken their toll on the playful creatures. Red tide occurs when millions of tiny organisms are present in an area of the water. Those tiny organisms turn the ocean red and brown. Some of them are harmful to fish and other animals.
Red tide occurs naturally in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2005, more than 80 manatees were killed in red-tide outbreaks.
Not everyone thinks it is a good idea to remove manatees from the list. Many wildlife experts worry that the unusual mammals will not receive the same protection they had in the past. ""We cant celebrate yet,"" warned manatee expert Patrick Rose in an interview with
State officials say that the manatee is not under urgent threat. Although the huge creatures are being removed from Floridas list, state scientists say that the animal will remain protected under the nations Endangered Species Act. That law offers special protection to animals and plants facing extinction.
Wildlife officials say protection of the manatees might even be strengthened. The next step calls for the writing of a plan to continue increasing the number of manatees. ""There will be no less protection,"" says Henry Cabbage of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
A manatee recently got a taste of the Big Apple. Manatees are rarely seen far from the warm coastal waters of Florida, but one adventurous sea cow swam north to waters off New York City this summer. The large marine visitor then swam to waterways about 25 miles inland. Wildlife officials say its not unusual for manatees to
or move from one place to another. However, the mammals typically dont go much farther north than Virginia.
Should manatees have been removed from Floridas endangered species list? Why or why not?

361,"The Heat Is On: Will Global Warming Affect Animals?
Polar bears in Alaska are having trouble catching one of their main meals--ringed seals. To get to the seals, the bears often walk across islands of ice floating in the water.
Ice throughout Alaska is melting earlier and faster in the spring than it did several years ago. So polar bears don't have as much time to catch seals before the ice melts. As a result, polar bears are catching fewer seals.
Ice along Alaska's coast is melting because the temperature is higher worldwide. In the last 100 years, Earth's temperature has risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit.
. Global warming is changing the environment worldwide. As a result, many plants and animals are being affected, say scientists from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
As temperatures rise, more and more animals will have to
, or move, in order to survive, said scientist Jay Malcolm of the WWF.
Many plants and animals that can't adjust or migrate will not survive the rise in temperature, said WWF scientists. In some areas of the world, the WWF says, as many as two in ten species of plants and animals will die out by the year 2100.
Here are some examples of how global warming is affecting some animals in North America.
The numbers on the map show where each animal can be found.
The black guillemot (GIL-uh-maht) is a bird that lives on an island off Alaska's coast. It eats Arctic cod, a fish that lives in water under ice. Rising temperatures have caused much of the ice to melt. The Arctic cod has moved to other parts of the sea where water is still covered with ice. The guillemot no longer has enough fish to eat.
The American bistort is a plant that lives in Mount Rainier National Park. The Edith's checkerspot butterfly drinks nectar from bistort flowers. The warming temperatures have caused the butterflies to hatch earlier, before the flowers bloom, so the butterflies don't have enough food right after they hatch.
Global warming is actually helping some animals.
The Mexican vole lives in areas with warm temperatures. It is spreading northward into Arizona and Colorado because of the rise in temperatures there.
For years, red fire ants lived in the warm southern part of the United States. Today, because of rising temperatures, they are spreading northward.
Scientists have learned that global warming is already affecting Earth. ""We should not expect the effects of global warming to take place 50 years in the future,"" said scientist Rafe Sagarin. ""It's happening right now.""
Scientists agree that Earth has been getting warmer for the last 100 years. They don't agree on
Gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming. Carbon dioxide in the air traps heat from the sun, causing Earth's temperature to rise.
Volcanoes and forest fires release carbon dioxide into the air. Some scientists blame the rise in temperature on volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and other natural events.
Other scientists blame human actions for the rise in temperature. They say Earth has always had volcanoes and forest fires, so why is Earth warming now? Those scientists say the carbon dioxide from automobiles and factories is causing the recent increase in global warming.

118,"Nine-year-old Hannah Niles loves poetry! The fourth grader especially enjoys reading poetry by Edgar Allan Poe. ""He uses a lot of expression and detail in his poems,"" she told
Hannah belongs to the Basketball Poets. That is a group of 40 fourth and fifth graders at Supply Elementary School in Supply, North Carolina. The students meet once a week in the gym, where they read, write, memorize, and perform poetry. Then they play basketball.
Poetry lets kids express themselves. ""If you're nervous, you write a poem about being nervous. If you're happy, you write a poem about being happy,"" said 10-year-old Douglas Mitchell.
The Basketball Poets also had the opportunity to meet two published poetsKenn Nesbitt and Sharon Creech. Both children's authors visited the school and gave the students advice on writing poetry. ""They were professional, and we're kids, so that's exciting,"" said Hannah.
Who came up with the idea for the Basketball Poets? It was the school's physical education teacher, Marty Mentzer. She sees the club as a way for kids to keep their minds and bodies fit. ""It's cool to be a reader and a writer,"" she said, ""and basketball teaches them teamwork.""

253,"Saturn is known for its rings. But scientists now say the planet has another claim to fame. It has more moons than any other planet in our solar system.
, scientists who study space, have been studying the space near Saturn. They recently discovered a dozen moons that had never been seen before, increasing the number of known moons orbiting Saturn to 30. The newly discovered moons range in size from 4 to 19 miles across.
At one time, the tiny moons were probably large rocks traveling through space. When they passed by Saturn, the planet's gravity pulled them in and captured them. The rocks have been orbiting the planet ever since. Over time, the large moons broke apart to form the smaller moons.
""We think that most of [the tiny moons] are the shattered remnants of captured moons,"" explained astronomer Brett Gladman.
Some astronomers wonder whether Saturn will hold on to its title as the moon king. Jupiter has 28 known moons. Some astronomers think they will find more undiscovered moons orbiting Jupiter, making Jupiter the moon king.
Earth's moon has a rocky surface dotted with craters

408,"Live from New York ... except this time, it wasn't! Pop singer Ashlee Simpson, the younger sister of singer Jessica Simpson, was caught
Lip-synching is mouthing the words or singing along to a recording. Some performers sing along to a prerecorded track to make their voice sound stronger.
A computer glitch was to blame for Simpson's mix-up on
. Simpson, 20, was caught lip-synching when the words to the wrong song began playing.
Simpson's dad rushed to her defense after the incident. He said his daughter was lip-synching because an upset stomach had made her voice hoarse.
""Every artist that I know in this business has had vocal problems at some time,"" he told The Associated Press. ""So you've got to do what you've got to do.""
An embarrassed Simpson apologized to her fans but said she hadn't done anything different from what many other artists do. Some music industry officials defend the practice. They say it's nearly impossible to sound good and sing on cue when you're dancing onstage or performing complicated acts.
Difficult dance moves are not an excuse for lip-synching, say many fans. In fact, some fans say lip-synching is a dishonest practice that hurts a singer's credibility.
Fans often question a star's talent if the singer is unable to perform live onstage. They say most people can sound good on a CD if their voice is enhanced in a studio. Some concertgoers also feel betrayed and disappointed if an artist lip-synchs, especially when they have spent a lot of money on a ticket to hear a live performance.
""[Lip-synching is ridiculous] and not entertaining in the least,"" a person commented online to NBC, the company that airs

322,"Scientists are going ape over orangutans (o-RANG-oo-tanz). They are working to help save these endangered tree dwellers before they disappear from the wild.
In recent years, the red-haired apes have found themselves out on a limb. Wildlife experts warn that they may die out, or become
, within the next 20 years. Scientists estimate that only 30,000 orangutans are left in the wild.
Today, orangutans can be found only in tropical rain forests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, in Southeast Asia. They are
creatures, which means they eat, sleep, and travel mainly in trees.
To search for food, orangutans swing from branch to branch. They like to dine on leaves, flowers, bark, and sometimes insects.
""Orangutans spend most of their time in the trees and won't cross open grounds, so the only way they can [move]... is through the trees,"" said one wildlife expert. ""We need to maintain these forest [areas] so that orangutan populations of the future have the opportunity to continue to survive.""
What is causing the numbers of orangutans to decrease at an alarming rate? The main reason is the destruction of their rain forest
Humans pose the greatest threat to orangutans for a number of reasons, say experts. People cut down trees for lumber. This illegal logging is destroying much of the animals' homes. Many countries, including the United States, buy the lumber. It is often used in shelves, picture frames, and floors.
Forest fires and farming are also to blame. As forests are cleared to make way for plantations, orangu-tans lose parts of their habitat.
In addition, orangutans have fallen victim to the recent boom in the illegal pet trade. People steal baby orangutans from the forest to sell them as pets.
To help bring these animals back from the brink of extinction, wildlife groups are working to protect orangutans and stop illegal logging. The government in the area is also involved in the effort to help orangutans. Police go into national parks to prevent illegal loggers from cutting down trees.
""Help is needed to save these amazing creatures,"" orangutan expert Cheryl Knott told
. ""If we can save the rain forest for orangutans, we can save it for other animals as well.""
The average life span for orangutans is about 50 years. Experts hope that orangutans born today will still be swinging through the trees at that age.
The orangutan got its name--which means ""person of the forest""--for a reason. Orangutans are remarkably intelligent. In the wild, scientists have spotted these clever creatures using sticks as tools to open fruit. Orangutans have been observed using large leaves as umbrellas to shelter themselves from heavy rains. Sometimes, the apes even use leaves as cups, from which they drink water.
Are there any endangered animals in the area where you live? What can people do to help them?

160,"When you are at school or hanging with friends, do you wonder what your dog is doing in your house? If so, a new robot might be just what you need.
The robot, called Maron-1, is made by a company in Japan. Maron-1 looks like a cartoon copy of R2-D2. It weighs about 11 pounds and stands about 2 feet high. When it goes on sale in Japan next year, the robot will cost about $1,600.
The makers of Maron-1 say their robot is better than the other kinds of robots that you can buy at toy stores. ""Our robot is different from pet robots. It's useful,"" said a representative from the company that makes Maron-1.
Maron-1 can detect whether someone or something is moving in front of it. If it sees"" something moving, it says, ""An intruder found."" It can also call you on a cell phone to tell you about the intruder.

605,"Soaring high above California's coastline stand the magnificent redwood trees. Redwoods are the world's tallest known trees and are also some of the oldest. Some scientists are concerned about a disease that is threatening the ancient giants. It is called sudden oak death.
The disease has scientists alarmed. First identified in 1995, sudden oak death has spread along hundreds of miles of California's coastline and jumped into southern Oregon. In addition to attacking oak trees, it has spread to redwoods, Douglas firs, and other types of trees and shrubs. One of the worst outbreaks of the disease has occurred at California's Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park.
Scientists recently discovered the organism responsible for the disease. It is a fungus that causes oozing red blobs to grow on diseased oak trees. On younger redwoods, it dries up leaves and kills sprouts. According to scientists, redwoods are hosts for the disease. A host is an organism on or in which another organism lives.
The disease first showed up in rhododendron plants in the Netherlands in 1993. Scientists are concerned because the spread of the disease could pose a threat to the redwoods' ecosystem, an environment where plants and animals coexist. Scientist David Rizzo said that anytime you have a strange organism, there is cause for concern.
Coastal redwoods can grow upwards of 360 feet. Some are taller than the Statue of Liberty, which stands about 300 feet.
The diameter of redwoods can measure about 20 feet.
Named California's state tree, the redwood can live more than 2,000 years.
In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Muir Woods a national monument dedicated to protecting and preserving the mighty redwoods.
In 1904, a fungus from Asia began killing chestnut trees in New York. Over the next 50 years, the disease killed about 3.5 billion trees and almost wiped out an entire species. Scientists want to prevent this from happening in California or elsewhere in the United States.
Studies show this disease spreads rapidly during the wet months of spring. The coming months could be vital in tracking the disease. Current weather forecasts predict that this spring will be rainier than the last two springs. ""We have to get familiar with the symptoms and the treatments,"" said another scientist, ""because we don't know how much farther it will spread.""

291,"Crews restart construction on the space station.
Mission completed! On September 21, astronauts returned to Earth aboard the space shuttle
The six-person crew had come back from a successful journey to the
about 220 miles above Earth. The astronauts added new solar panels to the giant space lab. The solar panels will power the station, which
or travels around, Earth. It was the first major delivery to the space station since 2002.
Once completed, the space station will be about the size of a five-bedroom house. It will measure 361 feet end to end.
The space station is being built as a joint effort by 16 countries, including the United States. Construction began in 1998, and the first crew arrived in 2000. The diagram shows when parts of the space station were added.

28,"A baby emperor penguin stays warm under its parent.
Temperatures are on the rise in Antartica. What does that mean for emperor penguins and other wildlife?
Emperor penguins and other Antarctic wildlife ""feel the heat"" as their icy home melts away.
In the hit documentary March of the Penguins,
emperor penguins make an amazing journey. They cross the vast continent of Antarctica, a frozen area that surrounds the South Pole. The penguins leave their ocean homes and cross the ice on a dangerous trip. They are blinded by blizzards and toppled over by strong winds. But each winter, they do this to lay their eggs and raise their chicks.
That cycle of life may be in trouble though. Scientists have discovered an alarming rise in temperatures around Antarctica. ""The region at the peninsula has warmed up about 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 40 to 50 years,"" Wayne Trivelpiece, a scientist who studies Antarctica, told Weekly Reader.
A recent study also shows that the ocean near the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed since the 1960s. A
is a stretch of land surrounded on three sides by water. A change in temperature could spell trouble for penguins, whales, seals, and other creatures at the South Pole.
Although researchers are certain about the increase in temperatures, they are still unsure about the cause. Many scientists blame
the gradual rise in Earths average temperature.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth. Temperatures there rarely reach above freezing. Although it is too cold for humans to permanently live there, many animals swim in the icy waters surrounding the continent. Penguins, for example, waddle across the ice and dive into the cold ocean waters in search of food. They eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called
In warmer water, however, krill have trouble surviving. ""Warming temperatures have led to a decline in sea ice,"" says Trivelpiece. ""Sea ice holds the food that krill need to survive. Without the ice, there is less food for krill and without the krill, the penguins are not surviving.""
These changes could upset the balance of the food chain and endanger larger animals and birds. A loss of penguins could leave leopard seals and whales hungry. (See
.) ""A very small change in temperature [can] completely change the whole food chain,"" says Trivelpiece.
Its not just emperor penguins and other creatures that may be in trouble. People who live thousands of miles away may be affected by melting ice.
As glaciers and sheets of ice melt, they add to the worlds sea level. When ice on land falls into the ocean and melts, it raises the water level. It is like dropping ice cubes into a glass of water. A 4-foot increase in global sea level would drown low-lying coastal areas.
The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air. Those gases collect in a layer and trap the heat from the sun. The process is called the
because the layer of gases is like the windows in a greenhouse. Too much of those gases in the air causes temperatures to rise. That is known as
Some scientists say global warming is caused by greenhouse gases in the air. Those gases are produced from
Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are used to power cars, heat homes, and create electricity.(See
Some heat from greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is necessary. Without them, Earth would be too cold to support life. But burning fossil fuels can release too much carbon dioxide into the air, which can cause temperatures to rise.
Scientists are working to persuade governments to reduce their use of greenhouse gases. Experts say that if greenhouse gases continue to gather in the air, temperatures will likely be higher by 2100 than any time in human history. ""Our research teaches us a lesson that even a small change in the environment can have a big effect,"" says Trivelpiece.
What are some ways that people can reduce their use of fossil fuels?
is a system of animals and plants in an area that depend on one another for food. At the top of the Antarctic food chain are large animals, such as whales. They eat seals, which eat penguins. Penguins munch on tiny shrimplike animals called krill. Krill eat tiny ocean plants called phytoplankton. A loss of smaller animals in the food chain could leave larger animals hungry.

659,"History in the Making: Mercury 3 Rescue Mission
The Mercury missions were the first attempts by NASA, the U.S. space agency, to send a human into space. The rocket missions took place from 1961 to 1963. During the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union competed to build the best space program. That period was called the space race. Tia interviewed her grandfather, Clark Presler, about his role in the 1961 Mercury 3 mission, during which astronaut Alan B. Shepard Jr. became the first American in space.
What do you remember from your experiences in the Navy?
I remember being part of the pickup crew [aboard the U.S.S.
] when the first manned space capsule returned to Earth. It was May 5, 1961. The name of the [rocket] was the Mercury-Redstone 3.
What was the purpose of this mission?
NASA wanted to send a man into orbit and back safely. His name was Alan B. Shepard Jr.
The capsule reached [an altitude of] about 187.45 kilometers, which is 114.61 miles.
The orbit flight lasted only 15 minutes.
In the Atlantic Ocean, near Cape Canaveral, Florida.
How did you pick up Mr. Shepard?
Well, we lifted the capsule up on the chain. Alan was standing up on it, hanging on to the chain. He came out without a single scratch on his body.
At first, I thought this project would be easy, but after the interview I knew I had to learn what this was all about. So later that day I asked Grandpa to explain this to me. After that, it sounded a lot clearer, and it's fun having a member of your family actually do something, well, famous.

Does thinking about spiders and their hairy bodies, long legs, and sticky webs make your skin crawl? Many people shiver at the thought of spiders.
That is not the case for Rich Bradley, a real-life Spider-Man. He can't get enough of the creepy crawlers. Bradley is an
(ah-rak-NAH-luh-jist). That is a scientist who studies spiders. Bradley has spent the last 10 years identifying and studying spiders in his home state of Ohio.
, or types, of spiders living in the Buckeye State. He and his team of volunteers have a sharp eye when it comes to collecting the creatures indoors and outdoors. ""They move really fast,"" he told
Scientists say about 3,500 species of spiders live in North America, and nearly 35,000 live worldwide. Spiders live in different places, including gardens, water, deserts, and caves.
Many people think spiders are insects, but they are actually
(ah-RAK-nidz). Ticks and scorpions are also arachnids.
Along with fangs and eight hairy legs, a spider has two body parts--a head and an abdomen. The abdomen contains
, organs that produce silk. A spider uses its silk for many purposes, including weaving webs, protecting its eggs, and catching food.
A spider uses its silk to weave a web.
, or hunters that eat other animals. They dine mostly on insects. Some larger spiders also eat lizards, frogs, and even snakes.
To capture their food, some spiders spin webs. Other types of spiders chase down their
, or poison, from their fangs helps paralyze their food.
Although the hairy creatures spook many people, there isn't much reason to be afraid of spiders. ""Most spiders are not very dangerous,"" said Bradley.
In fact, most are timid creatures that are unable to give humans more than a harmless bite. Although spider venom is deadly to insects, it often has little effect on humans because of our larger size.
Spiders may have a bad reputation for being scary, but they are important to us. Bradley hopes his work shatters some
about spiders. (A myth is a false idea that many people believe is true.)
Spiders eat mosquitoes and other insects that harm farmers' crops and carry diseases. Bradley's research is teaching scientists more about how spiders help control
, or communities of plants and animals. If spiders didn't exist, there would be a lot more insects!
""Spiders are your friends,"" Bradley said. ""They make our life more pleasant.""
Get caught up on some different types of spiders. Spiders come in all shapes and sizes. Crab spiders, jumping spiders, and orb weavers have made Rich Bradley's Ohio count. Find out more about them and other spiders.
Can you guess how this spider got its name? It may not live in the ocean, but it looks like a crab. The crab spider lives on flowers. It can match its body color to the flower's color. That allows it to sneak up on insects.
What a leap! The jumping spider can jump between 10 and 40 inches. To catch an insect, this hunting spider sneaks up on its prey and pounces.
The trap-door spider lives in a tunnel. The spider, common in the southwestern United States, lines the tunnel with silk and fashions a door made of silk and dirt. It peeks out of the slightly open door and grabs passing insects.
The tarantula is a large, hairy spider found mainly in warm regions, including the southwestern United States. Although the tarantula's bite is painful, it is not very poisonous to humans. Tarantulas hunt insects, lizards, mice, toads, and frogs.
E. B. White's famous spider Charlotte was an orb weaver. The orb-weaving spider spins a wheel-shaped web. When an insect flies into the web, the spider races toward its meal.

102,"Wispy lights danced through the night sky in October. Observers worldwide saw the lights.
People saw green, blue, and red lights. The lights formed different patterns. Some looked like rings. Others looked like curtains. And still others looked like pillars. The lights continually changed shape and color.
are also called the northern lights and southern lights.
Usually, only people living close to the North Pole and South Pole see auroras. But auroras were unusually active this fall. Even people in Arizona saw the lights.
Auroras are caused by the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The solar wind is made of tiny particles that stream away from the sun. Earth's magnetic field is similar to the field that surrounds a magnet. When the solar wind strikes Earth's magnetic field, gases in our atmosphere glow. Those glowing gases form an aurora.
The kind of glowing gas determines an aurora's color. Glowing oxygen makes red, yellow, and green auroras. Glowing hydrogen and helium make blue and purple auroras.
Don't worry if you missed the colorful auroras in October. An aurora can form at any time of year. If the solar wind continues to be as strong as it was in the fall, you may see the northern lights on any clear night.
The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth. You could line up more than 1 billion hot dogs end to end between Earth and the sun.
If you could drive to the sun in your family's car, it would take you nearly 2 million years. That's if you drove 55 miles per hour and didn't take any rest stops.
Light from the sun travels a lot faster than you can in your car. A beam of light travels at about 186,000 miles per second. It takes sunlight a little more than 8 minutes to reach Earth.

9,"For years, scientists have known about a group of icy objects, called
, in our solar system. They circle the sun between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus. Scientists thought centaurs were made of ice and were almost completely smooth. But recent photos of one of those objects, named Asbolus 8405, are proving scientists wrong.
Rather than finding a smooth surface, scientists discovered a crater near one end of Asbolus 8405. And centaurs are not made entirely of ice, either. Scientists saw material inside the crater that did not look like frozen water. Some scientists now say centaurs are made of a mixture of water, methane, and ammonia ice.
Asbolus 8405 formed when the solar system first formed, scientists say. They hope that the object will help them learn more about what the solar system was like when it first formed.

135,"Weather forecasters get ready for a busy tornado season.
Tornado season got off to a furious start this
year. Record-setting swarms of as many as 113 tornadoes clobbered five Midwestern states in mid-March.
The map shows tornado alley. More tornadoes sweep through tornado alley than any other part of the world.
Battered communities are continuing to recover from the tornadoes that sent fierce winds and softballsize hail across Missouri, Illinois, Kansas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. The powerful winds destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses, uprooted trees, and toppled power lines. The storms killed 12 people.
""Its just amazing how devastating it is,"" Mayor Tim Davlin of Springfield, Illinois, said after the storms. ""It looks like the pictures we saw a couple months ago after [Hurricane] Katrina."" Powerful tornado winds ripped through the state capital and left roof tiles, gasoline pumps, and other
in their wake. Debris is the scattered pieces of something that has been destroyed.

Tornado in Union City, Oklahoma, May 24, 1973
are natures most destructive storms, with winds that can spiral up to 300 miles per hour. A tornado, also known as a twister, is a rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm cloud to the ground. Tornadoes come in all shapes and sizes and do not always appear in the funnel form depicted in movies such as
The March tornadoes occurred when cold weather from the west collided with warm weather from the Gulf of Mexico.
Wind gusts that raged across the Midwest reached 90 miles per hour in five states, according to the National Weather Services Storm Prediction Center. One gust clocked in at 107 miles per hour in Kansas.
Tornadoes can strike in any month in any part of the world. In the United States, peak activity for tornado season is from April through July.
scientists who study weathersay the series of 113 damaging storms that tore through the Midwest will beat the recent record for the number of tornadoes on a single day in March. The previous record was 69 on March 13, 1990. ""For this early in the year, its a heck of a deal,"" says weather expert Joe Schaefer. ""What happens after that is anybodys guess.""
After the thunderstorms caused the series of deadly twisters, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for Michigan and Indiana. If a
is issued for an area, the conditions are favorable for a tornado to form. If the Weather Service issues a
for an area, a tornado has been spotted. In the case of a tornado warning, people should seek safe shelter immediately.
The National Weather Service also employs storm spotters to help predict where and when a tornado will strike. The trained volunteers are positioned before a storm hits to report what they see developing in the sky. Their reports confirm what weather forecasters see on their radar screens.
For many, there is no escaping the tornadoes wrath. ""It was over before you knew it,"" Greg Kospar of Bentonville, Arkansas, told reporters after the storm. ""The house is gone.""
The strength of a tornado and its potential to cause damage are rated using the Fujita scale, with 0 being the weakest and 5 being the strongest. A new tornado rating system is scheduled to go into effect early next year.
 Warm and cold air meet and rise into the storm cloud.
 Sometimes the rising air begins to spin, which can form a funnel-shaped cloud.
 When the funnel-shaped cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.
in the American Midwest. In this area, hot air traveling north from the Gulf of Mexico intersects with cool, dry air from Canada and the west, creating large thunderstorm clouds.
Each year the United States experiences about 100,000 thunderstorms. Those storms form about
A twister can last from a few seconds to more than an hour, but

The record breaker for the most tornadoes in one month was 543 in May 2003.

718,"New evidence suggests the famous ship sank faster than previously thought.
A new discovery has surfaced surrounding the worlds most famous shipwreck. The Titanics plunge to the ocean floor might have been faster than previously thought, say researchers.

On April 14, 1912, the luxury liner struck an iceberg on its very first voyage and sank to the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean. Before the ship departed from Southampton, England, on its way to New York, it was hailed as ""unsinkable."" On that fateful April night, more than 1,500 people sank to their watery graves 2 miles below the oceans surface.
In 1985, explorer Robert Ballard and his team discovered the wreck in two pieces. The wreck was found about 1,000 miles east of Boston, Massachusetts.
were found about a third of a mile from the wreck. The hull is the main part of the ship.
Undersea explorers say these pieces make up the bottom section that was missing when the ship was discovered nearly 21 years ago. It wasnt until after the bottom section of the hull broke off that the bow and the stern split.
expert David Brown estimated it took 20 minutes for the ship to sink. Now he says it likely plunged to the bottom of the ocean within five minutes. ""It was over more quickly,"" says Brown.

668,"The planet's famous rings have changed in the past 25 years.
Cassini is studying Saturn and capturing pictures of its rings.
Scientists have uncovered some of Saturn's secrets. Researchers recently learned that the planet's famous rings have changed during the past 25 years. The information has been collected from tools aboard the
, or circling, the ringed planet last year.
is studying Saturn and capturing pictures of its rings. Its ring bands are named with the letters
. The rings, however, are not in alphabetical order. They were assigned a letter in the order in which they were discovered.
One of the most surprising finds is that parts of Saturn's innermost ringthe D ringhave grown dimmer since 1981. In addition, the D ring has moved 125 miles closer to Saturn.
What do these new discoveries mean? Scientists aren't sure, but hope the discoveries will reveal clues about the age of the rings around the sixth planet from the sun. ""I don't think Saturn's rings will disappear anytime soon, but this tells us how the rings are [changing] and how long they might last,"" says Linda Spilker, a scientist with the U.S. space agency, NASA.
Although Saturn's rings appear solid, they are actually made up of pieces of rock, ice, and dust. Those pieces vary from the size of tiny dust particles to the size of large mountains.
Scientists are also studying the shimmering rings to learn more about how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. They say that Saturn's rings are a model of the gas and dust that once surrounded the sunthe center of the solar system.
The image of Enceladus was taken by the
spacecraft. Enceladus is one of Saturn's 47 known moons. The red areas appear to be craters and ridges on the icy moon's surface.
Other images revealed water vapor escaping from cracks on the moon. Water vapor indicates that Saturn has an
, a layer of air that surrounds a planet.
Tiny Enceladus now joins Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa as places in the solar system that may have liquid water beneath their surfaces. Water is necessary for life to exist.

467,"How will a growing U.S. population affect the countrys future?
The United States is about to reach a huge milestone. The population will hit 300 million sometime in late October, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The estimate is based on a running total of births, deaths, and the number of people moving in and out of the country.

With the 300 million milestone getting closer, more people are discussing the issue of illegal immigration, along with other aspects of the countrys future. For some, the population growth means more power.

Deforestation occurs when farmers and loggers cut down trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads.

331,"Many people think that the new millennium began on January 1, 2000. But they're wrong. The new millennium actually begins January 1, 2001. That's because the calendar we use doesn't have a year zero. Our present calendar actually began with the year 1.
A year may be only 365 days, but a lot can happen in such a short time. Below are just a few of the many important events that took place this past year.
It was a tough summer for many people in the western United States. Wildfires burned about 7 million acres of land--six times the size of the Grand Canyon National Park. The fires forced thousands of people to leave their homes. Many people returned home and found charred rubble.
Recovery is already under way in most burned areas. In Utah, officials from one park are using a helicopter to spread grass seeds over wide areas.
The United States was the top medal winner at the 2000 Olympic Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. The United States took home a total of 97 medals, 39 of which were gold.
There were some spectacular events in this year's Summer Games. One of the highlights was the victory of U.S. wrestler Rulon Gardner (left) over Russian Alexander Karelin. Gardner beat Karelin, who had not lost a match in 13 years, by 1 point.
received its first long-term guests in November. The station, which is being built with help from 16 nations, was first put in orbit in 1998.
According to NASA (the U.S. space agency), the station should be completed by 2006 and will weigh more than 1 million pounds. Scientists will stay in the
to conduct long-term experiments that cannot be done on Earth.
Terrorism struck Americans on October 12 when a bomb ripped a huge hole in the side of the Navy destroyer USS
. The ship was docked in Aden. Yemen, a country in the Middle East.
U.S. officials said that the attack occurred when two men in a rubber boat exploded a bomb next to one side of the
. The blast killed 17 sailors and injured dozens of others. Another ship carried the
to the United States, where it will be rebuilt.
More than 97 million people voted for president of the United States on Tuesday, November 7. Most political experts had predicted that the race would be close, but no one knew that it would be as close as it turned out to be.
On the day after the election, Vice President Al Gore had slightly more votes than Texas Governor George W. Bush had. But the vote in Florida was so close that the state had to recount all 6 million votes cast in that state. The race was so close that no one knew who had actually won the election long after the polls closed.

that resembles a furry lobster in the South Pacific Ocean, about 900 miles south of Easter Island. A crustacean is a sea creature that has an outer skeleton, such as a lobster or a crab.

Kiwa is the goddess of crustaceans in Polynesian mythology, and

125,"Lack of Zzzs Can Lead to Injuries
Fourth grader Annie Inglese knows how important it is to get the right amount of sleep each night. ""If I don't get enough sleep,"" she says, ""I have trouble getting up in the morning.""
Sleep experts say that kids who do not get a good night's sleep on a regular basis put their safety at risk. Delaying bedtime for other activities can lead to accidents, such as falling off a bike or getting hurt on the playground.
In addition to preventing injuries, children who get enough sleep on a regular basis tend to get better grades and be in a better mood. ""Sleep is just as important as nutrition and exercise in our overall health,"" says Dr. Carl Hunt, a sleep expert with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Estimates show about 1 out of every 4 adults does not get enough sleep. Sleep experts think that number may be just as high for kids. According to the NIH, children ages 7 to 11 need at least nine hours of sleep each night.
Most kids and families today have busy schedules that can keep them from getting enough sleep. Plus, watching television, chatting on the Internet, and playing video games all compete with valuable sleep time.
Going to bed at the same time each night will help you get a good night's sleep. If you have trouble falling asleep, Dr. Hunt advises you to unwind with quiet time. Reading or listening to soothing music can help bring on sleep.

303,"This summer, when 'N Sync took the stage at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Morgan Oseiki was there. The 9-year-old told
that the group did more than ""Bring in' Da Noise."" The members of the band talked about the dangers of illegal drugs.
Justin Timberlake, Chris Kirkpatrick, Lance Bass, JC Chasez, and Joey Fatone have joined forces with the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. The drug policy office designs programs to help kids stay away from drugs.
Because 'N Sync is one of the best bands today, the White House office asked the group to bring its anti-drug message to kids. ""We think having ['N Sync] as part of our team is really going to raise the volume on our message to kids,"" said Edward H. Jurith, who is head of the White House office. Together, the White House office and 'N Sync are promoting the National Youth Anti-Drug Campaign.
As part of their summer tour, the boys talked about their ""anti-drugs,"" the things they do instead of drugs. The group also invited kids to send their anti-drugs to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
Here's what some kids said their anti-drugs are:
Grace Chen, 11, of Glen Dale, Maryland, said it's music. She plays the violin.
Rachel Acevedo, age 10, of Altamonte Springs, Florida, said it's swimming.
Dipo Adedeji, age 11, of Glen Dale, Maryland, said it's basketball.
Abigail Tang, age 12, of Brooklyn, New York, said it's writing.
Diana Barrientos, age 11, of Alexandria, Virginia, said it's drawing.

753,"Does the classic tale about a woodworker whose puppet becomes a live boy sound familiar? Do you remember the name of the puppet from that story? If you answered Pinocchio, you are correct.
Many kids are unaware that the original Pinocchio story was not written in America. Pinocchio's roots can be traced back to Tuscany, an area of Italy. Carlo Collodi wrote the original story in Italy in 1881. Since then the book has been translated into more than 250 languages.
, or changed, many times since Collodi's original version. Now the puppet-turned-boy is about to embark on a new journey in the movie
. The plot of the movie has an interesting twist. Pinocchio is turned back from a boy into a puppet!
The movie appears on HBO Family in February and comes out on video and DVD in April. Playing the part of Pinocchio is 16-year-old Gabriel Thomson, who lives in England. Gabriel starred in the movie when he was 12 years old.
Gabriel described his experience as ""incredible."" During filming, he attended school for three hours each day and worked with different tutors.
Just as Pinocchio learns lessons about growing up, Gabriel learned some of his own lessons. ""I learned a lot about acting from Martin Landau, [the actor who plays Geppetto]. He taught me how to relax on the set.""

430,"told you that kids are not getting enough sleep. Now a new report shows that kids are not alone.
About two-thirds of U.S. adults say that they do not get eight hours of sleep a night, according to the 2001 Sleep in America Poll by the National Sleep Foundation (NSF). Those adults also said that they often are not fully awake when they drive and that they find it hard to stay awake while at work. According to the report, more than half of adults drive while drowsy, and nearly two out of ten say they have fallen asleep at the wheel.
""There is an epidemic of sleepiness in our society,"" said James Walsh, vice president of the NSF. ""People may be getting sleep, but it is at school, at work, and behind the wheel.""

249,"What is putting important world landmarks at risk?
Florida Everglades National Park covers more than 100,000 acres of swampland in southern Florida.
What do the Florida Everglades, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, and Kathmandu, Nepal, have in common? More than you might think!
."") World Heritage Sites are protected because they have special environmental, historic, or cultural value.
That isnt the only thing the landmarks share. Experts say the Everglades, the Great Barrier Reef, and Kathmandu are in trouble and should be closed off by 2020.
are endangering the landmarks, warns a new report by the Centre for Future Studies (CFS). Global warming is the gradual rise in Earths average temperature.
""The combined impact of too many tourists stomping all over these important sites plus climate change is having a severe [effect],"" Susi Moser, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told
The last nine years were the hottest since scientists began tracking Earths temperature in 1861. Some scientists say global warming will create more
or powerful, hurricanes. Researchers predict that the heat will cause glaciers in the Antarctic to melt. That will cause ocean levels to rise.
Those changes could destroy the Everglades, the CFS report says. Stronger hurricanes could threaten the areas plant and animal species, including American crocodiles and manatees. Rising seawater could flood the swampy region.
Its important to protect the 2,358-square-mile landmark, Jan Michael Jacobson, director of the Everglades Institute, told
""The Everglades primarily is valuable because it is a unique habitat,"" he said.
The historic temples of Kathmandu, Nepal, were built between 1300 and 1800. They draw millions of tourists each year.
The Great Barrier Reef and Kathmandu are facing a different threattourists. The Great Barrier Reef attracts about 1.8 million tourists a year, who pump billions of dollars into Australias economy. Visitors can also damage the delicate system of coral reefs.
Tourists are endangering Kathmandu, too, CFS officials say. The valley is in the shadow of Mount Everest, the worlds tallest mountain. The report warns that skiers and climbers hoping to tackle Mount Everest and other Himalayan peaks may harm Kathmandus ancient temples.
The effects of global warming are already being felt. More than 150 countries are working to stop the rising temperatures. They have
emissions. Those gases contribute to global warming.
As for the Great Barrier Reef and Kathmandu, the CFS report recommends limiting the number of tourists allowed to visit the sites. But some people say that visiting endangered landmarks could encourage tourists to fight for their protection.
Many cars and factories burn fossil fuels. That releases greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the air. Those gases form a layer and trap the suns heat close to Earth.
That process is called the greenhouse effect. The layer of gases acts as a window in a greenhouse doesit lets in heat but doesnt let much out. The result is global warming, a worldwide rise in average temperature.
There are 788 World Heritage Sites, but becoming one is not easy. Landmarks must meet one of 10 requirements. For instance, a site must represent a unique culture or a significant period in history. Independent groups
or examine, each landmark. Then an international committee, which is part of the United Nations, votes on the new sites. The Great Wall of China and the Statue of Liberty are included on the list.

719,"There is good news for rhinos. Wildlife experts recently discovered the tracks of 13 Sumatran rhinos in Borneo, an island in Southeast Asia. The number thrilled scientists because the animals are on the verge of extinction.
Sumatran rhinos have been hunted illegally for their horns, which are prized in traditional Asian medicine. Wildlife groups are working to stop illegal hunting and protect the endangered creatures. The Sumatran rhino is one of three species of endangered Asian rhinos left in the wild.

514,"Does your puppy groove to the song ""Who Let the Dogs Out?"" Does your cat purr when you pump up the volume? Does your bunny thump to the hip-hop beat? Thanks to DogCatRadio.com, pets can rock out to a new online radio station devoted just to them.
The radio station is the pet project of record producer Adrian Martinez of Los Angeles, California. He started the station so dogs, cats, birds, and other animals can be entertained while theyre home alone. The owner of six dogs and two cats, Martinez got the idea from his cat Snickers. He noticed that Snickers was calmer when music was playing. Pets can be less lonely while they rock out to tunes from artists such as Snoop Dogg, Bow Wow, the Stray Cats, and Pet Shop Boys.

267,"During National SAFE KIDS Week, doctors plan to give kids tips about how to prevent accidents.
Each year, about 6,000 U.S. kids under age 14 are killed in accidents, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Another 120,000 kids each year are permanently disabled in accidents.
The graph shows the number of kids ages 5 to 14 who were treated in emergency rooms in 1999 for injuries suffered while doing these four activities.
""Summer is the most dangerous time of the year for kids,"" said Dr. C. Everett Koop, who is head of the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Koop added, ""The good news is that families can take simple steps to ensure their kids stay out of emergency rooms.""
The 2001 campaign is paying special attention to scooter-related injuries. Because more kids are riding scooters, doctors expect a rise in scooter accidents.
In 2000, more than 30,000 people went to emergency rooms for scooter-related injuries, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said. Most of those injured were kids age 14 or younger.
Because many scooter accidents result in head injuries, some cities and states have passed helmet laws. The New York City passed a law requiring scooter riders under age 14 to wear helmets. Fourth graders from Connecticut, asked their state government to pass a similar law.
Scooter accidents may be on the rise, but bicycles account for more injuries than scooters or any other product except cars, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign.
In 1999, 340,000 kids age 5 to 14 were treated in hospital emergency rooms for bicycle-related injuries, SAFE KIDS reported. The most common bicycle-related injuries are injuries to the head.
The best way for kids to protect their heads while riding bikes is by wearing helmets. But the National SAFE KIDS Campaign says only 15 percent to 25 percent of kids who ride bikes wear helmets while riding.

564,"A rover like this one is making its way across the surface of Mars in search of life.
Here is one question that many people ask: Is there, or has there ever been, life on Mars?
Scientists are hoping to answer that question. In late June and early July, NASA launched two robot vehicles called
, the rovers weigh about 400 pounds each and are about the size of golf carts. The rovers are scheduled to land on the Red Planet in January 2004. Mars is called the Red Planet because its soil is a dark red color.
Don't expect the rovers to find little green aliens on the fourth planet from the sun. Instead, they will be on the lookout for signs that water once flowed on Mars. They will also search for evidence that some ice exists under the planet's surface. Scientists say that evidence of water on Mars can mean that life once existed on this planet.
Unlike Earth, Mars is dusty, very cold, and dry. ""We're going to look for signs that tell us that Mars may have been warmer and wet in the past,"" said a
Still, Mars is more like Earth than any other planet in the solar system. It has mountains, valleys, ice caps, and dry riverbeds.
The Red Planet even has seasons, wind and dust storms, and a rocky surface.
The seven-month journey for the rovers won't be an easy one. So far, only three of nine spacecraft that Americans and Russians have sent to Mars have completed the journey without breaking apart or failing.
The rovers were launched from a rocket and will travel through space in a protective shell. They will use parachutes and air bags to bounce to their landing sites. They will land on opposite sides of the planet.
The rovers are equipped with robotic arms, special tools, and cameras. As part of their mission, they will drill through rocks on Mars' surface and take pictures of them.
Then, they will then send the pictures back to Earth for scientists to study. Each rover can travel about the length of a football field each day.
""We will be using the rovers to find rocks and soils that could hold clues about [the possibility of water in] Mars' past,"" said another NASA scientist.
Missions to Mars typically occur when the two planets are close to each other. Mars recently made its closest pass to Earth in 60,000 years. On August 27, Mars was only about 34 million miles from Earth.
Distance from Earth on August 27, 2003:
Besides the moon, Mars will be the brightest object in the southeastern sky through early October. Many people are jumping at the chance to get a rare look at the Red Planet. Many
around the country have been flooded with stargazers excited to get a peek at Mars. An observatory is a place where people use telescopes to study the sky and stars. This view of Mars is a once-in-a-lifetime event. It won't be this close again until the year 2287.
Why is water needed for life to exist?

19,"The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States. It has nine justices. They are appointed for life by the president and approved by the Senate.
The Supreme Court rules whether federal, state, and local governments are following the written laws of the U.S. Constitution.
The Supreme Court hears only certain cases. Once the Court rules on a case, the decision is final. All other courts in the United States must follow the Supreme Court's decision in similar cases. This helps make sure that all Americans receive equal justice.

644,"Kid Radio Show Arrives in School Buses
Is your bus drivers taste in music driving you crazy? If so, you may be in luck. Theres a new radio show just for kids. Called Bus Radio, it started playing in school buses in October.
or play on the air, on 800 school buses in 11 states. The show plays the latest The show plays the latest songs by Kelly Clarkson, Jesse McCartney, Bo Bice, and other artists. It also has contests and safety tips.
Bus Radio officials say the best part about the show is what it
play. Bus Radio doesnt air songs with swear words or violent lyrics. It also doesnt play commercials meant for adults, which might be bad for kids.
However, Bus Radio isnt music to everyones ears. After all, in addition to music and contests, the show also plays eight minutes of advertising every hour.
Most radio stations have ads. Bus Radio advertisers know that kids are listening. So they air ads for toys and other products that will grab kids attention. Even if kids dont want to listen, they dont have a choice. They cant get off the bus until they reach their stop.
Thats why school officials in Fairfax County, Virginia, decided not to play Bus Radio. ""We are in the business of educating children, not selling them Barbie dolls and computer games for profit,"" Linda Farbry, the districts director of transportation, told
4 billion miles those buses travel in a year
417 average number of trips each bus makes in a year

662,"Chinese New Year kicks off on January 29. The date marks the beginning of the year in the Chinese calendar.
People in China and in Chinese communities around the world will celebrate the holiday with fireworks, dancers in dragon costumes, and parades. In Chinatown in San Francisco, California, for example, thousands of people will line the streets to watch a parade with dragon dancing, floats, and marching bands.
The Chinese calendar is divided into months based on the cycles of the moon. The Chinese New Year begins on the first new moon between January 21 and February 20. The festivities last for 15 days.
At the New Years Eve meal, people remember their favorite relatives and eat traditional foods, such as whole fish, dumplings, and noodles. The last day of the Chinese New Year is called the Lantern Festival. It is celebrated at night, and children carry lanterns in parades.

740,"Have you seen a 6-foot-tall statue that has red hair and red nose and is wearing a yellow outfit with big, floppy red shoes? If so, the police in Normal, Illinois, want to talk to you. They're looking for a statue of Ronald McDonald that was stolen from a McDonald's restaurant.
Police say this is the third time that the statue has been stolen in the last five years. A spokesperson for the McDonald's restaurant isn't sure how the statue was removed from the restaurant grounds. ""The guys who put the statue in [after the last time it was taken] said there was no way he was going to be taken again,"" the spokesperson said. But the installers were wrong.
The people who stole the statue may think that the theft is a prank. But they broke the law by stealing someone else's property. McDonald's wants Ronald back. The restaurant is offering a $250 reward for information on the missing statue's whereabouts.

133,"Now that you have an escape plan, get your family together to practice it. Join families across the U.S. and Canada in practicing ""The Great Escape"" on October 11, 2000, at 7:00 p.m. You'll be part of the world's largest fire drill! Better yet, you and your family will know exactly what to do if there is ever a fire in your home.
Test your doors and windows. They must all open easily so that you can get out easily.
Are there any boxes, toys, or pieces of furniture blocking your escape path? Move them out of the way!
Make sure all smoke alarms are working by pushing the test buttons.
: Newer smoke alarms have a universal signal repetition pattern of three beeps, followed by a one and a half second pause.
Start your home fire escape drill by assigning one member of the family to push the test button on your smoke alarm. When you hear the alarm, spring into action!
Feel around the door frame and the space between the door and frame with the back of your hand. Is it warm? For the first run through of your drill, pretend that it's not warm. That means you can exit the room safely because the fire is not nearby.
For the second drill, pretend that the door does feel warm. What's your plan now?
At the end of each drill, meet outside at your family meeting area. Practice your home fire escape plan at least twice a year with every member of your household.
Many communities have 911 emergency telephone service. Other communities have a different number for help in an emergency. What is the emergency telephone number where you live?

582,"Tourists Put Pressure on World's Monuments and Parks
Some of the World's most important monuments and parks are being loved to death. Many sites around the world are in bad shape because of a recent sharp increase in the number of tourists worldwide. The causes of damage range from everyday wear and tear to pollution to
, or the destruction of property on purpose.
Each year, hundreds of millions of tourists visit special places around the world. In fact, according to the World Tourism Organization, by the end of this year about 668 million people will have made tourist trips. By 2020, the organization said, that number may more than double, to 1.5 billion tourists!
The problem is that a large number of visitors can damage a monument or park. The thousands of cars and buses that carry tourists to a site create air pollution. Air pollution can discolor and damage monuments made of stone and other materials. Huge numbers of tourists also cause garbage to pile up. And sometimes tourists take pieces of monuments away with them as souvenirs.
These are some of the special places that are suffering from too much attention:
. These are two of the biggest national parks in the United States. Millions of tourists each year crowd into these areas. As a result, air pollution, garbage, and other damage have marred these awesome sites.
. Located in Peru, a country in South America, Machu Picchu is the site of an ancient city in the Andes Mountains. A people called the Incas built the city almost 600 years ago for Incan royalty. Garbage tossed aside by tourists, as well as air and water pollution, are now problems at Machu Picchu.
. The Parthenon is a temple that was built almost 2,500 years ago in Athens, a city in the European country of Greece. Air pollution has pitted and discolored the marble that the beautiful building is made of.
. Located near the town of Dunhuang, in north-central China, these caves are covered with delicate paintings and carvings. However, the breath of the 300,000 visitors who pass through the 492 caves each year is damaging the artwork, which is between 700 and 1,700 years old.
To help preserve such important places, new rules are being written by organizations such as UNESCO, which is a part of the United Nations. UNESCO is working with governments worldwide to limit the number of tourists who visit some special sites.
UNESCO is also working to educate sightseers about how to avoid damaging the places they visit. As one student who works with UNESCO said, ""You have to protect the past to reach tomorrow.""
If you are visiting a monument or national park, here are a few rules the U.S. Park Service says you should always follow:
If you are camping, take your trash and leftover food out with you when you leave.
When visiting a monument, don't touch sculptures, paintings, or other artwork.
Leave any artifacts, plants, stones, or other things where they are.
If you see someone damaging a monument or throwing garbage on the ground in a park, tell a park ranger or another park official.

238,"Laura Bush (above) thinks that reading is one of the most important things you can do.
kid reporter Fabien Navidi-Kasmai visited the White House on a special assignment. The 10-year-old found out what it's like to be a member of the press. He interviewed First Lady Laura Bush as part of the National Book Festival in early October.
The National Book Festival, which was held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., celebrates books and reading. Approximately 75,000 people attended the festival this year. Laura Bush told Fabien that she was happy to see such a large turnout at the festival.
Fabien was nervous before the interview, but the first lady quickly put him at ease. They discussed the Harry Potter book series and shared their love of reading.
In fact, the fifth grader learned that Laura Bush especially enjoyed reading Weekly Reader when she was in elementary school. ""Reading is one of the most important things you can do,"" the first lady told Fabien. ""If you love to read, you'll never be lonely-you'll always have a friend.""

348,"As firefighters battle the flames, how do some fires help Mother Nature?
Whoosh! Within seconds, a spark sets off large flames. The flames of a wildfire tear through a forest, destroying thousands of acres of trees and brush and threatening the homes of people and animals.
From California to Colorado and from Alaska to Arizona, firefighters have been battling thousands of wildfires this year. Wildfire season began in June and will last through November. So far, the flames have destroyed more than 3 million acres in the United Statesan area about the size of New Jersey!
The states in red show where the most wildfires have occurred this year.
Most wildfires are started naturally, either by lightning or from the sun's heat. Others are accidentally started by careless humans who leave campfires burning.
Hot, dry weather has caused most of this season's wildfires to spread. ""This year is unique,"" Rose Davis, an official at the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center, told
. Davis explained that the Northwest is suffering a
. A drought is a long period of dry weather with little rain. In the Southwest, heavy rains in the spring caused a lot of new grass to grow. The new grass burns quickly when it dries out.
Firefighters have been fighting the scorching flames from the ground and the air. Specially trained firefighters called
parachute from planes or helicopters to reach
fires. Because smoke jumpers leap into out-of-the-way areas, they carry enough food and water with them to survive for several days.
Although wildfires can be very dangerous, they are not all bad. In areas where few people live, officials monitor the wildfires. Sometimes, officials allow them to burn because the fires help the environment and keep forests healthy. ""If fires are going to spread to people's homes and property, we have to put them out,"" smoke jumper Lori Messenger told
Wildfires are like nature's housekeeperand forests come back to life after fires. ""Fire is a natural part of our forests,"" says Messenger. ""The fires kill the less healthy, diseased trees. They clean out the brush to make space for animals to graze on the new grass that grows.""
Some plants also need heat from a fire to help them release their seeds, which grow into new plants after a fire. Fire is nature's way of recycling dead plants into the soil. The dead plants help return nutrients to the soil.
Although some animals die, many creatures have ways of protecting themselves. Large animals, such as deer, moose, and buffalo, head to safety. Small animals, such as snakes, toads, and mice, burrow in the ground.
""It's important to realize that fires are an important part of what happens in a forest,"" says Messenger. ""It's a complicated balance, and people who manage the forest have to make good decisions about what fires will be fought and what fires will be left to burn.""
What qualities do you think a person needs to be a smoke jumper?
A fire requires three ingredients to burnheat, fuel, and oxygen. The combination of those three building blocks is referred to as the fire triangle.
is responsible for starting the fire. Heat can come from a lit match or a bolt of lightning, for example.
is anything that will burn. In a wildfire, fuel can be logs, grass, or even paper and trash.
is a gas and must be in the air for a fire to start. Burning fuel reacts with oxygen in the air to release heat, gases, and smoke.

62,"1805 - Surveyors discover the Old Man
1905 - People realize the face is breaking apart.
1915 - Crews work to repair the face.
1928 - Surrounding land becomes a state forest and park.
1945 - Old Man becomes New Hampshires state symbol.
1960 - More efforts are made to protect
2002 - the Old Man from collapsing.
One of New Hampshires most famous faces recently became history. In May, the Old Man of the Mountain crumbled to the ground.
The Old Man, of course, wasnt a person but a rock formation that nature carved out thousands of years ago. With its pointed nose, sharp chin, and heavy forehead, the mountainside looked like the profile of an old mans face. A
is a side view of a face.
Located on Cannon Mountain, the Old Man was a popular tourist spot and a favorite among the people of New Hampshire. In fact, the jagged rock face was considered the state symbol. It appeared on state quarters, road signs, and many souvenirs.
The famous landmark stretched 40 feet high and 25 feet wide. Long concerned that it would collapse, officials made several efforts to save the mountain face. However, the heavy snow and strong winds of this past winter finally caused the cliff to collapse.
Now a special state committee has been set up to decide if the stone profile should be replaced with a man-made face. ""He was part of our history, and he can still be a part of our history if we rebuild him,"" said a New Hampshire man who recalled learning about the famous face in the fourth grade.
Do you think the Old Man should be rebuilt? Why or why not?
However, other people dont necessarily feel the same way. ""Mother Nature put him there, and Mother Nature took him,"" said one committee member. ""To put it back up, to rebuild, wouldnt be the same.""

353,"Say Ahh! A New Vaccine Fights Cavities
If you have had a cavity, you have probably felt the bite of a dentist's whirling drill as it cuts into your tooth. Soon, however, the dentist may no longer need a drill.
Tooth decay is a disease. So dentists at Harvard University decided to fight the disease that causes cavities. ""We decided to try to beat the disease, rather than just drill and fill [cavities],"" said dentist Daniel Smith.
, or a medicine, that could prevent cavities. The vaccine attacks the
, or germs, that live on teeth. The germs make an acid that causes cavities.
The vaccine is a new way to prevent tooth decay. Brushing after meals and cutting back on sweets are two other weapons used to fight cavities.
, a chemical that strengthens teeth, also fights cavities. Fluoride is added to water and toothpaste. But many countries can't afford to put fluoride in water, and fluoride doesn't kill cavity-causing bacteria.
""[Tooth decay] is an epidemic worldwide,"" Smith said. ""Even if you have fluoride, you still have the bug [that causes tooth decay].""
So far, the scientists have tested the vaccine on rats. The rats that took the vaccine didn't get many cavities.
Now the scientists want people to try the vaccine. If it works, dentists may have a lot less drilling to do--other than drilling it into people's heads to remember to take the vaccine!

178,"Rosa Parks is arrested and fingerprinted again in February 1956 for breaking segregation laws.
Fifty years ago, one brave woman's refusal to give up her bus seat changed history.
Honor the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest and the start of the Montgomery bus boycott with our classroom play.
During the 1950s, the law in the South prevented black
people from having the same rights as white people. At that time, the South was
by law. Black people were forced to sit in the back of public buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, drinking fountains, and other public facilities.
Those laws made Rosa Parks angry. She was a well-known leader in the African American community of Montgomery, Alabama. For years, Rosa Parks had stood up to unfair laws against African Americans. She worked courageously with other African American leaders to change them. She also was one of the first women in Montgomery to join the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to fight for
, or equal rights under the law.
Rosa Parks had refused to move from her seat on city buses in the past. Drivers simply forced her off the bus. But 50 years ago, on December 1, 1955, her action changed history. She refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person and was arrested. Her arrest led to the Montgomery
. During the yearlong boycott, African Americans refused to ride public buses. As a result of the boycott and Rosa Parks's courage, the law was changed to provide equal seating on buses. It marked the beginning of the struggle to end segregation.
SCENE 1: Downtown Montgomery, Alabama, December 1, 1955
Rosa Parks, 42, boards a city bus on her way home from work as a seamstress.
At the time, buses are divided into two sections. The section at the front of the bus is for whites only. The section for black people begins five to 10 rows back. Holding her head high, Rosa Parks sits down in the first row of the ""colored"" section.
After the bus grinds to a stop, a few white people get on. They quickly fill the empty seats in the ""whites-only"" section. One white man is left standing. According to a city law, black people are to give up their seats in the colored section if no seats remain in the white section.
There are white people who want to sit down.
You know white people and black people can't sit in the same row. Are you going to stand up?
Then I'm going to have you arrested.
A few minutes later, two police officers board the bus and walk toward Rosa Parks.
Did the driver tell you to stand?
Why do you all push us around?
I don't know, but the law is the law, and you're under arrest.
SCENE 2: Rosa Parks's house, that night
Rosa Parks is released from jail on bail that day. She and other Montgomery civil rights leaders meet at her house to discuss the bus boycott.
For years, civil rights leaders have been planning a bus boycott to fight segregation. They are waiting for the right time and the right leader to spark the boycottand Rosa Parks is that person. They know Rosa Parks has the courage to stand up to segregation. Because most of Montgomery's bus riders are black, the bus companies will lose money if black people refuse to ride the buses.
I know one thing, I will never, ever ride another segregated bus againeven if it means I have to walk to work.
You have to stand up for what you believe in.
Rosa, how would you feel about making your arrest a test case against segregation? We may be able to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.
I don't like being in the spotlight, and I don't want to put my family in danger.
Rosa, this may be our best chance to fight segregation laws.
Good. In the meantime, we're going to boycott the buses.
The next day, community leaders meet to discuss the boycott. At their request, Martin Luther King Jr. agrees to lead it.
SCENE 3: Montgomery courthouse, a few days later
Rosa Parks approaches the courthouse steps with her husband for her trial.
The steps of the courthouse are packed with people. Some bystanders threaten Rosa Parks. Others shout their support.
Your place is in the back of the bus, lady!
Oh, she's so sweet. They've messed with the wrong one now!
After Rosa Parks and her husband manage to push their way into the courtroom, the trial begins. The bus driver takes the stand.
I politely asked her to move to the back, which is required by city law. She refused to listen.
Rosa Parks is not called to the stand. Instead, her lawyers speak on her behalf.
I find Rosa Parks guilty of violating the city law. She must pay a $10 fine plus $4 in court costs.
The crowd of supporters in the courtroom reacts angrily to the verdict.
You haven't heard the last from us.
Despite the boos from supporters, the guilty verdict was exactly what Rosa Parks and her lawyers wanted. Their case eventually made it to the nation's highest courtthe Supreme Court.
Montgomery's black community continued to boycott the buses. On November 13, 1956, their efforts finally paid off. The Supreme Court ruled that Alabama's segregated buses were against the law. After more than a year, the boycott ended.
At the urging of photographers, Rosa Parks boarded a bus on December 20. This time, she sat in the front seat. (See the cover.)

739,"When it comes to youth sports, parents and coaches are dropping the ball. The Citizenship Through Sports Alliance (CTSA) recently issued the first report card for childrens sportsand the grades need some improvement.
Parents got Ds for poor behavior and for not caring enough about their childs experience playing team sports. Coaches and youth sport programs overall received bad grades for focusing too much on winning and not enough on learning the game and having fun.
Many parents treat childrens sports like the professional leagues, according to the report card. Parents often pressure kids to train and win, rather than to have fun, stay fit, and develop strong character. They also focus on one sport instead of encouraging kids to try different ones.
""Sports are great for kids,"" CTSA official Ron Stratten told
""Sports help keep kids healthy and teach teamwork and hard work. The problem is with parents who dont understand that sports are for fun, friends, and fitness.""
The panel that issued the report card includes childrens sports leaders, coaches, parents, and other professionals. The CTSA has developed parents guides and community report cards to help teach parents and coaches better sportsmanship.
refers to fair play and reasonable behavior when playing a sport.

352,"Fourth grader David Casey likes to surf the Internet. He finds information that helps him do his homework. He listens to music and plays games on the Web. He even talks with friends in chat rooms-at least he used to.
After David started getting e-mail from strangers, his parents limited what he could do on the Web. His parents wanted to protect David.
Now the federal government is trying to protect David and other kids. ""Kids need a safe place to go on the Internet. This [bill] is the nation's best chance to guarantee kids an online experience that is fun and age-appropriate from start to finish,"" said Sen. Byron Dorgan.
These tips should help you surf the net more safely:
Tell your parents if anyone asks personal questions.
Never meet with someone you know only through the Web.
In November, Congress passed a bill that created a special domain name for kids. The new domain name is
A domain name comes at the end of a Web site address. A domain name tells you about the people who run a Web site. For example, a domain name can tell you whether a Web site is run by a business, an organization, or the government.
Web sites that use the new domain name must be appropriate for kids younger than 13 years old. Web sites with the
domain name will not link to sites that have different domain names. The sites will not have instant messaging or chat rooms unless they are safe for kids.
David's mother says the new domain name makes her feel better about the Internet. She says she will still watch what David does on the Web, but she will feel that David is safer.

615,"About 66 years ago, Walt Disney was working on a new movie,
. To make the movie, he had to name all seven dwarfs. The Disney Company now says Sleepy, Dopey, and Bashful almost had different names.
Today, the names of the seven tiny miners seem perfect, but Disney had a hard time coming up with them. He thought of 50 names before he settled on the seven we know.
Some of the names Disney came up with included Scrappy, Crabby, Biggy-Wiggy, Dumpy, Gaspy, Tearful, Snappy, Helpful, Busy, Dirty, Awful, Dizzy, Shifty, and Gloomy.
It's hard to imagine Snow White or the dwarfs whistling while they worked with Dirty or Dumpy. Can you picture a dwarf named Awful or Crabby being much fun? In the end, neither could Disney, and he came up with the names you know today.

733,"A group of college students has given new meaning to the words road trip. Beginning in mid-May, the students traveled from the East Coast to the West Coast aboard a bus that left the smell of fries and onion rings in its wake.
They weren't riding in an ordinary bus. They were traveling aboard a pollution-free vehicle that used recycled vegetable oil as fuel.
is the process of turning an old item into something new. Vegetable oil from cafeterias and restaurants powered the bus.
The students' college in Vermont provided about 200 gallons of vegetable oil to get the bus started. The vegetable oil had been used to fry chicken, potatoes, and other foods served in the cafeteria. As the students traveled across the country, they stopped at fast-food chains instead of gas stations to refuel the bus.
About a month later, the students completed their trek in Washington state. They hope to spread a message about protecting the environment.
Vegetable oil creates less pollution than diesel fuel, said one of the students. ""It's using some resource that was going to be thrown away and reusing it.""

156,"talks to actor Elijah Wood about playing a penguin.
Penguins are back on the big screen! The new movie
hits theaters on November 17. Elijah Wood stars in the animated movie as a tap-dancing penguin. Wood began his acting career when he was 9. He is known for his role as Frodo in the
caught up with Wood to find out what its like to become a cartoon penguin.
Did you think your first animated movie role would be as a penguin?
[laughs] No, definitely not. Getting to meet and work with George Miller, who directed
was pretty amazing. Im a big fan of his films.
So your character, Mumble, is a penguin that can dance but cant sing?
It was an idea developed by George. Apparently, emperor penguins can recognize each other in a group based on their songs. Mumble is born without the ability to sing. In its place, he has an odd ability to dance.
Ultimately, at the end of the film, the larger penguin community is taught a lesson that having a difference is all right. Everybody feels as though they have to change to fit in sometimes. In school, theres a feeling [that] you have to conform. Its actually our differences that should make us strong.
What do you think of the finished

Scientist discovered a tiny object in a strange orbit around Earth. A space object that orbits another object in space, as the moon does, is called a
. The newly discovered satellite completes its orbit once every 50 days.

783,"Elephants in New Delhi will soon be wearing reflectors so they can be seen at night.
The size of an elephant should make it easy to spot, right? That is not the case for some elephants in India.
Several elephants in New Delhi--the capital of that Asian country--have been hit by cars and killed. So a wildlife group has begun fitting the elephants with safety reflectors.
The reflectors work like the ones you find on a bike, bouncing back light from oncoming cars. The reflectors are attached to ropes that hang near an elephant's tail and hind legs.
In New Delhi, about 30 elephants work at night to help clear fallen trees. Many elephants are also forced to walk in the dark, after working at weddings and other religious festivals late at night. The elephants' dark skin makes it difficult for drivers to see them in the evening.
A wildlife group expert said, ""Most of India's 5,000 working elephants will soon [be wearing reflectors]."" That's a safe move!

495,"About 140 years ago, the Pony Express delivered mail to some parts of the United States. Today, mail is delivered to most communities by cars, trucks, trains, and planes. But in Supai, Arizona, mail carriers still deliver the mail the way carriers did 100 years ago--by mules.
About 600 Native Americans live in Supai. The town is located at the bottom of a canyon near the Grand Canyon.
Letter carrier Charlie Chamberlain loads packages on mules. The mules deliver mail to Supai, Arizona.
Before being delivered in Supai, mail arrives in the post office in Peach Springs, Arizona, about 70 miles from Supai. From Peach Springs, delivery trucks take the mail to the rim of the canyon. Letter carriers then use mules to carry the mail to Supai.
Letter carriers who deliver to Supai don't just carry letters and small packages; they deliver almost everything that goes to Supai.
""It's amazing what people can do when they put their minds to it,"" said Charlie Chamberlain, a letter carrier. ""They can pack things that you never would have thought of."" A washing machine is the most unusual item Charlie has delivered.

325,"A reward is being offered for toy ducks washing ashore.
Some people may find more than shells along the northeast coast of the United States. Rubber ducks could wash ashore any time soon.
About ten years ago, 29,000 yellow rubber ducks that were headed for bathtubs around the country became lost at sea. Boxes of the toys fell off a ship during a storm in the Pacific Ocean. Plastic beavers, turtles, and frogs were included in the shipment too.
has been tracking the toys' journey. An oceanographer is a scientist who studies the ocean.
The plastic toys floated along Alaska's coast and through the Bering Strait. Bobbing past polar bears and seals, the toys were caught in ice around the North Pole for several years.
They eventually made their way into the North Atlantic Ocean. Some washed up in Iceland. According to oceanographers, the ducks are now due to waddle ashore in New England and Canada.
The ducks' voyage is teaching oceanographers some lessons about currents, including how trash and ocean pollution travel. ""When trash goes into the ocean, it doesn't disappear,"" said the oceanographer tracking the ducks. ""It just goes somewhere else.""
To help with the research, The First Years, the company that owns the plastic toys, is offering a $100 savings bond for any duck that is returned by the end of the year. The ducks' color has faded, but there is a way to identify the plastic creatures. They are stamped with the words
Not just any duck will do. It has to be from the First Years flock! Believe it or not, many toy ducks are floating around the ocean. They are often left over from duck-race fundraisers. To learn more about the ducks, visit

475,"Thousands of students put their art skills to the test. They entered the annual greeting card contest sponsored by UNICEF, Pier 1, and Weekly Reader. Six-year-old Adam Carr from Florida and 12-year-old Anna Hall from Colorado took top honors. The two grand-prize winners won a trip to New York City, where they will tour the United Nations.
Adams and Annas drawings will be made into greeting cards. Money from profits will be donated to help children in need overseas.

597,"George W. Bush taking the Oath of Office on January 20, 2001, after his first election.
""Congratulations, Mr. President,"" Senator John Kerry said to George W. Bush in a phone call the morning after Election Day last November. In the close election, President Bush had beaten Kerry, his Democratic opponent.
On January 20, 2005, President Bush will be sworn in to office for a second time. That is
, which marks the beginning of a president's
. A term is the four-year period the president serves in office.
, or ceremony, begins at noon in the country's capital, Washington, D.C. Thousands of people will gather to hear President Bush take the
on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Millions of people will also watch the ceremony on television and on the Internet.
The oath is the promise the president makes to lead the country and uphold its laws. Bush will
, or publicly say, the oath that is written in the U.S. Constitution. (See ""
""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""
After the oath, President Bush will give an
. In that speech, he will speak to all Americans about his plans for the country's future.
After the speech, huge crowds will line the streets as the president makes his way along Pennsylvania Avenue in a parade from the U.S. Capitol to the White House. That night, the president and his wife, Laura Bush, will attend festive parties called
The oath is the only Inauguration Day event required by law. Every president since George Washington has taken the oath. On April 30, 1789, Washington was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City, which was then the country's capital.
In 1801, Thomas Jefferson was the first president to be inaugurated in Washington, D.C. In 1809, the first organized inaugural ball was held in Washington, D.C., for James Madison. In 1817, James Monroe's inauguration was the first to be held entirely outdoors. Over the years, inauguration traditions have evolved from simple events to elaborate ceremonies.
Since George Washington's time, presidents have used inaugural addresses to unite the country and inspire people. Abraham Lincoln gave his second inaugural speech in 1865, not long before the Civil War ended. He used his speech to draw the country together.
Other presidents' inaugural words are still quoted today. When Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural speech in 1933, the United States was at the height of the Great Depression. That was a time when many people were out of work. He brought promise with his words ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.""
When John F. Kennedy took office in 1961, he encouraged people to help their country. His speech challenged Americans: ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.""
What message will President Bush convey? He will likely continue the message expressed in his victory speech. ""A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation,"" he said. ""We have one country, one Constitution, and one future that binds us. And when we come together and work together, there is no limit to the greatness of America.""
George Washington's second inaugural speech, in 1793, was the shortest on record. At only 135 words, it lasted just eight minutes.
In 1841, William Henry Harrison gave the longest inaugural address. At 8,445 words, it lasted almost two hours!
In 1925, Calvin Coolidge's inaugural speech was the first broadcast on the radio.
Harry S. Truman's speech in 1949 was the first to be shown on television.
After Jimmy Carter was sworn in as president in 1977, he became the first president to walk the parade route instead of riding in a car.
In 1997, Bill Clinton's inauguration was the first to be transmitted over the Internet.
If you were president, what would you say in your inaugural speech?

Ghana recently passed the Persons with Disability (PWD) Bill. The law helps provide disabled people with jobs, transportation, and medical care.
In Ghana, as in many poor countries around the world, people with disabilities are often forced to beg for food. But, even as a little boy, Yeboah refused to accept that fate. Instead, he dreamed of riding a bicycle across his country.
Four years ago, Yeboah rode a bicycle across Ghana. He traveled nearly 400 milesmore than the distance across Kansas! Since then, Yeboah has had an operation and has been fitted with an artificial leg. He has competed in sporting events around the world.
Today, Yeboah is a celebrity in Ghana. He runs a fund that helps disabled children in Ghana go to school. He also has built or bought more than 800 wheelchairs for other disabled people in his country.
""I want children to learn my story and do more than Ive done,"" Yeboah told
""I want kids to say, Emmanuel inspired me to do this!""

420,"An expedition to the Arctic has uncovered a giant sea reptile.
An expedition to the Arctic has uncovered a giant sea reptile.
Scientists have discovered the skeleton of a sea monster near the North Pole. Researchers from Oslo, Norway, recently announced that they have found a complete
skeleton. A plesiosaur is a prehistoric marine reptile about the size of a bus. The recent discovery is believed to be the first complete plesiosaur skeleton ever found.
during an expedition to the Svalbard islands, 300 miles off the coast of Norway, in August. Fossils are the remains of plants or animals from millions of years ago preserved in rock.
The meat-eating reptile lived more than 150 million years ago, during the Jurassic Period. Some scientists call it the
of the sea. ""We think it is [a 26-foot] skeleton from snout to tail,"" team leader Jorn Hurum told
He described the plesiosaurs long teeth as being ""the size of bananas.""
The expedition also uncovered fossils from 27 other marine reptiles on the islands. ""We hope to find lots more in the years to come,"" says Hurum. ""We have just scratched the surface.""

257,"""A penny for your thoughts"" is something many people say to one another. Soon, however, the old saying may have to be changed to ""a nickel for your thoughts.""
Saying that a penny has ""virtually no value,"" Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona wants stores to stop using the penny. He has introduced a bill in Congress that would require stores to round prices to the nearest nickel.
Kolbe says that most people don't usually use their pennies. He says people just toss the coins aside.
Critics, however, disagree with Kolbe. They argue that if Kolbe's bill becomes law, people will pay more for many of the things they buy. The critics claim stores will round most of their prices up, not down.
The penny is the oldest currency authorized by the U.S. government. The government first minted the 1 cent coin in 1787. Since then, the U.S. Treasury Department has made more than 300 billion pennies.

284,"Smack Down! Is Pro Wrestling Bad for Kids?
""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

507,"Animal experts are worried that cheetahs are in danger of disappearing from parts of Africa.
A mother cheetah rests with her cubs in the tall grass. Their spotted fur helps them stay hidden. The mother cheetah does not know it, but animal experts are tracking her every move.
Most wild cheetahs live in Africa. Animal experts are worried that cheetahs are in danger of disappearing from parts of Africa. One wildlife group in South Africa is trying to protect these big cats.
The group is working to find out how many cheetahs are left in South Africa and where they roam. To track the animals, they use radio collars, cameras, and aircraft. Experts will use what they learn to find ways to save cheetahs.
The biggest threat to cheetahs comes from people. They have built farms on land where the animals live. As farming areas spread, cheetahs often have trouble finding food. In addition, farmers who want to protect their animals sometimes kill cheetahs.
The good news is that there still is hope for cheetahs. The group is helping to move cheetahs away from the farms to other areas in the wild.
""Cheetahs are very, very special,"" said the group's director. ""It would be a great shame if a time came when our children and our children's children were not able to see the cheetah.""
Cheetahs can run 65 miles per hour. That is about as fast as a car driving on a highway!
In one second, cheetahs can run about 92 feet.
Cheetahs can run fast for only a short distance about a quarter of a mile.

65,"Imagine staring into the face of a 3,300-year-old king. That is what scientists in Egypt recently did. Egypt is a country in Africa. Scientists displayed the
of King Tutankhamen (too-tahn-KAH-mun) for the first time in history. A mummy is a body that has been prepared to last for a long time.
King Tut became the ruler of Egypt when he was 9 years old. He ruled for 10 years. Tut died at age 19. His
, or burial place, was discovered in 1922.

145,"Do you ever have trouble deciding what to wear to school? Students at Lakeside Elementary School in Ohio don't have that problem. This year, the school has a dress code. Students must wear shirts with a collar and tan, navy, or black pants. Girls can also wear jumpers or skirts.
The students at Lakeside are not alone. Many students in public schools across the country are wearing uniforms for the first time.
Some people think dress codes are a good idea. A lot of parents say they don't have to worry about buying designer clothing for their kids. They say that buying school uniforms is less expensive.
School officials say dress codes also help students concentrate more on learning. ""[Clothes] should not be the focus,"" said one principal in Connecticut. ""Math and writing should be the focus.""
These students wear a uniform to school.
These students can wear their own clothes to school.

spoke to some third graders at Lakeside Elementary School. We asked them: Do you like having a school uniform?
""I like the uniforms. No one judges you, because you are wearing the same thing they are.""
""I don't like wearing the uniform, because I'm not used to it.""
Should public schools have dress codes? Why?

633,"Many kids say good-bye to a favorite part of the school day.
Imagine if recess were no longer part of your school day. If you are like most kids, you are probably thinking, ""No recess? No way!"" However, some students have no choice. For them, recess is over.
Clark County School District in Nevada recently put an end to recess. It is one of many school districts across the country to get rid of recess time. Why? School officials say they want students to have more time to learn. They also hope that more time in class will help students perform better on tests.
Should schools stop having recess? Why or why not?
Many teachers, parents, and students do not agree with the decision to
, or take away, recess. ""Recess is important so kids get a break from sitting at their desks,"" said one principal from Virginia. ""They get up and move. They can visit with their friends and have social time.""
Many experts say that having recess is worth the lost class time. Recess gives kids the chance to exercise. At recess, many students also learn how to play and work together with other students. Some studies even show a recess break can help improve test scores.
""If we had a longer school day, we would love to have recess,"" said one school official. ""But we have more math to teach and more reading to do, and something had to go.""
Exercise helps kids stay healthy. No recess break? Don't worry! You can get fit on your own time. Kids should exercise for an hour each day, say experts. Here are some ideas to get you moving:

Snakes, insects, and other critters are invading Austin Dulany's classroom. Austin, 8, is one of Peggy Garner's thirdgrade students at St. Mary's School in Bryantown, Maryland. Each spring, Garner
or changes, her classroom into the Amazon
A rain forest is a thick forest in a warm region with heavy rainfall. The Amazon is located in South America. It is the largest tropical rain forest in the world.
Garner decorates her classroom with leafy plants and hanging vines. Her students learn about the foods and spices found in the Amazon. Students make life-size
or models, of toucans, snakes, and other animals that live there.
""The Amazon is where a lot of animals live,"" Austin told
In fact, the Amazon is home to more
or types, of plants and animals than any other place in the world.
Garner's lesson has a serious side too. Since 1970, an area of the Amazon nearly as big as Texas has been destroyed. Loggers have cut down trees to make room for homes, roads, and farms. That has put many plant and animal species at risk.
To help protect the Amazon, Garner's students are raising money to adopt land in the rain forest. Brazil's government is also working to save the region. Recently, a section of the Amazon as big as Illinois was placed under government protection.
Kelsey Phipps, 8, hopes more people work together to protect the Amazon. ""Many kinds of plants and animals will be lost forever if people continue to destroy the rain forest,"" she says.
The Amazon rain forest is home to a variety of animals. Here are a few of them.
is one of the world's largest snakes, at more than 15 feet long.
have long limbs, hairless faces, and black hands.
Jaguars are wild cats covered with yellowish brown and black spots.

626,"U.S. cities jump on the bicycle path.
A bicycle boom is headed to a city near you! More Americans than ever are hitting the road on two-wheelers.
About 1.7 million U.S. residents use bicycles as their
or main, way to get around. The number of riders has nearly doubled since 2000. That is according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The spike in bikes may be thanks to the work of U.S. cities. From San Francisco to Boston, cities are becoming more bicycle-friendly. Some towns are adding more bike lanes. That makes
easier for cyclists. To commute is to travel regularly from one place to another, such as school or work.
Officials are adding more bike lanes in Washington, D.C.
the length of traffic lights. To alter is to change. That helps riders stay safe. Longer lights give them more time to cross busy streets. The nations capital also has a bike-sharing program. Riders can borrow bicycles at one location. Then they can return them in another part of town.
U.S. officials hope the new projects mean people will use their bicycles more and their cars less. Fewer cars on the road can help cut pollution. Thats because driving cars gives off harmful gases.
Riding bicycles helps more than just the environment, though. Cycling is a great way for people to stay active and fit, explains Meghan Cahill. She is a spokesperson for the League of American Bicyclists.
Cities will continue to increase their bike-friendliness, she told
Officials realize that bicycle-friendly cities [have] healthier and happier citizens.
Take a spin around the map to learn about some U.S. cycling programs.
Note: Alaska and Hawaii are not shown.
A program in Portland donates bicycles to people who cannot afford to buy their own.
More than 30 schools in Boulder encourage students to walk or cycle to school along safe paths.
Houston has set up 345 miles of bike paths so that people can cycle to school and work.
Lawmakers are working to add more bicycle lanes in New York City and the rest of the state.
What are some other ways people commute to school or work?

638,"Scientists are testing Columbus's bones to settle a dispute over where he is buried.
Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492. He made four trips to the part of the world that later became known as North America.
When Columbus died in 1506, his remains were placed in a box. The box was first buried in Spain. It was later moved to the Dominican Republic. That is an island in the Caribbean Sea. It is where Columbus wanted to be buried.
The Dominican Republic was once under Spanish rule. When Spain lost control of the island, officials moved the box again. Spain claims to have the explorer's remains. But so does the Dominican Republic. People have been arguing about it for 100 years!
Scientists recently opened the box in Spain where Columbus is thought to be buried. They are now doing tests on the bones found there. The scientists hope to finally settle the argument.

270,"The world's tallest living man recently saved the lives of two sick dolphins. The dolphins swallowed plastic from their pool at an aquarium in China.
Veterinarians, or animal doctors, couldn't figure out how to remove the plastic. Surgery would have hurt the dolphins too much. The doctors had the idea to ask for help from Bao Xishun from Mongolia. Bao is 7 feet 9 inches tall. His arms are about 3? feet long!
Bao used his long arms to reach into the animals' mouths and remove the plastic from their stomachs. ""The two dolphins are in very good condition now,"" aquarium manager Chen Lujun told reporters.

602,"A new study says chimps want to help.
Everyone knows helping others is a good thing - maybe even chimps! Scientists recently studied from Uganda. That is a country in Africa. The scientists did tests that show that chimps often help people or other chimps, even if they get nothing in return.
In one test, a person dropped a stick near a group of chimps. In most cases, a chimp handed the stick back to the person. Chimps care about other chimps too. In another test, a chimp handed over the stick when another chimp dropped it. The animals did not receive food or praise for their actions in either test.
The results surprised the scientists. They had long thought that humans are the only animals that help others. ""We've never seen this level ... of
in any other animals except humans,"" says chimp scientist Alicia Melis. Cooperation means working together. Scientists say the study suggests that chimps and humans may be born with the ability to be helpful.
So the saying ""Kindness is its own reward"" may not be true just for humans.
Chimpanzees are a type of great ape. Great apes are the largest primates. Primates are a group of animals. Other great apes are gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos.
The gorilla is the largest primate. A male gorilla can weigh as much as 500 pounds and stand up to 6 feet tall. Gorillas live in Africa.
uses tools more than any other animal does - except humans. A chimp might use a stone to crack a nut. Chimps live in Africa.
The orangutan has very long arms. That's because it lives mostly in trees. Orangutans live in Indonesia, a country in Asia.
is the smallest great ape. They can weigh up to 100 pounds. Bonobos are sometimes called ""little chimps."" Bonobos live in Africa.
What does the expression ""Kindness is its own reward"" mean?

207,"The first day of school, in early October, was a fresh start for millions of kids in Iraq. This year, the old rules and lessons have changed. School is no longer a place where every lesson centers around Saddam Hussein. He ruled Iraq from 1979 until May 2003.
When Saddam ruled Iraq, teachers were forced to mention him in every class, from history to music. In gym class, students had to chant, ""We all love Saddam!"" while they exercised.
""Children's minds have shrunk here. They have no imagination. They [were] taught only to memorize,"" said one teacher.
Now students will have the chance to learn new ideas about the world. They will use new textbooks that do not include pictures of the former president of Iraq.
Although students are eager to learn, not all schools are ready to teach. Many schools still need supplies and books.
Americans are helping out. They have donated pencils, crayons, and other school supplies. U.S. soldiers are repainting and rebuilding schools.
What do you value most about your school? Why?

139,"If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
Fish may be a rare sight by 2048. That is what a team of scientists predicted after making a four-year study. They say ocean life is being wiped out by pollution and too much fishing.
The loss of ocean life will mean less food. It will also affect the balance of the oceans ecosystem, say the scientists. An ecosystem is a group of plants and animals and the environment working as a unit to live.
The studys lead author, Boris Worm, says that its not too late to reverse the problem. He told reporters, ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we dont change things.""

212,"Its the 200th anniversary of Lincolns birth.
For elementary school students in Idaho, it made cents to collect more than 300,000 pennies. Why? Abraham Lincoln appears on the coin, and the kids needed the money for a big birthday celebration in the 16th U.S. presidents honor.
Kids collect pennies and take part in class projects to remember Lincoln.
Lincoln was born 200 years ago, on Feb. 12, 1809. This month marks the
of his birth. A bicentennial is a 200th anniversary.
The students in Idaho raised money to help
, or move, a statue of Lincoln to a park near the Idaho Capitol. The project is one of hundreds of events across the country being held to celebrate Lincolns birthday.
In Washington, D.C., officials will honor Lincoln with a ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial. That is a special statue of the president. In other states, people will attend speeches and plays about the leader.
There are events being planned in all 50 states, David Early told
. He is a spokesperson for the group that has been planning the celebrations. [Lincoln] believed everyone should be treated the same.
Lincoln served as president during the Civil War (18611865). During that war, Southern states tried to break away from the country. They fought for their right to own slaves. Northern states were against owning slaves. Lincoln was also against slavery. In 1863, he signed the Emancipation Proclamation. It helped free most U.S. slaves.
Thats why third grader Morgan Squires, of Gooding, Idaho, was happy to collect pennies for the president.
[Lincoln] was a great leader, Morgan told
State Capitol, White House: Northwind; Cabin: Corbis
Abraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin in Kentucky. He moved to Illinois when he was a young man. There, he worked as a shop owner and a lawyer. Lincoln also served as a lawmaker for Illinois and the country.
In 1842, Lincoln married Mary Todd. Together they had four sons.
Lincoln became the 16th U.S. president in 1861. The Civil War started a few weeks later. Lincoln won reelection in 1864.
The war was coming to an end in April 1865. Lincoln was shot on April 14, while watching a play in Washington, D.C. He died the next day. Lincoln is buried in Springfield, Ill.

735,"Coins were available for buying and selling at the World's Fair of Money.
The sound of money was heard loud and clear this August at the World's Fair of Money. It was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
One billion dollars' worth of coins were at the fair. The money was available for buying and selling. Some coins cost less than a dollar. Other coins were worth millions.
Eight-year-old Sam Zurenski and his grandfather were among the visitors. Sam's grandfather collected coins when he was a boy. Now he is helping Sam build his own collection.

460,"Scientists recently made an unusual discovery. They found a new
, or type, of frog. At first glance, the frog looks like a bright purple blob! However, if you look closer, you will see its tiny head and pointy snout.
(am-FIB-ee-ahn) was found in India, a country in Asia. An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and the rest of its life on land.

239,"You were fine a moment ago. Now you're tired and achy. The school nurse takes your temperature. You have a fever. Bad news-those are all symptoms of the flu, or
Hang in there; you are not alone. This flu season started early, and the virus spread quickly. The good news is that flu season appears to have slowed down.
Some health experts say this flu season was most harmful to kids. Doctors' offices and hospitals have been flooded with sick kids.
Schools in several states have closed for ""sick days"" because so many kids had the flu. To keep the virus from spreading, many teachers have asked students to wash their hands often. School officials want to make sure healthy students don't get sick.
Along with washing your hands, what else can you do to stay healthy?
The best way to stay flu-free is to get a flu
(vak-SEEN), or shot, say experts. ""If you get the flu, don't panic. Most kids will recover just fine,"" Dr. Carol Baker of Houston, Texas, told

744,"Write a letter to the next president!
What advice would you give to the next president of the United States? Hundreds of kids had a lot of ideas. They wrote letters of advice to George W. Bush and John Kerry.
The letter program is taking place at a library in Massachusetts. Kids who can't go to that library can write letters online.
The kids had many things to say. ""Please make world peace and stop world hunger,"" wrote Luke, 9, from Florida. Eight-year-old Megan from Georgia wrote, ""I hope you try your hardest to help our country.""

672,"Last September, scientists announced that an African monkey is now
or is no longer living. Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey is the first monkey to become extinct in nearly 300 years.
Scientists say the monkey is gone because of hunting and because people have destroyed much of the monkey's
or natural home. The monkey lived in the rain forests of Ghana and Ivory Coast, two countries in the western part of Africa.
Scientists warn that 25 other kinds of

150,"Green sea slugs (below) dont just look like leaves. They act like them too! Experts recently found that the slugs are able to carry out
(foh-toh-SIN-thuh-sehss). That is the process plants use to turn sunlight into energy. The slugs are the only animals scientists know of that are able to carry out that process.

Algae are plantlike creatures that carry out photosynthesis. Eating algae gives the slugs special materials that allow them to get energy from the sun instead of from food.

56,"NASA slams spacecraft into the moon to look for water.
This drawing shows a spacecraft speeding toward the moon.
Were going to crash! Those arent words NASA scientists usually like to hear. This fall, however, the U.S. space agency crashed spacecraft into the moonon purpose!
On October 9, two spacecraft smashed into Earths neighbor. They created a dent that is 100 feet wide. The big booms were part of a mission to find out whether there is water on the moon.
have found signs of small amounts of water in the moons soil. A satellite is an object that circles something else, such as a planet. Scientists think the moons south pole might have the most water. That part of the moon is almost always cold and in shadow, so the water may be ice.
The two spacecraft aimed for the moons south pole. When they crashed, they kicked up soil. Scientists are studying
, or information, from that soil. It will help them
, or figure out, whether their water guess is right.
Finding water on the moon would make a big splash. Scientists once thought the moon was dry. Having water up there would help astronauts. NASA hopes to set up stations on the moon where astronauts can live. If water were available, they would not have to bring as much of it from Earth.
Water on the moon could also be turned into fuel. That might help NASA power spacecraft headed to explore Mars and other planets.
Scientists are excited about the possibilities. The [spacecraft] returned ... data that will greatly improve our understanding, says Anthony Colaprete. He is a NASA scientist. The team is excited to dive into the data.
Temperatures on the moon can get as low as -400 degrees Fahrenheit. Thats not the moons only cool fact. Read on for more.
Only 12 peopleall Americanshave walked on the moon. The first was Neil Armstrong, in 1969.
Want to wish upon a star? Go to the moon. Stars are always shining, and the sky looks black even during the day.
, or bowl-shaped dents in the ground. The biggest crater on the moon is more than 1,300 miles wide!
Why might scientists want to learn more about outer space?

581,"Orangutans have babies only once every eight years.
Orangutans (aw-RANG-oo-tanz) eat and sleep high in the treetops of rain forests. However, these great apes are not safe.
When she was 8 years old, Misha liked to jump up and down on her nest. She played with her food. Sometimes she needed her mothers help to cross from one tree to another.
Misha is one of thousands of orangutans that live in Asia. They are found on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra.
Scientists are worried about the survival of these red-haired apes. They are in danger of becoming
, or dying out. Scientists say orangutans could be extinct in the wild within ten years.
Why are orangutans in such danger? Their
is being destroyed. A habitat is the area where an animal makes its home.
People are the main threat to these apes. Some people cut down trees in the areas where orangutans live. The trees are sold as lumber. In addition, people steal baby orangutans from the forest and sell them as pets.
Do you think it is important to save orangutans? Why?
""Help is needed to save these amazing creatures,"" scientist Cheryl Knott told

553,"The King memorial takes shape on the National Mall.
A piece of the nation's capital will honor an important leaderDr. Martin Luther King Jr. A memorial for King is being built on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. It will be the first memorial on the Mall to honor an African American.
A ceremony was held on November 13 to mark the start of construction. President George W. Bush and other leaders were among the thousands of people who gathered for the event.
""When the work is done, the King memorial will be a fitting tributepowerful and hopeful and poeticlike the man it honors,"" Bush said at the ceremony.
If all goes as planned, the memorial will be finished in 2008. It will have trees, flowing water, and a 30-foot statue of King. Quotes from King's speeches will be carved into a stone wall.
King (19291968) grew up in the U.S. South. At that time, the South was
or separated by race. Under the law, black people were not allowed to attend the same schools as white people. They were forced to sit in the backseats of buses. They also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains.
King worked to change the laws by giving speeches and leading peaceful marches. Thanks to King and other leaders,
were passed. Those laws make sure that all Americans are treated equally.
On August 28, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech in Washington, D.C. A crowd of more than 200,000 people came to hear him. In his speech, King said, ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.""

663,"School buses are still the safest way for kids to ride to school.
As the wheels on the bus go round and round, many kids are being bounced around. A new study shows that about 17,000 accidents occur on school buses each year. Injuries range from cuts to broken bones.
Researchers report that crashes aren't causing all of those injuries. Kids are sometimes thrown around when buses stop and turn. Some people say those injuries could be prevented if school buses had seat belts.
Traffic safety experts say seat belts would not
or lower, injuries. Not all injuries occur when kids are in their seats. Nearly one-quarter of injuries occur when kids are getting on and off the buses.
School buses are still the safest way for kids to ride to school, says the National School Transportation Association. The number of kids injured is only a small fraction of the nearly 24 million kids who travel on school buses each year.

128,"The life cycle of a frog is amazing. Read below to learn more. (Note: Although many frogs have this life cycle, others do not. Some frogs don't even have tadpoles; instead their eggs hatch directly into frogs!)
A frog begins life as a tiny egg, usually in or near water.
After about 10 days, a tadpole hatches from the egg. It breathes using gills and moves like a fish.
After about five weeks, the tadpole's gills disappear, and it grows lungs.
At about 12 weeks, the young frog grows legs, and its tail disappears. It leaves the water and can live on land.
In about one year, the frog is a full-grown adult. Soon, the cycle will begin again.

778,"So long, mystery meat! School lunches are about to get a lot more
U.S. President Barack Obama recently signed a new law. It requires schools to provide more nutritious food. The law is called the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Its purpose is to help kids be healthier.
This act is about doing whats right for our children, Obama said before signing the law.
So, what will the new law serve up? School officials have to remove sugary drinks and junk food from vending machines. They have to make meals healthier, as well. For example, instead of hot dogs, cafeterias might dish out whole-wheat spaghetti with meat sauce. There will also be more fruits and vegetables on the menu.

423,"On January 8, rescue workers tried to help save pilot whales in trouble. Pilot whales are actually members of the dolphin family. The whales were stranded on a beach off the coast of New Zealand. New Zealand is an island in the Pacific Ocean.
It is not uncommon for a large pod, or group, of pilot whales to get stranded. They are highly social animals that stay close together. ""The value of sticking close together at times brings the risk of beaching. When one whale beaches, the other whales may follow,"" said scientist Michael Moore.
Sadly, 120 whales died on the beach. But volunteers were able to rescue 39 of the whales. The rescuers poured cool water on the whales to protect them from the heat. They helped push the huge mammals back into the water. Then small boats led the pilot whales back to sea.

787,"The planet Mercury recently had a special visitor. It was a robot named
. The flying robot was the first spacecraft to travel near the planet in more than 30 years.
flew within 125 miles of Mercury's surface. The spacecraft took more than 1,200 photographs of the planet. Before, scientists had pictures of less than half of Mercury's surface.
will pass the planet in October 2008 and again in September 2009. Then the robot will spend a year
the planet. To orbit is to travel in a path around an object.
Scientists hope studying Mercury will show how the planets formed. ""We really need better information on Mercury to make sure that our ideas on how the Earth and sister planets formed [are correct],"" says researcher Sean Solomon.

788,"Trained rats may soon be used to find survivors who are trapped after disasters.
Meet the soon-to-be members of rescue teams--rats! Scientists are training the rodents to help find people who are buried in buildings after earthquakes and other disasters.
Rats have a strong sense of smell, which can help them sniff out people. The rodents are also tiny enough to crawl just about anywhere. They can get into places that are too small for people and other animals, such as dogs.
Scientists trained the rats to search for the scent of people. They attached tiny electronic devices to the brain of each rat. Signals from the rat's brain are sent to a radio that is strapped to the animal's back. Rescue teams will be able to track the signals and follow the rat's path. That will help them figure out where to start digging. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next six months.

632,"Change is on the way for some school vending machines. Candy bars, sugary drinks, and other sweet snacks are no longer being offered in many schools.
Those foods and drinks are being replaced with more healthful choices. Some of those choices include bottled water, salads, granola bars, and dried fruits and nuts.
School vending machines offering soda and candy may soon be a thing of the past.
New York City has the largest school system in the country. That school system recently decided to
, or not allow, junk food in its vending machines. Schools in Texas, California, and many other states are doing the same.
Do you think schools should ban junk food from vending machines? Why or why not?
Why are vending machines getting a makeover? Poor nutrition habits and a lack of exercise have caused many kids to become overweight. School officials hope the changes to vending machines will help students make better nutrition choices.

328,"The world's largest volcano appears to be coming back to life. Scientists are keeping a close watch on it. If the volcano erupts, it could destroy nearby towns.
A giant volcano on the island of Hawaii is beginning to show signs of life, scientists say. The volcano is called
Mauna Loa is Hawaiian for ""Long Mountain."" It is the largest volcano on Earth. The volcano makes up half of the island of Hawaii. Hawaii is one of the islands that make up the state of Hawaii.
Recently, scientists have noticed changes in Mauna Loa. The top of the volcano is growing slightly. Magma is rising into the giant volcano.
is hot, liquid rock beneath Earth's surface.
The last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984. A river of
flowed from the volcano for three weeks. Lava is magma flowing out of a volcano. The lava can reach temperatures of nearly 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit. Lava can burn everything in its path.
Since 1984, many more people have moved to areas around Mauna Loa. They have built homes on the volcano's slopes. If the volcano erupts now, hot lava could destroy those homes.
For now, people should not worry too much about an eruption, experts say. ""We're at a stage where it's months to years, rather than days to weeks"" before the next eruption, said scientist Peter Cervelli. Until then, scientists will continue to keep track of changes in the volcano. They hope to give people lots of warning about future eruptions.
Mauna Loa is a shield volcano. Shield volcanoes form from lava flows. When lava cools, it hardens. The lava builds up and forms a low mountain.
Why is it important for scientists to study volcanoes?

167,"Most bats nap in caves or trees. One kind of bat naps in a strange place. It snoozes inside the leaves of a bug-eating plant! That is what scientists recently discovered.
A Hardwickes woolly bat naps in a pitcher plant leaf. Can you spot the bat?
The plants leaves are shaped like cups. They trap bugs inside. The bat is safe there. It stays hidden from
. A predator is an animal that eats another animal for food.
The bat leaves behind something that helps the plantpoop. It becomes food for the plant.

357,"Amazing Animal News: This Bird Changes Its Tune
A male zebra finch changes his song if a female zebra finch is nearby. A zebra finch is a
. A bird is a warm-blooded animal with feathers on its body.
Can the female tell when the male is singing just to her? A team of scientists recently learned that the answer is yes. They did an experiment using a recording of a male zebra finch singing. They placed female birds between two speakers.
The first speaker played the song of a male zebra finch singing alone. The second speaker played a male singing for a female. Most of the female birds moved closer to the second speaker.
The males make very small changes to their songs, says scientist Sarah C. Woolley. We were excited to learn that the females can notice those changes and that they pay attention to them.

The orange-and-black butterflies are on the move.
It's time for monarch butterflies to take a trip. Each fall, they
means ""to move from one place to another."" Many monarchs leave Canada and the United States to travel to Mexico. Others go to California, Texas, or Florida.
In the winter, monarchs stay close together on trees. That helps protect them from wind, rain, and cold. The trees look bright orange because they are covered with millions of butterflies!
In the spring, monarchs migrate north. On the way, female monarchs stop to lay eggs. A baby caterpillar hatches from each egg. Many of the new monarch butterflies finish the trip north.

The red lines on the map below show places where monarch butterflies migrate for the winter.
Milkweed is the only type of plant where female monarchs lay their eggs. ""If the milkweed disappears, so do the monarchs!"" says teacher Edie McDonnel.

488,"Ann Bancroft and Liv Arnesen are trying to become the first women to ski across Antarctica. They plan to ski 4,200 miles in 100 days. That is the longest distance ever skied by women.
The women began their journey in November. That is spring in Antarctica. But the average temperature is 39 degrees below zero! Freezing winds blow at 100 miles per hour.
The wind is helping Arnesen and Bancroft. They attach themselves and the sleds that carry their supplies to sails, so the wind helps them ski faster. They hope to finish their trip later this month.

507,"Summer is almost here! Why do experts say that summer is the most dangerous time of the year for kids? During the summer, most schools are closed. Kids have more time to play outside, ride bikes, and swim. That means kids have more chances to get hurt.
Playing outside gives you a chance to breathe fresh air, but it also exposes you to harmful sun rays. Harmful sun rays can cause sunburns. You can get a sunburn even if you are outside for a short amount of time. So when you are in the sun, always wear sunscreen. Use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher, and be sure to rub it evenly into your skin. You should also wear a hat and try to play in the shade.
Whether you ride a bike, ride a scooter, or use in-line skates, be wheel safe. The most serious way kids get hurt while on wheels is by hitting their heads. So always wear a helmet when you are playing on wheels. When you ride scooters and use in-line skates, always wear wrist guards, kneepads, and elbow pads.
What's the Right Way to Wear a Helmet?
A helmet should be straight on the head, just above the eyebrows.
The chin strap should be snug but not too tight.
The rear straps go behind the ears; the front straps should run up and down.
One way to beat the summer heat is by swimming in a cool pool. To stay safe when you swim, you need to follow water-safety rules. Be water safe by swimming only when a grown-up is nearby. You should always swim with a buddy.

595,"How do stinkbugs and burrower bugs send messages? They use plants like telephone lines! That is what a new study shows. The insects drum on leaves and stems. They also shake their bodies. That makes the plants vibrate. Other insects hear the vibrations.
To do the study, scientists watched 21 species of stinkbugs and burrower bugs. The scientists measured the tiny vibrations using a laser. They learned that different species have their own vibration patterns. Males and females of the same species have different patterns too.

160,"What can you do with some paper, markers, and kind words? Show a veteran that you care. That is how some students will honor our veterans. They will make thank-you cards.
Veterans have made great sacrifices to serve our country. They deserve our respect and gratitude, says Laurie Tranter. She is a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Receiving a thank-you card can put a smile on a veterans face. It lets that person know he or she is appreciated.

608,"Put on your party hats! February 12 is the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincolns birth. He was the 16th president of our country.
A big birthday event takes place on February 12 at the Lincoln Memorial. A
is something that keeps a memory alive. The Lincoln Memorial is a building in Washington, D.C., that honors Lincoln. There, Americans will gather to hear speeches about Lincoln.
Events honoring Lincolns birthday actually began a year ago. A giant birthday party was held at the Lincoln Museum in Kentucky. That is the state where Lincoln was born.

Since then, many other events have taken place across the United States. They have included poetry readings, plays, dances, and tours of places where Lincoln lived. Events will continue until February 2010.
Why is the country having such a big celebration? It isnt just because Lincoln was a great president, says David Early. Early is a spokesperson for the group that has been planning the celebration. Lincolns story could be anybodys story, he explains. He grew up poor on a farm and rose to become president of the United States.
When Lincoln was president, some people owned slaves. He worked to help end slavery. One of the things that makes Lincoln great is that he believed everyone should be treated the same, says Early.

510,"Goats are helping to prevent forest fires.
Goats are doing their part to help prevent forest fires. Goats eat tall grass, weeds, and small branches. Those plants often spread forest fires in places such as California and Florida.
Many states are using goats to eat plants on mountains and in fields close to people's houses. By eating plants in those areas, the goats leave a clear patch of land. That way, if a fire starts in the forest, it will not be able to spread to where people live.
In 1999, there were about 94,000 forest fires in the United States.
Forest fires in 1999 burned nearly 9,500 square miles of land in the United States.
Most forest fires are started by people. People are sometimes careless with cigarettes and campfires.
Lightning is another cause of forest fires. When the forest is very dry and lightning strikes it, a fire can start.

459,"Inventing is not just for adults. Kids from across the country recently showed off their great ideas. They took part in a contest to create a new use for Bubble Wrap. Bubble Wrap is a packing material that has air-filled plastic bubbles. It is used to protect objects that are breakable.
Andy Boler, age 10, from Texas, used Bubble Wrap to make a cover for plants. It protects plants from the cold. I like building things that could help people, he says.
Other inventions in the contest included a kite-making kit and a wrist cushion. Some of the kids inventions may be turned into real products.
We have very few rules, says a contest spokesperson. One of the main goals is to get young students thinking.

589,"Every February, we celebrate Presidents' Day. We honor presidents by putting their pictures on money. Whose picture is on the new dollar coin?
New dollar coins showing George Washington will soon be at a bank near you. This month, the
(the place where money is made) began making one-dollar coins that show the faces of our presidents in the order they served in office. The George Washington dollar coin will be first, followed by coins showing John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. Would you rather carry a dollar bill or a dollar coin?
or arguing, about whether the penny should still be made. A penny is worth 1 cent. The U.S. Mint says it costs more to make the penny than the coin is worth. Some people want to keep the penny. They say the coin is a part of American history.

541,"Many schools are growing their own food. Chatham Elementary School in Illinois is one of those schools. In September, students planted seeds in a garden. They are growing spinach, lettuce, radishes, and herbs.
A group of volunteers created the schools garden project. The group was started by Dr. Kemia Sarraf. She wants to teach kids healthy habits.
Gardens are wonderful, says Kim Sepich, the schools principal. When kids plant and grow their own food, they are more likely to try it. We want kids to eat their veggies!

423,"Your heart beats about 100,000 times a day.
Your heart pumps more than 75 gallons of blood an hour.
Many people think the heart is on the left side of the chest. Your heart is actually in the middle of your chest, between your lungs.

408,"April 22 is Earth Day. That day reminds everyone to take care of Earth, our home. Many of Earth's animals are in danger of losing their homes. The pika (PEE-kah) is an animal whose habitat is in danger. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal or a plant lives.
Earth's temperature is rising, and people are using land where animals live.
are related to rabbits. Some kinds of pikas live on the rocky slopes of mountains. These animals prefer cool weather. As Earth heats up, they must move to cooler places higher in the mountains.
make their nests in the holes of rain forest trees. People are cutting down those trees and using the land for farms. Macaws are running out of trees in which to make their nests.
live in the Arctic. They live on large pieces of sea ice. As Earth's temperature rises, the large pieces of sea ice begin to melt. If the ice keeps melting, polar bears will have nowhere to live.
live in the grasslands of Asia. Their habitat is shrinking because people are building towns in places that used to belong to the tigers. Now these big cats have fewer grassland areas to call home.
Tigers are among the animals losing places to live.
Scientists say Earth is getting warmer because of pollution in the air. They are working to protect animal habitats.
Take short showers to save water and energy.
Dispose of trash properly. Recycle plastic, glass, paper, and metal.
Turn off electrical appliances when you are not using them.

281,"When kids get flu shots, everyone may end up healthier. That is what a new study shows. Almost 50 farming
in Canada took part in the study. A community is a group of people living in an area.
Kids in half the communities were given flu shots. Kids in the other half were not given flu shots. No adults were given flu shots.
What did scientists learn? Fewer adults and kids in the flu shot group got the flu. The scientists say that giving flu shots to kids can protect the whole community.

338,"Animals that are too old to perform in zoos or circuses now have special places to live. They can live in retirement homes. Both Nevada and California have special places for retired animals. The animals have plenty of room to run and play. The animals have pools to swim in and trees to climb. Volunteers take care of the animals.

270,"Many people are afraid of sharks. They think sharks are monsters. But one scientist thinks people should not be scared of sharks.
Sharks do not like the taste of people. That's what Dr. Peter Klimley says. Klimley is a scientist who studies sharks. He says sharks would rather eat seals and sea lions than people. Seals and sea lions have a thick layer of fat on them. Eating that fat gives sharks energy. Klimley says people's bodies do not have enough fat to fill up a shark.
Klimley thinks that sharks should be afraid of people. Each year, people kill about 65 million sharks. Some people like to eat shark meat. And some sharks die because they live in water that is polluted.
Klimley says that at least seven kinds of sharks are endangered. The number of those sharks has dropped in the past ten years. Klimley hopes that people will help protect sharks.
There are at least 340 kinds of sharks.
A shark's liver is filled with oil. This oil is lighter than water and keeps the shark from sinking.
Sharks have several rows of teeth. Sharks often lose their teeth while eating. New teeth quickly grow to replace the teeth that are lost.
A shark can swim 3 feet per second.
talked to Dr. Peter Klimley about his work. Here's what he had to say.
Why did you decide to study sharks?
I wanted to study how sharks behave. I wanted to get into their world and learn everything about them.
Why is it important to study sharks?
To me, sharks are a mystery that I wanted to learn more about.
No. Many kinds of sharks are not dangerous. I think sharks bite people by mistake.
Which kind of shark is your favorite?
The hammerhead shark. I have studied the hammerhead for most of my life. I am often called ""Dr. Hammerhead""!

96,"Do you wear headgear when you play soccer? Some parents think you should. That is because many kids use their heads to hit soccer balls. This is called ""heading.""
Some doctors say that heading can hurt your brain. A group of parents has made special helmets and headbands to protect kids' heads. A middle school in Wisconsin is having its soccer team wear the special headgear while playing soccer.
Soccer coaches give these tips for safely heading a ball:
Keep your eyes open and on the ball.
Head the ball with your forehead, which is the thickest part of your skull.
Be careful not to let the ball hit your face.

446,"Students recently planted trees in Brechtel Park. It is in New Orleans, Louisiana. The park lost thousands of trees in 2005. A big hurricane hit the area then. Its name was Hurricane Katrina.
The students worked hard. They raised money to buy the trees. How? They sold T-shirts and had an art fair. The group planted about 100 trees.
The event was a great success, says Brad Philipson. He is a teacher at Metairie Park Country Day School. One day, these kids will come back and see how the trees have grown.

38,"April 22 is Earth Day. On Earth Day, millions of people will think of ways to stop pollution. They will talk about recycling and planting trees. People will look for ways to save energy and water.
People have been celebrating Earth Day since 1970. Earth Day was started by a man named Gaylord Nelson. Nelson was a United States senator from Wisconsin. He was worried about the damage being done to the planet.
To celebrate Earth Day, people get together once a year to think about ways to protect Earth. But many people think that every day should be Earth Day. They say people should always work to to stop pollution and clean up the land and water.
Here are a few ways that you can help make every day Earth Day!
Don't litter! Be a good example for other kids. If you see litter, pick it up and put it in trash cans or recycling bins.
. That means these objects are put through a special process so they can be used again.
Start a can recycling program at your school. Use the money you earn from returning the cans to buy new playground equipment or to have an Earth Day party.
Paper is made from trees. You can save a tree by not wasting paper. Use both sides.
Celebrate National Arbor Day on April 27 by planting a tree. This holiday encourages people to plant and care for trees.
, or save, water. Turn the faucet off while brushing your teeth and washing your face.
Save electricity by turning off the lights when you leave a room. Do not leave a radio or TV on if you aren't using it.

253,"The Life of Martin Luther King Jr
A memorial for Martin Luther King Jr. is being built in our nation's capital.
Martin Luther King Jr. was a leader. He lived from 1929 to 1968. Americans honor him in January with a national holiday. This year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is January 21.
King grew up in the southern part of the United States. At that time, laws treated African American people differently from white people. African Americans were forced to sit in the back of buses. They also had to use separate bathrooms and water fountains.
When King was older, he worked to change those laws. As a result, equal rights laws were passed. Those laws provide the same rights to all Americans.
King will soon be honored with a
. A memorial is a statue or a place that honors a person or an event. The King memorial is being built on the National Mall. That is a park in Washington, D.C., our nation's capital. Memorials for some U.S. presidents are also on the Mall.
The King memorial is scheduled to be finished this year. It will have a 30-foot statue of King. Sentences from some of his speeches will be carved into a stone wall.
The cost of the memorial is $100 million. Most of that money has been raised. A concert was held in September in New York City to raise the rest of the money. Many famous singers performed. The singers included Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, and Garth Brooks.

378,"Many children are in need of winter coats. Operation Warm is a group that wants to make sure those kids are cozy. The group gives away new coats to kids whose families dont have enough money to buy coats. The new coats bring smiles to kids faces, says Cydney Irving-Dasent. She is a spokesperson for the group.
Two girls receive new winter coats from Operation Warm.
Operation Warm started in 1998. The group expects to give away its millionth coat this winter! We are really excited about reaching this important milestone, says Irving-Dasent.

456,"Many different animals live in the Arctic.
Welcome to the Arctic! That is the cold, windy area around the North Pole. It includes the Arctic Ocean and the land near it. Snow and ice cover the ground for much of the year.
, or place in nature where many animals live. The walrus, polar bear, and snowy owl are a few of those animals. They have different ways to survive the cold.
A walrus spends most of its time in the icy water. This marine animal has a thick layer of
, or fat, under its skin to keep it warm.
When a walrus swims, its body works in a special way to stay warm. Blood flows away from its skin to important
inside its body. They include the heart and brain. That keeps heat from leaving the walruss body, and the animals skin turns white. When the walrus is warm again, its skin turns a pink color.
A polar bear has special fur to keep it warm. Each hair is shaped like a straw. The shape helps direct sunlight toward the bears black skin. The black skin collects and holds in heat. Polar bears also have a layer of blubber under their skin.
How does a snowy owl stay warm? It has two layers of feathers. They cover the owls entire body, including its legs and feet. The bottom layer of feathers, called
, is soft and fluffy. The outer layer of feathers is thick. In strong wind, the snowy owl may hide on the ground behind a pile of snow or rocks to block the wind.
