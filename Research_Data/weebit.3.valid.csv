2197,". This is when a character reacts to something - it's not quite the same as a soliloquy because it's a comment on what is happening around them. However, the other characters are not aware of it and it's as if the speaker is confessing. So in Act 2, Scene 1 Iago sees Cassio take Desdemona's hand and his asides tells us he has decided to 'ensare' Cassio with 'tricks', which is exactly what he does later on.
- Othello hides away to hear Cassio talk, Iago hides to watch Roderigo's attack on Cassio and even Desdemona's body is hidden until Emilia 'draws the bed-curtain' to reveal her lying there.
- it seems completely unimportant at first, it is just a handkerchief which Desdemona has dropped. But we soon realise that Iago has been trying to get hold of it for a long time, and it is a
of loyalty, so losing it means Desdemona is unfaithful. Othello even thinks it has magical properties. This shows how Shakespeare cleverly takes an ordinary object and makes it the focus of the drama.

1598,"If you are mainly painting and drawing, you'll be expected to develop your knowledge and understanding of colour, form, tone, texture and shape.
You'll need to explore the results of painting on different surfaces, the qualities of different paints, and the effects of using different painting tools. For example, acrylic paint can be used to create flat surfaces of colour but if it's watered down sufficiently, it can be used to create washes of colour.

What is each painting about? What is each artist trying to represent or say?
How does the subject matter differ between the two paintings?
How has each artist used paint to show how they feel about their subject matter?
How have time and/or place influenced each artist?
Does it look like the artist has used a brush or palette knife to apply the paint?
Does the way in which each artist has used the paint affect the mood, atmosphere or the way it looks?
Does the size of either of the paintings affect the viewer?
What (painting) devices does Justin Mortimer use to show Mick Scarletts personality. How does he show his response to and feelings about him?
How does Robert Maclaurin show that the atmosphere and mood of a place is more important to him than the accurate recording of its details?

experiment with thick and thin areas to create textures
surface. By adding turpentine to the mix, you can make the paint thinner, more
and have a more matt finish. By adding oil (such as linseed or poppy oil) you make the paint thinner, more transparent and give it a more glossy finish. Adding wax will give a soft matt finish and make the paint thicker too.
Acrylic paint can be mixed with anything water based, such as water, soap, PVA glue and other water based paint. It can be applied thin or thick. You can try mixing in an acrylic medium to make the paint more transparent. This is useful for glazing effects and more subtle colouring.
Water colour and gouache paints are both water based, so like acrylic they can be mixed with anything water based.
experiment with the surface you are painting on
. Try wood, paper, card, glass or metal. Create a collage, cut into the surface, or tear the paper and rejoin it in a different way.
Surfaces can be changed in a variety of ways, scratched, roughened, made uneven or smoothed
. Try using sandpaper to remove some of the paint from previous painting and then paint onto it some more.
Try painting onto a wet surface, and a dry surface. Try painting over old painting once it's dry. You can be surprised how good the results can be.
Make use of a palette knife to discover new textures, or draw into the paint with the wrong end of your paintbrush. Try adding things such as glue, rice or sand onto, or into, the paint to build up or create a variety of interesting textures.
Try different sizes and shapes of brushes. Decorating brushes are a cheap alternative to large artist quality brushes. Try painting without brushes, using pieces of wood or plastic as scrapers, or bits of rag to apply the paint.
When you are experimenting have an idea in mind of what you want to achieve, and then see what techniques give you the most success.

. Try drawing with wet media like watercolours, ink or watered-down acrylic paint. Try different mark-making materials from pencils to pastels, inks, pens, charcoal, sticks, matches. Try fine aquarelle pencils for subtle colour blending, or make a delicate wash by brushing over them with water.
Try using different types of eraser. Try using erasers to make marks and remove parts of the drawing. Putty rubbers are very soft and can be used to lighten shadows, to give delicate shading, by rubbing gently at areas you've already shaded. Try rubbing out an area and then drawing back into the mess that is left behind.

6205,"The elements in group 0 are called the noble gases. They belong to the right-hand column in the periodic table. The noble gases are all chemically unreactive which means they are
The noble gases have the following properties in common:
they exist as single atoms (they are monatomic)
The main uses of the noble gases
Used in balloons and airships. It is much less dense than air, so balloons filled with it float upwards.
Used in advertising signs. It glows when electricity is passed through it, and different coloured 'neon lights' can be made by coating the inside of the glass tubing with other chemicals.
Used in light bulbs. The very thin metal filament inside the bulb would react with oxygen and burn away if the bulb were filled with air instead of argon. As argon is unreactive, it stops the filament burning away.

73,"Information technology has led to many changes in how we work, where we work and even when we work. It has had a dramatic effect on our working lives.
Until the mid-90s it was not possible to shop online. The closest alternative was shopping by phone.
The same was true for banking and all the host of Government and other services which now exist online.
electronic mail - a message written or typed on a computer and sent electronically rather than by post
an application that allows users to send instant messages (text) to one another
Instead of mobile phones there was a trend for CB (Citizen's Band) radio.
Documents could not be sent as email
a file that's 'attached' to an email is called an attachment
and were faxed instead (a paper document is digitised, sent down a phone line, and then printed at the other end).
The need to travel for essential services, eg banking, was far greater for those who lived outside town.
Today, customers expect even the smallest of businesses to have a professional, informative
a web page or group of web pages hosted on one web server and viewed in a web browser
. Businesses that have failed to embrace the advancement of communications and ICT have put themselves at a disadvantage.
It is now common for adverts to include a

address in addition to, or even instead of a phone number.
The introduction of information technology has caused some unemployment, for example:
Computer-controlled warehouses need only a handful of staff to operate them.
Computer-controlled robots are now common on production lines, replacing human workers.
The old skills of workers in the printing industry are now out-of-date.
Some jobs have disappeared as they can now be done automatically, eg marking multiple choice exam papers.
However, it is fair to say that the development of information technology has led to many new jobs such as computer technicians, programmers,
includes all of the web pages accessible via the Internet
IT is more likely to have changed someone's work rather than led to them losing their job. People in certain professions have had to be retrained to make use of modern technology:
Travel agents book holidays by computer, not by phone or letter.
has meant that many bank staff now work by phone in front of a computer, instead of being in a branch, behind a counter.
De-skilling has taken place. Some jobs which needed a high level of skill in the past can now be done more easily. For example, print workers today can use
an application that allows text and images to be laid out on a page
used extensively in the automotive industry, aerospace industry, and in architectural design to draw 2D and 3D designs
rather than pencil and paper on a drawing board.
Products made with computers should be of a better quality than before. For example, car bodies are welded more accurately by robots than by humans.
Robots don't get tired so the quality of work is consistent.
Machines controlled by computer are more reliable than those controlled by humans.
Miniaturisation - many electrical items, such as mobile phones and video cameras have become much smaller due to developments in technology.
High street stores now find themselves competing with each other for business both on the high street and online.
opens the market to customers nationally and internationally
enables smaller companies to compete with larger companies
reduces in staffing and/or high street stores thereby reducing costs
provides the option to offer 24 hour shopping at minimum additional cost
- businesses once competing with the shop in the next town now find themselves competing on a global scale.
- with increased competition, local companies may have to reduce their work force.
- the move to e-commerce may not be a smooth one and will certainly require a degree of investment.
- if high street stores are closed in an effort to save money, customers who prefer to shop on the high street may not be comfortable buying online so may go elsewhere.
Now, both for companies and individuals, there is pressure to have Internet access to do everyday things such as submit orders or look up details in a catalogue. There are initiatives to make as many services available on the Internet as possible, including e-government, where government departments such as the Inland Revenue can be dealt with using secure
a web page or group of web pages hosted on one web server and viewed in a web browser
, means working from home using modern technology to keep in touch with your business. Jobs can be relocated to places where it is more attractive, more convenient or cheaper to live.
a global network connecting millions of computers
electronic mail - a message written or typed on a computer and sent electronically rather than by post
a technology used to digitise hard copies of documents, transfer them across the telephone network, and print them on receipt
Office running costs and overheads (rates, electricity, heating etc) can be reduced, which in turn may reduce the need for office space.
Travel-related problems may be reduced, ie staff being unable to get into work due to rail/road delays.
It may tempt better staff to come and work for the company.
Employers need to be able to trust their staff and be prepared to have less direct control over them.
work in a comfortable environment - their home
less human interaction - fewer opportunities to meet people, share ideas with etc.
more difficult to work as part of a team, especially if they're all office based
greater temptation to spend time on non-work-related activities
difficult to separate personal life from work
Video conferencing means using computers to provide a video-link between two or more people. Instead of just talking to someone by telephone, you are able to see them as well.
The following is needed to take part in a video conference call:
a microphone (most webcams have a microphone built-in)
a global network connecting millions of computers
a general term used to describe an application or a program
It is possible to buy a special video conferencing machine just for this purpose.
Meetings can take place without leaving the office.
Travel costs and the time taken to travel can be reduced significantly.
Meetings can be called instantly worldwide with little notice.
Delegates can still attend meetings even if they are physically unable to.
May not be as productive as a discussion around a table.

2527,"Once you have an idea of the main tasks involved in a project, break down each task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
Think about all the different things you need to do for each task, and the order they need to be done in, and add them to your overall plan. Allocate a number to each main task and give each sub-task a number or letter to show which main task it is part of, and where it is in the order. For example:
Task 3: Produce a formal letter to a newspaper explaining why animal experiments might be necessary.
Once you have an idea of the main tasks involved in a project, break down each task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
You could write this plan on paper and scan it before saving it on your computer. You could also write it straight onto the computer using a word processor, a spreadsheet, a mind mapping application or other suitable software.

4962,"In this Revision Bite we are going to look at standard index form and zero, negative and fractional powers.
Adding and subtracting numbers in standard index form:
Convert them into ordinary numbers, do the calculation, then change them back if you want the answer in standard form.
Multiplying and dividing numbers in standard form:
Here you can use the rules for multiplying and dividing powers. Remember these rules:
To multiply powers you add, eg, 10
To divide powers you subtract, eg, 10
Multiply 2 by 3 and add the powers of 10:
If not, remember that you should first work out 36  6, then work subtract the powers of 10 (because it is division), like this:
) = (36  6) x (10
In the previous pages, we only looked at positive whole number powers. We can also find zero, negative and fractional powers. The rules below apply to these powers.

1800,"Moniza Alvi: Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan
Moniza Alvi: Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan
Moniza Alvi was born in Lahore in Pakistan, the daughter of a Pakistani father and an English mother. She moved to Hatfield in England when she was a few months old. She didn't revisit Pakistan until after the publication of her first book of poems - 'The Country over my Shoulder' - from which this poem comes.
Presents from My Aunts...was one of the first poems I wrote. When I wrote this poem, I hadn't actually been back to Pakistan. The girl in the poem would be me at about 13. The clothes seem to stick to her in an uncomfortable way, a bit like a kind of false skin, and she thinks things aren't straightforward for her.
I found it was important to write the Pakistan poems because I was getting in touch with my background. And maybe there's a bit of a message behind the poems about something I went through, that I want to maybe open a few doors if possible.

5218,"The amount of energy transferred from the burning fuel to the water in the calorimeter can be calculated if you know:
energy transferred (joules, J) = mass of water heated (grams, g)  4.2  temperature rise (C)
For a given amount of water heated up, the greater the temperature rise, the greater the amount of heat energy transferred to the water. For example, twice as much energy is transferred to the water to achieve a temperature increase of 20C compared with 10C.
You can compare fuels by measuring the mass of fuel burned in the experiment. The best fuel is likely to release the most energy per gram of fuel. This is worked out using:

168,"In your work you need to show how different events fit together. This means you should know the basic storyline and what other parts of the plot are relevant to your task. If your task is about a particular scene, you should know what has already happened and what happens after the scene. Imagine you are looking at Act 2, Scene 1 (which finishes with Macbeth killing Duncan). You would probably want to include details from the plot like:
How Macbeth and his wife have secretly agreed to kill Duncan
How trouble is predicted at the start of the act (with Banquo saying he can't sleep and having 'cursed thoughts')
How Macbeth greets Banquo as a 'friend' when he is really a traitor
How Macbeth denies he has been thinking of the witches and their predictions (so we already know he is a liar)
How leaving Macbeth alone puts the focus directly on him and his thoughts
How Macbeth is relying on his wife for the signal to kill Duncan (just as he relied upon her for the courage to kill him)
How we do not see the murder, so are in the same position as Lady Macbeth - can we be sure Duncan is dead?
How the murder affects all the other characters in the play

Perhaps Clarke chose this structure because, in a way, it reflects what the poem suggests about memory - the main points are fixed but the details are looser.
Think about how the language the poet uses helps to convey her ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is the scene of the near-tragedy, Cold Knap Lake, an artificial lake in a park in Glamorgan. It is haunting that the name of the lake includes the word Cold - it is a word we associate with fear and death, ideas that are explored in the poem.
The poem is written in the past

, dealing with events in Clarke's memory. Certain details, those that made a big impression on her, such as the appearance of the girl when she was pulled from the water
(line 3) are described in detail, while other aspects are left vague. What effect does this give? What does it suggest about memory?
Apart from the poet's family, the characters are

The first stanza initially makes us believe that the child is already dead,

Just when we have been led to believe we are reading a 'happy ever after' story of rescue, we are told the girl was taken home and
(line 14). We are not told specifically why she was beaten - perhaps her parents were angry with her for the trouble she had caused, or found that hitting her was a way of venting the anxiety they had when they realised she was missing. Either way, the beating troubled Clarke so much that she wonders whether it actually happened -
There are a number of overtones of a fairy story in the poem - a miraculous rescue, a heroine, a poor family. Clarke explores this idea even further in

4, where she wonders about memory and what affects it. She says, ""When you recapture a memory from early childhood, you're sometimes not sure if you were really there, if someone told you about it, or if you read it in a story. I'd read fairy stories and legends about people drowning in mysterious lakes. I'd seen a famous painting of a drowned girl floating in a brook ..""

of human bodies, so they were limited in what they could find out about human anatomy. They also
many Greek ideas about medicine. These factors slowed down their progress, but they continued to explore new ideas about the causes and prevention of disease.
Roman doctors learned a lot about the human body as they tended gladiators wounded in the amphitheatres. However, dissection of humans was forbidden in the Roman empire, so Roman anatomists such as
to further their knowledge. Galen recommended dissecting monkeys that walked on two legs, like men.
Galen as depicted in a book by the 16th-century French surgeon Ambroise Par
He did manage to work a little with the human body, and described how he had
to dissect when he found a hanged criminal, and when a flood washed some bodies out of a cemetery. Despite this, he made various errors in his analysis of how bodies work.
Galen's books show a good knowledge of bone structure. He also studied the lungs, the muscles, the heart and blood and the nervous system. He conducted experiments on pigs, and when he cut the spinal cord in different places he realised how the
takes messages from the brain to the muscles.
Galen accepted the Greek theory of the
Four bodily fluids - yellow bile, black bile, blood and phlegm - used in ancient times to analyse and describe people's state of health.
as the cause of disease. However, the Romans did not continue the Greeks' investigations into disease and rejected Greek ideas, so Roman knowledge of disease did
Roman ideas about disease were muddled. For example:
Crinas of Massilia thought illness was caused by the stars (astrology).
Varro blamed creatures too tiny to be seen.
Columella blamed poisonous vapours in the swamps.
All these ideas survived until the 19th century.
Galen based most of his information about anatomy on what he saw when he dissected the bodies of animals. This led him to make mistakes. Some of his errors were:
He thought that muscles attach to the bone in the same way in humans and in dogs.
He thought that blood was created in the liver. He realised that it flowed round the body, but said it was burned up as fuel for the muscles.
He thought he saw holes through the septum, which allowed the blood to flow from one side of the heart to the other.
He made mistakes about the blood vessels in the brain.
He thought the human jaw-bone was made up of two bones, like a dog's.
He was mistaken about the shape of the human liver.

5869,"Jane is excited about returning to Thornfield and Mr Rochester, even though she believes he is married to Blanche Ingram. It is obvious when they meet that Rochester is delighted to see her, too.
What follows is ""a fortnight of dubious calm"", in which Jane expects to hear about the marriage but nothing is said.
On midsummer eve, Jane goes into the garden after Adele has gone to bed. She finds Mr Rochester there. The scene is described in extraordinary detail, as it moves to his proposal.
He is perhaps teasing or testing Jane as he talks of her having to move on, claiming to have found her a new position in Ireland. Eventually, however, he proposes, revealing that any chance of a relationship with Blanche ended when he pretended to have less money than she considered acceptable.
Rochester talks frequently of what he is doing as being wrong, but claims his love and care for Jane will atone for it. As readers, we think there could be something sinister behind this. However, Jane does not pick up on more than his emotion as they go into the house.
Jane is blissfully happy, but still aware that Mrs Fairfax seems shocked. So she asks Mr Rochester to speak to her the following day. Her congratulations, when they come, seem very subdued, fuelling our suspicions.
Jane decides she will not abandon her previous path. She refuses expensive gifts and spends a lot of time with Adele. Mr Rochester is eager to be with her, but allows her to dictate terms in this way in the four weeks leading up to the wedding.
Then we hear of a very bizarre episode. Mr Rochester has had to go away. When he returns, Jane describes having been woken by someone in her room. She describes the woman in hideous terms, and explains that her wedding veil was ripped in two, so it could not have been a dream. Mr Rochester encourages her to continue to blame Grace, and insists she shares Adele's room the night before the wedding.
The wedding morning arrives. Mr Rochester is possessed by tension and a desire that everything should be done quickly. Even Jane is encouraged to hurry.
There are no family present at the wedding. Perhaps for this reason, Jane notices two men, apparently waiting for the ceremony, enter the church before them.
When the priest asks if there is any impediment to the marriage, one of the men, Mr Briggs - a lawyer - explains that Rochester is already married to the sister of Mr Mason, who comes forward at this point.
Clearly, there can be no marriage. Mr Rochester takes them back to Thornfield to see his wife, Bertha, a dangerous lunatic, and Grace, her keeper. Bertha attacks Mr Rochester, but he is able to restrain her. Even though
The crime of marrying one person while still being married to another.
is a serious crime, it becomes easy to understand what drove him.
Before Briggs and Mason depart, we learn that it was a chance connection between Jane's uncle in Madeira and Mr Mason that brought Briggs and Mason to stop the marriage. We also learn that Jane's uncle is on his death-bed.
Jane spends a long time numb with shock at what has happened. She eventually meets with Mr Rochester and he tries everything in his power to keep her with him. He explains how he was trapped by his family into the marriage, and how he spent time in Europe seeking, in vain, some kind of escape.
He asks Jane to come away with him, but she is controlled by conscience and cannot allow herself to be loved by a married man. She knows she cannot stay with him and keep her resolution, so says she will leave.

4377,"Iron and steel rust when they come into contact with water and oxygen. They rust faster in salty water or acid rain. Aluminium, on the other hand, does not corrode easily, because its surface is protected by a layer of aluminium oxide.
Steel and aluminium have advantages and disadvantages when used to make cars, which are recycled to re-use valuable materials and cut down on waste.
Iron and steel rust when they come into contact with water and oxygen. Both water and oxygen are needed for rusting to occur. In the experiment below, the nail does not rust when air - containing oxygen - or water is not present:
Calcium chloride absorbs water in the right-hand test tube
Salt dissolved in water does not cause rusting, but it does speed it up, as does acid rain.
Aluminium does not rust - corrode. Its surface is protected by a natural layer of aluminium oxide. This prevents the metal below from coming into contact with air and oxygen.
Unlike rust, which can flake off the surface of iron and steel objects, the layer of aluminium oxide does not flake off.
reaction. The iron reacts with water and oxygen to form
, which we see as rust. Here is the word equation for the reaction:
iron + water + oxygen    hydrated iron(III) oxide
Most iron is converted into steel - an alloy - before being used. Compared to iron, steel is:
Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.
Cars are complex machines. Many different materials are used in their manufacture.
The main materials used in the manufacture of cars
tough and easily moulded to desired shape

3255,"Exam questions on data security will usually ask about methods for keeping data safe and secure.
In a local doctor's surgery, data about the patients is stored in a database on a computer.
Consider two physical precautions that should be taken to keep the data secure.
- the question is asking for the physical precautions you can take to protect data. Keeping the computer area secure and keeping backups in a safe place are both physical precautions. Swipe card entry, locking
a point of access, eg to a computer system
or controlling access to computer areas would also have been good answers.
The doctor needs to see all the information about patients. The receptionist only needs to see some of the information.
Describe one way in which software could restrict access to patient information.
Make it so users must enter a password to gain access to certain areas of the database.
The question is looking for detail about different types of access for different users. This answer clearly highlights the need for having passwords for different levels of access.

1546,"What is it? How do you know?
What type of publication do you think text 2 is? A comic? A newspaper? A magazine? A web page? A business document?
This one isn't so easy, so let's rule some things out...
: No. Comics are generally brightly coloured and full of cartoons. This isnt!
: No. Newspapers generally use narrow columns, black and white print and the pages are very full when you look at them.
: No. There are no giveaway clues such as 'click here', 'contact us', 'print this page' - so it cant be a web page.
: No. In a magazine, one would expect to see more writing and pictures on each page. This layout is too spacious.
: You are pretty close - text 2 comes from the Environment Agency. This is from the booklet the organisation would give to members of the public if they asked for information about what the Government is doing to protect and improve the environment.

865,"The three main causes of population change are:
- usually measured using the birth rate (number of live births per 1000 of the population).

4118,"The following scenes use flash-backs into the past to describe the story:
Megan is in the headteacher's office, with the Head (DSL/R). The Head gives the victim's account of what happened. As she tells her account the lights dim and Megan joins the group CS, and re-enacts the scene as the lights go up. The commentary fades out as the scene is played. Freeze. Megan rejoins the Head in her office with her Head bowed. The Head asks what she has to say. She apologises, and says that she's ashamed etc. The Head brings in the victim, and Megan has to apologise - the victim doesn't answer.
Megan is now a mother, whose daughter has been accused of bullying. The scene takes place in the headteacher's office. Megan is horrified to hear of what her daughter has done, and tells of what happened when she was at school. Lights dim. She joins group CS and re-plays the scene. Freeze. She returns to the headteacher's office and it is still in the past (slightly dimmer lighting than previously). The scene unfolds, with a telling off and a statement by (young) Megan about how she feels about what she's done and what her parents will say. Freeze. Lights fully up and the scene is now today. Megan's daughter is told about what happened in the past, and is thoughtful. The headteacher asks that Megan's daughter be excluded from school for a day, to think about what will happen in the future.
These scenes will need more than three actors. Again, they focus on Megan's regret, and the guilt she feels about being a bully.

7500,"Close or tight shots are good for capturing
or atmosphere. Think about when you watch a sports match. When you are up close you can see the players sweating and hear the grunts as they immerse themselves in the game, which in turn arouses your interest. This also applies when capturing images, so focus on what you want to show, and
Photograph taken from a distance of a man talking on a mobile phone, and photo of the same person in close-up
As these images illustrate, getting in close allows you to see people's expressions.
Always remember when taking photographs of people to get their permission first.
To create interesting photographs, you need to fill the frame and minimise the amount of
, and there is no reason why you can't fill the frame with your focal point being taken as an extremely close-up shot. It will help you to capture emotion that wouldn't be detectable from far away.
Capturing action shots requires practise. You could practise capturing images of footballers in action, but make sure you have their permission first. Take
of pictures to see if you can capture a player making contact with the ball. With a digital camera you can take lots of pictures, view them on the LCD display, then delete any unwanted images. Some cameras have a function called
that allows you to take several photos in quick succession. This is great for taking action shots.

object/person in your photograph. Any more than one focal point looks cluttered. If your photograph is expansive - for example, a sweeping landscape - you can choose a tree or small cottage as your focal point.
Two images of a park - the first has too many focal points - a bench, trees, grass, people; the second has one clear focal point - a tree
There are too many focal points (people, trees, bench) in the first image shown above, whereas the second image shows the tree as the clear focal point.
Arrange your subjects to ensure you translate what you want the audience to focus on. Use
. Be selective. If your object is in front of a messy background, move it until you are satisfied with the shot.
Two photographs of an iron - one with a messy background and one with a plain background
In the first image above, the messy background takes the focus away from the iron.
Have you ever taken a picture of a landscape and been disappointed when you have not captured the beauty of it?
There are several reasons why the camera views something differently from the human eye. We have the ability to interpret an image and enhance it, because the brain has the ability to process lots of different things at a time. The camera has a limited focus range whereas the eye is constantly scanning the scenery, recomposing it, and responding to changes in light conditions. The eyes work in conjunction with the brain to create the splendid image that you can see. A camera has a much narrower exposure range than the human eye.
and capture an attractive feature following the rules of taking good digital images. Once again, take lots of photos to ensure you capture one that is perfect.
Photographs with the focal point exactly in the centre can lack depth and interest, so it's better to position your focal point
. To do this, apply the rule of thirds. Draw two horizontal and two vertical lines through the picture you want to capture, to divide it into thirds.
The eyes are naturally drawn to the
illustrated in red above, so place the important elements of your picture on one (or more) of these points.
Compare the two images above. A focal point placed in the centre (as in image 1, above) often just looks boring, so as a rule avoid placing your focal point in the centre. You will see this rule being applied in any magazine you look at.
that is used when the camera senses there isn't enough natural light. It's good to keep the flash on automatic, to make sure your photographs are illuminated well. You need to experiment with your flash, to work out its
. Generally, most flashes work up to 10 metres away - any further, and your subject is likely to appear dark.
Also think about natural light, especially outside. Try to make sure the sun/light source is
When photographing people, be aware that strong bright light will show up their wrinkles and blemishes, so you may need to adjust the light. Similarly, when taking photographs of landscapes, try to take them in the early morning or early evening because the light is softer then.
shots, so experiment with using your camera horizontally and vertically. A photograph of Nelson's Column, for example, would be ideal for a vertical shot to illustrate the towering effect the coloumn has on its surrounding scenery.
Nelson's Column is ideal for a vertical shot.
10. Know when to break the rules
Once you have mastered these rules, you can then begin to break them. With digital photography, it's easy to take lots of pictures, so don't be afraid to
. If you can create an unusual image, it's likely that people will be interested in it.

1138,"Try to split problems of this type into a series of two-dimensional questions. It is easier to work in two dimensions than three. Look at the following example.
has a square base that is 4cm long. The height of the pyramid is 3cm.
O is the centre of the base, so AQ is half of AC.
are equilateral triangles with sides that are 4cm long.
QU is part of the triangle QUV, where V is the point we used in the first part of this question, midway between S and R.
For this question, you will need to use the answers from the previous questions. Use the perpendicular height of the prism, UV, which is
and the base is 18.8 (1 dp).
Keep your answers in surd form (like
), or store them in the memory of your calculator. Using rounded values later on in a question will lead to inaccurate answers.
You might also be expected to apply the sine or cosine rules to a 3-D problem. Look at the following example.
Sally and Kate stand some distance away from a building (B) which is 10m high. Sally is on a bearing of 030 from the building. From where she is standing, the angle of elevation of the top of the building is 35. Kate is on a bearing of 090 from the building. From where she is standing, the angle of elevation of the top of the building is 50. This information is shown in the diagram.
What is the distance between Sally and Kate?
In the same way we can find OK = 8.39m (3 s.f.)

Also known as the Blackshirts. A German police/ military style organisation created to serve as the personal bodyguards of Adolf Hitler. In Hitler's Germany they eventually controlled the intelligence, security and police forces, and extermination of those they considered undesirable.

2893,"There are different opinions about what the Industrial Revolution actually consisted of and what caused it. This Revision Bite will look at some of the arguments that question the definition and timing of the Industrial Revolution.
wrote the famous economic historian EJ Hobsbawm.
""It is little wonder that the Victorian period is sometimes called the Age of Iron""
The economic historian JU Nef always argued that it was the move to coal as a fuel that kicked off the technological changes, which created the Industrial Revolution -
""The steam engine was one of the most important of mans inventions for without it the Industrial Revolution could never have taken place""
confusion about the nature of the Industrial Revolution
, and where the revolution in the British economy started.
Recently, certain economic historians have claimed that there was
revolutionary change only in the cotton and iron industries
, and that change in other areas of the economy was much slower  so much so, that one economic historian has argued that the period as a whole no longer deserves the title ""Industrial Revolution"".

5815,"W B Yeats: Song of the Old Mother
Yeats wrote a great deal about the passage of time, and of youth and beauty giving way to old age and death.
A central, unifying idea that runs through a text or performance.
. The poem contrasts two types of human endeavour: the young women's dreams of love and obsession with appearance; and the hard, grinding, thankless work that is the Old Mother's lot.
An interesting cross-current is set going by our uncertainty about who the young women are.
Are they the Old Mother's own children? If so, their idleness is easier to forgive. Perhaps in her youth the old woman herself dreamed of love, lay late in bed, and obsessed about whether her ribbons matched. Perhaps, as old people often do, she has forgotten what it's like to be young!
Or are they the children of the old woman's rich employers? If they are, we are more likely to view them as spoilt and selfish young people whose idle lives are made possible only by the drudgery of poor servants like the Old Mother.
And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress:
While I must work because I am old,
And the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold.'

5231,"Atoms are made of three types of sub-atomic particle: neutrons and protons in the nucleus and electrons orbiting the nucleus.
Some materials are radioactive because the nucleus of each atom is unstable and gives out nuclear radiation in the form of alpha particles, beta particles or gamma rays. The radiation can be detected using a Geiger counter.
Atoms are made up of two main parts, the
The nucleus contains two types of particles called
. As protons, neutrons and electrons are the building blocks of atoms they're called
because the nucleus of each atom is
in the form of alpha particles, beta particles or gamma rays. The nuclear radiation given off can be detected using a Geiger counter. The number of nuclei that decay and give off radiation every second is called the
of the material and is measured in
If a radioactive material has an activity of 200Bq, in 1 second 200 of its nuclei will decay and give off radiation. In 1 minute 12000 (=200 x 60) nuclei will decay.
The activity of a radioactive material will

Similar species tend to live in similar habitats, and are closely related in evolutionary terms. They are likely to share a relatively recent ancestor. Closely related species living in different types of habitat may have different characteristics. You can use
to identify organisms according to their features.
In the 18th century, Carl Linnaeus started the modern system of putting species of organism into certain groups and giving them scientific names. Each species is given a name using Latin words, so that the same name can be used all over the world. For example, the scientific name for human beings is Homo sapiens. The first part of the name tells you the genus, while the second part of the name tells you the particular species in that genus.

412,"Comets are balls of ice and dust in orbit around the Sun. The orbits of comets are different from those of planets - they are elliptical. A comet's orbit takes it very close to the Sun and then far away again. The time to complete an orbit varies - some comets take a few years, while others take millions of years to complete an orbit.
Comets have a range of different orbital periods and all leave a trail of debris behind them
Comets are often visible from Earth when they get close to the Sun, because the Sun's heat vaporises material from their surface, and this vapour forms a tail.
Asteroids are rocky objects, smaller than planets. Most of them are found in an 'asteroid belt', in orbit around the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. The minor planet Ceres is found here, too. Asteroids can crash into each other. When they do, they may break apart and their orbit may change.
The orbits of some asteroids cross the Earth's orbit. At various times during the Earth's history, asteroids have hit the Earth. When this happened, a tremendous amount of energy was released, throwing up billions of tonnes of dust. This blocked heat and light from the Sun, making the Earth very cold.
It is thought that it was the collision of an asteroid with the Earth that helped to drive the dinosaurs to extinction. Scientists worry that an asteroid could still hit the Earth and cause a global catastrophe.

Compounds and mixtures - The reactivity series
Magnesium burns very brightly when heated in air
Some metals are very unreactive. That means they do not easily take part in chemical reactions. For example platinum does not react with oxygen in the air, even if it is heated in a Bunsen burner flame.
Some metals are very reactive. They easily take part in chemical reactions to make new substances.
Magnesium is like this. If it is heated in a Bunsen burner, it ignites and burns with a brilliant white flame.
The reactivity series for some common metals
Other metals may be more reactive than magnesium, or in between magnesium and platinum. If we put the metals in order of their reactivity, from most reactive down to least reactive, we get a list called the
If you want to learn the reactivity series, you could try making up a mnemonic or silly sentence to help. Here's one - can you do better?

70,"> Time - 12-hour and 24-hour clock
am is the time from 12 midnight and before 12 noon.
pm is the time from 12 noon and before 12 midnight.
means 23 minutes past 6 in the morning
means quarter to 8 in the morning
The 24-hour clock does not require the use of am or pm. Afternoon is indicated by a number bigger than 12.
When converting from the 12-hour clock to the 24-hour clock remember:
for any time after 12.59pm, add 12.
, so for any time before 10:00 a zero is placed at the beginning.

262,"When using trial and improvement guess what the answer might be, then improve on it until you get close to the correct answer.
A square has an area of 20 cm
. Use a method of trial and improvement to find the length of its side, correct to 1 decimal place (1 d.p.).
4 is too small, so try 5:
4 is too small, and 5 is too big, so the answer lies between 4 and 5.
between 4.4 and 4.5, but it is closer to 4.5
The question asked us to find the length of the side correct to 1 d.p., so you only need to try values with 1 d.p.
If, however, the question had asked for values correct to 2 d.p. you would have got a more accurate answer. For example:

441,"We can see why variety is important by looking at this list below. It is taken from a story called ""You are now entering the human heart"", by Janet Frame, and is actually one of her paragraphs broken down into simple sentences:
None of them had ever touched a live snake.
They were waiting for the drama to begin.
The attendant took a green snake out of a basket.
He draped the snake around the teacher's neck.
She did not have a chance to protest.
He stepped back to admire the sight.
It doesn't really sound right. How could the writer change this to convey the drama of the situation? Look again at the sentences and decide what changes you could make, which ones you could join. Then click here to compare your ideas with the version in the book.
Her eyes faced the lighted exit. I saw her fear. The children, none of whom had ever touched a live snake, were sitting hushed, waiting for the drama to begin; one or two looked afraid, as the attendant withdrew a green snake about three feet long from the basket and with a swift movement, before the teacher could protest, draped it around her neck and stepped back, admiring and satisfied.
So the key points to remember about sentences are:
You should have a variety of sentences in each piece you write.
Complex sentences cause the most problems, but they can be the best for linking ideas and arguing your point.
Different types of sentence suit different purposes, so think carefully about what you are trying to do.
Connectives are a good way of linking ideas. They can provide a more detailed structure and help readers.
You write sentences all the time. Find out when and where to use them.

The Tempest second key extract - Language
Think about how language is used in the two Key Extracts - for example, patterns of language that appear in both, or how language changes from the first to the second extract.
Love is strongly linked to magic. Miranda thinks that Ferdinand is a ""spirit"". He thinks that she is a ""goddess"". It is strongly suggested that their love at first sight is simply an illusion.
Miranda and Ferdinand's speeches are very honest and loving. Ferdinand is ""humble"", whilst Miranda talks of her ""modesty"".
When Prospero describes love he uses terms linked to control, e.g ""They are both in either's powers""; his daughter will ""control"" Ferdinand.
Prospero recognises that Miranda and Ferdinand's love is real and beyond their control. He compares it to a disease. He says his daughter is ""infected"".
There are lots of references to freedom and slavery. Prospero promises to free Ariel; he threatens to ""manacle"" Ferdinand. Ferdinand doesn't mind being a slave as long as he has Miranda to love.
Ferdinand uses a metaphor linked to slavery to describe his past crushes. He admits that he only suffers the indignity of being Prospero's slave for Miranda's sake.
The exchanges between characters are short to speed up the action.
The speeches between Miranda and Ferdinand are much longer. The content is moving and romantic.

510,"Scatter diagrams show the relationship between two sets of variables. By looking at the diagram you can see whether there is a link between variables. Where there is a link it is called
The English and Maths results of ten classmates are shown in the table below:
To see whether there is a correlation between the Maths and English marks, you could plot a scatter diagram.
The Maths mark is on the horizontal scale and the corresponding English mark on the vertical scale.
Bill's Maths mark was 60 and his English mark was 65, so his results are represented by the orange point at coordinates (60, 65).
In the scatter diagram above, whose mark does the small red cross represent?
The co-ordinates of the cross are (80, 70).
Therefore, the Maths mark is 80 and the English mark 70.
You can see that all the points representing Maths marks and English marks lie approximately along a straight line. This shows that there is a correlation between these two variables.
The table below shows the correlations that you can deduce from different patterns of scatter.
The points lie close to a straight line, which has a positive gradient.
This shows that as one variable increases the other increases.
The points lie close to a straight line, which has a negative gradient.
This shows that as one variable increases, the other decreases.
There is no pattern to the points.
This shows that there is no connection between the two variables.
Would you expect there to be positive correlation, negative correlation, or no correlation between the following pairs of variables:
a) As temperature increases, the sales of ice-cream are also likely to increase. Therefore, there is likely to be positive correlation.
b) It is unlikely that there is a connection between height and intelligence. Therefore, there is no correlation.

Astronomy and space science - The Moon
The Moon orbits the Earth, so it is called a
. No-one built it or launched it into space.
Gravitational forces between the Moon and the Earth keep the Moon in orbit. The Moon does not produce light. But it does
light from the Sun, which is how we are able to see it from Earth. (Only stars produce light and they are called luminous for that reason.)
It takes the Moon 28 days to make a complete orbit of the Earth. As it orbits, we see the Moon lit from different angles. This is why we see
Sometimes the Moon looks like a full circle. That is called a 'full Moon'. At other times we see a crescent shaped Moon, because we can only see the edge of the part that is lit by the Sun.
Remember that we can only see the part of the Moon that reflects the Sun's light. How much of that we can see depends upon the position of the Moon in its orbit.
This slideshow shows the phases of the Moon, as seen from the Earth.
A common mistake is to think that the phases of the Moon happen because the Earth gets in the way, and casts its shadow onto the Moon. That is not how the phases are caused.
However sometimes it does happen that the Earth's shadow falls on the Moon. Then we get an
of the Moon. The whole Moon goes from full, to dark, and back again to full, in the course of a few hours.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - Performance
There are a lot of different ways to perform a particular scene. How is the drama created in the two Key Extracts?
From the table below, you will see there are elements of the two Key Extracts that are quite similar. But whereas there is some humour in the first extract, the second extract is more moving and romantic. This needs to be brought out in the performance.
Set in a public place in Verona.
Set in Capulet's Orchard - the two characters are alone.
Is a more gentle and humorous end to what has been a very tense and action-packed scene.
A moving and romantic extract that contrasts with the scene before it which is full of Mercutio's rude jokes.
Montague and Benvolio describe how Romeo has been behaving, before he actually appears on stage.
Whereas in the first extract, Romeo talks about love, in the second extract we see how he behaves when he is in love.
The movement of characters is less obvious - it's just two characters having a chat. The director has to make sure that this is interesting to look at on stage.
Again, in the second extract, two characters are talking. The director has to think creatively so that the action is interesting to watch.
The potential for humour comes from the banter and word-play between Romeo and Benvolio.
The language of this extract creates a romantic and moving tone.
Once you understand how the audience should feel, you can decide how you might direct particular parts of the play.
Answer the question you have, not the question you would like.

497,"> Atmosphere and setting - Implicit meaning
- it's suggested, but not openly stated. Implicit meaning can be harder to figure out than explicit meaning. Writers like to be clever and draw you into their text. It's up to you to make your mind up about a setting, in just the same way that it's up to you what to make of a new place you visit. Writers often use language in clever ways to build up a sense of atmosphere and setting.
Take a look at the following extract from Robert Westall's novel, 'Urn Burial'. Ralph has been captured by an alien race...
This was the worst nightmare yet. He was standing with his back pressed against a smooth wall cold as ice. The cold nibbled at his buttocks and legs; it ran up and down the knobbles of his spine, making him shiver; it invaded his lungs so he could hardly breathe; he felt he had been shivering a long time.
In the extract, the writer intends to create a very creepy, sinister atmosphere. The way that he describes Ralph's imprisonment makes it sound very unpleasant. He is ""pressed"" against a wall that is ""cold as ice"" and the cold is creeping into every part of his body, making him shiver. Ralph also feels as if he can ""hardly breathe"" because of the cold.
. The simile; ""a smooth wall cold as ice"", helps the reader relate to Ralph as they will know what ice feels like. The writer also uses personification; the cold ""nibbled"" at Ralph, it ""ran up and down"" his back and ""invaded"" his lungs. This makes the cold sound as if it were alive, running over and into Ralph, trying to eat away at him. This adds to the feeling that he has been overpowered and is in danger.

624," r  r. Only the 'r' is squared.
Find the area of the following (use
a) r = 6cm, so we calculate A = 3.14  6  6 = 113.04cm
b) The diameter is 10cm, so the radius is 5cm. We calculate A = 3.14  5  5 = 78.5cm
A dartboard has a radius of 20cm. The bullseye in the centre of the board has a radius of 1cm.
By calculating the area of the two circles, find the area of materials required to make the dartboard (use
The area of the materials required is 10990mm
Remember that the area of the large circle is 3.14  20  20 = 1256cm
The area of the small circle is 3.14  1  1 = 3.14cm
Therefore, the area of the materials required is 1256 + 3.14 = 1259.14cm
When calculating the area of a circle, remember to use the radius, not the diameter.

Energy transfer and storage - Saving energy
Electricity can be generated in many ways, including:
in power stations using fossil fuels or biomass fuel
Most of the UK's electricity is generated in power stations using
energy released from the burning fuel is used to boil water to make steam, which expands and turns turbines. These drive the generators to produce electricity.
the fuel is burned to boil water to make steam
the spinning turbine turns a generator which produces electricity
the electricity goes to the transformers to produce the correct voltage
when they burn, we are aiming to produce more of our electricity using other,
energy resources. This will reduce the rate at which the fossil fuels are used up.
We can also reduce the rate at which the fossil fuels are used up by saving energy. For example, we can:
walk to instead of getting using cars where possible
turn off the lights when leaving the room

396,"> Writer's tricks - Persuading the reader
Some persuasive texts aim simply at persuading us to do something, particularly charity leaflets, holiday brochures and adverts. Others may try in more subtle ways; newspaper and magazine articles may try to persuade us to agree with a certain view.
Try to convince us to do or agree with something, such as spending money or agreeing with a certain belief.
Contain a mixture of fact and opinion.
Emphasise key points by using subheadings, repetition, memorable phrases and emotive language.
Often use a personal style so that the text seems to speak directly to the reader.
Show clear links between points, such as ""if you donate 20 you will be helping a sick animal"" or ""using our deodorant will attract women"".
Stories can also be persuasive as well. A writer may want you to like or dislike a character. The way that they describe a character can persuade you to do either of these. Look at this extract from 'Jane Eyre':
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at the table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye with flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mamma had taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate health'.
How does Charlotte Bront try to persuade, or convince, us that John Reed is an unpleasant character in this paragraph?
She makes him sound unattractive, with his ""dingy and unwholesome skin"" and ""heavy limbs"".
She suggests that he is greedy as he ""gorged himself habitually at the table"". She suggests that this is why he is so unhealthy, so that we don't feel sorry for him.
She makes him sound spoilt because his mother is keeping him home from school, even though his so-called ""delicate health"" is his own fault.

368,"A debate is an organised argument. You might think you've never taken part in a debate before but you probably have without realising it! When you discuss topics in class or at home, and put forward different points of view - this is debating. Debating allows you to discuss your ideas and find out what other people think about a particular topic.
If you're asked to take part in an organised debate at school, this is likely to be a more formal discussion and follow a set of rules.
Here are some simple rules for formal debates:
First of all, you need two teams: the proposition team and the opposition team.
Then you need something to argue about. This is called a motion.
The proposition team starts. Their first speaker has to tell everyone what the motion is all about.
The opposition team goes next. Then the teams take it in turns until everyone has had their say.
The last speaker on each team has to sum up their team's main argument.
Your team will need to do plenty of preparation - writing out the main points of your argument. During the debate, your team is allowed to pass notes to each other so that you can add or change things as you go along. The most convincing team wins the debate. Try to guess in advance what your opposing team might argue to avoid being caught out.
Use these tips to make your arguments as convincing as you can:
Use facts - it's hard to argue against a fact so use as much evidence and as many statistics as possible.
Use opinion too - debating is all about getting your opinion across and persuading others to agree with you, so use a good balance of fact and opinion.
Listen to the other team and comment on what they have said. You then have a chance to convince the audience of the other side of the argument.
Structure your argument - as if you were writing an essay, you need a clear introduction, a middle and a conclusion.
Arguing isn't about shouting the loudest - present your arguments in a clear controlled voice. Don't lose your temper or get too emotional about the arguments.

The second half of the writing focuses on the points in favour of the healthier options. Again, if you want any further information, click the check ideas button to see our comments.
However, this evidence does not show the whole picture. Many students say they would prefer to see more choice in the canteen. They point out that eating jacket potatoes every day is boring, and that the cold fillings are inadequate in winter. It has been suggested that more sandwiches, salads and a bigger range of hot main meals would be much more appealing. Many of these students currently bring their own food to school simply because they feel there is so little choice. These numbers include Grange High's many vegetarians.
Now the writer moves on to the views in favour of healthy food. The impersonal tone is maintained in the first sentence. The formal connective 'However' is used to signal a change in the argument. The writer returns to the facts - jacket potatoes are the only healthy option - and suggests some alternatives. She builds on the evidence mentioned earlier. She is building up towards her conclusion now.
Nevertheless, it remains true that junk food is popular and easy to produce. If students start going off site they may get injured or into trouble, and the school could be held responsible. Therefore, it seems impractical to ban junk food altogether. But is there another answer? I believe there is: the canteen could offer a wider selection, including healthier options, for one term, and see whether it is successful. If it is, and we see more students using the canteen and eating the healthy options, the canteen could make this change permanent.
This detailed paragraph begins to suggest the solution. Formal connectives are used ('nevertheless' and 'therefore') to signal that the argument is coming to an end. She returns to a personal expression, 'I believe there is...' because she is summing up her findings.
In conclusion, the solution seems clear: if a good selection of food is provided then everyone will be happy - and the canteen will almost certainly gain more customers. Thank you for your time.
The final paragraph is short and direct. It sums up the main conclusion of the speech in a positive way: 'everyone will be happy' and 'the canteen will almost certainly gain...' which leaves the audience with a clear picture of her final point of view. Rather than trying to persuade people one way or the other, the speech has tried to suggest a solution where everyone gains. This isn't always possible, but it can be a helpful way of concluding without sitting on the fence and telling the audience to make up their own minds. As you can probably guess, this is an excellent answer.
Make all that writing make sense. Try this!

297,"When all the food chains in a habitat are joined up together they form a food web. Here is an example of a food web:
Although it looks complex, it is just several food chains joined together. Here are some of the food chains in this food web:
grass  insect  vole  hawk
grass  insect  frog  fox
grass  insect  vole  fox
Notice that the frogs, voles and insects have more than one predator, but the rabbits and slugs have just one predator.
This leads to some interesting effects if the population of a particular organism in the food web decreases. Some animals can just eat more of another organism if food is in short supply, while others may starve and die. This in turn can affect the populations of other organisms in the food web.

484,"The environment, the Earth and the universe
> Astronomy and space science - Introduction
The solar system contains planets, their satellites, asteroids and comets. The planets orbit the Sun and take different amounts of time to do this.
We have night and day on Earth because the Earth spins on its axis. The tilt of the Earth's axis causes the seasons to change as we orbit the Sun in one Earth year.

443,"Extending the x and y axes beyond the origin reveals the negative scales. The areas of the graph between axes are called quadrants. So now we have four quadrants in total.
Coordinates in these quadrants are still described in terms of x and y. But now we can have
The coordinates of A are (-2, 3).
The coordinates of B are (-3, -4).
What are the coordinates of C for each of these examples?

344,"We need to get oxygen from the air into the blood, and we need to remove waste carbon dioxide from the blood into the air. Moving gases like this is called gas exchange. The alveoli are adapted to make gas exchange in lungs happen easily and efficiently.
Here are some features of the alveoli that allow this:
they give the lungs a really big surface area
they have moist, thin walls (just one cell thick)
they have a lot of tiny blood vessels called capillaries.
from where they have a high concentration to where they have a low concentration:
Oxygen diffuses from the air in the alveoli into the blood.
Carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the air in the alveoli.
In order to see this content you need to have both
is also lost from the surface of the alveoli into the lungs - we can see this condensing when we breathe out on cold days.

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to advise
Once you can argue and persuade, it should be easy to advise. The trick is to be gentle - it's no good pushing your ideas at your readers, or trying to impress them. Instead, you should come across as friendly, as someone who just wants to help.
For instance, imagine you're writing to advise someone in Year 9 who is moving house and has to change schools. We know that it won't be easy - they'll have to make new friends and cope with all sorts of changes. So you need to be sympathetic and give some ideas you think could help.
The first thing might be to plan each main idea in a separate paragraph because it's easier to follow like this. Then think about how you want to present your ideas. It might be fine to give some information as an order, such as:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone.
You can add information to this - perhaps explaining why and giving an example of what to do, so now your paragraph looks like this:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone. Most people will be glad to help and it's the quickest way to make friends. You can ask a teacher, but it might be better to ask one of the other pupils. Choose a friendly face if you can, and don't be shy - it might be their first day too.
It is not just the information that makes this a good piece of advice, it's also the style. It includes words like ""might"" and ""can"". These make the ideas softer - they are not in your face and pushing you to agree, they just guide you. And they are very simple to use, so make sure you include words like ""should, can, could, might, ought to and may"" - each one turns an idea into a piece of advice.

Measures - Converting units for area and volume
The method for converting between units works the same as the one for converting units of area and volume.
When you are converting one sort of unit to another, you need to know how many smaller units are needed to make 1 larger unit (eg 1000m
When converting from a larger unit to a smaller unit (eg m
When converting from a smaller unit to a larger unit (eg cm
= 100cm  100cm = 10 000cm
You are converting from a smaller unit (cm
= 50 000  10 000 = 5m
= 10mm  10mm  10mm = 1000mm
You are converting from a larger unit (cm
= 10  1000 = 10 000mm

Variation and classification - Inherited & environmental
Some variation within a species is inherited, and some variation is due to the environment.
Variation in a characteristic that is a result of genetic inheritance from the parents is called
Children usually look a little like their father, and a little like their mother, but they will not be identical to either of their parents. This is because they get half of their inherited features from each parent.
Each egg cell and each sperm cell contains half of the
needed for an individual. When these join at fertilisation a new cell is formed with all the genetic information needed for an individual.
Here are some examples of inherited variation in humans:
Gender is inherited variation too, because whether you are male or female is a result of the genes you inherited from your parents.
Characteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle. For example, if you eat too much you will become heavier, and if you eat too little you will become lighter. A plant in the shade of a big tree will will grow taller as it tries to reach more light.
Variation caused by the surroundings is called
. Here are some other examples of features that show environmental variation:
flower colour in hydrangeas - these plants produce blue flowers in acidic soil and pink flowers in alkaline soil.
Some features vary because of a mixture of inherited causes and environmental causes. For example, identical twins inherit exactly the same features from their parents. But if you take a pair of twins, and twin 'A' is given more to eat than twin 'B', twin 'A' is likely to end up heavier.

- each generation provides words known as 'slang' - often many of these words become accepted into mainstream English eg 'ok' and 'cool'. However, many slang terms lose popularity as a new generation emerges with their own slang words and phrases - making words such as 'phat' and 'groovy' history.

Has anyone ever said 'gesundheit' after you've sneezed? This is actually a German word, which has become popular in English.
- these are words or phrases that you only hear in a particular geographical area eg do you eat your sausage in a roll, bap or bun? Depending on where you live, it could be any of these. If you're Cornish, you might hear someone from Birmingham or Scotland using different words and grammar to you, even though you're all still speaking English.

197,"Another way to look at sentences is to think about their purposes. For instance, we can talk about...
Statements, which tell us things. We tend to see these in school text books, in newspapers, or in an encyclopedia. For instance:
This Revision Bite is all about sentences.
Questions, which ask us things or make us think about things. For instance:
When did the First World War end?
Orders, which are also called commands. These tell us what to do, so we find these in instructions, recipes and signs. For instance:
Next, take a small pinch of salt and mix it all together.
Exclamations, which are shouted out. You'd hear these at a football match, in arguments, or if you told a joke. For instance:
You don't have to know the names but you do need to know how and when to use them.
You write sentences all the time. Find out when and where to use them.

36,"> Compounds and mixtures - Chemical formulae
Remember that we use chemical symbols to stand for the elements. For example,
stands for sodium. For a molecule we use the chemical symbols of the atoms it contains to write down its
For example the formula for carbon monoxide is
. It tells you that each molecule of carbon monoxide consists of one carbon atom joined to one oxygen atom.
Take care when writing your symbols and formulae. Be careful about when to use capital letters. For example
means a molecule of carbon monoxide but
The word 'formulae' (""form-u-lee"") is the plural of 'formula'. If we have more than one formula, we don't say formulas, we say formulae.
If the molecule contains more than one atom of an element we use numbers to show this. The numbers are written below the element symbol. For example, the formula for carbon dioxide is
. It tells you that each molecule has one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.
Take care when writing these formulae. The small number go at the bottom. For example CO
Some formulae are more complicated. For example, the formula for sodium sulfate is
. It tells you that sodium sulfate contains two sodium atoms (
All compounds have a definite composition. Let's look at water as an example. A water molecule always has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom - it cannot be a water molecule if it has different numbers of these atoms. Its formula is always

Ray, the main character in this extract, has stolen a motorbike and caused an accident that killed someone. He has told nobody, but knows that he can't hide for much longer. He is about to get on a bus, but realises that the one person who can link him to the crime is the conductor of that very bus. Before he can run off, he bumps into Mrs Fitzroy, his best friend's mum.
Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. Write one paragraph for each bullet point.
He hung back, groping wildly for some excuse to prevent him getting on, but the bell rang and the engine increased its impatient rumble and his legs carried him upwards on to the platform, and he felt Mrs Fitzroy clamber on behind. The bus began to move. He turned towards the stairs, but she caught hold of his arm.
""Let's go downstairs. I don't like the smoke."" Again he felt her hand guide him, and he ducked his head and began to walk along the aisle. ""Yeah"".
""This'll do,"" she said, and he turned back and sat beside her - the less fuss he made, the less obvious he was, the better. As he settled, he kept his face bent low, aware of the conductor walking towards them. He brushed past, and, noticing things with a total clarity, Ray saw the dark blue uniform that he was wearing and noted the heaviness and thickness of the material. He heard him clumping up the stairs, and he wondered, absurdly, if he was wearing heavy boots, too.
Mrs Fitzroy was opening the bag which she had on her lap, and Ray felt in his pocket for his fare. If he had the right change, he could just hand it to the conductor without looking up. Yes, he had a ten and two pence piece. He glanced at Mrs Fitzroy and saw to his dismay that she was taking out a pound-note from her purse. That would mean a delay while she got her change - plenty of chance for him to be recognised. Could he offer to pay her fare? It would seem strange, but anything was better than being seen.
What kind of atmosphere does the writer create in this extract and how do they do it?
Ray's thoughts and actions as he gets on the bus
how the writer uses language to create the atmosphere.
In this text, the writer creates an atmosphere of fear and tension. Ray's thoughts and actions at the start of the passage show that he is under a lot of pressure. He tries to think of an excuse to 'prevent him getting on' the bus, but knows that this will just make Mrs Fitzroy suspicious. When he tries to go upstairs, she insists they stay downstairs. Nothing seems to be going his way, and this leads us to believe he may well be spotted by the conductor.
As the conductor approaches, Ray's fears increase which creates more tension. He keeps his face 'bent low' to avoid being recognised, and also notices things 'with a total clarity'. This shows that he is very scared and alert, ready for something to go wrong. When he realises Mrs Fitzroy has no change, he feels 'dismay'. The reader is kept on the edge of their seat waiting for the conductor to come along.
The writer uses language, as well as events, to create tension. The phrase 'groping wildly for some excuse' shows Ray's panic and gives the impression that he feels he has no control over events. The way he notices the 'heaviness' of the conductor's uniform, and wonders if he was 'wearing heavy boots as well' might mean that he is afraid of the man. Ray asks himself 'Could he offer to pay her fare?'. This shows he is tense; he is running through possibilities in his mind. The writer uses Ray's fears to create an atmosphere of tension for the reader.

482,"A sentence is made up of words put together to do a certain job.
Let's take a look at what those pieces are and how they fit together to make a sentence.
First, we have words. Words are the smallest meaningful bits of sense.
Each of these words does a different job.
is a verb - it tells us what happens in a sentence.
is a noun - it names things in a sentence.
is an adjective - it gives us more detail about a noun.
We put words together to make a
A phrase is a short, single piece of information:
We use phrases to make a clause.
A clause is a larger word group that includes a little more information. It consists at least two phrases - one is a noun phrase known as the subject, and the other is the verb.
In this clause, the noun phrase is
This now takes us to the sentence.
If we put a capital letter at the beginning of the clause we've used, and a full stop at the end, we have a sentence.
. A simple sentence consists of one clause that has a subject and a verb. A simple sentence puts across one simple idea.
A complex sentence is used to put across more
ideas. A complex sentence contains one main clause that can make sense on its own, and one or more minor clauses that are linked to it.
The main clause is the 'big dog barked' because it has a subject and a verb and makes sense by itself.
The minor clause is 'When I arrived'. Although it is a clause with a subject and a verb, it doesn't make sense on its own, it needs a main clause.
We can add more minor clauses to make a more complex sentence.
We can even split the main clause with a minor clause and still have a complex sentence.

More on formulas - Changing the subject of a formula
Sometimes you need to rearrange the formula to find the value you're looking for.
The area of a circle (A) is
This is useful if we know the radius of the circle and want to know the area. But what if we want to find the radius?
We need a formula that has r = (some expression in A). We get this by rearranging the A =
[Then find the square root of both sides]
[Swap the sides to make it easier to read]
The formula has been rearranged. We say that now r is
Q1. The formula to find the circumference of a circle: C = 2
Rearrange the formula to make r the subject.
Q2. The formula to convert the temperature in F to the temperature in C is :
Rearrange this formula so that it will convert the temperature in C to the temperature in F (so that f is the subject). Write down your working, then check your answer.
r, so divide both sides by 2
9c = 5(f  32) [multiply by 9]
= f - 32 [divide by 5]

175,"Firefighters usually use water and chemicals to fight wildfires. But this summer, firefighter battling a wildfire near Jackson, Wyoming, fought the fire with a new weapon a chemical used in disposable diapers.
The firefighter sprayed homes that were in the fire's path with a special gel nicknamed ""green slime"". The slime, which doesn't burn, is made from the same absorbent chemicals that are used in disposable diapers.
The firefighter sprayed the gel on nearly 200 houses. Because the green slime doesn't burn, it protects the houses from the fire.

683,"Lily Thorpe is showing kids that they really can make a difference in politics even though they may not be old enough to vote yet. The 11-year-old from Grand Junction, Colorado, recently started an organization called Kids Campaign.
""Kids weren't getting enough of a say in politics,"" Lily told
. ""Grown-ups who vote are making the decision for us. Kids can have a voice.""
. Political action committees bring awareness of various causes to elected officials. In Lily's case, Kids Campaign focuses on bringing children's issues to the attention of politicians.
Kids Campaign grew out of a concern that Lily had about her school library. She noticed that many of her school library's books and encyclopedias were outdated. To help schools in Colorado get the education funds and supplies they need, Lily founded Kids Campaign.
In the name of kids everywhere, Lily is making her voice heard and is hoping that politicians are listening. She is busy meeting politicians and speaking with them about kids' causes.
Lily has some advice for grown-ups. She encourages them to talk to kids about their voting choices. That way, she says, it helps make voting ""a family decision.""

The Great Lakes are the worlds largest group of freshwater lakes. They provide drinking water to more than 40 million people in the United States and Canada. But the lakes may not be around for long. A recent report shows that the Great Lakes are in trouble from pollution, overfishing, alien species, and habitat loss. Scientists have asked Congress for $20 billion to protect the lakes. The map shows the maximum depths of the five Great Lakes.

158,"Giant pandas get a new home at the National Zoos Asia Trail.
These lucky animals are getting some extra room to stretch out! Giant pandas at the National Zoo, in Washington, D.C., have a bigger home. The zoo opened its Asia Trail in October.
The zoos three pandas may be the stars of the show, but they arent alone. Six other threatened or endangered Asian species have new
or homes, on the trail. The animals with new homes are red pandas, fishing cats, sloth bears, Asian small-clawed otters, clouded leopards, and Japanese giant salamanders.
The $53 million makeover doubles the space for those animals. ""This is a giant leap forward for the National Zoo,"" says its director, John Berry.
The Asia Trail is part of a 10-year project to improve the zoo. Before the exhibit was
or updated, the animals lived in cramped quarters. Covering nearly 6 acres, the new area gives animals more room to roam and play.
""Visitors are treated to up-close views,"" says Susan Ades, head of the zoos exhibit design. ""You can see, hear, touch, and even smell the zoos science.""
The pandas are among the zoos most popular attractions. They draw huge crowds, which are expected to reach a record 3 million people this year. The pandas new habitat includes waterfalls and shallow pools, along with more rocks and leafy trees to climb. Fog machines even help model the pandas wet natural environment in China.
Along with the giant pandas, here are a few animals that capture visitors attention on the Asia Trail.
are the smallest of the worlds 13 otter species. They live in family groups of about 12 creatures.

648,"Coins were available for buying and selling at the World's Fair of Money.
Collectible coins and currency worth about $1 billion were on display at the World's Fair of Money. The fair was held this August in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
During the five-day event, money was displayed for looking at, buying, and selling. Some coins were worth as little as half a cent. Other coins were worth millions.
The event drew thousands of coin lovers from around the world. That's not surprising--coin collecting is one of the world's most popular hobbies.
, or a way to make money in the future. Most collectors, however, are not in it for the money. They participate in the hobby because of each coin's story. One coin expert referred to money as ""history that you can hold in your hand.""
Among the fair's most valuable coins were two Liberty Head nickels. The nickels were worth between $2 million and $3 million each.
A 1794 coin couldn't be missed at the fair either. Experts say the coin, believed to be the first silver dollar in the United States, is worth about $10 million.
Coin hobbyists point out that just because a coin is old doesn't necessarily mean it's valuable. A coin's worth depends on how many exist, on how many people want it, and on its condition.
Coin collectors are used to paying more for a coin than its original value. They say their hobby is worth every penny.
Each day, the government prints 37 million bills, worth about $696 million.
About 18 tons of ink per day go into printing those bills.
If you had $10 billion and you spent $1 every second of every day, you would go broke in 317 years.

228,"History is getting ready to repeat itself. This summer, the Olympic Games will return to their birthplace--Greece.
This year's Summer Olympics will take place from August 13 through August 29 in Athens, the capital of Greece. The Summer Games are held every four years.
""This Olympic homecoming will be an opportunity to reawaken the true spirit and meaning of the Olympic Games,"" said an Athens organizing committee member.
The Olympic Games date back more than 2,700 years. They were first held in Olympia, an area west of Athens.
The first known Olympic competition included just one event-a 200-yard footrace. Winning athletes were crowned with a wreath of olive leaves.
Over the years, more events were added, such as wrestling, discus throwing, and chariot racing.
As times changed, the Olympics evolved. In 1896, the first modern Olympic Games began in Athens. At that time, 312 athletes from 13 countries competed in nine sports.
Now, more than a century later, 10,500 athletes from more than 200 countries will go for the gold. The athletes will compete in 28 events, including baseball, gymnastics, swimming, and tennis.
Since 1896, the Olympic Games have journeyed around the world and have been
by, or held in, many cities. In keeping with tradition, the Olympic torch was
, or lit, this March in an ancient stadium in Olympia.
, or worldwide, Olympic Torch Relay. It is the first time in history that the Olympic torch will journey through all continents except Antarctica. The torch will travel nearly 48,000 miles before reaching the opening ceremonies in Athens.
As runners carry the torch around the world, people in Athens are having a race of their own. They are busy preparing for the estimated 5.3 million
, or viewers, who are expected to flood the city in August.
Construction workers are feverishly working to finish building the
. Those are the places where Olympic athletes will compete in different events.
At press time, the roof still had to be put on the Olympic Stadium. That is the site where the opening and closing ceremonies will be held. It is also where track-and-field events will take place.
Around the rest of the city, workers are completing a railway system and tearing up narrow roads to widen them for traffic. Hotels and restaurants are getting ready for an influx of tourists. Topping the Olympic planners' list is making sure the city is secure for athletes and visitors.
Some people are concerned that Athens might not be ready for the Olympics. But the Greek government was quick to reassure: ""We will have everything ready when it matters. We will offer what the world expects of us.""

601,"Mount Rushmore is getting a cleaning for the first time in its 65-year history. Carved into the famous granite monument are the faces of four U.S. presidentsGeorge Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Mount Rushmore is located in the Black Hills of South Dakota. For five weeks this summer, a crew washed the presidents' faces.
To kick off the cleaning, workers scaled the mountain and sprayed the left side of Jefferson's forehead with water. They also blasted Jefferson's eyelid and jaw with handheld hoses to wash away decades of dirt.
""Apart from the dirt, we are concerned with the lichens,"" Mount Rushmore official Judy Olson told
. Lichens are small plant-like organisms that can grow on hard surfaces, such as rock and bark. They make an acid that can harm the faces. ""The lichen roots are digging into the stone,"" Olson says.
The workers took special care near the cracks on the stone faces. They used pressure washing instead of chemicals. Pressure washing has been used to clean other historical structures, including the Statue of Liberty in New York City and the Coliseum in Rome.
Mount Rushmore was designed by American sculptor Gutzon Borglum. From 1927 to 1941, his team worked on the memorial. They used drills and dynamite to blast into the cliff. Each head is as tall as a six-story building.
Four presidents were carved into Mount Rushmore because they symbolized courage and freedom during the first 150 years of American history.
(1732-1799), the first U.S. president, led the American colonies to freedom during the Revolutionary War (1775-1783)
(1743-1826), the third president, helped write the Declaration of Independence.
(1809-1865), the 16th president, held office during the U.S. Civil War (1861-1865) between the North and South.
(1858-1919), the 26th president, was a champion of the environment. He founded the first national parkYellowstone.

246,"Explorer Brge Ousland likes challenges. He currently holds four polar records. He set his last record in 1997 when he became the first person to walk across Antarctica without help.
Now Ousland is taking on a new challenge. At the end of February, he was scheduled to begin a 1,100-mile Arctic trek from Siberia to Canada via the North Pole. Siberia is a region of eastern Russia.
If successful, Ousland will be the first person to cross the top of the world alone and without help. Although he was not sure how long the trip would take, the explorer planned to pull a 340-pound sled with food and supplies for 90 days.
""This is the last classic challenge when it comes to expeditions in the polar areas,"" Ousland said. ""I have wanted to do this for a long time.""

123,"Students from Camden's Promise Charter School in New Jersey recently finished both a canned-food drive and a clothing drive. And they are currently helping a local literacy agency reach its goal of collecting 20,000 books.
Jesse Coltrane, a 15-year-old student at Camden's Promise, says that kids can help people in need through school and community projects. Like Jesse, thousands of students will be working in their schools and communities to make the world a better place during National Volunteer Week (April 27 through May 3).
This year will mark the 30th anniversary of National Volunteer Week. The theme of this year's week is ""Celebrate Volunteers-The Spirit of America."" As part of this year's week, kids across the United States will be taking part in service projects. Many kids will also participate in community events to honor volunteers.
""When you volunteer, you help America become strong. You become an instant champion!""
""Volunteers learn important skills like teamwork and responsibility,"" said Melissa Helmbrecht, founder of the volunteer organization Champions of Hope.
Champions of Hope is made up of more than 650,000 kids across the country and includes Jesse Coltrane and other students at Camden's Promise. Champions of Hope participants across the country are volunteering to collect food for the hungry, clean parks, and raise money for firefighters.
Champions of Hope started a United Day of Service on September 11, 2002, one year after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. On that day,
star Sean Astin spoke to youths gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., about the importance of civic action. Astin plays hobbit Sam Gamgee in the movie. Astin told
, ""It is our responsibility to keep making the world a better place. We can do that by helping others.""
Sixth-grade student Matthew Malon from Illinois attended the September 11, 2002, rally and has collected food for homeless shelters. Astin's speech on volunteering moved him.
Some students from Camden's Promise also attended the rally. Students Damian Johnson, Keith Bennett, and Tashay Moody agree that it's important for kids to volunteer.As 16-year-old Damian Johnson puts it: ""[Volunteering] makes me feel like I have made an impact on people who don't have as much as I have.""
""How can I make a difference in the world if I'm just an ordinary kid?"" Thirteen-year-old author Sondra Clark answers that question in her fourth book,
!, which hit bookstores in March. She shows kids that small actions, such as donating videos to a children's hospital, can make a big difference.
Clark was motivated to write her book after reading an article on volunteerism in
. She has traveled to Africa to help children. Currently, she is traveling across the United States with her parents to share her experiences.
The action doesn't stop for actor Sean Astin when the cameras stop rolling. Astin, one of the stars of The Lord of the Rings movies and the father of two young children, is inspiring kids to make the world a better place.
In January, Astin was appointed to the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation. President George W. Bush created the council to encourage volunteerism. He has urged Americans to make a lifetime commitment to volunteering.
Astin tells kids that it's easy to make a difference. As a teenager in Santa Monica, California, he volunteered his time helping preschool students cross the street. He told Weekly Reader, ""I remember feeling that because I was helping someone, I had an incredible responsibility, and it felt great. It made me a better person.""

677,"Imagine having a twin that you didn't know existed. For Tamara Rabi and her sister, Adriana Scott, it was like a fairy tale come true.
The twin girls, now 20, were adopted in Mexico by different sets of parents in the United States. As luck would have it, the girls grew up in the same area in New York and went to different colleges near each other.
A common friend insisted the girls were twins and put them in contact. The girls exchanged
e-mail messages. Tamara had to do a double take when Adriana e-mailed a picture of herself.
The girls were stunned to learn that they each had a sister. Tamara's adoptive mother was surprised, too. Adriana's adoptive mother was aware that her daughter had a twin, but that was all she knew.
Besides looking alike and being the same height, the girls have a lot in common. They love to dance, and both started lessons when they were young. Upon meeting her sister for the first time, Adriana said, ""It was a shock. I saw me.""

162,"Mystery has surrounded King Tutankhamen's death for more than 80 years. Since his tomb was
, or dug up, in 1922, scientists have been left wondering: Was the ancient Egyptian king murdered?
Scientists recently performed a computerized X-ray called a
on King Tut's 3,300-year-old mummy. The results of the tests indicated that Tut wasn't violently murdered but might have suffered a badly broken leg shortly before his death. The injury could have led to a dangerous infection.
, or rising to, the throne when he was nearly 8 years old, Tut died mysteriously at age 19. The recent tests confirmed his exact age at the time of his death.
In 1968, X-rays performed on Tut's mummy showed that he might have suffered a blow to the heada sign that he could have been violently murdered. Now scientists say that is not the case. ""In answer to theories that [Tut] was murdered, the team found no evidence for a blow to the back of the head, and no other indication of foul play,"" an Egyptian spokesperson reported.
Despite the finding, some experts say the tests haven't solved the mysteryand haven't ruled out murder. One idea is that Tut was poisoned.
Although the cause of death is not clear, Zahi Hawass, the Egyptian scientist who led the investigation, says it's finally time to close the case.
""I believe these results will close the case of Tutankhamen, and the king will not need to be examined again.""

674,"The mummy which may be Nefertiti lies in Egypt's Valley of the Kings.
Queen Nefertiti's name means ""the beautiful one has come."" It is not surprising that she was given such a name. Queen Nefertiti has long been admired for her swanlike neck and high cheekbones.
But Nefertiti was more than just a pretty face. She is believed to have been one of the most powerful women who ever lived. She ruled Egypt more than 3,000 years ago. Egypt is a country in Africa.
Mysteriously, no one knows how Queen Nefertiti died. Her remains have never been found--until now, perhaps.
led by Joann Fletcher uncovered three mummies in a tomb in Egypt. (Archaeologists are scientists who dig up ancient objects and study them to learn about the past.) Fletcher believes that one of the mummies is Queen Nefertiti.
Modern science is helping Fletcher prove her idea and identify the face of the mummy. After X-rays of the mummy were taken, scientists put together a computerized version of what the face would have looked like.
What they discovered was amazing! The re-created face resembles a famous sculpture of Queen Nefertiti that was made during her reign.
""If the mummy is who we think it is, it would certainly help to answer a lot of unanswered questions,"" said Fletcher.
Scientists are quick to point out that the computerized version of the face does not prove that the mummy is Queen Nefertiti. The re-created face, however, isn't the only clue to the past.
There are other pieces of the puzzle that make Fletcher's team think the mummy is Nefertiti. First, the mummy's hair had been shaved off. Nefertiti preferred a shaved head so that her crown would fit tightly. A shaved head also helped her stay cool in Egypt's heat. Second, traces of a wig found next to the mummy matched the kind Nefertiti would have worn.
In addition, the mummy's left earlobe was pierced twice. Statues of Nefertiti show her having a double-pierced ear. The mummy's forehead showed the mark of a tight-fitting band--a sign of royalty. Another clue was the mummy's bent arm, which was broken off. Royalty were usually buried with their arms bent.
Not all scientists are convinced that the mummy is Nefertiti.
""If the mummy is female and if it is royal, then you still do not necessarily have Nefertiti,"" one archaeologist told
Another scientist from Egypt expressed doubts that the mummy is even a female. He said that both men and women could have double-pierced ears.
But Fletcher believes that she has found the long-lost queen and has returned Nefertiti to her rightful place in history.
The mummy which may be Nefertiti lies in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. That is an ancient burial ground for royalty. It is located in the desert, south of Cairo (the capital of Egypt) and along the west bank of the Nile River.
Scientists are starting to piece together more about the legendary queen's life. Nefertiti is now one of the most popular faces from ancient history, but that wasn't always the case.
, ruled Egypt together and had many enemies. Pharaoh is a name given to Egyptian kings.
The pharaoh and Nefertiti were disliked because they challenged the religion of the time. They began to worship one god instead of many gods. As part of their new religion, they moved from the city of Thebes and built a new capital in the heart of the desert. The new capital was called Akhetaton (ah-keh-TAHT-uhn).
(The modern name is Amarna.) They also made many changes to the style of art and architecture of the time.
Many historians think that when Nefertiti's husband died, she became pharaoh.

593,"Philippines hopes to set tree-planting world record.
Ready, set, plant! Nearly a million tree lovers
planted more than 500,000 trees on 2,137 miles of highway in the Philippines last month. (
means ""at the same time."") Planters were given 30 minutes to place their trees in the ground.
""This morning, we planted trees all over the
the biggest number of trees planted at one time in the history of the world,"" declared Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who took part in the planting. An archipelago is a group of islands.
The ""Green Philippine Highways"" project aims to improve air quality in the Asian nation. The Philippines has the second most polluted air among eight Southeast Asian countries polled, according to a recent study.
are substances discharged into the air from motor vehicles and factories. Emissions account for 70 percent of air pollution in the Philippines. Experts say it takes at least 10 trees to soak up the emissions from a single vehicle.
The current record for most trees planted at a single time is 300,587, set in 2005 by 16,317 people in India. Arroyo, however, is confident her countrys massive planting is in position to break the record. ""We will probably make it to the Guinness [World] Records,"" she says.

321,"Some people might think Geraldine Griswold is a little batty, but she doesnt mind. Griswold loves bats. In fact, she currently has about 20 of them in her home.
Griswold, who is a radio traffic reporter by day, runs a ""bat hospital"" in her Connecticut home. While you wont find these little creatures stretched out on hospital beds, you might find one or two of them snuggling up to Griswold.
At her home, Griswold cares for bats that are sick, injured, or orphaned. She has taken care of bats with injuries, such as a broken wing, as well as babies that have lost their mothers.
She has also cared for bats that were stranded in the winter because they had forgotten to travel south during the colder months. With the help of a
, or animal doctor, Griswold helps nurse the winged mammals back to health. Then she sets them free.
But Griswold is no stranger to bats. She grew up on a farm where they were a common sight. So it was no surprise how quickly she took to an orphaned baby bat she found squeaking on the ground outside her house ten years ago. She took the bat in and fed it milk from a goat on her farm.
To her delight, the little creature survived the night. Today, the bat--which she named Poppy--still lives with her. She did not release Poppy back into the wild because it identifies more with humans than with bats.
This bat lady, however, doesnt keep Poppy all to herself. Poppy is one of the winged creatures that Griswold brings with her on school visits. In fact, this Halloween she is speaking at a Connecticut school. Griswold, who teaches kids about bats, is on a mission to change their reputation.
. Many people, she says, are afraid of bats, but theyre actually gentle, shy creatures that are important to the environment.
Bats pollinate plants, spread seeds, and, most important, eat insects. ""There is no animal worldwide that eats more bugs at night than bats do,"" said Griswold, who is full of bat trivia.
However, the number of bats worldwide is in serious decline. They often lose their homes when people cut down trees.
But Griswolds message seems to be spreading. After she spoke to a Brownie troop, the members built bat houses in their town. The project turned into a community effort. ""The kids are making such a huge difference,"" she said.
There are almost a thousand species of bats worldwide. Bats come in different colors, shapes, and sizes. Some have huge ears and unusual faces. In fact, a bats face can teach you about its habits. Read on about some of these creatures.
Vampire bats can be found in Mexico, Central America, and South America. They drink blood, but its usually from cattle and horses--not people. A heat sensor on its nose helps it find blood close to the surface of its victims skin.
Egyptian fruit bats live mainly in Asia and Africa. They eat fruit and nectar. Their long noses help them locate ripe fruit. Fruit bats use their sharp teeth to chew fruit.
This bats ears are almost as long as its head and body. It uses its ears to detect insects. This bat, which is found in parts of North America, feeds mainly on moths.
(EHK-oh-loh-kay-shun) to navigate in the dark and to find insects. The bats make sounds that cant be heard by humans. A bat knows where an insect is because the bats sounds echo, or bounce off, an insect and return to the bats ears. A bat can actually hear the footsteps of a tiny mosquito!

613,"People in India are rebuilding their homes and lives after a powerful earthquake rocked a western section of their country on January 26. Indian officials say that the quake, which had a magnitude of 7.7, may have killed as many as 25,000 people.
The quake, which was the strongest to hit India in 50 years, left devastation and heartache in its wake. Initially, rescue workers had little hope of finding survivors under rubble from toppled buildings. However, miraculous rescues did occur. For example, a rescue team saved a 4-year-old girl trapped under tons of concrete several days after the quake had struck.

If you have access to a computer, you can log on to the Internet to find information and go to places without ever leaving home.
The Net also has some sites that aren't so nice. Many stories in the news lately have been about kids who have gotten into trouble because they weren't careful about using the Net.
The number of kids who use the Net has exploded in the past few years. According to studies by eMarketer, an Internet company that studies who uses the Net, the number of U.S. kids between ages 5 and 13 going online at home will grow from 11 million in 1999 to 22 million in 2003.
Not all kids are surfing the Internet safely. Many kids are giving out information that they shouldn't reveal on the Net, such as their real last names, addresses, and phone numbers. Some kids have online conversations with people who mean them harm or could get them into trouble.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), you can have fun on the Net without putting yourself at risk if you stick to the following rules. The FBI says:
meet someone or have him or her visit you without your parents' permission.

798,"One night in March, Daniel Calderone, age 12, was doing his homework in his California home. Then the lights went out, and he knew he wouldn't finish his assignment.
Many Californians have had similar problems. Since December, power companies have had trouble meeting the demand for electricity in the Sunshine State. In January and March, more than a million Californians sweated through
, which happen when power companies turn off electricity in an area for a short time.
Several factors contributed to the shortage, said Lawrence J. Makovich, a scientist who studies energy use. One problem is that California doesn't have enough power plants to supply all the electricity the Sunshine State needs. In addition, prices have risen for the fuels used in power plants to produce electricity, Makovich said.
The energy crisis may become worse this summer as Californians turn on air conditioners. According to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the state will probably be 10 percent short of the amount of electricity it needs.
This summer, the electricity crunch may spread to other parts of the country. In some areas, prices for electricity have been on the rise.
Many states are taking steps to solve the shortage. In California, Gov. Gray Davis is urging people to save energy.
""Yes, we have a power shortage, but we are far from powerless,"" Davis said. ""By reducing our electricity demand by even a small amount, we can reduce the price, avoid shortages, and lower energy bills.""

604,"No, this isn't a scene from the movies. A submarine designer is planning to build a new hotel in the Bahamas in which half the rooms will be underwater. The Poseidon Undersea Resort is expected to open late next year. In the hotel's most expensive rooms, guests will be able to watch ocean life outside their windows.

76,"Harbin's ice festival brings tourists and prestige to China.
The lights are on in ice city! The fun starts on January 5, in the city of Harbin in northeastern China. It is the site of giant ice sculptures, colorful ice castles, and working ice restaurants. Harbin hosts the world's largest International Snow and Ice Festival each year. The monthlong festival is among the many tourist attractions drawing millions of visitors to China.
or show, wows visitors this winter, the Chinese government is getting ready for another big tourism event. The 2008 Summer Olympics will take place in China's capital, Beijing. China's leaders are spending billions of dollars to build arenas and hotels throughout the country for the games. The goal is to make China a comfortable place for people to visiteven in the icy north.
China has more people than any other country in the world. Harbin is China's sixth-largest city, and by far the coldest. The city's
or extremely cold, winter temperatures can dip to more than 20 degrees below zero. Each year the people of Harbin have braved the freezing weather to carve ice sculptures for the Chinese New Year. In recent years, that tradition has exploded into a giant festival. Many of the ice buildings and sculptures are lit with colorful lights in the evening.
In December, 3,000 sculptors and workers began constructing Harbin's winter wonderland. Harbin lies on the Songhua River, which provides the festival with some of its ice. The festival covers 44 square city blocks. Workers used enough snow and ice to fill 90 Olympicsize swimming pools!
""Nothing can prepare you for the amazing sight of dozens and dozens of brightly glowing buildings,"" American photographer R. Todd King told
. ""Every year, the festival has more ice structures, and they are bigger and more complicated than before.""
China's rich cultural history, historic landmarks, and events such as the ice festival have made the country a top tourist destination. Nearly 42 million people visited China in 2004. The World Tourism Organization predicts that China will be the world's most-visited country by 2020. The Chinese government hopes the recent tourism boom will help improve the country's world image.
China's leaders have often been accused of violating human rights. Some watchdog groups, such as Amnesty International, claim that the Chinese government limits Chinese citizens' freedom of speech and imprisons people for speaking out against the government. Those accusations almost
or stopped, the International Olympic Committee from allowing China to host the 2008 Olympic Games.
China's leaders hope big events will increase China's world
or respect. The Chinese government plans to spend more than $500 million to improve tourism near Harbin. That means that Harbin's ice festival is bound to get even biggerand more slipperynext year!
3,705,406 square miles (slightly smaller than the United States)
About 1.3 billion people (about four times the population of the United States)
More than 50 dialects, or versions, of the Chinese language are spoken. The most widely spoken dialects are Mandarin and Cantonese.
The ice festival changes each year. Here are some buildings and sculptures that have been part of the festival in the past.
The ice festival often has an ice slide that visitors use to get from one part of the city to another.
Visitors to the winter festival can even eat at restaurants made of ice, like this KFC.
This structure was built to look like an ancient European castle. It was lit up at night to attract visitors.
People try to climb a sheet of ice. The ice wall is often located in a part of the city called Adventure Playground.
If you could design a new feature for the ice festival, what would it be?

785,"Twelve-year-old Sydney Davis is riding the wristband wave. Inspired by the popular yellow wristbands introduced by champion cyclist Lance Armstrong to raise money for cancer research, Sydney had her own idea. ""I thought, 'Why can't we have one for diabetes?' "" she told
since she was in kindergarten. She is one of 18 million people in the United States with this disease. In a person with diabetes, the body makes little or no
. That is a substance that the body needs to help convert
, a sugar in food, into energy.
With the help of her friend Daniel Rosen, 13, who also has diabetes, Sydney ordered blue wristbands with the slogan ""Cure Diabetes Today.""
The two friends started selling the wristbands in their New Jersey community to raise money for research aimed at curing diabetes. After only a month, they had sold 10,000 bracelets and donated the contributions to the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center in New York City.
The bracelets were in such high demand that the diabetes center began selling them on its Web site. ""We made over $100,000 already!"" said Sydney.

112,"What's purple and gold, wears sneakers, has horns and a tail, and weighs several hundred pounds? A statue of a cow, of course!
People in several U.S. cities are being treated to herds of cow sculptures. The sculptures are part of Cows on Parade.
Cows on Parade started in Switzerland in 1998. A U.S. businessman saw the cows and brought the idea to the United States in 1999. This year, about 1,000 cows are on display in several U.S. cities.

200,"Scientists recently discovered three previously unknown species of mouse lemurs. The find is important, because the numbers of lemurs left in the wild is dwindling.
Scientists found the lemurs on Madagascar, an island nation off the southeast coast of Africa. Madagascar is home to more than 30 species of lemurs. Most lemurs are the size of small rodents, but some can grow to be as large as a medium-sized dog. Lemurs are usually
animals, which means they mostly sleep during the day and come out at night.
The discovery surprised scientists. ""It's incredibly rare to discover a new species of primate, let alone three new species,"" said Steven Goodman of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.
Lemurs live only in the island nations of Madagascar and Comoros.
The smallest lemur weighs about 1 ounce.
The newly discovered species live only in the rain forests along Madagascar's west coast. They weigh a few ounces and eat beetles, fruits, and plants.
All lemurs on Madagascar are in trouble, however. Scientists fear that lemurs are in danger of becoming extinct.
One threat is from people cutting down the trees in which lemurs live. The trees are being cleared to create farmland. Another threat to lemurs comes from hunters who are trapping the primates for food.
To protect lemurs and the rain forests in which they live, wildlife officials in Madagascar have set up special parks and nature reserves. Loggers and hunters cannot cut down the trees or hunt the animals in the nature reserves.
Scientists hope that the special areas are large enough to protect all the species of lemurs that are living today. Scientists are especially concerned because there may be undiscovered species that need protection. ""So many areas of Madagascar haven't been [explored],"" said Dean Gibson of the Duke University Primate Center. ""I think there are more [species] to find.""

791,"For sale: a two-headed, albino rat snake. Asking price: $150,000 or best offer. The World Aquarium in St. Louis, Missouri, has put the 6-year-old
reptile up for sale. An albino snake has no natural coloring in its skin.
At the time the aquarium acquired the snake in 1999, officials thought it would survive only a few months. The 4-footlong snake, named We, has survived so long because its two mouths are connected to one stomach. Experts believe the snake will live another 10 to 15 years. The aquarium plans to use the money from the sale for research and education projects.

277,"March Madness has begun! That is the time in college basketball, from the beginning of March to the beginning of April, when top-rated teams compete to become national champions.
During March Madness, 65 men's teams and 64 women's teams are narrowed down to the Final Four. The two winning teams from each Final Four compete in the NCAA (National College Athletic Association) championship game.
This year, the men's Final Four and championship game will be held April 3 and 5 in San Antonio, Texas.
The women's Final Four will be April 4 and 6 in New Orleans, Louisiana.
The men's NCAA basketball tournament began in 1939, and the women's NCAA tournament began in 1982.

256,"The poems of Angel Island shine the light on Chinese immigration to the United States.
The year is 1934. Twelve-year-old Wong Kai Chong must leave everything he knows in China and travel to the United States to join his father. He lands in San Francisco, California, on a cold day and is held on Angel Island, a station for immigrants. An
is a person who comes to a country to live.
or question, Kai. He knows his answers must match what his father said before him. If they dont, Kai will be sent back to China. His experience is detailed in the childrens book Kais
Kais story portrays the voyage of more than 175,000 Chinese immigrants to Angel Island from 1910 to 1940.
In December, President George W. Bush signed the Angel Island Immigration Station Restoration and Preservation Act. The law provides up to $15 million to set up a museum and research center on the island to help tell stories like Kais. The money will also be used to protect hundreds of poems carved in the wooden walls of the station that describe the difficult journey.
People from China didnt always have difficulty entering the United States. The earliest Chinese immigrants arrived during the California gold rush in the 1840s and 1850s. They nicknamed the United States
or ""Gold Mountain,"" because many of them hoped to strike it rich.
But as the number of Chinese immigrants grew, Americans became less welcoming. In 1882, the U.S. government passed the Chinese Exclusion Act. The law made it almost impossible for Chinese workers to enter the United States.
or forcibly held, at Angel Island while immigration officials decided whether the newcomers should be allowed to enter the United States. The process was very different from that of Ellis Islandthe New York port of entry for European immigrants.
On Ellis Island, more than 95 percent of travelers were processed quickly and allowed into the United States. On Angel Island, many Chinese immigrants were held for weeks, months, and sometimes even years. After being cruelly questioned by officials, more than 30 percent of immigrants were sent back to China.
Angel Islands doors closed in 1940 when China and the United States became
or partners, during World War II (1939-1945). The islands main immigration station was scheduled to be destroyed in the 1970s until a park ranger found poetry carved in its walls. The poems described the frustration and sadness that many people felt during their stay at Angel Island. (See ""
Later this year, the poems will literally be brought to light. Angel Islands main buildings will reopen to the public, and the poems will be lit up for all to see.
""Angel Island shows a different, but equally important, side of immigration,"" Erika Gee, education expert at the Angel Island Immigration Foundation, told
""We hope that Angel Island becomes a bookend to Ellis Island.""
More than 200 poems are on the walls of Angel Island. The following two poems were recently translated:
Its been a long time since I left my home village
Who could know Id end up imprisoned
Im heartsick when I see my reflection,
  my handkerchief is soaked in tears
I ask you, what crime did I commit
  I give vent to despair
  on a mountainits hard to earn glory
  I watch for my early release
What feelings do these poems capture? How do they tell the story of Angel Islands immigrants?

34,"Five California condors died last summer in Arizona's arid backcountry.
A condor's wingspan is 9.5 feet across. That's about as wide as two kids lying down head to toe.
Wildlife experts say the condors did not die from the heat. Instead, the experts believe the huge birds died from lead poisoning. They say the condors had swallowed lead shotgun pellets.
, which means they eat the remains of dead animals. The condors probably ate the remains of an animal that had been shot by a hunter. As they ate the dead animal's flesh, the birds ate the deadly pellets.
If swallowed, lead can make an animal sick or cause death. Lead stops the body from making red blood cells. It can also damage an animal's organs, including the brain and liver.
The five poisoned birds were among 35 condors that have been released in Arizona since 1996. The release program has cost millions of dollars.
After the dead condors were found, wildlife experts recaptured and tested the 16 birds left in the Arizona group. All the birds were healthy and were soon released.
Members of the Peregrine Fund have been releasing and watching the condors set free in Arizona. Jeff Cilek, of the Peregrine Fund, told
that saving California condors is important. ""Condors are good for the environment. They [eat] dead animals,"" Cilek said.
California condors are among the world's largest birds. A hundred years ago, the birds were found in many parts of the United States. Today, the condor is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's list of endangered species. That means the number of California condors is so low they all could disappear someday.
Why are scavengers an important part of the food chain?
Peregrine Fund officials say there are 150 California condors left on Earth. Forty-eight of those birds are living in the wild; the rest are in zoos.
Although the loss of five birds is a ""serious setback,"" Cilek said his group is looking to the future. Peregrine Fund officials recently announced plans to release 12 more California condors in Arizona this winter.

413,"Assur was once one of the greatest cities in the world. About 30,000 people lived there. A huge temple tower, or ziggurat, stood about 200 feet above the city streets. Assur (or Ashur) was one of the leading cities of Assyria, the center of a great empire.
Today, ancient Assur is in ruins. Desert sand has covered over much of the 3,500-year-old city. Now Assur faces a new threat: water.
Assur is located in what is now Iraq, a country in the Middle East. Many parts of Iraq are covered by desert. Water is hard to find in the desert areas. To increase the amount of water, Iraqi officials are building a dam on the river Tigris.
The dam will trap the river's water. As the water rises, it might flood Assur and many other nearby ancient ruins.
Scientists worry that floodwaters will destroy artifacts hidden beneath the desert sand. Assur has already been the site of some amazing discoveries.
Scientists recently discovered four hidden tombs at Assur. They found ancient coffins, gold, jewelry, and gems. They also dug up the remains of two ancient Assurian queens.
Scientists used modern medical equipment to study the queens' bodies. They learned about some of the medical problems the ancient queens suffered from. The bodies showed evidence of dental cavities, sinus infections, and poor nutrition.
Michael Mller-Karpe, a scientist who studies ancient Assyria, said, ""The Assyrian queens have just begun to speak to us, and we are looking forward to more answers.""
Mller-Karpe and other scientists worry that the new dam may keep them from getting more answers. Even if the new dam doesn't flood Assur, the rising water could damage the ancient city. Moisture could cause the artifacts to crumble.
""You can't save Assur if it's [near] a dam,"" said scientist Peter Miglus. The soil beneath the ancient city would soak up water like a sponge. The water in the soil would destroy what's left of ancient Assur.
For now, scientists are scrambling to uncover the secrets hidden for centuries in Assur and other nearby communities. Meanwhile, some people are looking for ways to save the ancient cities. ""We don't want the slightest damage to Assur,"" one Iraqi official said.

375,"Meet a robot that has been busy tooting its own horn. A trumpet-playing robot made its debut at a hotel in Japan in March.
The robot played the song ""When You Wish Upon a Star."" After its performance, the 4-foot-tall droid bowed its head and waved its arms in response to the audience's applause.
Although the musical droid doesn't have a name yet, it is the latest in a string of
that scientists have built in the past few years. Humanoid robots are high-tech machines that act lifelike and are programmed to do jobs that people typically do.
Japanese companies lead the way in creating humanoid robots. Japan is thought to be the leader in
Other humanoid robots created by Japanese companies have been getting plenty of attention even without playing the trumpet.
Japanese scientists introduced ASIMO (ah-SEE-moh), the world's first stair-climbing robot, in 2000. The 4-foot, 115-pound ASIMO's many talents include walking, holding objects, speaking Japanese, and recognizing faces. ASIMO recently finished a world tour. The tour included several stops in U.S. cities so kids and adults could learn more about it.
Like ASIMO, QRIO (KYOOR-ee-oh), can talk and recognize faces. QRIO, which was unveiled in Japan in December 2003, can also run, jump, throw a ball, dance, and even belt out a tune.
In March, QRIO conducted Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in Japan. Before the rehearsal in front of a live audience, the robot grumbled, ""I'm feeling nervous.""
Today, robots come in all shapes and sizes. Many robots are used in factories. They help build cars, inspect computer parts, and package food. Robots speed up production on assembly lines and help save companies both time and money.
Robots also perform tasks that are difficult or dangerous for humans. Robots have explored the far reaches of space and traveled into active volcanoes.
that when robots were first introduced in the 1960s, they performed only jobs that were ""dirty, difficult, and dangerous."" That, however, is starting to change. Today's engineers hope that the new breed of humanoid robots will improve people's lives.
Many people are excited that humanoid robots may one day be able to lift people confined to beds or wheelchairs. The robots may also be able to help elderly people with chores such as vacuuming and taking out the garbage. Some people, however, worry that robots may take away jobs that are now performed by humans.
Although the humanoid robots have been busy making public appearances, they aren't for sale yet. If you really want a robot that will clean your room and help out with chores, you still have to wait a bit longer.
1. QRIO shows off some dancing skills. QRIO stands for ""quest for curiosity."" Why do you think the robot was given that name?
2. ASIMO (which is short for Advanced Step in Innovative MObility) walks down a flight of stairs.
3. In March, this latest humanoid robot-still unnamed-plays the trumpet at its first public appearance in Japan.
Robots are used for a variety of purposes from helping out in offices to performing surgery.
2. Sico the robot helps children paint pictures at an Arkansas hospital.
3. There is a two wheeled robot that can guide blind people.
How does technology help improve people's lives?

577,"Scientists recently confirmed that large, mysterious bones found near a river in San Jose, California, weren't those of any ordinary animal. They belonged to a Columbian mammoth, an elephant-like creature that roamed the area's grasslands between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago. Those ancient animals weighed 10 tons and stood 13 feet tall.
Columbian mammoths were found throughout the southern half of North America 2 million years ago. They lived during the mild weather between
. An ice age was a period of time when large sheets of ice covered Earth.
Similar to elephants today, Columbian mammoths are believed to have had short gray hair. They are thought to be related to woolly mammothslarge animals with shaggy coats that lived during the Ice Age. Scientists don't know why either mammoth vanished.
This find marks the most complete mammoth skeleton ever discovered in California. Scientists will study the bones to learn more about these creatures. ""This is important because it creates a record of the animals that wandered the area,"" scientist Mark Goodwin told
. ""They are an important part of California history.""

442,"The North Bridge at Minute Man National Park is where the ""shot heard 'round the world"" was fired and the Revolutionary War began.
Minute Man National Historical Park outside of Boston made history in 1775. It was the site where the Revolutionary War and America's battle for independence from British rule began.
Today, it is the site of a different kind of struggle. Heavy traffic and noisy jets from a nearby airport threaten the peace at this historic landmark.
This year, the National Trust for Historic Preservation added the park to its list of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in the United States. An
place is a site in danger of being destroyed. To protect the park, officials will try to stop the airport's growth.
Neglect and the development of roads and buildings are dangers for many historic sites. The trust works to
, or save, threatened historic treasures. It also helps raise money to support endangered historic sites.
More than 145 sites have appeared on the trust's list since 1988. All have been saved except one. Bridges, schools, hospitals, and even an airport
made this year's list. A terminal is a transportation station.
The TWA Terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York was designed by a famous architect and completed in 1962. Many people have traveled through it over the years. Now there are plans to knock it down to make way for a new building. Officials at the trust want to save the terminal.
""These places tell us who we are as a nation,"" said the president of the National Trust. He says that unless people become aware of the importance of these historic sites and take action to protect them, ""America's past won't have a future.""

18,"What is one of your worst nightmares about the school day? No recess!
For students in cities across the country, from Atlanta to Las Vegas, break time is over. Elementary-school children at the Clark County School District in Las Vegas recently said good-bye to recess.
Why has this Las Vegas district and many others eliminated, or
, recess? School officials say they want students to have more classroom time to learn. They also hope that more time in class will help students perform better on their standardized tests.
The students in Clark County have a 30-minute lunch period. They have to squeeze playground minutes into that half-hour block. They no longer get an additional 15- to 20-minute recess.
Many teachers, parents, and students disagree with the decision to ban recess. Education experts often say that recess is an important part of the school day.
Those experts say that the benefits of recess outweigh the lost class time. Recess gives students the opportunity to take a break, exercise, and socialize with their friends. At recess, many students learn how to cooperate and play with other students. In addition, some studies show a recess break can help improve test scores.
One fifth grader in Virginia told the
she looks forward to the daily break so she can return fresh to her schoolwork. ""I feel like I'm ready for anything that comes my way,"" she said.

327,"Watch out, Spider-Man. You may soon have company. The superhero's powers might someday become more than comic-book science fiction.
Researchers from England say that people may actually be able to scale walls and climb ceilings with gloves made of a special material. However, the researchers who came up with the material didn't get the idea from wall-crawling spiders.
Scientists are developing a sticky tape based on the hairs on a gecko's foot.
. Geckos are little lizards that use their sticky feet to cling to walls and ceilings. They can climb the most slippery glass surfaces and dangle from the ceiling with a single toe.
What's the secret behind their amazing grip? Geckos have millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of their feet. When a gecko comes in contact with a surface, the hairs create an electrical force that lets it cling to a wall or a ceiling.
""If human palms were covered by this [sticky] material, it would support the weight of an average human,"" said one scientist.
Scientists hope the material can be used with robots or in medicine. But they have a way to go before turning their idea into reality. The material is expensive, and it quickly loses its stickiness. Spider-Man would not be pleased to hear that!

518,"About 140 years ago, the Pony Express delivered mail to some parts of the United States. Today, mail is delivered to most communities by cars, trucks, trains, and planes. But in Supai, Arizona, mail carriers still deliver the mail the way carriers did 100 years ago--by mules.
About 600 Native Americans live in Supai. The town is located at the bottom of a canyon near the Grand Canyon.
Letter carrier Charlie Chamberlain loads packages on mules. The mules deliver mail to Supai, Arizona.
Before being delivered in Supai, mail arrives in the post office in Peach Springs, Arizona, about 70 miles from Supai. From Peach Springs, delivery trucks take the mail to the rim of the canyon. Letter carriers then use mules to carry the mail to Supai.
Letter carriers who deliver to Supai don't just carry letters and small packages; they deliver almost everything that goes to Supai.
""It's amazing what people can do when they put their minds to it,"" said Charlie Chamberlain, a letter carrier. ""They can pack things that you never would have thought of."" A washing machine is the most unusual item Charlie has delivered.

308,"No, the 'iceman' isn't a villain from the Batman movies. At 5,300 years old, he's the world's oldest known mummy. Scientists recently thawed him out.
The iceman, called tzi (OET-see), was found frozen in 1991 on a
in Italy. A glacier is a large body of ice that moves slowly. tzi is now stored in a museum in Italy in a room that is usually kept at 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
Scientists recently increased the temperature in the room to thaw the iceman. They took samples of bone, blood, and teeth from tzi.

645,"A new fashion trend has hit some public schools across the country. More schools are requiring students to wear uniforms or are enforcing stricter dress codes.
Students at Lakeside Elementary School in Cincinnati, Ohio, said good-bye to jeans, T-shirts, and oversized, baggy clothes this school year. Instead, they must wear tan, navy, or black pants and shirts with a collar. Girls are also allowed to wear jumpers or skirts.
The students in Ohio are not alone. From California to New York, an estimated 11 million public schools
, or require, dress codes for students.
Some people support the idea of dress codes. School officials say that dress codes often improve discipline and lessen teasing and bullying. Students focus on schoolwork instead of fashion.
""I like uniforms,"" Brittany, a student at Lakeside, told
. ""No one judges you, because you are wearing the same thing that they are.""
Some parents say that another benefit of wearing uniforms is that it saves money. They think uniforms are less expensive than designer clothes.
Not all people are in favor of dress codes. Some parents say that dress codes
, or go against, kids' freedom of expression. That right is guaranteed in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
These students do not have to follow a dress code.
Others argue that dress codes take away their kids' creativity by preventing them from choosing what to wear. Maggie, a student at Lakeside, told
that she doesn't like to wear a uniform, because ""all the outfits are the same.""
Some parents don't agree that buying uniforms is less expensive. They say it can be costly to purchase clothes to meet dress codes.

Scientists are piecing together clues to solve a puzzle about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. They're trying to determine whether a skull kept at a private location in Salzburg, Austria, belongs to the famous music composer. Austria is a country in Europe.
Mozart was born in Salzburg in 1756 and was buried in Vienna, Austria, in 1791. According to legend, sometime later a gravedigger took the skull, which eventually ended up in Salzburg.
Now scientists have opened a grave in Salzburg that they believe holds the remains of Mozart's father and other relatives. Researchers plan to conduct DNA tests on those remains.
DNA from humans contains information that scientists can use to determine whether people are related to each other. The skull could belong to Mozart if it matches the DNA of his father or other relatives.
Austria has officially declared 2006 the year of celebrations for Mozart. That country will
, or honor, the 250th anniversary of the composer's birth.

779,"Is Atlantis a myth? For centuries, people have wondered whether this legendary land really existed. A
is a made-up tale that is often accepted as truth. Now an American scientist claims he has discovered the remains of Atlantis on the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.
According to the age-old myth, Atlantis was a place of great wealth. The ancient kingdom gleamed with gold and silver and was a center for art and learning.
Over time, the people there became corrupt and greedy. As punishment, the gods unleashed powerful earthquakes and floods that swallowed up Atlantis and sank it to the ocean floor.
The only account of this legendary lost land comes from the long-ago writings of Plato. He was an ancient Greek writer who lived about 2,500 years ago. People don't know how much of Plato's text is factual, because he wrote about an event that had happened 9,000 years before his time.
Robert Sarmast, the American scientist behind the recent claim, performed sonar tests of the Mediterranean seafloor. Sonar tests use sound waves to find underwater objects.
Sarmast believes that he has found Atlantis in the Mediterranean Sea, between Syria and Cyprus.
Sarmast says his tests revealed human-made walls and structures that matched Plato's description. ""If you compare [my findings to Plato's description], you will be astonished,"" Sarmast told reporters. ""We hope that future expeditions will bring back physical proof.""
A scientist from Germany says the newly found ruins are underwater volcanoes that spewed mud, not the remains of Atlantis. Other scientists say the only location for Atlantis was Plato's imagination.
, or unsure, that the remains are those of Atlantis. Sarmast and his team are not the first researchers to believe that they have discovered the
, or sunken, land. Some of those explorers have placed it off Spain's coast, near Cuba, southwest of England, and in the South China Sea.
Plato wrote about Atlantis as an island in the western sea. Many people believe that location meant the Atlantic Ocean.
, or idea, is that the story of Atlantis refers to the ancient Minoan (mih-NOH-ehn) people. They lived on the islands of Crete and Thira, between Greece and Turkey.
Do you think Atlantis was real or a myth?
That civilization disappeared following volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Plato might have based his writings on that event. Even today, the mystery of Atlantis grows stronger and continues to

370,"During the summer, a strange brown goo fell from the sky onto buildings and people in several towns in Idaho. The sticky goo coated everything it fell on.
People splattered by the weird substance couldn't figure out what it was. Now, the state's Department of Environmental Quality has identified it.
The strange substance is not some weird goo from space. It is actually bee waste. The environmental workers found an unusually large number of beehives near the towns where the goo fell.
When the bees from those hives flew over the communities, they dropped the waste. Because it was a good year for bees, there was a lot of waste. Luckily, the bee goo is made mostly of pollen and is harmless.

414,"The waters in the San Francisco Bay, off the California coast, are cold, choppy, and infested with sharks. But that didnt stop 9-year-old Johnny Wilson from braving the waves. The fourth grader swam the 1.4 miles between Alcatraz Island and San Francisco in just less than two hours. He swam to raise money for Hurricane Katrina victims.
Although Johnny trained for three months, the water was colder and wavier than he had expected. Johnny made it to the shore by telling himself, ""Im almost there. Im almost there.""
His classmates were waiting on shore, cheering ""Go, Johnny! Go, Johnny!"" When he came out of the chilly water, his father hugged him and said, ""Can you believe it? You did it!""
Johnny successfully made the trek that Alcatraz prisoners had dared to cross years ago. Alcatraz Island housed a prison from 1934 to 1963. In 1962, three prisoners escaped by swimming across the bay. They were never heard from again, so it remains a mystery whether they made it through the frigid waters to land.
Johnny didnt only raise more than $30,000 for his swim. He also reportedly became the youngest person to swim the distance from Alcatraz to San Francisco.

669,"One morning in February, 75,000 kids woke up to find that they had become U.S. citizens. The kids, who were all adopted from other countries, became citizens because of the Child Citizenship Act.
The U.S. Congress passed the act last year. As a result, as of February 27,2001, the United States will grant citizenship to adopted kids who are under 18 years old and have one parent who is a citizen.
Every year, U.S. families adopt about 20,000 kids from foreign lands. Kids who were adopted from other countries were not considered U.S. citizens right away. Sometimes, they had to wait years before they could become citizens.
The Child Citizenship Act was written by Rep. William Delahunt. Years ago, he adopted a child, Kara, from Vietnam and knows firsthand how hard it can be for an adopted child to become a citizen. He hopes that the act will encourage more U.S. families to adopt kids from other lands.

69,"Winter is upon us, and that means snow in many parts of the country. Snow forms when water droplets in clouds freeze into ice crystals. Take a look at the five cities in the continental United States that average the most snowfall each year. Alaskas cities are not included because they would take over most of the list.Valdez, Alaska, tops the list as the snowiest city, with an average snowfall of 326 inches a year!

217,"An Iowa class heads into high-tech tests.
Every student in class has a remote control, and the kids are clicking away at the screen. But they aren't changing channels. They're taking a test! Terry Rex's fourth graders at Wings Park Elementary School in Oelwein, Iowa, are using a new kind of classroom technology. Instead of writing with pencils on exam papers, the students use remote controls to take tests.
""It's more fun,"" Courtney Ricchio, 9, told
""I don't have to write, and my hand doesn't get tired."" The remote controls are part of the Classroom Performance System (CPS). When students use CPS to take a test, the questions appear on an electronic screen. Students key in their answers on the remote-control response pad.
Rex is one of the first teachers in Iowa to use CPS. His students use the technology for more than taking tests. They also play learning games with the system. Sam Myott, 9, says his favorite CPS activity is a football game. ""It's a math game with multiplication and subtraction,"" he told
""Since it's on the computer, it's more fun than a worksheet on your desk.""
Some teachers think using CPS to grade a test is more
or a better use of time, than grading a written test. The computer keeps track of the students' answers and prints out their grades at the end of the day. The computer also reports which questions the class found most difficult to answer, so Rex can review them with the group.
Classrooms across the country are trying out new teaching gadgets.
Sixth graders Marina Gagliano and Kerry O'Conner of Wellwood Middle School in Fayetteville, New York, label parts of a microscope on an interactive whiteboard. The whiteboard allows students to use their fingers to click and tap answers on the projected image.
Fourth and fifth graders at Elton Hills Elementary School in Rochester, Minnesota, are on the move. Their classrooms have no chairs! Tiny desks hold high-tech gadgets, such as laptops and iPods, with different lessons. Researchers say this setup may be healthier for students than sitting at desks all day.

735,"Kids say things on the Internet that they would never say face-to-face
When 13-year-old Katie recently went online, she couldn't believe that some classmates were making fun of her. The seventh grader from New Jersey discovered mean and hurtful comments written about her in an online Web journal.
""It was really offensive and upsetting to me because I knew everyone could see it online,"" Katie told
. ""There was nothing I could do to take it down.""
Katie's story is not unusual. She is one of the many victims of
. ""Cyberbullying is when a child torments, humiliates, or tries to frighten another child using interactive technology,"" online safety expert Parry Aftab told
Instead of teasing or picking on kids in the school yard, bullies have new territorycyberspace. The explosion in technology, such as computers, cell phones, and interactive games, gives bullies more places to do their dirty work.
Cyberbullies use e-mail, instant messages, text messages, and online journals to spread nasty rumors, post embarrassing photos, and tease other kids. Breaking into others' e-mail accounts and sending out mean messages to their buddy lists is a common practice for cyberbullies. Cyberbullies also run up other kids' cell phone bills with text messages. Some kids have even conducted online votes for the ugliest person in class.
For many kids like Katie, online bullying has become part of everyday life. Most cyberbullies are between the ages of 9 and 14. Studies show that about 55 percent of kids in grades 4 through 8 have had mean or hurtful remarks made to them online. ""Cyberbullying is a huge problem in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades,"" said Aftab.
Why is cyberbullying such a growing problem? For starters, kids spend a lot of time online at both home and at school. Nearly two-thirds of American kids have computers in their homes, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Online experts say being mean online is easier because computers give kids a sense of being
, or not being known. Kids say things on the Internet that they would never say face-to-face.
Some kids also don't realize that they're cyberbullies because they don't see the consequences of their actions. ""In face-to-face communication, we see when we've gone too far,"" she says. ""We lose all those visual cues online.""
To address the problem, more schools and communities are educating kids about online etiquette and are holding anti-bullying seminars. Aftab trains groups, called TweenAngels and TeenAngels, to become safe and responsible cybercitizens who share their knowledge with others.
TeenAngel Kendall, 12, experienced cyberbullying when kids at school blocked him out of gaming sites. His advice for dealing with a cyberbully: ""Don't be afraid to tell your parents, teachers, or whomever you trust the most.""
, or fight, cyberbullying, is to take a stand against it. ""The only way cyberbullying will stop is if kids protect each other,"" says Aftab. ""If you stand by and let someone else hurt someone, you're part of the problem. You need to be part of the solution.""
Online safety experts offer the following tips to protect yourself from cyberbullying:
Don't give out your passwords or any private information to anyone, even close friends.
Don't post any information online that you don't want others to read.
Don't answer a mean or threatening e-mail, block the person who sent you the offensive message, and tell a trusted adult. That person can help you take action.
Don't react to a mean message. Walk away from the computer and do something else that you enjoy for a few minutes.
Run your name through search engines, such as Google, to check whether there is information that you don't want on the Internet. Some search engines let you set up alerts that send you an e-mail if a new posting includes your name.
How is face-to-face communication similar to or different from sending a message by e-mail or IM?

711,"Nearly a year ago, a volcano erupted more than 8,000 feet underwater. Today, researchers 500 miles off the coast of Mexico are getting a close look at the aftermath. The eruption covered 9 square miles of the ocean floor with hot liquid rock called
Scientists are studying how quickly deep-sea creatures come to live on the lava flow.

a submarine. They use cameras to take pictures and robotic arms to take samples.
The lava cooled within seconds of the eruption into

The eruption took place along the mid-ocean ridge, the most active volcanic region on Earth.
The crew made an amazing discovery! Chemicals from the vents attracted tiny organisms called bacteria.
Over time, scientists think that the bacteria will help tube worms grow in the area.
Later, crabs will come to feed on organisms, such as the tube worms, near the vents.
The dark zone of the ocean floor has no sunlight. The temperature there is almost freezing. Yet even after the eruption, living creatures are moving to this place to form a
(A food web links plants and animals that depend on each other for food.) Life is starting over.

281,"An American classic turns 50 this year--the Wiffle ball! In air, the round, hollow ball dips and curves, making it hard to hit.
The Wiffle ball's design, which has not changed since 1953, includes eight holes on one side. The idea was the brainchild of a Connecticut man who watched his 12-year-old son and a friend struggle to throw curve balls to each other.
""He decided he wanted to make a ball that would make it easier for us to pitch,"" the creator's son told
Early versions of the Wiffle ball included square holes and diamond-shaped holes. Neither of them worked.
That's how the Wiffle ball was born. Several years later, the plastic bat joined the ball.
How did the ball get its name? When you swing that plastic yellow bat and strike out, you whiff, said the creator's son.

212,"Sometimes its OK to play with your food. People created hundreds of sculptures from food cans and entered them in a yearly competition called Canstruction. The contest is held in dozens of cities across North America to help collect food for people who are
For their projects, teams can create anything they want as long as they do it with cans, bottles, and bags of food. Wire, string, and rubber bands are also allowed. Glue is forbidden.
Past sculptures that have made it into the winners circle include a hot dog, a castle, and sea creatures, such as an octopus and a shark. The number of cans used to build those structures ranged from 1,000 to 13,000.
Elementary school students in Tampa, Florida, recently built spooky sculptures with everything from cans of black beans to boxes of spaghetti. Eleven-yearold Ashley Weaver, who helped construct a haunted house, thought her project looked ""cool.""
Canstruction prizes are awarded to the sculpture with the most cans, the most creative sculpture, the best use of can labels, and the ""best meal""the tastiest combination of food.
Canstruction is about more than creativity, though. All the food used to make the sculptures is donated to shelters and food banks. To view the artwork, visitors have to bring canned goods as their admission fee. That food is also donated. Some food banks have helped feed evacuees from Hurricane Katrina. Last years contests raised more than 1 million pounds of canned goods.
""[Canstruction] is an opportunity to bring in much-needed food,"" says Burma Rai, the executive director of an Ohio food bank. Rais food bank recently received donations from a Canstruction event held in Dayton, Ohio.
The students in Florida understand the importance of helping people who need food. ""Youre helping someone get a can of food,"" Alexis Carrasco, 10, told reporters as she and her classmates worked on their sculpture. ""This is fun for us and helpful to them.""
To find out when a Canstruction event is coming to a city near you,
Although the United States is the richest country in the world, more than 37 million Americans live in poverty. That is more than the population of California, the most populous state. Many of those impoverished Americans are kids. About one in four American children is born poor. What else can be done to fight the poverty problem?

174,"Leapin' Lizards! It's TV's Favorite Croc Hunter!
Leaping from his rowboat, Australian crocodile hunter Steve Irwin lands on top of a fierce 12-foot-long crocodile. Covered with mud, Irwin wrestles with the reptile and finally ties up its snout and legs. The out-of-breath hunter then stands in front of the croc and declares, ""She's a beauty!""
Irwin is the star of the hit TV show
. In the United States, 60 million viewers see the wildlife show each week. The show is watched by people in 122 countries around the world.
Irwin, age 38, has been interested in animals and the environment since he was a child. He grew up in a wildlife park in Queensland, a state in Australia. For his sixth birthday, Irwin's parents gave him a 12-foot snake called a scrub python. At age 9, Irwin captured his first crocodile. Ten years ago, Irwin took over the park that his parents had started. Five years ago, his show aired on American TV for the first time.
is about more than wrestling crocodiles, snakes, and other wild animals, Irwin says. He explained that the show is also about making people aware of problems facing many animals.
""We don't run around capturing wildlife for the fun of it,"" Irwin said. ""Our love is to educate and share with the world threatened wildlife. We want to bring animals into your house so that we can share and learn about them.""
For example, Irwin was recently on the Australian island of Tasmania. Irwin was working with the World Wildlife Fund to rescue stranded whales. He wants to call attention to whale hunting in the South Pacific Ocean. ""This practice [whaling] has to stop,"" Irwin said.
Not everyone agrees that Irwin's show is good for animals or the environment.
Kent Vliet does not like ""the haphazard way in which [Irwin] handles snakes and gets bitten."" Vliet is a reptile expert who has worked for the National Geographic Society. Vliet fears that viewers might copy the croc hunter's dangerous moves and get hurt.
Instead of wrestling animals, Vliet said, Irwin should talk more about protecting endangered animals and the environment.
For now, the croc hunter said he will keep on wrestling crocs and snakes and bringing people up close with some of Earth's endangered animals. ""I will continue to put my life on the line to save wildlife,"" he said. ""This is my passion, and it won't stop.""

510,"There are cameras almost everywhere. They watch us in banks and in stores and when we're riding in cars. They watch us at concerts and at sporting events. On reality TV, video cameras follow celebrities and ordinary people as they go about their lives. Now cameras are even popping up in public schools.
Students in Biloxi, Mississippi, have found themselves under the watchful eye of Web cameras. Their school district is one of the first in the country to have cameras located in all public-school classrooms.
The school superintendent says that the use of cameras helps make sure students behave and prevents crime. The cameras, which don't record sound, are not open to public viewing.
Only the superintendent and school officials, such as principals, can watch.
Before watching the class on computers, officials are required to enter a password. Parents, teachers, and students would need court permission to watch.
Many teachers and students say they feel safer with cameras and are pleased to have them in the classrooms. Others say they don't feel the same way. They are concerned that Web cameras may interfere with teaching and distract students from learning. They also point out that the use of cameras is an invasion of privacy.

45,"Third grader David Bates won the Weekly Reader American Values contest. The U.S. Army and the Pentagon sponsored the contest. Nearly 14,000 kids in grades 3 through 6 entered the contest.
The contest asked kids to write an essay that answered this question: Which of seven American values-loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, or courage-is the most important in your daily life? Those seven American values are the core values of the U.S. Army.
David chose selfless service as the most important value in his life. David wrote that the other six values are part of selfless service. ""It is most important in my everyday life because it incorporates all the other values.""
David; his younger brother, Andrew; and his parents traveled from their home in Spanish Fork, Utah, to Washington, D.C., to get his prize. On November 11, they attended the Veterans Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery.

760,"It's no surprise that Wangari Maathai (wahn-GAHR-ee mah-TIE) planted a tree in her hometown in Kenya after learning that she won the Nobel Peace Prize. Kenya is a country located in East Africa.
Thanks to Maathai, many trees have taken root in Africa. Maathai was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize for saving forests and working for women's rights in Africa. She is the first African woman to win the prize. ""It's a really great surprise,"" Maathai said when she heard the good news.

In 1977, Wangari Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement.
Judges award the Nobel Peace Prize to a person or a group working for peace. Nobel Prizes are also given for achievements in science, medicine, and literature. Those prizes are presented on December 10 as well, but in Stockholm, Sweden.
Maathai has dedicated her life to helping the environment. In 1977, she founded the Green Belt Movement. This organization has helped plant more than 30 million trees across Africa, which has suffered from the loss of forests.
The judges awarded Maathai the prize for growing more than trees. They said she has planted the seeds of peace by making sure that people have natural resources so they don't fight over them.

684,"Polar bears reign as the kings of the Arctic. Yet there is trouble underfoot for those snow-colored creatures and other wildlife as their icy habitat slips away.
The Arctic is the icy, cold region located around the North Pole. In November, scientists from eight countries released a report saying that the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of Earth.
In the report, scientists predict that at least half of the summer sea ice in the Arctic will melt by the end of this century. The scientists blame
for the Arctic thaw. That is the gradual rise in Earth's temperature.
Arctic ice is melting at an alarming rate. Winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen between 4 and 7 degrees Fahrenheit. During the past 30 years, polar bears have lost more than 386,000 square miles of ice--an area larger than the states of Texas and Arizona combined.
More than 20,000 polar bears live in the Arctic regions. Disappearing sea ice threatens polar bears and other cold-weather animals. Polar bears use the ice as a bridge to hunt seals, their primary source of food.
As the sea ice disappears, the mighty
, or hunters, catch fewer seals and risk starvation. Seals also depend on the ice to rest and give birth. Scientists fear that polar bears, seals, and other animals that rely on the ice could be wiped out by the end of the century if the warm-up continues.
Some of the 4 million people who live in the Arctic have also found themselves on shaky ground. As the frozen land thaws, buildings and roads have weakened.
Inuits (IH-nyoo-wets), a group of native people in the region, fish and hunt Arctic animals, including polar bears. They depend on those animals as their main source of food. Inuit hunters are also falling through thinning ice.
Rising sea levels have forced some people in the Arctic to move their coastal villages inland. The report warns that melting ice could cause sea levels to continue to rise--up to 3 feet by the end of this century. Towns and cities along coastlines around the world could flood as a result.
The warm-up also affects other parts of the planet. Arctic ice and snow reflect heat from the sun into space. Without the ice and snow, the planet would be much warmer. ""The polar regions are essentially the Earth's air conditioner,"" said scientist Michael McCracken.
Who cranked up the thermostat on the Arctic? Scientists say human activity is to blame for global warming. People use
, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to power cars, heat homes, and create electricity.
Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Burning those fuels gives off gases that trap heat from the sun and add to the overheating of the Earth.
To protect life in the Arctic, scientists say people need to limit their use of fossil fuels. ""Climate change is not just about the future,"" said scientist Pal Prestud, who worked on the report. ""It is happening now.""
The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Those gases collect in a layer and trap heat from the sun. The layer of gases is like the windows in a greenhouse. The process is called the
Too much of those gases in the air causes temperatures to rise. That is known as
What are some ways people can reduce their need for fossil fuels?

429,"The $10 bill is the latest in the series to get a new design.
The $10 bill is getting a new look! To outsmart counterfeiters, the U.S. government is rolling out a newly redesigned $10 bill that has splashes of red, yellow, and orange.
are people who try to make fake bills that look like the real ones. Counterfeiting is a crime.
""The new $10 note design continues the U.S. government's efforts to make our currency safer, smarter, and more secure,"" says Dawn Haley of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which produces all U.S. paper money.
The $10 bill is the latest in the series to get a new design. The $50 bill was updated last year, and the $20 bill was given a makeover in 2003.
There are several colorful changes on the new bill. A red image of the Statue of Liberty's torch appears next to the portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the treasury. On the portrait's other side is the phrase ""We the People,"" also in bright red ink. The background is light orange, and small yellow 10s surround the torch. A new ink makes the numeral 10 in one of the corners change color from copper to green when the bill is tilted.
But don't expect to find the new $10 note in your wallet just yet. In January 2006, the U.S. government will begin to circulate the new bills. The government plans to redesign the currency every seven to 10 years to stay ahead of counterfeiters.

157,"Five years after 9/11, New York City rebuilds.
On September 11, 2001, two airplanes slammed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Terrorists had hijacked the planes. After the fiery crash, the New York City skyscrapers tumbled to the ground. More than 2,700 people died on that historic day.
Now, five years later, a building is set to rise from the ashes. Builders in New York City recently presented a new design for the Freedom Tower. When completed, the tower is likely to be the tallest building in the United States.

727,"As Ellen MacArthur crossed the finish line of the Vendee Globe race, she sailed right into the history books. MacArthur, aboard her sailboat called
set two world's records in the around-the-world race.
The Vendee Globe is one of the world's toughest sailing races. Sailors must race nonstop around the world. And if that were not hard enough, all sailors must sail
Ellen MacArthur, a 24-year-old Englishwoman, finished second in the 2000 Vendee Globe. She sailed about 31,000 miles in 94 days, 4 hours, 25 minutes, 40 seconds. MacArthur finished only one day after the winner, Frenchman Michel Desjoyeaux.
Despite finishing in second place, MacArthur made good enough time to win two titles--the fastest woman and the youngest person ever to finish a solo around-the-world race.
During the Vendee Globe voyage, MacArthur had to make repairs to her boat without losing time. She averaged ten naps a day, sleeping a total of just six hours a day. Once she awoke just in time to steer away from a giant iceberg looming 50 feet in front of her!
Those difficulties were nothing compared to the one MacArthur said she faced at the finish line. ""My life is here, home is on board
I just adore being at sea, and to suddenly stop this will not be easy at all,"" she said.

or clean, the air. They take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. People could not survive if the air had too much carbon dioxide or too little oxygen. The trees are also being planted because they add beauty to city neighborhoods and provide shade.
Arbor Day traces its roots to Nebraska. In 1872, J. Sterling Morton started the holiday in that state because Nebraska was almost treeless. Today, National Arbor Day is celebrated each year on the last Friday in April. This year, it takes place on April 27. Many states, however, celebrate Arbor Day on different dates based on their best tree-planting times. The holiday encourages people to plant and care for trees.

115,"Got chocolate milk? Students in Berkeley, California, dont! Some schools in that city recently banned the sale of flavored milk.
Other schools around the country are considering re-moo-ving the sweet stuff from their cafeterias too. Some officials say it isnt healthy for kids to drink flavored milk every day. One glass of chocolate milk can have as much sugar as a soft drink, experts say.
Some people are against the ban, though. They say flavored milk has ingredients that are
or good, for kids. Nancy Rice agrees. She is the president of the School Nutrition Association. That group gives schools ideas for healthy student lunches.
Some kids just wont drink white milk, Rice told

166,"The results are in! At the beginning of the school year, we asked kids: How much weight are you carrying in your backpack? More than 2,000 kids responded to our online poll.
Carrying packs that are too heavy may cause injury. Doctors say most third graders' packs should weigh no more than 8 pounds. The good news is that most of you are following that advice. More than 1,300 kids replied that they carry 8 pounds or less.
Still, some kids are very overloaded. Of the kids polled, 465 told us they lugged around more than 12 pounds! If that is true for you, it may be time to clean out your backpack and lighten up!

194,"Which invention could you not live without? That was a question Americans were recently asked in a survey. The survey gave five choices: the computer, car, cell phone, microwave, and toothbrush. Believe it or not, the toothbrush came in first!
The toothbrush is both the simplest and oldest invention on the list. According to the American Dental Association, the first toothbrush was invented in 1498. A Chinese emperor made it out of hog bristles and bone.

439,"Thats not a koala earring. The colored tag in Yellows ear helps scientists tell her apart from the other koalas on St. Bees.
Koalas are pictured everywhere in Australiafrom boxes of chocolate to sports team jerseys. Yet the animals live only in small areas along the east coast.
The koalas were once widespread on the east coast. However, farmers cut down many of the forests where koalas lived. Hunters also killed the animals for their fur.
I recently joined Bill Ellis and his team in a forest on St. Bees Island. Ellis is a scientist who studies koalas. He and other scientists hope that studying koalas on the island will teach them how to protect koalas elsewhere in Australia.
We spotted a koala named Abby in a blue gum tree. The blue gum is a
or type, of eucalyptus (yoo-kuh-LIP-tuhss) tree. The leaves of eucalyptus trees are the main food source for koalas.
Whenever we find a koala, we collect information about the trees in the area. We measure how tall and how fat the trees are. Then we put tags on their trunks, so we know theyve been recorded.
We also capture and tag the koalas. Before releasing them back into the wild, we give them a health checkup.
Ellis wonders if the St. Bees koalas are headed for hard times. The island is filled with wild goats, which may be eating small blue gum trees. Ellis hopes more research will help him understand how to protect the blue gumsand the koalas that depend on them.
 Volunteers shake a tree branch on which a koala named Yellow sits. Yellow falls onto a plastic sheet and is placed into a sack.
 Volunteers hold Yellow in the sack. They adjust a radio collar around the koalas neck.
 The colored tag on Yellows ear helps scientists tell that koala apart from others on St. Bees Island.
What are some ways that people might protect koalas?

How much of the movie is special effects?
Theres a lot of stuff that ... they made with the computer, like a giant octopus that comes to life. ... The monkey was real because it slapped me for real, and it hurt!

294,"Michaela Teague, 8, recently played tic-tactoe in a whole new way. She took part in the game onstage at Pine Grove Elementary School in Parkville, Md.
These kids are having fun onstageand learning math!
We were asked math questions, the third grader told
. If we got them right, we chose a letter, an
Michaelas school was taking part in a program called Arithmetickles. The program teaches students that math can be fun. The name is based on the words
. Arithmetickles performers visit schools to put on shows.
Students go onstage and participate in games and
, or performances. They learn math skills such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. In the game Seven Boo, kids take turns counting to 50. They cant say certain numbers, such as the number seven. Instead, they have to shout Boo!
Sandra Bendor cocreated Arithmetickles. She says the program helps kids learn to like math. Numbers can tell great stories, she told

327,"Talk about a toy that sticks around! The National Toy Hall of Fame recently added a surprising playthinga stick!
Other toys to join the Hall of Fame this past fall include the skateboard and the baby doll. The toys are kept at the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, N.Y.
The twiggy toy holds many playtime possibilities. [It] can be used ... to draw in the sand on a beach or [used as] a magic wand, says Chris Bensch. He is the museums
. A curator is a person in charge of a place where things are on display.
Plus, kids dont have to save money to get their hands on a stick. The best toy is often a plaything thats free [and] easy to get, Bensch says.

330,"Heres a fun holiday gift! Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are back in
. Actor and singer Jesse McCartney, 22, does the voice of Theodore.
student reporter Arin Soileau interviewed McCartney about the movie, which comes out December 25.
. Theodore ... was actually my favorite. Hes easy to like. Hes very friendly.
How long did it take you to make the movie?
It takes ... about six to eight weeks to record all the voices, but it takes the
[or people who draw the scenes] up to two years to animate all of the cartoons.
What advice do you have for kids interested in movie or music careers?
It is one of those things that ... doesnt happen overnight. You have to put a lot of time into it. Its an amazing experience. Its also a lot of hard work.

304,"One of the worlds oldest birds may not be a bird after all!

He is a dinosaur expert. Both animals had long arms and feathers.

300,"The 2004 Summer Olympics are almost here! The Summer Games occur every four years. This year, they will take place August 13-29. Athletes from nearly 200 countries will compete in 28 sports. Swimming, tennis, basketball, and gymnastics are among those sports.
This year, the Olympics are heading home to the place where they first began--Greece. That is a country in Europe. The first Olympic Games were held in Greece about 2,780 years ago. The modern Olympics began there in 1896.
That year, only 13 countries competed in nine sports.
To kick off the Olympics, a special event called the Torch Relay takes place. The relay started in Greece on March 25 with the lighting of the Olympic flame. The flame is a symbol of competition, friendship, and peace.
During the relay, thousands of runners carry the Olympic flame around the world. The flame is passed from torch to torch.
It will travel around Greece for seven days. Runners will then take the flame around the world for 35 days. During that time, the flame will journey across six continents and 27 countries.
On July 9, the flame will return to Greece. Runners will carry it around the country until August 13, when they will light the flame at the Olympic stadium.

317,"New Jersey is set to have the strictest school nutrition laws in the country. The state passed a
in January to ban the sale of junk foods in elementary and middle schools. A bill is a proposed law.
The law goes into effect in September. As part of the ban, candy and sodas are not allowed to be sold. Elementary schools can sell only milk, water, or 100 percent fruit and vegetable juice. The bill also limits how much fat and sugar can be in foods served to students.
Why the strict laws? Poor nutrition habits have caused many kids in the United States to become overweight. That can lead to health problems. The purpose of the new bill is to help students make better nutrition choices.
Besides eating right, how else can you keep your body healthy?

254,"Scientists in Greenland are going ducky over their latest experiment. Theyre using toy ducks to study ice! Greenland is a large island in Europe. It is near the North Pole.
The scientists recently set loose 90 rubber ducks in the Jakobshavn (yah-cuhb-SAH-ven) Glacier on Greenland. A glacier is a large sheet of ice that moves slowly over land. Scientists dropped the ducks into tunnels in the glacier called
Melting ice on the glacier flows into the moulins. Some experts say
is causing the ice to melt. Global warming is the slow rise of Earths temperature.
Where the water ends up is a mystery. Thats where the ducks come in. Scientists have labeled the toys with an e-mail address. They hope fishing crews will find the ducks and contact them. That will help scientists learn where the melting water travels.
Scientist Alberto Behar is waiting to hear some of the duck tales.

469,"Scientists hope that an allergy-free peanut will one day replace the common peanut.
Many kids love peanut butter. Americans eat millions of pounds of it each year. But not all kids can enjoy this food. For some, peanuts can be harmful. About 100 people, mostly kids, die each year from peanut allergies.
A peanut allergy is one type of food allergy. A food allergy is when the body has a strong reaction to a certain food. Eleven-year-old Chris Conetta is allergic to peanuts. If he eats peanuts, he gets very sick. ""My face and my tongue swell up, and I can't breathe,"" he said.
Kids like Chris can have an allergic reaction from eating just a tiny amount of peanuts or a food made with peanut oil. Even smelling or touching peanuts can make some kids sick.
About 7 million Americans have food allergies. These eight foods are the cause of most food allergies:
tree nuts (such as walnuts and cashews)
Help may soon be on the way for kids with peanut allergies. A team of scientists tested 300 kinds of peanuts. They recently found one that is special. It is missing one of two major allergens. An allergen is something that causes an allergic reaction.
The peanut hunt is not over yet. Now scientists are looking for a peanut missing the other allergen. Once they find it, they will try to create an allergy-free peanut.
Scientists hope an allergy-free peanut will one day replace the more common peanut. That would make kids with peanut allergies very happy. ""Chris always has to be careful of everything he eats,"" said his mom. ""If he didn't have to do that, it would be wonderful!"" Chris agrees. ""I could have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I miss them.""

723,"Fifty years ago this month, four African American college students took a stand by sitting down. They tried to order food at a store lunch counter that served only white people. Workers at the store in Greensboro, North Carolina, wouldnt take the students orders. At that time, many restaurants in the South refused to serve black people.
Students sit for their rights at a lunch counter in North Carolina.
The students decided to keep coming back to the store until people of any color could eat there. Their
caught on. A protest is a public stand against something that people disagree with. Thousands of people started similar protests in other states.
The students actions worked. A few months later on July 26, 1960, the stores lunch counter opened to all people. The protest also helped pave the way for a new law in 1964. That law said businesses had to serve people of all races.
Skip Alston says its important to remember what the students achieved. He is the cofounder of the International Civil Rights Center & Museum in Greensboro. They proved that you can do whatever you set your mind to do, he says.

165,"Astronauts are adding rooms to a lab in space.
Life in space is about to get a little spacier! The
is getting a makeover. The station is a lab in space where astronauts live and work.
Astronauts are adding two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a mini kitchen. The new parts were delivered by the space shuttle
. Before this, the space station had only three bedrooms and one bathroom. Astronauts have been building the space station since 1998.
delivered new parts to the International Space Station.
The new rooms will allow more astronauts to live at the space station at the same time. Having more astronauts in space could help scientists gather new information about space more quickly.
, or right now, only three astronauts can stay on the space station. Officials hope six astronauts will be able to live there at the same time by May or June.
also brought technology to the space station. A new system will turn the astronauts urine into drinking water. That might sound gross, but
, or reusing, the liquid will make sure the space station has water. Right now, water is rocketed to the space station from Earth.
Astronaut Christopher Ferguson says the same technology could be used on Earth one day. Were going to need to have these technologies in place, and this is a great way to get started.
Why do astronauts float in space? There is no
. That is a force that pulls your body toward Earth. Heres how astronauts eat, sleep, and exercise on the space station.
Astronauts put their feet in special holders to help them stay seated at the table. Food containers stick to trays with Velcro.
Astronauts can sleep standing up! Their sleeping bags are attached to the space stations walls. They strap themselves in for naps.
Astronauts stay in shape by exercising for up to two hours every day. They strap themselves to exercise bikes and treadmills.

519,"This discovery will knock your socks off! Scientists recently found footprints that are more than a million years old.
The footprints are in Kenya. That is a country in Africa. An early human
, or relative from the past, may have made the prints. The feet that made the prints had rounded heels and big toes that point forward, just like people have today.
U.S. scientist John Harris helped discover the special prints. He and his team found four sets of adult footprints in the area. They also found tracks of animals such as lions.
The footprints could teach people a lot about what Earth was like a million years ago. Figuring that out is like a giant jigsaw puzzle, Harris told reporters.

273,"Nicole the shark set a world record for her swim distance and speed.
A great white shark named Nicole has taken a bite out of the record books. She swam farther than any other known sharkmore than 12,400 miles!
Great whites are endangered. They are often hunted for their teeth and fins.
The great white shark swam from South Africa to Australia and back within nine months. That is also the fastest
of any ocean animal. When an animal migrates, it moves from one region to another.
The map shows Nicoles route between South Africa and Australia.
Nicole was one of 25 great whites that scientists tagged in 2003. The tags record information such as time and speed. Scientists are using what they learn to find ways to protect these endangered animals.
""Its clear that we have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg; there is still much to learn,"" says lead researcher Ramn Bonfil.

45,"Scientists used the satellite to count different types of animals at the Bronx Zoo.
As the tallest animals in the world, giraffes have a great view of the zoo. Scientists recently had an even better view--from 280 miles above Earth! Animals at the Bronx Zoo in New York City were tracked from outer space with a
. A satellite is a spacecraft that orbits a planet or moon.
of zoo animals and sent the images back to Earth. A species is a group of plants or animals that are alike in certain ways. Scientists studied the images to see how well the satellite could spot different species.
The Bronx Zoo is located in New York City.
So far, scientists are pleased with the results. They hope to use the satellite to track
animals in faraway places in the wild. Endangered animals are at risk of becoming
, or dying out completely. Currently, people track animals either by foot or by airplane. Scientists think that using a satellite to track animals will be both easier and cheaper.
""Taking a count is the first step in finding out if a species is in danger of extinction,"" scientist Scott Bergen told
Along with counting endangered animals, scientists want to learn where they
. When animals migrate, they move from one place to another.
Why do scientists want to learn where animals migrate? ""[We want to know where to] create national parks and other protected areas for endangered animals,"" said Bergen.

266,"Colin Carlson may be young, but hes got a big message: Save energy to save the world.
The 12-year-old from Coventry, Conn., runs the Cool Coventry Club. The club teaches people how to
, or save, energy. More than 600 families have joined Colins club. The student recently won a Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes for his work.
Each member of the Cool Coventry Club has to promise to use less energy in at least three ways. The changes can help people save money and Earth at the same time, Colin says.
Turn off the light when you leave a room. Turn off the water when youre brushing your teeth, Colin told

313,"Finding a bug in your dinner is usually a bad thingunless you like your meals hot!
Scientists in Bolivia recently figured out that bugs help make some chili peppers spicy. Bolivia is a country in South America.

459,"Do your pets fight like cats and dogs? You may be surprised to learn that these animals are often furry friends.

37,"New species are taking over the Great Lakes.
The Great Lakes have a great big problem. Theyre under attack! Odd creatures from faraway places are moving in and taking over.
. Invasive species are animals or plants that get moved to a new place and harm the people, animals, or plants that live there.
Zebra mussels in the Great Lakes block pipes that people depend on for water. Sea lampreys kill the lakes fish. Those and other invasive species are putting the areas 3,500 types of
plants and animals in danger. Something that is native has always lived in that part of the world.
Even more trouble is on the way, scientists say. U.S. researchers recently found 28 species in the lakes that could become
That worries scientist Vic Serveiss, who helped with the research. Invasive species ... compete for the same food ... as the native species, he told
. Many times [they] are more successful ... than the native species.
Some invasive species enter the lakes on ships from other places. Some ships carry water in tanks for balance. That water is called
. When the ships arrive at the Great Lakes, they dump the ballast water. Any species in that water end up in the lakes.
Its important to stop new invasive species from entering, says Tim Eder of the Great Lakes Commission. That group helps protect the lakes. Were trying to get Congress to pass new laws to require ships ... to clean [their] tanks before they release water into the lakes, he says.

The Great Lakes make up the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world. They cover more than 94,000 square miles.
More than 40 million people rely on the lakes for water. About 350 species of fish live in the lakes.
Lake Ontario is the smallest of the Great Lakes. It is about one-fourth the size of Lake Superior, the largest lake.

604,"Author Angela Johnson takes readers on a journey in her new book,
She writes about the Tuskegee Airmen. They were the first African American pilots in the U.S. military. The group learned to fly airplanes in Tuskegee, Alabama. The Tuskegee Airmen served during World War II (19391945). They
or guided, U.S. fighter planes during the war.
Johnson says the story of the Tuskegee Airmen can encourage people to follow their dreams. ""There will always be people who want to keep you from doing something,"" she told

416,"Nine-year-old Aubrie LeClair of Connecticut is often busy at her computer. Like a lot of kids today, she uses the computer to type her schoolwork and learn new things.
By third grade, many kids know how to type on a keyboard. That has some handwriting experts worried. They are afraid that computers will replace cursive writing in the future.
""[The kids have] good handwriting now, and they love cursive,"" said one teacher from California. ""But it wouldn't surprise me if they just walked around with their little keyboards and typed everything a few years from now.""
Third grade is the year when most kids learn how to write in cursive. However, many kids like Aubrie say they would rather type than write in cursive. ""Computers are better. [They don't] make my hand cramp up as much,"" said Aubrie.
No one knows what will become of cursive writing. In the meantime, keep practicing. For the time being, it seems that cursive is sticking around.

706,"U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson's job is out of this world! This fall, Whitson became the first woman to lead the International Space Station. She will be there for six months. The space station is being built 220 miles above Earth. Whitson's job is to oversee the construction. She will also help run science experiments on the giant space lab.
astronauts are men. NASA is the U.S. space agency. Between 1978 and 2004, fewer than one in five NASA astronauts were women.
""I think it's special that I get the opportunity to play that role,"" Whitson says. ""But I think it's also special to have an opportunity to [show] how many other women also work at NASA.""
One of those women is Pamela A. Melroy. She recently flew the space shuttle
to the space station. The visit marked the first time two female commanders were in space at the same time.
, or build, the space station. Melroy and her
crew delivered a part named Harmony. Harmony is a hallway that will connect different parts of the space station.
Sixteen countries, including the United States, are working on the space station. Once the lab is finished, it will be about the size of a five-bedroom house. The space station should be finished in 2010.
In 1983, Sally Ride set a record. She became the first American woman to travel in space. Ride traveled aboard the space shuttle
. The shuttle took off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Today, Ride is in charge of her own company. The company encourages girls to
, or work toward, careers in science, math, and technology.

689,"Some projects take longer than others. The Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota is one of them. Workers started carving the giant rock sculpture in 1948. They are still working on it today.
The memorial honors Chief Crazy Horse. Native American leaders chose to honor him because he was one of their heroes. Chief Crazy Horse was a Native American who fought for his people's right to their land and traditions.
When will the sculpture be finished? No one knows for sure. All that matters is that it's going forward, said the project manager.

509,"More and more kids are using their heads. A recent study found that 73 out of every 100 kids wore a helmet while riding a bike. The bad news is that most of the kids did not wear the helmet the right way.
A helmet protects your head and brain if you fall. To work, the helmet must fit and be worn correctly. The helmet should rest on your head and cover your forehead. Helmet straps should always be tight. If the helmet is too loose, it wont protect your head. In-line skaters and skateboard riders should listen up too! Helmets are not just for biking.

260,"Kenzie Chabino is reaching her goal one greeting card at a time.
Kenzie Chabino gives a homemade card to a woman.
The student from Tulsa, Oklahoma, recently started a group. It is called Kenzies Cause. The group makes homemade cards for
So far, Kenzie, 13, and kids from 28 Oklahoma elementary schools have created 120,000 cards. And Kenzie is just getting started! She wants to make 1 million greeting cards.
The cards may include drawings of flowers or dinosaurs. Inside are special notes. Some say Have a great day! Kenzie explains.
Most of the cards are handed out through Meals on Wheels. That is a program that gives food to people in need. Sometimes Kenzie takes the cards to people herself.

739,"Two eyes peer through the thick leaves and branches of a tree. The eyes belong to a 400-pound lowland gorilla that lives in Africa's Congo Basin. That is home to the second-largest rain forest in the world.
The world's entire population of lowland gorillas live in the Congo Basin. Those creatures are among many species of endangered animals living in the rain forest.
The gorilla is one of the endangered animals living in the Congo Basin.
Scientists warn that more than half of the forest could disappear within 50 years. Some people illegally cut down trees and hunt wildlife to sell as meat. Many rain forest animals, like the lowland gorilla, are endangered because of illegal hunting.
Gorillas are plant eaters. They also like to eat insects, such as termites and ants. An adult male eats about 40 pounds of food each day!
Young gorillas love to play. They learn new skills by imitating adult gorillas.
Each gorilla has a unique nose print. Scientists can identify a gorilla by the shape of its nose.
Help is on the way for the rain forest and the animals that live there. The presidents of 10 African countries recently signed a
, or agreement, to protect the rain forest.
""The treaty is important because it shows that the governments are committed to protecting the Congo Basin,"" World Wildlife Fund (WWF) scientist Richard Carroll told
The WWF is a group that protects endangered animals and habitats. The WWF is helping Africa's governments stop illegal hunting and set up parks and protected areas for animals. ""This gives us a great opportunity to save the forest,"" said Carroll.

335,"Asian elephants are running out of space and time. Their
or the place where they usually live, has been shrinking. Scientists warn that Asian elephants could disappear if nothing is done to help them.
In Asia, humans and elephants are fighting over land. The forests where many elephants live are being cut down by loggers. The land that elephants live on is also being turned into farms. Many elephants have been killed when they cross into farms looking for food.
Scientists say the fight for land between elephants and humans is hurting both sides. Elephants kill around 300 people each year in India. In the last ten years, the elephant population in Vietnam has dropped from about 2,000 to fewer than 100.
Scientists for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) say there are about 35,000 to 50,000 Asian elephants left in the wild. That is a
or drop, from the 100,000 Asian elephants that were in the wild in 1900.
The map shows Asian countries. Elephants in these countries, scientists warn, are in danger of becoming extinct, or dying out.

Most males have tusks. If present, female tusks are small.
The WWF is an organization that works to save endangered animals. According to a recent WWF report, many Asian elephants are being killed for their meat, skin, and ivory tusks.
Elizabeth Kemf, a WWF scientist, says that world governments should set aside land for Asian elephants. Efforts to save the Asian elephants are important, she says, because the elephants belong ""not only to Asia, but all the world's people.""
More people live in Asia than on any other continent. How might that affect the Asian elephant population?

118,"Companies are pulling the plug on unhealthy food ads for kids.
No more cookies or candy for SpongeBob SquarePants. Dora the Explorer is also going on a diet. Recently, some companies decided to stop using cartoon characters to advertise unhealthy foods and drinks to children. This includes television commercials.
Nickelodeon will stop showing characters on junk-food packages by 2009. Starting next year, Kellogg's, McDonald's, and Kraft Foods will not advertise unhealthy products to children under 12.
According to doctors, kids see 40,000 television ads per year. About half of them are food ads. Many of them are for sugary cereals and unhealthy snacks. Health experts and parents say these ads make kids want to eat junk food more often.
""It's putting our children at risk,"" says scientist Ellen Wartella.
Obesity is the condition of being very overweight. Experts say one-third of American children are obese or at risk for becoming obese.
Currently, there are no laws that control how food companies advertise to children. This means it's up to the companies to decide how to advertise.
Josephine Thomas is a parent. She is glad that some companies are changing their use of cartoon characters in advertisements. ""As soon as [my kids] see a Shrek or Mickey Mouse [food product], they automatically look at that and they don't see what they really need,"" she says.
Yes, according to scientists at the University of Liverpool in Europe. Recently, they studied 60 children of various weights. The kids, ages 9 to 11, were shown several food and toy ads on television. Children at a healthy weight ate 84 percent more food after watching the food commercials than after watching the toy commercials. Obese kids ate 134 percent more food.

332,"Nicole Thompson and her third-grade social studies students at Greenbriar Academy in North Carolina wanted to learn about world geography. So late last year, they sent an e-mail message to 100 people.
Readers were asked to send the e-mail message to people in other places. Readers were also asked to write something about themselves as well.
About six weeks later, Thompson and her students received more than 60,000 e-mail replies! Messages came from every state in the United States and from 120 countries.
According to Thompson, the students' favorite response was written by a carpenter at McMurdo Station in Antarctica. ""It was a huge deal. We didn't think we would hear from Antarctica!"" Thompson said.

614,"Do bats hold the answer to better-flying aircraft?
Batman, have you heard? A new kind of ""batmobile"" is in the works!
Scientists in Rhode Island are studying how bats fly. The United States Air Force is funding the $6 million project. It hopes the mammals will offer clues about how to design better-flying aircraft. Mammals are warm-blooded animals that feed their babies milk.
Bats can fly in ways that birds and airplanes can't. The animals' wings have more than 24 joints. The joints allow them to
, or control, their wings while flying. Bats can stretch and bend their wings. This helps them fly higher and faster. Scientist Sharon Swartz says bats' control of their wings is similar to humans' control of their hands. ""Bats are the only flying animals whose wings are really just like human hands,"" she told
Swartz and the other scientists will study about 20 species of bats over the next five years. They are using real bats, high-tech cameras, and wind tunnels in their research. The team hopes to find out why bats can turn sharply without falling. If airplanes could do that, they could
, or move, in tight spaces. They could also fly in more dangerous conditions. The Air Force also hopes to learn how weight affects bat flight. Bats can carry up to 50 percent of their weight while flying. If aircraft designers knew bats' secrets, they could design airplanes that could carry more weight.
Swartz says there is still a lot more to learn about the animals. ""We expect to be studying bats long into the future,"" she says.
It's going to be a hair-raising Halloween for Little Rock Zoo in Arkansas. Three vampire bats were born there recently. Vampire bats are the only type of bat that drinks the blood of other animals. They do this to survive, but don't worry! Vampire bats are usually friendly with people. Of the more than 1,000 bat species, only three are vampire bats. They live mostly in Mexico and Central and South America.
How can studying animals help people improve technology?

247,"Puppets will soon be popping up on the big screen! In
, Jason Segel plays Gary, a man who tries to
the Muppets to save their old theater. To reunite is to bring back together. Segel also wrote the movie, which hits theaters November 23.
student reporter Elliott Hansing recently spoke with Segel about making
Amy Adams and Jason Segel team up with the Muppets.
Elliott Hansing: Which Muppet is your favorite?
I like Fozzie Bear the best because even though he tells bad jokes, he keeps on trying.
EH: What was the hardest part of filming?
The hardest part ... was not laughing all the time. ... Those Muppets are so funny that I kept breaking character and laughing during scenes.
EH: Did anything unexpected happen while you were making the movie?

610,"We live in a jam-packed world. In fact, more people live here than ever before. The population recently hit a whopping 6.5 billion! The big news was reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.
The number of people on the planet has doubled since 1960. And that number continues to grow. As you can see from the graph, experts estimate that six years from now, Earth will be home to about 7 billion people. That is not surprising when you consider that 261 people are born each minute.

700,"California has the bluesblue butterflies, that is! Scientists in the state recently released 80 Palos Verdes blue butterflies into the wild.
The experts raised the fliers because the insects are endangered. They can live only in a small area of California. That area is called the Palos Verdes
A peninsula is a stretch of land that is bordered by water on three sides.
The butterflies lay their eggs on two types of plants found on the peninsula. However, those plants have been harmed by people moving into the area.
To save the butterflies, scientists grow the insects favorite plants in parks around the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Then they release the insects into those areas each spring.

186,"Should Native American names and mascots be allowed in college sports?
Football fans cheer as a student rides a horse down the field. The student is dressed as Chief Osceola, a famous leader of the Seminole tribe. In one hand, the student holds a flaming spear. As he throws it into the ground, the crowd goes wild.
Some find Florida State University's mascot doesn't respect the real Chief Osceola.
That tradition takes place before every football game at Florida State University (FSU). The NCAA recently tried to end the tradition. The NCAA is the group that oversees college sports. It made a rule that sports teams can't use Native American names or
after the regular season. A mascot is a symbol that represents a sports team.
Some members of the Seminole tribe think the rule is unfair. They believe that FSU honors their traditions. Tribe members designed the mascot's costume, they say. They add that the student chosen as the mascot has to study the tribe's culture to earn that honor.
The NCAA decided to let FSU keep its tradition. However, the rule remains for at least 17 other schools.
Native Americans are the people who first settled in North and South America. Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today. Each tribe has its own history and culture.
Other Native Americans say that teams that use Native American mascots do not honor their culture. They think using those mascots supports
A stereotype is an idea that a group of people is alike in a certain way. It may be untrue or only partly true.
""It is not respectful to parade around in war paint and feathers,"" John Sanchez told
. Sanchez is a member of the Yaqui/Apache tribe. ""This is not honoring; it is making fun of.""

282,"Third grader David Bates won the Weekly Reader American Values Contest. Nearly 14,000 students in grades 3 through 6 entered the contest.
To enter, kids had to write an essay on which American value is most important in daily life. David chose to write about selfless service. He wrote, ""It is most important in my everyday life because it incorporates all the other values.""

With the help of a special camera, scientists recently met unusual creatures. They saw a squid with crooked eyes. They also met the scary-looking viperfish. It has teeth like ice picks!
Scientists uncovered hundreds of underwater species. A species is a type of plant or animal. The discoveries were made in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. That is a
, or underwater, mountain range. It is beneath the Atlantic Ocean.
The Mid-Atlantic Ridge has not been explored much. Scientists often search waters closer to land. The scientists sent vehicles into the water. The vehicles searched waters up to two miles deep. They included cameras that took pictures of the animals. The cameras found that the ridge has a high level of
, or variety of plants and animals in an environment.

559,"Can you imagine a week without your favorite television shows? Kids across the country will give it a try during TV-Turnoff Week. It takes place from April 24 to April 30.
The TV-Turnoff Network came up with the idea so kids would take part in other activities, such as reading and playing sports. ""Turning off the television allows children to see the real world,"" Robert Kesten, the groups executive director, told
On average, each American watches more than four hours of television per day, says the TV-Turnoff Network. In fact, kids spend more time in front of the television (1,023 hours per year) than in school (900 hours per year)!

315,"Imagine that you had to play video games for homework. Does that sound too good to be true? At Prairie View Elementary in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that is exactly what is happening. Prairie View is not alone. More than 4,000 schools across the country are assigning video-game homework!
These are not ordinary video games, however. They are special educational games made for schools. At Prairie View, students borrow the games to take home. The school lends video-game systems to any student who does not already own one.
The games teach students reading, language arts, and math skills. ""[The video games] are about having fun and learning,"" said third grader Hannah Stevens. ""I'm learning to do more math than I used to and more language arts.""
Laurene Lanich, the principal at Prairie View, says students enjoy playing the video games. ""It's high interest for kids. It's very similar to typical children's video games. They can get to different levels,"" she said.
Video-game homework also helps the home-school connection, says Lanich. ""It's an opportunity for children and parents to do something together that focuses on learning.""
Mark Ganzeveld, a third-grade teacher at Prairie View, says the best thing about the games is simple: ""It helps [students] see that learning can be fun.""
Educational video games are just one way to help kids learn.

652,"Say good-bye to French fries and hello to fresh fruit. The U.S. Congress is considering new rules to make school lunches healthier.
, or lawmakers, plan to discuss the Child Nutrition Act this fall. That law, passed in 1966, requires schools to make sure lunches have enough healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables.
Health experts say Congress may chew on changes to the law. For example, legislators may ask schools to serve only low-fat milk and to use less salt in lunches.
Some schools are already on the right track. Many have traded in hot dogs for baked chicken tenders. Others serve whole-wheat bread.

373,"Artist Cynthia Vose believes that hats tell a story. Women have worn different hats throughout history. In honor of Womens History Month, Vose organized an art exhibit about hats. The exhibit is taking place this month at a library in Billerica, Massachusetts.
""Beyond fashion, hats represent the changing roles of women in society.""
In the 1800s, many American women wore bonnets. As women gained rights, they no longer wore hats just for fashion. Women began to wear hats for jobs that were once held by men.

11,"A purple octopus is making a splash! It is one of 11
or types, of sea creatures scientists recently found near Canada. That is a country north of the United States. Experts say the animals may be new to science.
Researchers discovered the creatures in the Atlantic Ocean. In addition to the purple octopus, scientists found a sea star and many types of coral and sea sponges.
We found all kinds of beautiful creatures, Ellen Kenchington told
She is one of the scientists who helped find the animals.
Researchers didnt explore the ocean alone, however. An underwater robot gave them a hand. The robot can search areas of the sea that are too deep for people to visit, explains Kenchington.
She and her team are studying their findings. They want to learn more about the oceans plants and animals. Every time we discover a new species, we learn something new about our planet, she says.

Most people would not get excited about finding an old toothbrush lying around. But what if that brush was more than 250 years old? That's right! Scientists recently dug up a toothbrush that old!
The brush was discovered in Germany. Experts think it dates to about 1750. That could make it the oldest toothbrush found in Europe.
The brush is so old that its bristles have rotted away. Its 4-inch handle is made of animal bone. One end of the handle was carved into a tiny spoon. Scientists believe the spoon was used to clean out the owner's ears.
Many people may think a toothbrush that old is a great find, but dentists might disagree. They recommend getting a new one every three to four months.

359,"Two robots are rolling around Mars. The robots are called rovers. They were sent to Mars in 2004. The U.S. space agency, NASA, sent them there. NASA recently said the rovers will work on Mars for at least two more years.
What are the rovers doing on Mars? They are there to explore the planet and do science experiments. The rovers have been studying the soil and rocks.
People are now learning more about Mars because of the rovers. ""The rovers are amazing machines,"" says NASA spokesperson Alan Stern.

520,"Healthy foods are good for you! They help your body grow. They also give you energy to work and play.
How do you know which foods to eat? Follow the food pyramid. Use it to make good choices. Choose more foods from groups on the pyramid with wider stripes.
The grains group gives you energy. Make sure at least half the grains you eat are whole grains. Eat brown rice, oatmeal, and popcorn. Try whole-wheat bread instead of white bread.
Color your plate with all kinds of veggies. They help your heart, eyes, skin, and teeth. Experts say to eat a rainbow of colors. Each color helps the body in a different way. Munch on carrots, corn, and broccoli.
The meat and bean group is high in protein. That helps build strong muscles. Eat fish, chicken, lima beans, and nuts.
Fruits are natures treats. They are sweet and tasty. They help your heart, eyes, skin, and teeth too. Eat a variety of colors. Try an apple or a banana. You can also mix pieces of different fruits to make a salad.
Have milk and foods made with milk. Those foods are high in calcium. Calcium builds strong bones. Foods made with milk can be high in fat. Try low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese.
Your body needs only a little oil to keep it healthy. Some foods that have oils are nuts, tuna fish, and salad dressing.
The child climbing the food pyramid is a reminder to exercise. Why might exercise be important?

439,"Last November, doctors operated on a clouded leopard named Joe. Joe had not been eating and had trouble walking. A disease was causing fluid to press on Joe's brain. This disease can also happen to cats, dogs, and humans. A two-hour operation saved Joe's life.
Joe is special because he is an endangered species. He is one of only a few hundred clouded leopards in the world.
Joe lives in Texas at the Fort Worth Zoo. He is often taken out of the zoo to visit people at schools and churches. A

12,"Smile! New studies show that people who have healthy teeth and gums also have healthy hearts. Thats why brushing and flossing your teeth is so important. It removes the bacteria that can cause problems in other places in your body, says Dr. Sally Cram. She is a spokesperson for the American Dental Association.
Here are some ways you can keep your teeth and gums healthy:
 Brush your teeth twice a day with toothpaste. Replace your toothbrush every three to four months.
 Floss gently once a day. Dental floss is thread that cleans between your teeth.
 Visit a dentist twice a year. Your dentist will clean your teeth and make sure they are healthy.
 Eat foods that are good for you. Those foods include fresh fruits and vegetables.

580,"Astronauts travel into space on a space shuttle. Most space trips take about ten days. During that time, astronauts work, eat, sleep, and have fun. Many things in the space shuttle are different than they are on Earth.
Eating in space can be hard because everything floats. Juice poured into a cup will float away and crumbs can get into air vents. So astronauts drink and eat in special ways. Astronauts drink with special straws and pouches. The pouch closes around the straw so juice doesn't leak out. Astronauts eat foods that don't make crumbs, like tortillas instead of bread.
On Earth, people usually sleep in beds. But most astronauts sleep in sleeping bags. The sleeping bags are in little cubbies. That way, a sleeping astronaut won't lose his or her pillow or float into something!
Astronauts have to work hard in space. Astronauts make sure that the space shuttle is in good condition. They clean air vents and check the engines and computers. The astronauts also do research and tests. Their work helps people learn about space.
A space shuttle does not have much room inside. But astronauts can still have fun. Astronauts like to watch Earth from the windows. They also like to use exercise bikes or float around the shuttle together.
What would you do for fun while in space?

468,"An American Leader: The Story of Martin Luther King Jr.
Martin Luther King Jr. lived from 1929 to 1968. He worked to help all people be treated fairly. Each January, we honor his work with a holiday.
During the 1950s and 1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. worked to stop the unfair treatment of African American people. Some of those people were treated differently than white people were. African Americans had to use separate bathrooms and sit in the backseats of buses.
King lived in Montgomery, Alabama, when he started working for fairness. Recently, his house was fixed up to look exactly the way it did when he lived there. Visitors learn about King when they tour the house.
Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech in Washington, D.C. in 1963.
In 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. gave his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. He spoke in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. He told people that he dreamed that everyone would have
. Equal rights make sure that everyone is treated fairly and equally.
Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a national holiday in the United States. On this day, people honor Martin Luther King Jr. Children around the country learn about his work. They remember King in different ways, including making signs for parades and treating others nicely.
Rosa Parks seated on a Montgomery bus.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of an important event in history. In 1955, an African American woman named Rosa Parks was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama, for not giving up her bus seat to a white man. Rosa Parks's courage inspired many people, including King, to change that law and work for equal rights.
Today, people can visit the bus that Rosa Parks made famous. It looks like it did in the 1950s. Now it is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan.

496,"Kids in New York City may soon get a new place to play. People who
or plan, playgrounds have invented a new kind of park. They hope to build it in New York. The park would have mazes, ramps, and tools for kids. Experts say that foam blocks, balls, carts, and pulleys would help kids learn while they play. People called ""play workers"" would help kids use the park equipment safely.

563,"It took 100,000 people about 20 years to build the Great Pyramid.
It is made of more than 2 million blocks of stone.
Most of the blocks weigh about 6,000 pounds each!
Workers poured water onto the logs so the blocks would roll more easily.
The Earth has many mysteries, or things that are not known or explained. People use science to try to understand those mysteries.
The pyramids are giant tombs, or graves, for Egyptian kings. Pyramids are made of huge stone blocks. Experts know that the Egyptians didn't have the same tools that we have today. So, how were those heavy blocks moved and lifted? Some experts believe that the Egyptians pushed and pulled them into place.
1. Workers cut and shaped the stone into blocks.
2. The workers floated the blocks down the Nile River on big barges.
3. The workers rolled the blocks over logs from the river to the pyramid.
4. The workers built dirt ramps so the blocks could be rolled to the top of the pyramid.
5. Workers carefully fit the stone blocks into place on the pyramid.
No one knows for sure what the dinosaurs looked like. Some experts think that dinosaur skin might have looked and felt like the scaly skin of reptiles today.
Experts study how animals today use skin color to survive. Some animals, like the chameleon, can change skin color in order to hide. Experts also say that other animals, like poison arrow frogs, have brightly colored skin to keep away their enemies.
It is likely that dinosaurs also used skin color to survive, say experts. For example, some experts say that Stegosaurus's plates might have changed color and size to scare its enemies.

The Wright brothers invented the first airplane in December 1903. That makes 2003 the 100th anniversary! Before the airplane was invented, most people traveled by cars, boats, and trains. Today, airplanes help people travel faster. How do airplanes help you?
Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876. Before the telephone was invented, people kept in touch by writing letters or talking in person. Today, the telephone makes it easier for people to talk to one another. How do telephones help you?
The first four-wheeled gas-powered car was invented by Karl Benz in 1891. Before people had cars, they couldn't travel easily. They walked or rode horses for short trips. They took trains or boats for long trips. Today, cars are one of the main ways people travel. How do cars help you?
What are some other inventions that have changed our world?
People worked for years to make the first computer. It was built in 1946. The first computer was called ENIAC. Today, computers are an important part of many people's lives. People use computers as tools to write, get information, and much more. How do computers help you?

. Put on your sea legs and join Christopher Columbus and his crew on their journey across the Atlantic Ocean.
Christopher Columbus and his crew started their trip in Spain. They had three ships: The
. Columbus and his crew were looking for a shortcut to Asia to buy gold and spices.
The trip was long. Many of the sailors thought they were lost. They were running out of food. Some of the sailors wanted to turn around. Columbus said they must be close to land because he saw birds flying in the distance.
Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division (reproduction number LC-USZ62-1784)
In late October 1492, Columbus landed on an island near the United States.
Many of the sailors were scared and tired. They knew they were lost. Columbus told his crew that they would turn around if they didn't see land soon. Thankfully, one of the ctrew members spotted land the next day!
Columbus did not find a shortcut to Asia. Instead, he landed on an island near what is now the United States. Columbus called it San Salvador. People called the Taino (TIGH-noh) lived there. The Taino lived in straw huts and fished from canoes.

293,"The Bowler family of England took a trip back in time last year. The Bowlers moved into a house that did not have electricity or a telephone. The Bowlers lived for three months as a family would live in the year 1900.
The family even had to wear clothes from the year 1900. The clothes were not comfortable. The girls wore long dresses that they often tripped on.
For fun, the Bowlers played card games. They also built a puppet theater and put on puppet shows.
TV cameras took pictures while the Bowlers lived in the old house. Those pictures were made into a TV program called
These are just a few of the rules the Bowlers had to follow while living in the 1900 house:
All meals had to be cooked using recipes from 1900. They seldom ate eggs or bananas because they were expensive.
The family had to use toothbrushes from 1900. They were made of pig and horse hair.

. A tomb is a special building for the dead. The 4,300-year-old tomb is located in Egypt, a country in Africa.

388,"Just where the mighty Amazon, a river located in South America, starts had been a mystery. But a team of explorers has found the answer.
The team says the Amazon begins on a mountain named Nevado Mismi. The mountain is in the country of Peru and is 18,363 feet high. It is part of the Andes mountain range.

349,"November 11 is Veterans Day. On that holiday, Americans honor U.S. veterans. Veterans are men and women who have served in the military for our country.
Many cities will hold events to honor veterans. The oldest and largest celebration is held in Birmingham, Alabama, each year. Veterans from all over the country attend. Events include an awards dinner and a parade. We want to thank our veterans for their service, says event planner Bill Voigt.

399,"For kids in parts of Africa, it is also a way to get clean water to their communities. How? The merry-go-rounds pump water out of the ground. They are called PlayPump water systems.
Kids in Africa play on a PlayPump merry-go-round. It pumps clean water out of the ground.
People need clean water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, and bathing. Many people around the world do not have clean water. In some parts of Africa, women and girls have to walk miles to get clean water.
People are raising money now for more PlayPump systems. By 2010, they hope to have 4,000 PlayPumps in Africa.

381,"Stay safe while having a super summer.
Grab your beach towel and sunglasses! Summer is just around the corner. It starts on June 21. For most kids, that means more time to play outside. Experts say that more injuries occur during summer. Follow these tips to make sure you have a safe summer.
Many kids will spend hours playing outside in the summer sun. Be careful, though. The suns rays can be harmful. They can cause damage to your skin and eyes.
If you are out in the sun, be sure to wear sunscreen. Experts say it should have a
(SPF) of 30 or higher. The SPF number lets you know how much the sunscreen protects your skin from the sun. Make sure you rub it in everywhere your skin is showing.
You should also wear a hat and sunglasses. They protect against the suns harmful rays. Better yet, play in the shade!
What is one way to beat the heat? Splash in a pool! Just be sure to follow water-safety rules. Always swim with a grown-up watching you. You should also swim with a buddy. A buddy can tell others if someone needs help. If you dont know how to swim, stay in the
end. Something that is shallow is not deep.
Biking and in-line skating are great ways to get exercise. To stay wheel safe, always wear a helmet. It protects your head and brain if you fall. If you are in-line skating, also wear wrist guards, elbow pads, and kneepads.
What other ways can you stay safe this summer?

16,"More animals live in cold waters near the South Pole than people once thought. Scientists recently found more than 1,000 types of ocean animals around a group of Antarctic islands! Until now, most people believed cold waters didnt contain as much life as warmer waters.
A diver studies ocean animals near the cold South Pole.
How did scientists make the discovery? They wore scuba gear and dived into the freezing waters. They also used nets to catch marine animals nearly a mile down in the water. This is the first time scientists have managed to make a list of all the animal types living at a place near the South Pole, says scientist David Barnes.

348,"Thanksgiving is a time for people to give thanks. Many people eat turkey on Thanksgiving. Long ago, the Pilgrims and Native Americans gave thanks.
How might Native Americans give thanks today?
Thanksgiving is about more than the food.
Joseph Bruchac (JB) is a Native American writer and storyteller.
asked him to share his thoughts about Thanksgiving.
My family gathers for a big meal. We say a few words in our native language of Abenaki around the table to express our thanks.
What does Thanksgiving mean to Native Americans?
Native people give thanks for all things. Different groups have many thanksgiving festivals during the year.
Native Americans were one of the first to have a fall harvest festival. Squanto and other Native Americans taught the Pilgrims how to survive in a new land. The Pilgrims shared their first harvest with the Native Americans.
In 1620, the Pilgrims landed in what is now Massachusetts. Squanto showed the Pilgrims which crops to grow, such as corn, beans, and squash. He showed them which animals to hunt and where to fish.

395,"Christopher Columbus was an explorer. Explorers travel to places to learn more about them. Columbus sailed the ocean on a ship called the Santa Maria. Look inside to learn about his travels.
Columbus lived long, long ago. People had to go to faraway places to get spices and gold. Those trips were long and hard. Columbus wanted to find a shorter way to get to those lands. He had an idea to cross the ocean. He found people to help pay for his trip. Look at the map above to see where Columbus first sailed.
Columbus and his crew left Spain in August 1492. They sailed on three ships, called the
. The trip was long and stormy. Just when the crew was ready to give up, they saw land!
Columbus didn't find a shorter way to those faraway lands. Instead, he landed on an island near what is now the United States. He named the island San Salvador.
Columbus began to explore that island. He met people who already lived there. They were called the Taino (TIGH-noh). Later, Columbus left the island. He continued to explore other places. After some time, he returned to Spain.
Why might Columbus's trip have made him famous?

566,"April 22 is Earth Day. That is a day for people to take action and help Earth. This year, Earth Day is 40 years old. To celebrate, 40 events will take place in cities around the world. The events were the idea of Earth Day Network. That group is trying to get more people to take care of Earth.
The main event is going to be held in Washington, D.C. People can go there to learn more about ways to help Earth, says Sean Miller. He is the education director at Earth Day Network.

164,"What do takeout pizza and toys have in common? Justin Lewis and Matthew Balick invented toys they call Flip-Its out of
. A pizza saver is the white piece of plastic used to keep cheese off the takeout box.
