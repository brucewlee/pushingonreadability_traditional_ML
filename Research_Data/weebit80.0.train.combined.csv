1,293,"The Bowler family of England took a trip back in time last year. The Bowlers moved into a house that did not have electricity or a telephone. The Bowlers lived for three months as a family would live in the year 1900.
The family even had to wear clothes from the year 1900. The clothes were not comfortable. The girls wore long dresses that they often tripped on.
For fun, the Bowlers played card games. They also built a puppet theater and put on puppet shows.
TV cameras took pictures while the Bowlers lived in the old house. Those pictures were made into a TV program called
These are just a few of the rules the Bowlers had to follow while living in the 1900 house:
All meals had to be cooked using recipes from 1900. They seldom ate eggs or bananas because they were expensive.
The family had to use toothbrushes from 1900. They were made of pig and horse hair.

What else can you do to protect your hearing?

3,340,"Scientists recently studied black bears in Alaska. The bears hibernated for about six months. During that time, the bears breathing slowed down. Their heartbeats slowed too.
What barely changed? The bears body temperature! It dropped only a few degrees. That surprised scientists. Most animals that hibernate have a large drop in temperature.
As body temperature drops, the body slows down and uses less energy. It was surprising that hibernating bears were able to save so much energy without a large drop in body temperature, says Oivind Toien. He is the scientist who led the study.

11,620,"The United States government recently said it will clean up the Everglades. The Everglades are
in southern Florida. A wetland is an area of wet and spongy soil. Both pollution and construction have hurt the Everglades. A new law will now clean up and protect the Everglades. Over the next 36 years, the government will spend $8 billion to clean up pollution in the Everglades.
 The Everglades take up about 2,344 square miles. That's about the size of Delaware.
 The Everglades are the only place in the world where both crocodiles and alligators live.
 Other animals that live in the Everglades are snakes, turtles, birds, fish, deer, and the rare Florida panther.

13,63,"Mount Rushmore is a mountain in South Dakota. The faces of four U.S. presidents are carved on it. Now a special model is being made of Mount Rushmore.
What will make the model so special? It will be shown on a computer in 3-D! That makes pictures look more like the real object, instead of looking flat.
People are making the 3-D model for an important reason. If Mount Rushmore is ever damaged, it will need to be fixed. The 3-D model will show people what the carving looked like.
Mount Rushmore shows the faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Each face is as tall as a six-story building!
A landmark is a building or place that is special to an area. Americans want to make sure that Mount Rushmore will be here for a long time.
Why might people want to protect famous landmarks?

14,462,"The sound of drums fills the air. People start to sing and dance. A
has begun. A powwow is a festival. It celebrates Native American life.
People sing songs in Native American languages. Some of the songs are old. Other songs are new. People sing to the beat of a drum. Dancers move to the beat. The drum is an important part of the powwow.
Dancers wear special clothes at a powwow. The clothes are made by hand. As the dancers get older, they add pieces to the clothes. Some of the pieces are gifts from family and friends.
People sell arts and crafts at some powwows. The artists make each item by hand. The arts and crafts often include beadwork, baskets, and pottery.
Fry bread is often found at powwows. The bread is sometimes used to make special tacos. People put meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and hot peppers on top of the bread. Then they roll it up and eat it.
Is it important to learn about Native American life? Why or why not?

15,127,"Scientists have never seen a living giant squid. They want to learn more about this huge animal that lives deep in the ocean.
Scientists believe giant squids live about a mile down in the ocean. They live in the coldest, darkest part of the ocean.
Recently, scientists traveled in submarines to look for the giant squid. Even with the light from the submarine, they could not see the huge giant squid.
The sperm whale is the giant squid's only enemy. Scientists attached video cameras to the heads of some sperm whales with suction cups. They hoped the cameras would take pictures of giant squids swimming. The cameras filmed other types of squids, but not the giant squid. For now, the giant squid remains a mystery.
What Does a Giant Squid Look Like?
A giant squid has eight arms and two
. A tentacle is like an arm, except it is much longer.
A giant squid can be 60 feet long and weigh 1,000 pounds.
A giant squid has huge eyes, as big as a kid's head.
A giant squid has a beak that looks somewhat like a parrot's beak.
Debra Ingrao works at Mote Marine Laboratory in Florida. Last year, Debra flew to New Zealand to bring back a dead giant squid to study. She talked to
I love the ocean and want to learn more about the sea animals living in it.
What do you love most about your job?
I enjoy studying sea animals in their natural habitats. [A
is the place where an animal lives.]
Why is studying the giant squid important?
Everything we learn helps us understand the deep sea better.
Should we be afraid of the giant squid?
Its large size is scary! But giant squids don't live where people swim.
What does a giant squid's skin feel like?
The skin is very smooth and a bit slimy.
Do you want to go on a search for a living giant squid in the future?
If I got to go on a search, it would be my wildest dream come true!

19,492,"A new study shows that hibernating animals are less likely to die out. Why? Earths weather has been changing over time. Scientists say animals that sleep or hide are able to
the changes better. To survive is to stay alive.
Animals that sleep or hide are protected from nature, says scientist Bill Toone. That helps them survive.
A chipmunk hibernates during the cold days of winter.
Snakes will often hibernate next to one another to stay warm.

20,446,"Students recently planted trees in Brechtel Park. It is in New Orleans, Louisiana. The park lost thousands of trees in 2005. A big hurricane hit the area then. Its name was Hurricane Katrina.
The students worked hard. They raised money to buy the trees. How? They sold T-shirts and had an art fair. The group planted about 100 trees.
The event was a great success, says Brad Philipson. He is a teacher at Metairie Park Country Day School. One day, these kids will come back and see how the trees have grown.

22,214,"2008 is the Chinese Year of the Rat.
February 7 is Chinese New Year! The celebration lasts 15 days. Each Chinese year is named after one of 12 animals. This is the Year of the Rat.
People prepare for the holiday before the actual day. They clean their homes and decorate them with flowers and poems. The poems are happy messages of good luck. People also put out bowls of tangerines, oranges, dried fruits, and candy to wish visitors a sweet new year.
On the first night of the celebration, families and friends gather for a special meal. Many people wear new red clothing. They eat foods such as dumplings, fish, and long noodles. Sweet, sticky rice cakes are a favorite treat.
The Chinese New Year celebration ends with the Lantern Festival. It includes music, dancing, and fireworks. Kids carry lanterns in a parade under the light of a full moon. The highlight of the parade is the dragon dance. Dancers carry a long dragon made of silk, paper, and bamboo through the streets. The dragon may stretch more than 100 feet!

26,546,"About 47 million American kids went back to school in September. Some live in cities that do not have big enough schools for all the kids. Some of those cities do not have space or money to build new schools.

29,37,"Have you ever wondered how snow forms? Bits of frozen water called
form in the air when it is very cold. Many ice crystals make a snowflake. A group of snowflakes creates a snowfall.
Before a snowflake reaches the ground, it goes through four steps.
1. Each snowflake begins as water droplets inside a cloud in the sky.
2. When the temperature freezes, the water droplets turn into ice crystals.
Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division.
3. As more water sticks to the ice crystal, it begins to change shape.
4. When many ice crystals stick together, snowflakes form and fall to the ground.
The shape of a snowflake depends on the temperature at which ice crystals form. These crystals bump into each other and stick together. That creates new shapes of snowflakes.
Snowflakes are usually less than half an inch across.
The largest snowflake ever measured was bigger than a childs hand!
Snow only looks white. It is actually clear.
No two snowflakes are exactly the same.
Can you name two things that look alike but are not exactly the same?

32,400,"Many kids love listening to music on their MP3 players. However, portable music players may not be good for the ears. Health experts say the music players may lead to hearing loss. Why? They send loud sounds straight into the ears. Hearing loss is also more likely if you listen to loud music for hours at a time.
Experts say kids need to give their ears a rest. They warn that at least 12 out of 100 children are at risk of losing some of their hearing.
How do you know if your music is too loud? If you are wearing your earphones, you should be able to hear someone talking to you from a few feet away.
You can also ask friends if they can hear the music from your earphones. If they say yes, turn it down!

About 4? million people in the United States are Native American. They live in cities and towns across the country. Some Native Americans live on
A reservation is land set aside for Native Americans by the U.S. government.
Native Americans belong to more than 500 different groups. Each group has its own traditions.
How does Jody Naranjo make her pottery? She digs three different clays out of the ground and mixes them together. ""That makes a very strong clay,"" says Naranjo. She uses the coil method to make the pots. ""It's like rolling snakes out of clay and joining them,"" she says. Then she rubs the pots with a stone to make them shiny. She puts the pots over a fire to make them hard. Afterward, she carves designs into them.

38,393,"Casey Martin is a professional golfer. But Martin has a disease that makes walking painful for him. So he would like to ride in a golf cart between shots during golf games.
Members of the Professional Golf Association (PGA) think it would be unfair to let Martin ride in a cart. They say that part of the competition in a golf match is walking the golf course. Some matches last four days, and players walk about 25 miles.
Now the U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether Martin can use a golf cart. The Supreme Court is the most important court in the United States. In January, the justices of the Court listened to what Martin and the PGA had to say about using the golf cart. The Court plans to make a decision by July.

40,96,"Do you wear headgear when you play soccer? Some parents think you should. That is because many kids use their heads to hit soccer balls. This is called ""heading.""
Some doctors say that heading can hurt your brain. A group of parents has made special helmets and headbands to protect kids' heads. A middle school in Wisconsin is having its soccer team wear the special headgear while playing soccer.
Soccer coaches give these tips for safely heading a ball:
Keep your eyes open and on the ball.
Head the ball with your forehead, which is the thickest part of your skull.
Be careful not to let the ball hit your face.

47,370,"Schools across the country are trying to protect kids from getting hurt by heavy backpacks. Researchers say heavy backpacks can hurt kids' backs and cause kids to fall down.
Some schools are giving students two sets of textbooks. Students keep one set in school, and they leave the other set at home. That way, kids don't have to carry books back and forth every day.
Experts say that a kid who weighs 60 pounds should carry a backpack that weighs 9 pounds or less. If a kid weighs 70 pounds, his or her pack should weigh no more than 12 pounds.

53,16,"More animals live in cold waters near the South Pole than people once thought. Scientists recently found more than 1,000 types of ocean animals around a group of Antarctic islands! Until now, most people believed cold waters didnt contain as much life as warmer waters.
A diver studies ocean animals near the cold South Pole.
How did scientists make the discovery? They wore scuba gear and dived into the freezing waters. They also used nets to catch marine animals nearly a mile down in the water. This is the first time scientists have managed to make a list of all the animal types living at a place near the South Pole, says scientist David Barnes.
Why might it be useful for scientists to know which types of ocean animals live near the South Pole?

54,355,"Good news for the bald eagle! The bird was recently taken off the U.S. endangered species list. That is a list of animals and plants that are in danger of dying out.
""It's exciting that the bald eagle is back and so healthy. It is a beautiful bird and the symbol of our nation,"" says Martha Nudel. She is a spokesperson for the National Wildlife Refuge System. ""We know that we're protecting the planet in a way that is helping bald eagles and hundreds of other birds.""
Bald eagles were in danger because many of them had been killed by hunters. They were also harmed by a chemical called DDT. It had been used to kill insects on farms until 1972.
In 1963, only 417 nesting pairs of bald eagles were left in the continental United States. That included all of the states except Hawaii and Alaska. Today, there are nearly 10,000 pairs.
Though bald eagles are no longer on the endangered species list, they are still protected. Killing a bald eagle is

The bald eagle is a symbol of our country. It was chosen as our national bird in 1782. Read about some other U.S. symbols.

58,595,"How do stinkbugs and burrower bugs send messages? They use plants like telephone lines! That is what a new study shows. The insects drum on leaves and stems. They also shake their bodies. That makes the plants vibrate. Other insects hear the vibrations.
To do the study, scientists watched 21 species of stinkbugs and burrower bugs. The scientists measured the tiny vibrations using a laser. They learned that different species have their own vibration patterns. Males and females of the same species have different patterns too.

59,87,"Rain forests are in trouble. They are disappearing. For many years, people have been cutting down trees to make room for farms and roads.
Many groups are working to save rain forests. The forests are home to half the worlds plant and animal
, or types. Many of those species are in danger of dying out.
We have lost almost all of our worlds tropical rain forests, says Ashley Schaeffer. She is a spokesperson for the Rainforest Action Network. That group is working to protect rain forests. Unless we take action now, they will all be gone, she says. We are working with large companies to get them to stop cutting down trees.
Farmers have destroyed a large area of this tropical rain forest.
Should people protect rain forests? Why or why not?

60,381,"Stay safe while having a super summer.
Grab your beach towel and sunglasses! Summer is just around the corner. It starts on June 21. For most kids, that means more time to play outside. Experts say that more injuries occur during summer. Follow these tips to make sure you have a safe summer.
Many kids will spend hours playing outside in the summer sun. Be careful, though. The suns rays can be harmful. They can cause damage to your skin and eyes.
If you are out in the sun, be sure to wear sunscreen. Experts say it should have a
(SPF) of 30 or higher. The SPF number lets you know how much the sunscreen protects your skin from the sun. Make sure you rub it in everywhere your skin is showing.
You should also wear a hat and sunglasses. They protect against the suns harmful rays. Better yet, play in the shade!
What is one way to beat the heat? Splash in a pool! Just be sure to follow water-safety rules. Always swim with a grown-up watching you. You should also swim with a buddy. A buddy can tell others if someone needs help. If you dont know how to swim, stay in the
end. Something that is shallow is not deep.
Biking and in-line skating are great ways to get exercise. To stay wheel safe, always wear a helmet. It protects your head and brain if you fall. If you are in-line skating, also wear wrist guards, elbow pads, and kneepads.
What other ways can you stay safe this summer?

62,545,"Tagging horseshoe crabs increases our understanding of their migration, survival, and abundance.
The horseshoe crab population in the United States is going down. Scientists say that too many horseshoe crabs are being caught by fishermen. Fishermen use horseshoe crabs to catch fish.
Scientists fear that many animals will be endangered if there are too few horseshoe crabs. Many animals eat horseshoe crabs.
To help the horseshoe crab, the government has made a rule saying how many crabs each state can catch. States must not catch more than that number. Scientists say the rule may mean there will be more horseshoe crabs soon.

are buildings or places that are well-known. They are symbols of our country. Lets explore some of them!
The Statue of Liberty is in New York, New York. It is located on Liberty Island. People can visit the statue by taking a
to the island. A ferry is a boat used to carry passengers.
The statue was a gift of friendship from the people of France. It was shipped to the United States in 350 pieces. The statue was rebuilt. It was completed in 1886.
The Gateway Arch is in St. Louis, Missouri. It was completed in 1965. The arch is 630 feet tall. Visitors can ride a
to the top. A tram is a car that travels on overhead cables.
The arch was built to look like a
or entrance, to the West. It honors American
who traveled west across the United States long ago. Pioneers are people who are among the first to settle in new places.
The Golden Gate Bridge is in San Francisco, California. It opened in 1937. It is a suspension bridge. That means the roadway hangs from cables. The cables are connected to towers. People can cross the bridge by car, by bicycle, or on foot.
The bridge is almost 9,000 feet long It crosses the Golden Gate Strait. A
is a narrow channel of water that connects two large bodies of water.
The Liberty Bell is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was made in 1753. The bell weighs about 2,000 pounds. It was rung to call people together for special events and announcements.
Soon after the bell was made, it cracked. People tried to fix the bell, but it cracked again. The bell has not been rung since then. It now hangs in a museum. Many people visit the bell to see the crack that made it famous.
If you were asked to create a new landmark for our country, what would it be? Why?

65,348,"Thanksgiving is a time for people to give thanks. Many people eat turkey on Thanksgiving. Long ago, the Pilgrims and Native Americans gave thanks.
How might Native Americans give thanks today?
Thanksgiving is about more than the food.
Joseph Bruchac (JB) is a Native American writer and storyteller.
asked him to share his thoughts about Thanksgiving.
My family gathers for a big meal. We say a few words in our native language of Abenaki around the table to express our thanks.
What does Thanksgiving mean to Native Americans?
Native people give thanks for all things. Different groups have many thanksgiving festivals during the year.
Native Americans were one of the first to have a fall harvest festival. Squanto and other Native Americans taught the Pilgrims how to survive in a new land. The Pilgrims shared their first harvest with the Native Americans.
In 1620, the Pilgrims landed in what is now Massachusetts. Squanto showed the Pilgrims which crops to grow, such as corn, beans, and squash. He showed them which animals to hunt and where to fish.
A harvest is a gathering of food that has been grown. They shared their food at a feast with Squanto and other Native Americans.

. Polluted water has harmful chemicals or trash in it. Those things can get into water in many ways. For example, chemicals can get into water if a factory dumps them into a river. Because water travels in a cycle, it can carry those chemicals into the ocean, the air, and the ground. Trash can get into our water when people dump it in the wrong places. Trash in the water can be very harmful to animals and plants.
You can help keep Earth's water clean too! Everything you do affects Earth's water in some way. Take a look at these tips.
Put chemicals and trash only in the proper place--not in water or down a drain.
Pick up trash you see on the ground and don't litter.
Earth Day is April 22. On Earth Day, many people help clean up parks, rivers, and beaches. Groups of volunteers from schools, churches, and neighborhoods join to help our Earth. Some people pick up trash, and others plant trees. Many people work to save water from pollution. What will you do this Earth Day?

. The water cycle has four parts.
--The sun warms water in rivers, lakes, and oceans. Soon the water turns into a vapor, or gas, and floats into clouds in the sky.
--Water vapor in clouds cools and turns back into a liquid.
--The liquid falls from the clouds to the ground as rain or snow.
--The rain or snow ends up in rivers, lakes, and oceans again.
Besides water, what are some things you could care for on Earth Day?

69,439,"Last November, doctors operated on a clouded leopard named Joe. Joe had not been eating and had trouble walking. A disease was causing fluid to press on Joe's brain. This disease can also happen to cats, dogs, and humans. A two-hour operation saved Joe's life.
Joe is special because he is an endangered species. He is one of only a few hundred clouded leopards in the world.
Joe lives in Texas at the Fort Worth Zoo. He is often taken out of the zoo to visit people at schools and churches. A
, or animal doctor, at the zoo said Joe is ""part of the family.""

When the weather gets colder, the groundhog goes inside a sleeping chamber. It closes the opening with dirt. Then the animal rolls up into a ball and hibernates. The groundhogs body slows down. Its heartbeat slows. Its body temperature drops. Its breathing slows too.
When the weather gets warmer, the groundhog wakes up. It is very hungry! It moves from its winter den to its summer den. The animal eats plants that are growing nearby.

72,467,"Students recently planted trees in Brechtel Park. It is in New Orleans, Louisiana. The park lost thousands of trees in 2005. A big hurricane hit the area then. Its name was Hurricane Katrina.
The students worked hard. They raised money to buy the trees. How? They sold T-shirts and had an art fair. The group planted about 100 trees.
The event was a great success, says Brad Philipson. He is a teacher at Metairie Park Country Day School. One day, these kids will come back and see how the trees have grown.

75,395,"Christopher Columbus was an explorer. Explorers travel to places to learn more about them. Columbus sailed the ocean on a ship called the Santa Maria. Look inside to learn about his travels.
Columbus lived long, long ago. People had to go to faraway places to get spices and gold. Those trips were long and hard. Columbus wanted to find a shorter way to get to those lands. He had an idea to cross the ocean. He found people to help pay for his trip. Look at the map above to see where Columbus first sailed.
Columbus and his crew left Spain in August 1492. They sailed on three ships, called the
. The trip was long and stormy. Just when the crew was ready to give up, they saw land!
Columbus didn't find a shorter way to those faraway lands. Instead, he landed on an island near what is now the United States. He named the island San Salvador.
Columbus began to explore that island. He met people who already lived there. They were called the Taino (TIGH-noh). Later, Columbus left the island. He continued to explore other places. After some time, he returned to Spain.
Why might Columbus's trip have made him famous?

80,116,"Whoa! Dont look down! The newly opened Mike OCallaghanPat Tillman Memorial Bridge is the second-highest bridge in the United States. The bridge rises 890 feet above the Colorado River. It connects Arizona and Nevada.
The arch took nine years to build. The bridge is made from 16 million pounds of steel and 2 million feet of cable.
David Goodyear helped design the bridge. He cant get enough of the archs views. Its just such a fabulous setting, he says.
The bridges backdrop is the Hoover Dam. It was completed in 1935. The dam is considered a construction
or something that causes wonder. The dam stores water from the river. That water is used to make electricity.

82,614,"Do bats hold the answer to better-flying aircraft?
Batman, have you heard? A new kind of ""batmobile"" is in the works!
Scientists in Rhode Island are studying how bats fly. The United States Air Force is funding the $6 million project. It hopes the mammals will offer clues about how to design better-flying aircraft. Mammals are warm-blooded animals that feed their babies milk.
Bats can fly in ways that birds and airplanes can't. The animals' wings have more than 24 joints. The joints allow them to
, or control, their wings while flying. Bats can stretch and bend their wings. This helps them fly higher and faster. Scientist Sharon Swartz says bats' control of their wings is similar to humans' control of their hands. ""Bats are the only flying animals whose wings are really just like human hands,"" she told
Swartz and the other scientists will study about 20 species of bats over the next five years. They are using real bats, high-tech cameras, and wind tunnels in their research. The team hopes to find out why bats can turn sharply without falling. If airplanes could do that, they could
, or move, in tight spaces. They could also fly in more dangerous conditions. The Air Force also hopes to learn how weight affects bat flight. Bats can carry up to 50 percent of their weight while flying. If aircraft designers knew bats' secrets, they could design airplanes that could carry more weight.
Swartz says there is still a lot more to learn about the animals. ""We expect to be studying bats long into the future,"" she says.
It's going to be a hair-raising Halloween for Little Rock Zoo in Arkansas. Three vampire bats were born there recently. Vampire bats are the only type of bat that drinks the blood of other animals. They do this to survive, but don't worry! Vampire bats are usually friendly with people. Of the more than 1,000 bat species, only three are vampire bats. They live mostly in Mexico and Central and South America.
How can studying animals help people improve technology?

83,300,"The 2004 Summer Olympics are almost here! The Summer Games occur every four years. This year, they will take place August 13-29. Athletes from nearly 200 countries will compete in 28 sports. Swimming, tennis, basketball, and gymnastics are among those sports.
This year, the Olympics are heading home to the place where they first began--Greece. That is a country in Europe. The first Olympic Games were held in Greece about 2,780 years ago. The modern Olympics began there in 1896.
That year, only 13 countries competed in nine sports.
To kick off the Olympics, a special event called the Torch Relay takes place. The relay started in Greece on March 25 with the lighting of the Olympic flame. The flame is a symbol of competition, friendship, and peace.
During the relay, thousands of runners carry the Olympic flame around the world. The flame is passed from torch to torch.
It will travel around Greece for seven days. Runners will then take the flame around the world for 35 days. During that time, the flame will journey across six continents and 27 countries.
On July 9, the flame will return to Greece. Runners will carry it around the country until August 13, when they will light the flame at the Olympic stadium.
It will be kept burning until the end of the Olympics.

Scientists uncovered hundreds of underwater species. A species is a type of plant or animal. The discoveries were made in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. That is a
, or underwater, mountain range. It is beneath the Atlantic Ocean.
The Mid-Atlantic Ridge has not been explored much. Scientists often search waters closer to land. The scientists sent vehicles into the water. The vehicles searched waters up to two miles deep. They included cameras that took pictures of the animals. The cameras found that the ridge has a high level of
, or variety of plants and animals in an environment.
The team may have found a new species of ostracod, says lead scientist Monty Priede. An ostracod is a shrimplike animal. ""Usually you do not realize it is a new species until some time later,"" Priede, a science professor from Europe, told
The Mid-Atlantic Ridge still holds secrets to be uncovered. ""The main thing we want to find out is what lives out there and in what quantity,"" Priede says.

86,138,"Spiders may not like to eat sweet treats, but they sure know some tricks! Scientists recently learned that certain spiders build
of themselves. A decoy is something used to trick or trap something or someone.
The spiders live in Taiwan. That is part of China, which is a country in Asia. The spiders build the decoys in their webs. They make the fake crawlers to protect themselves from wasps. The spiders use dead insects and other materials to make the decoys. The decoys are about the same size and shape as the spiders.
Spiders may be the only creatures other than humans to make life-size models of their own bodies, according to researchers. Our study seems to be the first to [show] animal-made decoys, scientist I-Min Tso told reporters.
The spiders plan to trick wasps works, researchers say. The insects often think the decoys are real. When wasps attack the fake spiders, the real critters quickly crawl away.
Not even Spider-Man could come up with such a great escape!
A spider hangs out beneath fake spiders.

87,212,"Its the 200th anniversary of Lincolns birth.
For elementary school students in Idaho, it made cents to collect more than 300,000 pennies. Why? Abraham Lincoln appears on the coin, and the kids needed the money for a big birthday celebration in the 16th U.S. presidents honor.
Kids collect pennies and take part in class projects to remember Lincoln.
Lincoln was born 200 years ago, on Feb. 12, 1809. This month marks the
of his birth. A bicentennial is a 200th anniversary.
The students in Idaho raised money to help
, or move, a statue of Lincoln to a park near the Idaho Capitol. The project is one of hundreds of events across the country being held to celebrate Lincolns birthday.
In Washington, D.C., officials will honor Lincoln with a ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial. That is a special statue of the president. In other states, people will attend speeches and plays about the leader.
There are events being planned in all 50 states, David Early told
. He is a spokesperson for the group that has been planning the celebrations. [Lincoln] believed everyone should be treated the same.
Lincoln served as president during the Civil War (18611865). During that war, Southern states tried to break away from the country. They fought for their right to own slaves. Northern states were against owning slaves. Lincoln was also against slavery. In 1863, he signed the Emancipation Proclamation. It helped free most U.S. slaves.
Thats why third grader Morgan Squires, of Gooding, Idaho, was happy to collect pennies for the president.
[Lincoln] was a great leader, Morgan told
State Capitol, White House: Northwind; Cabin: Corbis
Abraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin in Kentucky. He moved to Illinois when he was a young man. There, he worked as a shop owner and a lawyer. Lincoln also served as a lawmaker for Illinois and the country.
In 1842, Lincoln married Mary Todd. Together they had four sons.
Lincoln became the 16th U.S. president in 1861. The Civil War started a few weeks later. Lincoln won reelection in 1864.
The war was coming to an end in April 1865. Lincoln was shot on April 14, while watching a play in Washington, D.C. He died the next day. Lincoln is buried in Springfield, Ill.
Why is it important to remember U.S. leaders of the past?

88,151,"Shark attacks are on the risebut probably not in the way you think. These days, the mighty fish are the ones being hunted.
About one-third of the worlds sharks are threatened. That is according to a recent study. Scientists studied 64 shark
. A species is a type of plant or animal. The scientists found that some types of sharks are
. Something that is endangered is at risk of dying out completely. That includes the oceanic whitetip shark (pictured below).
Fishing is partly to blame. People catch about 100 million sharks each year. Some of those fish are captured illegally.
World leaders are fishing for solutions to help sharks. Recently, representatives from fishing companies met in Spain. That is a country in Europe. They agreed to ask the companies to try to stop people from hunting sharks illegally.
We are pleased that governments ... have at last [understood] the ... need for shark [protection], says shark expert Sonja Fordham.

89,232,"Animals get a new home at the National Zoo.
You don't have to travel to Asia to see sloth bears slurp up insects. You can see the shaggy-coated creatures at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The zoo opened a new exhibit, called the Asia Trail, in October.
Sloth bears and six other species, or types, of animals from Asia have new homes at the National Zoo. Those animals face several threats in the wild.
Before the Asia Trail opened, the animals lived in tight spaces. Now they have twice the room. The changes are part of a 10-year plan to update the zoo.
""This is a giant leap forward for the National Zoo,"" says its director, John Berry. ""Our goal is to be the world's finest zoo by 2016.""
Giant panda cub Tai Shan (tie-SHAHN) and his parents are the stars of the show. They help draw huge crowds to the zoo. Three million people are expected to visit this year.
The giant pandas' new home includes more trees for climbing. Pandas like water, so their area has a waterfall and pools. Fog machines help make the exhibit more like their habitat, or natural home, in China.
Visitors now have closer views of the giant pandas and other animals. ""You can see, hear, touch, and even smell the zoo's science,"" says Susan Ades, head of the new design.
The National Zoo is home to 2,000 animals. Along with fishing cats, clouded leopards, sloth bears, and Japanese giant salamanders, the creatures here live on the Asia Trail.
Giant panda cub Tai Shan relaxes while chewing bamboo at the zoo.
Red pandas use their bushy tails to cover their bodies when they're cold.

Why? To find out how many sharks there are, of course! Some, such as the porbeagle shark, were once in danger of becoming extinct. The porbeagle shark is a species, or type, of shark. People hunted them for their meat and fins. Now, laws protect porbeagle sharks in the Atlantic Ocean.
Scientists want to make sure porbeagles are still safe. Traveling in boats, scientists caught about 1,000 sharks. Most were porbeagles. The scientists put tags on the female sharks and released them back into the ocean. The tags will allow the scientists to
or watch, the sharks in the coming months.

94,118,"Companies are pulling the plug on unhealthy food ads for kids.
No more cookies or candy for SpongeBob SquarePants. Dora the Explorer is also going on a diet. Recently, some companies decided to stop using cartoon characters to advertise unhealthy foods and drinks to children. This includes television commercials.
Nickelodeon will stop showing characters on junk-food packages by 2009. Starting next year, Kellogg's, McDonald's, and Kraft Foods will not advertise unhealthy products to children under 12.
According to doctors, kids see 40,000 television ads per year. About half of them are food ads. Many of them are for sugary cereals and unhealthy snacks. Health experts and parents say these ads make kids want to eat junk food more often.
""It's putting our children at risk,"" says scientist Ellen Wartella.
Obesity is the condition of being very overweight. Experts say one-third of American children are obese or at risk for becoming obese.
Currently, there are no laws that control how food companies advertise to children. This means it's up to the companies to decide how to advertise.
Josephine Thomas is a parent. She is glad that some companies are changing their use of cartoon characters in advertisements. ""As soon as [my kids] see a Shrek or Mickey Mouse [food product], they automatically look at that and they don't see what they really need,"" she says.
Yes, according to scientists at the University of Liverpool in Europe. Recently, they studied 60 children of various weights. The kids, ages 9 to 11, were shown several food and toy ads on television. Children at a healthy weight ate 84 percent more food after watching the food commercials than after watching the toy commercials. Obese kids ate 134 percent more food.
In what ways can advertisements affect people?

Ballard said the ship in the Black Sea was used for trade. The ship was filled with jars. At one time, the jars held items such as fish, olive oil, and honey.
This summer Ballard's team plans to dig up the shipwreck. They are hoping to learn more secrets about the ancient world.

Today, about 1,200 seals live near the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Experts fear that the population will drop in the next five years. ""The clock is ticking,"" says scientist Jen Palmer.
Experts worry that the seals are not getting enough food. Many of the pups are thin and are not living past their first few years. Scientists are trying to figure out why.
Other scientists are monitoring the monk seals habitat for pollution. A

97,165,"Astronauts are adding rooms to a lab in space.
Life in space is about to get a little spacier! The
is getting a makeover. The station is a lab in space where astronauts live and work.
Astronauts are adding two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a mini kitchen. The new parts were delivered by the space shuttle
. Before this, the space station had only three bedrooms and one bathroom. Astronauts have been building the space station since 1998.
delivered new parts to the International Space Station.
The new rooms will allow more astronauts to live at the space station at the same time. Having more astronauts in space could help scientists gather new information about space more quickly.
, or right now, only three astronauts can stay on the space station. Officials hope six astronauts will be able to live there at the same time by May or June.
also brought technology to the space station. A new system will turn the astronauts urine into drinking water. That might sound gross, but
, or reusing, the liquid will make sure the space station has water. Right now, water is rocketed to the space station from Earth.
Astronaut Christopher Ferguson says the same technology could be used on Earth one day. Were going to need to have these technologies in place, and this is a great way to get started.
Why do astronauts float in space? There is no
. That is a force that pulls your body toward Earth. Heres how astronauts eat, sleep, and exercise on the space station.
Astronauts put their feet in special holders to help them stay seated at the table. Food containers stick to trays with Velcro.
Astronauts can sleep standing up! Their sleeping bags are attached to the space stations walls. They strap themselves in for naps.
Astronauts stay in shape by exercising for up to two hours every day. They strap themselves to exercise bikes and treadmills.

98,387,"A military dog missing in Afghanistan returns to her troops.
Sabi is one smart pup. The dog knows how to sniff for bombs and protect soldiers. Recently, the black Labrador learned another skill: how to live on her own in Afghanistan for more than a year.
Afghanistan is a country in the Middle East. U.S. troops are at war in Afghanistan. They are fighting people who supported the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
About 70,000 U.S. troops are currently fighting in the war in Afghanistan. President Barack Obama recently announced that hes sending 30,000
The United States is not the only country fighting. Soldiers from more than 40 other countries are involved in the war. Sabi is part of a
of soldiers from Australia. A unit is a group. The military dog helps troops by
, or finding, bombs with her nose.
In September 2008, Sabis unit was fighting in Afghanistan. During the battle, she became separated from the soldiers. For months, Sabis unit searched for her without any luck.
Finally, a U.S. soldier spotted Sabi in November 2009. With the soldiers help, Sabi was
with her Australian unit. To reunite is to bring back together.
The troops will probably never know what their furry friend was up to all that time on her own. Theyre just glad to have found her. Says Australian leader Kevin Rudd, Sabi is back home in one piece.
The dog probably wouldnt mind lending another helping handor pawif soldiers need it.
251,827 square miles (slightly smaller than Texas)
28.4 million; about half are kids younger than 15
mostly mountains and deserts; only about 12 percent of the land can be farmed
What are some other ways dogs might help troops serving overseas?

99,566,"Asian swamp eels are no ordinary eels. They are fierce hunters. They can live on land and in the water. Now scientists are worried that the eels may take control of Everglades National Park in Florida.
The eels came from Vietnam, a country in Asia. Scientists believe someone accidentally released some of the eels in waters near the park. The eels feed on the plants and animals that many Everglades animals eat to survive. Scientists hope to catch the eels before they reach the park's waters.

102,316,"Koalas eat about a pound of eucalyptus leaves each day.
The koala is a picky eater. To choose what to eat, it just follows its nose.
The menu for koalas is always the sameleaves! They eat only the leaves of eucalyptus (yoo-kuh-LIP-tuhs) trees. Sound boring? Not to a koala! There are thousands of these trees in Australia. The only problem is that leaves from some trees can make koalas very sick.
How does a koala know which leaves to choose? Scientists recently discovered that koalas learn from experience. After eating leaves that make them sick, the animals use their sense of smell to remember to avoid that type of leaf.
Scientists were not surprised to learn that koalas
means ""to like better."" Large trees have more leaves and offer better shelter to koalas.
A mother koala sits in a eucalyptus tree and holds her joey.
A marsupial is an animal that has a pouch in which to carry its young.
It looks like a small pink jellybean.
After a joey is born, it crawls into its mother's pouch. The joey drinks only its mother's milk for the first six months.
However, no matter how large the tree, koalas will not eat from one that makes them sick. They would rather go hungry than eat leaves from these trees, say scientists.
A koala napping in a eucalyptus tree.
To a koala, a forest is a tricky mix of good and bad leaves. Scientist Ben Moore says, ""It's like having to choose between 1,000 restaurantsor trees, in the koala's casespread all over town, without a restaurant guide.""
Koalas use their sense of smell to choose leaves. How does your sense of smell help you?

104,787,"The planet Mercury recently had a special visitor. It was a robot named
. The flying robot was the first spacecraft to travel near the planet in more than 30 years.
flew within 125 miles of Mercury's surface. The spacecraft took more than 1,200 photographs of the planet. Before, scientists had pictures of less than half of Mercury's surface.
will pass the planet in October 2008 and again in September 2009. Then the robot will spend a year
the planet. To orbit is to travel in a path around an object.
Scientists hope studying Mercury will show how the planets formed. ""We really need better information on Mercury to make sure that our ideas on how the Earth and sister planets formed [are correct],"" says researcher Sean Solomon.

106,727,"As Ellen MacArthur crossed the finish line of the Vendee Globe race, she sailed right into the history books. MacArthur, aboard her sailboat called
set two world's records in the around-the-world race.
The Vendee Globe is one of the world's toughest sailing races. Sailors must race nonstop around the world. And if that were not hard enough, all sailors must sail
Ellen MacArthur, a 24-year-old Englishwoman, finished second in the 2000 Vendee Globe. She sailed about 31,000 miles in 94 days, 4 hours, 25 minutes, 40 seconds. MacArthur finished only one day after the winner, Frenchman Michel Desjoyeaux.
Despite finishing in second place, MacArthur made good enough time to win two titles--the fastest woman and the youngest person ever to finish a solo around-the-world race.
During the Vendee Globe voyage, MacArthur had to make repairs to her boat without losing time. She averaged ten naps a day, sleeping a total of just six hours a day. Once she awoke just in time to steer away from a giant iceberg looming 50 feet in front of her!
Those difficulties were nothing compared to the one MacArthur said she faced at the finish line. ""My life is here, home is on board
I just adore being at sea, and to suddenly stop this will not be easy at all,"" she said.
If you were to take a long trip by yourself, where would you go? How would you travel?

Tornado in Union City, Oklahoma, May 24, 1973
season in the United States. A tornado is a powerful, spinning wind. It travels quickly and can destroy everything in its path. Tornado season, which lasts for several months, is the time these twisters are most common.
The National Weather Service recently said it will change the tornado rating system next year. The strength of a tornado will continue to be rated on a scale from 0 (weakest) to 5 (most powerful). However, the new rating system will be more exact.
Under the old system, tornadoes with wind speed of about 300 miles per hour were given the rating 5. Studies have shown that slower winds can cause as much damage. The new system rates a tornado 5 if wind speed is at least 200 miles per hour.
Adverbs are words that describe verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. They tell where, how, or when. Examples are
Circle two adverbs in the tornado story.

110,610,"We live in a jam-packed world. In fact, more people live here than ever before. The population recently hit a whopping 6.5 billion! The big news was reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.
The number of people on the planet has doubled since 1960. And that number continues to grow. As you can see from the graph, experts estimate that six years from now, Earth will be home to about 7 billion people. That is not surprising when you consider that 261 people are born each minute.
A fact is a true statement. An opinion is an idea or a belief. Underline two facts and circle two opinions in this issue.

For many families at Fort Campbell, the wait for their loved ones is almost over. The rest of the bases troops will be home in time for Thanksgiving. Though the soldiers may be sent back to Iraq in the future, their families can breathe a sigh of relief for now. ""There are no words to describe how happy I am,"" says Hunters mom, Kristine.

113,557,"A rocket, with the orbiter on top, was launched in August from Cape Canaveral, Florida.
A spacecraft speeds toward the Red Planet. Scientists hope the trip will lead to answers.
In many books and movies, little green aliens from Mars invade Earth. In real life, Mars is the planet being invadedby strange-looking machines from Earth.
In August, NASA, the U.S. space agency, launched a spacecraft to Mars. It is called an orbiter because it will
, or circle, the fourth planet from the sun. Right now, the orbiter is speeding toward Mars. Scientists expect it to reach the Red Planet in March.
The orbiter will join two robots, called rovers, that are already there. They have been rolling around on the surface of the planet for more than two years. They are searching for signs of water.
Mars is cold and dry. Scientists think the planet was once a warmer and wetter place. Evidence of water can mean that life once existed on Mars.
The orbiter will look for signs of water. It is expected to spend at least two years studying Mars. It will scan Mars with the largest telescope camera ever sent to a planet. The orbiter's radar will look for water beneath the planet's surface. It will also search for landing spots to prepare for future human missions to Mars.
This is an artists depiction of the spacecraft as it nears Mars.
""This orbiter is going to look much farther and with more detail than what the rovers could do,"" NASA's Ramon DePaula told
. ""We are going to bring back more data than all other missions to Mars combined.""
Mars is called the Red Planet because its soil is a reddish color.
Like Earth, Mars has mountains and valleys.
The largest volcano in the solar system, called Olympus Mons, is on Mars.
Even in the summer, the temperature on the planet's surface is below zero.

114,531,"Where do tyrannosaurs tango? On the dino dance floor!
Scientists recently found more than 1,000 holes that may be dinosaur footprints. The holes are in Arizona. Scientists call the area the dino dance floor because the site is so packed with dino footprints that scientists imagined dinosaurs boogied there.
Researchers say dinos probably went there for water. The site might have been an
. That is a spot in a desert where plants and water can be found.
Still, some people arent sure that dinosaurs made the holes. Scientist Marjorie Chan will do more research to find out what caused them. Our science is a ... search to understand ... our Earth, she says.

115,347,"Popcorn is the official state snack food of Illinois.
Its light. Its fluffy. It pops. What is it? Popcorn! And now, it is also the official state snack food of Illinois.
The idea to honor popcorn came from a group of second and third graders. They called themselves the ""Kernel Kids.""
The kids invited a state senator to their school to tell him about their idea. The senator thought it was good and told other officials about the idea. In August, the governor of Illinois signed the popcorn bill. At the ceremony, the guests ate popcorn. The students wore popcorn hats that they had made.

117,155,"February is the month in which millions of Americans celebrate African American history. Many important events in African American history took place in February.
For example, Rosa Parks was born during this month. In 1955, Parks was arrested when she refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery, Alabama, city bus. In some places at that time, it was illegal for a black person to sit in the front of a bus.
of, or refusal to use, the bus company. Many blacks refused to ride the city buses for more than a year, until those unfair laws were changed.
In 1926, the historian Carter G. Woodson declared a week honoring black history. He chose the February week with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass.

The redesigned currency is safer, smarter and more secure.
What is blue, peach, and green all over? The new $20 bill coming out this fall!
The U.S. government has good reason for giving the $20 bill a new look. The new look will make it harder for people to make
(KOUNT-ehr-fit) money. Counterfeit money is fake money. Making it is illegal.
Along with new colors, there will be a few other changes to the $20 bill. For example, the oval around the image of Andrew Jackson will be removed. Jackson was the seventh U.S. president. For a closer look at the new bill, visit

One student is creating a math card game. Another student has an idea for a special chair to hold toy animals.
Teacher Liz Bradshaw runs the project. She says making toys helps kids think for themselves. This is a way to ... create [ideas] and make them come to life, she told

Kids who like to cook dont have to stay out of the kitchen. However, they should ask an adult for permission first, say fire officials. There are many tasty treats you can make without using the stove or oven. For recipes and cooking safety tips for kids, go to

121,417,"The United States is sometimes called a ""melting pot."" It got this nickname because people from all over the world have come here to live. A recent government report says more people from Latin American and Asian countries are living in the United States than ever before.
The U.S. Census Bureau counts all the people who live in the United States every ten years.
The world map shows the areas where the most immigrants who live in the United States came from between 1990 and 1999, according to the Census Bureau.
The Census Bureau's report shows that about 11 million Asian people live in the United States today. The report also says that 31 million Latin American people live in the United States.
Latin American people are from the countries south of the United States in Central and South America. People
or move from their homeland to another country, for many reasons. Some people leave their homeland to be with family members. Other people emigrate because life in their homeland has become too hard or dangerous. More people also emigrate today because traveling to other countries is faster, less expensive, and safer than ever before.
The Census Bureau says that the main reason people emigrate to the United States to start a new life.

122,373,"Artist Cynthia Vose believes that hats tell a story. Women have worn different hats throughout history. In honor of Womens History Month, Vose organized an art exhibit about hats. The exhibit is taking place this month at a library in Billerica, Massachusetts.
""Beyond fashion, hats represent the changing roles of women in society.""
In the 1800s, many American women wore bonnets. As women gained rights, they no longer wore hats just for fashion. Women began to wear hats for jobs that were once held by men.

123,264,"Why do some plants and animals die out?
Venice is a famous city in Italy. It is built on small islands. To get around the city, people travel by boat. Over the years, Venice has been sinking slowly into the sea. Water levels are rising and causing flooding. The city needs help to stay above water.
The government of Italy has a plan to save the city from floods. Government officials want to build a system of gates. The gates would block the seawater from flooding the city.
The gates would take about ten years to complete. If the plan is a success, Venice will be saved from being swallowed by the sea.

124,69,"How does the government want to protect polar bears?
Polar bears are on thin ice. Their home in Alaska is in trouble. The animals could become
. That means to be at risk of dying out completely.
To help the big bears, some U.S. officials want to set aside more than 200,000 square miles in Alaska. The area would be a protected habitat. It would have special rules to help keep polar bears safe.
About 3,500 polar bears live in northern Alaska. That area is part of the Arctic. The Arctic is the northernmost place in the world. About 25,000 polar bears live there.
Some people are worried that the number could fall, though. Alaskas polar bears face dangers in their home. Some companies drill for oil off the states coast (right). People use oil to heat their homes. However, an oil spill could hurt the animals, some experts warn.
By creating a protected habitat for polar bears, the U.S. government could
drilling there. To limit is to control. Some Alaskans dont want the habitat, though. They say the bears dont need protection. Plus, drilling is important for the state, says Alaskas governor, Sean Parnell.
Melting sea ice is another problem for the polar bears. The animals stand on the ice while hunting for food. Some scientists say the ice is melting because of
. That is the slow rise of Earths temperature.
Its important to protect polar bears habitat, wildlife expert Kassie Siegel told
656,424 square miles (Alaska is the largest state. It is more than twice the size of Texas.)
, or usual, January temperature is 11 degrees Fahrenheit. The average July temperature is 47 degrees Fahrenheit.

125,784,"? It may sound like a tongue twister, but it is actually a new species of dinosaur. Scientists recently finished a
were discovered in 1998 in South America. Fossils are ancient remains of plants or animals. Scientists spent almost six years cleaning the bones and putting them together. After studying the fossils, scientists learned that the dinosaur lived about 225 million years ago. It was one of the first two-legged plant-eating dinosaurs on Earth!
Scientists say the new species is related to dinosaurs that lived in what is now Europe. The discovery supports the idea of a supercontinent called

126,214,"On March 27, hundreds of colorful kites will fill the sky over the National Mall. That is a park in Washington, D.C., where a kite festival will be held. Nearly 25,000 people attend the popular event each year. This year's theme is ""Kites Around the World.""
""Kites are something people celebrate all over the world,"" event organizer Brandi Rose told
. ""The festival is a way to bring all of the
together in one place,"" she said. The culture of a group of people refers to their way of life, ideas, and traditions.
Some people have built their own kites for the festival. ""I chose to build a Japanese fighter kite,"" said Mike Van Meers. ""In 17th-century Japan, the kites were built with bamboo and paper. I'm building one with modern materials.""
Experts think kites were first made in China more than 2,000 years ago. Legend has it that a Chinese farmer invented the kite. On a very windy day, he tied a string to his hat. He held the string to keep his hat from blowing away.
Traders from China spread kite flying to other parts of the world. ""Kites come in all different shapes and sizes,"" said Van Meers. ""Every culture is unique, and every culture has a different style.""
The kite gets its name from a bird of the same name. Kites are graceful, soaring birds with long, narrow wings. These birds were once common in England. In the 1600s, kids in England made toys that sailed through the sky when pulled with a string. When the toys moved, they looked like the gliding birds.
Why is learning about different cultures important?

127,58,"Imagine diving into a world filled with giant starfish and yellow sea lilies. That is what scientists from New Zealand recently did. New Zealand is an island country near Australia.
Scientists spent five weeks studying sea life in the Ross Sea. That is a body of water near Antarctica. Antarctica is the southernmost place on Earth.
The team used special cameras to see all the way down to the seafloor. They collected more than 30,000
, or samples. They found eight types of fish that may be new to scientists.
, or sea, creatures the scientists found are bigger than similar creatures in other parts of the world. The starfish, for example, are 2 feet wide. Some starfish in other seas are less than 1 inch wide.

128,329,"Which famous African American do you most admire?
asked some third graders at Tamarac Elementary School in Holtsville, New York, that question. Here's what they said:
Jackie Robinson in a Kansas City Monarchs Uniform.
I admire Jackie Robinson. It must have been tough being the first African American to play major-league baseball. He wasn't treated equal. Instead of getting angry, Jackie Robinson showed how good he was. He made the Hall of Fame!
Rosa Parks was a very brave woman. She refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person. She helped change the laws in our country by standing up for what she believed in.
Hockey player Anson Carter is whom I admire. He has proved to be a decent power forward for the New York Rangers. He always gives 100 percent. That will help the Rangers make their drive for the playoffs.

The fishs gills and muscles can be seen through its light-colored body. Several other
can also be seen, including the heart, stomach, and brain. An organ is a body part.
The see-through goldfish gives experts and students a new way to study the animals, says researcher Yutaka Tamaru. They can see how the fishs organs work without hurting it.

130,707,"After years of protection, bald eagles and other endangered animals are making a comeback.
The future looks bright for some endangered animals! Thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists, many of these animals are doing well.
The bald eagle is one success story. The bird became the symbol of the United States in 1782. At that time, about 100,000 bald eagles lived in the lower 48 states. By 1963, only 417 nesting pairs remained.
Hunting and loss of habitat contributed to the
or drop in number. However, the biggest threat came from DDT, a chemical used for farming. DDT made the birds eggshells so thin that chicks couldnt survive.
or not allowed. In 1973, the Endangered Species Act was created. That law protects threatened plants and animals. Bald eagles soon gained protection under this law.
Today, there are more than 7,100 bald eagle nesting pairs in the lower 48 states. Plans are under way to take the birds off the endangered species list. If that happens, they will still be protected by other U.S. laws.
""It is a good endangered species success story,"" spokesperson Nicholas Throckmorton of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told
""Caring citizens have brought our national symbol back from the brink of extinction.""
The bald eagle isnt the only endangered species doing well. Here are some other success stories.
in and around Yellowstone National Park were endangered as a result of hunting and habitat loss. By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears lived in Yellowstone. Today, there are more than 600.
Scientists counted only 67 nesting females in 1973. Now the number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400.
of California were once killed by pollution and fishermen. In 1938, there were only 700 otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500.
Why was the bald eagle chosen as a national symbol?

She writes about the Tuskegee Airmen. They were the first African American pilots in the U.S. military. The group learned to fly airplanes in Tuskegee, Alabama. The Tuskegee Airmen served during World War II (19391945). They
or guided, U.S. fighter planes during the war.
Johnson says the story of the Tuskegee Airmen can encourage people to follow their dreams. ""There will always be people who want to keep you from doing something,"" she told

132,525,"Should peanut butter be kicked out of school?
When Sam Roffwarg was 18 months old, someone on an airplane gave him a snack pack of peanuts. Sam ate a few of the nuts. Suddenly, he was throwing up and gasping for air because he couldnt breathe.
It turned out that Sam, now 8, has a peanut
. An allergy is a bad reaction to something. Today, the third grader from Jackson, Miss., is careful about what he eats. I always read the ingredients, Sam told
Staying away from peanuts is hard when Sam goes to school, though. When other kids eat peanut butter, Sam has to be sure not to sit near them. Just touching a peanut could make him sick. A
, or strong, allergic reaction could be life threatening.
To protect kids, some schools are limiting or banning peanuts. A survey of about 1,200 school districts found that 18 percent of schools had some type of peanut ban in 2007.
Some officials say the bans are needed to protect kids with allergies. About 400,000 school-age children have peanut allergies, and experts say that number is growing.
Still, most kids are not allergic to peanuts. Some people say banning peanuts is not fair. Plus, they say, keeping track of what every kid eats is impossible. You just cant monitor whats in every persons lunch pail, says Janet Mitchell, a school district representative in Georgia.
Food is not the only thing that can cause allergic reactions. Here is a
, or close-up, look at some other
, or things that may set off allergies.
Tiny dust mites live in the dust found on furniture and in carpets. They are invisible to the naked eye, but they cause asthma and breathing problems for some people.
This allergen is often found in moist, damp areas, such as basements and bathrooms. Mold gives off a type of
, or germ, that can trigger allergy symptoms.
Plants create pollen. It is carried through the air by wind and travels into peoples noses. That can cause people allergic to pollen to sneeze and their eyes to tear.
Should schools limit or ban peanuts? Why or why not?

133,641,"Workers clean the Gulf of Mexico after an oil spill.
At a busy aquarium in New Orleans, Louisiana, a sea turtle splashes about in clean, clear water. Its hard to imagine that just weeks ago the animal was covered in greasy oil.
Experts wash a bird rescued from the oily water.
the sea turtle from an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. That body of water is south of the United States. To rescue something is to save it.
Until recently, oil had been spilling into the gulf for months. The oil
miles of sea and beaches. To damage something is to harm it. Thousands of animals were trapped in the sticky stuff.
The spill began in April. Workers were drilling from on top of an
in the gulf. That is a building in the sea. It is used to collect oil. Suddenly, the oil rig exploded. The accident caused an oil well at the bottom of the gulf to leak.
Since then, experts have been trying to stop the oil from spreading. They recently plugged the well with cement. Workers are also cleaning the water. The cleanup could take years, experts say.
The work is starting to make a difference, though. Officials recently reopened part of the gulf to fishing. That is good news for people who live near the gulf.
We love the land, Alma Robichaux told
She lives in Louisiana. We cant go anywhere else.
The oil spill isnt the first big trouble for the Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina hit the area in August 2005. The huge storm killed more than 1,300 people in five states.
New Orleans, Louisiana, was one of the worst-hit areas. Even today, parts of the city look as if the hurricane just happened. Many peoples homes are still damaged from the storm.
A group of kids works to repair houses. To repair is to fix. The group is called Beacon of Hope.
Student Emma Ridenhour recently lent a hand. After five years, theres still a lot of work to be done, she told
It means a lot that I could ... help.
How might the oil spill affect people in other parts of the country? Why?

135,273,"Nicole the shark set a world record for her swim distance and speed.
A great white shark named Nicole has taken a bite out of the record books. She swam farther than any other known sharkmore than 12,400 miles!
Great whites are endangered. They are often hunted for their teeth and fins.
The great white shark swam from South Africa to Australia and back within nine months. That is also the fastest
of any ocean animal. When an animal migrates, it moves from one region to another.
The map shows Nicoles route between South Africa and Australia.
Nicole was one of 25 great whites that scientists tagged in 2003. The tags record information such as time and speed. Scientists are using what they learn to find ways to protect these endangered animals.
""Its clear that we have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg; there is still much to learn,"" says lead researcher Ramn Bonfil.

137,469,"Scientists hope that an allergy-free peanut will one day replace the common peanut.
Many kids love peanut butter. Americans eat millions of pounds of it each year. But not all kids can enjoy this food. For some, peanuts can be harmful. About 100 people, mostly kids, die each year from peanut allergies.
A peanut allergy is one type of food allergy. A food allergy is when the body has a strong reaction to a certain food. Eleven-year-old Chris Conetta is allergic to peanuts. If he eats peanuts, he gets very sick. ""My face and my tongue swell up, and I can't breathe,"" he said.
Kids like Chris can have an allergic reaction from eating just a tiny amount of peanuts or a food made with peanut oil. Even smelling or touching peanuts can make some kids sick.
About 7 million Americans have food allergies. These eight foods are the cause of most food allergies:
tree nuts (such as walnuts and cashews)
Help may soon be on the way for kids with peanut allergies. A team of scientists tested 300 kinds of peanuts. They recently found one that is special. It is missing one of two major allergens. An allergen is something that causes an allergic reaction.
The peanut hunt is not over yet. Now scientists are looking for a peanut missing the other allergen. Once they find it, they will try to create an allergy-free peanut.
Scientists hope an allergy-free peanut will one day replace the more common peanut. That would make kids with peanut allergies very happy. ""Chris always has to be careful of everything he eats,"" said his mom. ""If he didn't have to do that, it would be wonderful!"" Chris agrees. ""I could have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I miss them.""

138,292,"Have you ever listened to the sounds that paper makes? To composer Tan Dun, paper is music. He invented instruments made of paper and wrote music to play on them.
This October, a group of fifth graders were among the first to hear musicians perform Dun's piece. The big event was held at the newly opened Walt Disney Concert Hall in California.
Dun wrote the musical piece to celebrate the art of making paper. About 2,000 years ago, the world's first fine paper was invented in China. China is the country in Asia where Dun was born.
""Using your imagination, you can find music around you, even in paper! Music is everywhere if you just look for it,"" Dun told
During the concert, musicians made sounds with the instruments in different ways. They tore, shook, hit, and even sang through the paper. Bet you didn't know paper could be so musical!

139,299,"Talk about lost and found! A team of scientists recently discovered some tiny critters in Indonesia. They are called pygmy tarsiers (PIG-mee TAWR-see-uhrss). Indonesia is a country in Asia.
Pygmy tarsier: Sharon Gursky-Doyen; Map: Leigh Haeger
Scientists thought this little creature was lost forever.
, or completely gone. Thats because no one had seen the animals alive for about 70 years.
. Primates are an animal group that includes humans, apes, and monkeys. The little fur ball is less than 4 inches long. It weighs about 2 ounces. It has wide eyes, big ears, and a long tail.
Scientists caught three pygmy tarsierstwo males and one female. They attached radio collars to their necks. Then they released the animals. When scientists return to Indonesia, they will track the collars to find and study the creatures.
Professor Sharon Gursky-Doyen helped find the critters. She told

143,108,"Will see-through frogs clear the way for frog research?
Green is out! Frogs have a new look that has some scientists jumping for joy.
Scientists in Hiroshima, Japan, have produced see-through frogs. Japan is a country in Asia. The pale frogs are the world's first see-through animals with four legs. Frogs are often used for scientific research. Now researchers can view
that are under the see-through frogs' skin. Organs are body parts, such as the heart and lungs.
Scientist Masayuki Sumida says the see-through animals provide new ways to study frogs. He says scientists can observe what happens to a frog's organs if it gets sick. ""You can see through the skin how organs grow...,"" he says. ""You can watch organs of the same frog over its entire life.""
. That means their body temperature depends on their environment. Frogs are also amphibians, which are animals with backbones that spend part of their lives in water and part on land. ""That's one of the things that makes them so interesting to study,""
. A herpetologist is a scientist who studies reptiles and amphibians.
Collins says students also could benefit from studying the see-through frogs. ""Seeing the heart actually pumping and the lungs actually working would be really important to younger students,"" he says. ""It will teach a lot about how the organs work.""
Frogs are one of more than 5,000 amphibian species! Keep reading to learn more about some of the other species.
These colorful frogs have red eyes and blue and yellow stripes. They live in rain forests in Central America.
Toads have stubby bodies with warty skin, and they walk instead of hop. Toads live in most parts of the world.
Salamanders look like lizards. Some have lungs. They live in cool areas in Europe, North America, and Asia.
What can people learn from studying frogs' organs?

146,563,"In 1990, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) launched the Hubble Space Telescope into space. It has taken thousands of photos of planets, stars, and other space objects.
The Hubble Space Telescope takes photos from 380 miles above Earth. Hubble is huge. It is almost the size of a large school bus!
Earlier this year, astronauts went to space to attach a new camera to Hubble. The new camera has helped scientists make many discoveries.
Recently, Hubble took a photo of the Cone Nebula. A nebula is a cloud of gas and dust in space. Nearby hot stars cause the Cone Nebula to glow red.

147,519,"This discovery will knock your socks off! Scientists recently found footprints that are more than a million years old.
The footprints are in Kenya. That is a country in Africa. An early human
, or relative from the past, may have made the prints. The feet that made the prints had rounded heels and big toes that point forward, just like people have today.
U.S. scientist John Harris helped discover the special prints. He and his team found four sets of adult footprints in the area. They also found tracks of animals such as lions.
The footprints could teach people a lot about what Earth was like a million years ago. Figuring that out is like a giant jigsaw puzzle, Harris told reporters.

149,83,"Taking those first baby steps is very excitingespecially for a robot. For years, scientists have worked to create a robot that could walk in a humanlike way. That time has finally arrived!
This February, scientists unveiled three robots that can walk like humans. The robots swing their arms for balance, as people do. The new robots require far less power than earlier versions did.
Toddler is the most advanced of the three. It learns to walk like a
, or a young child. Its balance improves with each step.
The walking robots are more than just toys. In the future, robots like these may be used to perform dangerous space missions. The discoveries could also help scientists develop better robotic limbs for people who have lost their arms or legs.

151,328,"The world's largest volcano appears to be coming back to life. Scientists are keeping a close watch on it. If the volcano erupts, it could destroy nearby towns.
A giant volcano on the island of Hawaii is beginning to show signs of life, scientists say. The volcano is called
Mauna Loa is Hawaiian for ""Long Mountain."" It is the largest volcano on Earth. The volcano makes up half of the island of Hawaii. Hawaii is one of the islands that make up the state of Hawaii.
Recently, scientists have noticed changes in Mauna Loa. The top of the volcano is growing slightly. Magma is rising into the giant volcano.
is hot, liquid rock beneath Earth's surface.
The last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984. A river of
flowed from the volcano for three weeks. Lava is magma flowing out of a volcano. The lava can reach temperatures of nearly 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit. Lava can burn everything in its path.
Since 1984, many more people have moved to areas around Mauna Loa. They have built homes on the volcano's slopes. If the volcano erupts now, hot lava could destroy those homes.
For now, people should not worry too much about an eruption, experts say. ""We're at a stage where it's months to years, rather than days to weeks"" before the next eruption, said scientist Peter Cervelli. Until then, scientists will continue to keep track of changes in the volcano. They hope to give people lots of warning about future eruptions.
Mauna Loa is a shield volcano. Shield volcanoes form from lava flows. When lava cools, it hardens. The lava builds up and forms a low mountain.
Why is it important for scientists to study volcanoes?

152,526,"What is colorful, plastic, and nearly 100 feet tall? The worlds tallest LEGO tower!
, or built, in Vienna, Austria. Austria is a country in Europe. The plastic creation broke the
world record for the tallest LEGO building. Something that is previous came before.
The tower was made up of about 460,000 LEGOs. More than 3,000 people helped build it in four days.
Most of the builders were children. Each young helper made a part of the tower. The designs were different, says LEGO spokesperson Kate Sutch. Some kids built their sections in patterns.
Breaking the record feels amazing, Sutch told
. It took ... hard work and creativity, but in the end, the kids of Vienna [did it]!

Chlorine is a chemical used to kill
Bacteria are tiny germs that you can see only with a microscope. Bacteria cause socks to smell. In the new socks, the chlorine kills any odor-causing bacteria.
A cross-country running team tested the socks. ""After running 9 miles, not having socks smell of feet is a real bonus,"" said one runner.

156,672,"Last September, scientists announced that an African monkey is now
or is no longer living. Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey is the first monkey to become extinct in nearly 300 years.
Scientists say the monkey is gone because of hunting and because people have destroyed much of the monkey's
or natural home. The monkey lived in the rain forests of Ghana and Ivory Coast, two countries in the western part of Africa.
Scientists warn that 25 other kinds of
(including monkeys and apes) may become extinct within the next 20 years.

157,439,"Thats not a koala earring. The colored tag in Yellows ear helps scientists tell her apart from the other koalas on St. Bees.
Koalas are pictured everywhere in Australiafrom boxes of chocolate to sports team jerseys. Yet the animals live only in small areas along the east coast.
The koalas were once widespread on the east coast. However, farmers cut down many of the forests where koalas lived. Hunters also killed the animals for their fur.
I recently joined Bill Ellis and his team in a forest on St. Bees Island. Ellis is a scientist who studies koalas. He and other scientists hope that studying koalas on the island will teach them how to protect koalas elsewhere in Australia.
We spotted a koala named Abby in a blue gum tree. The blue gum is a
or type, of eucalyptus (yoo-kuh-LIP-tuhss) tree. The leaves of eucalyptus trees are the main food source for koalas.
Whenever we find a koala, we collect information about the trees in the area. We measure how tall and how fat the trees are. Then we put tags on their trunks, so we know theyve been recorded.
We also capture and tag the koalas. Before releasing them back into the wild, we give them a health checkup.
Ellis wonders if the St. Bees koalas are headed for hard times. The island is filled with wild goats, which may be eating small blue gum trees. Ellis hopes more research will help him understand how to protect the blue gumsand the koalas that depend on them.
 Volunteers shake a tree branch on which a koala named Yellow sits. Yellow falls onto a plastic sheet and is placed into a sack.
 Volunteers hold Yellow in the sack. They adjust a radio collar around the koalas neck.
 The colored tag on Yellows ear helps scientists tell that koala apart from others on St. Bees Island.
What are some ways that people might protect koalas?

160,179,"""May I stay up just a little longer?"" That's the cry heard from kids every night in many U.S. households. That's because most kids don't want to go to bed.
Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks.
The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8? hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said.
Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said.
In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should.
Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school.
Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep.
Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' ""
If a kid loses one hour of sleep a night, how many hours of sleep does he or she lose in a week? A month? A year?

161,184,"Textbooks in China are getting a makeover. For years, schoolchildren in that Asian country have learned that the Great Wall of China could be seen from space.
Education officials recently ordered school textbook publishers to stop printing the
, or falsehood. In October 2003, Yang Liwei, China's first person in space, reported that he could not see the wall when he orbited Earth.
Liwei's comments contradict the last man on the moon. In 1972, a U.S. astronaut reported that the famous monument was visible from space.
More than 2,000 years old, the Great Wall is the longest structure ever built. Experts estimate that the Great Wall of China is about 4,000 miles long.

163,685,"Utah has a state fruit, a state folk dance, and a state fish. And thanks to a group of determined fourth graders, Utah may soon boast a state reptile.
Students in Laura Grafs social studies classes at Diamond Valley Elementary School in St. George, Utah, are getting a lesson in how a bill becomes a law. They are urging state lawmakers to approve a new state symbolthe western rattler.
The idea for the state reptile came from the schools mascot, a diamondback rattlesnake. The students convinced their state representative, David Clark, to present the bill to the state Congress.
Sixty students from Diamond Valley recently visited the state House of Representatives in Salt Lake City, the state capital. They sang their school song, which mentions the slithery reptile. They also presented Governor Jon Huntsman Jr. with a cherry pie (cherries are the state fruit) and performed a lively square dance (the state folk dance).
The students efforts are paying off. The bill passed the House of Representatives. Next it has to make it through the state Senate before it lands on the governors desk for signing.

164,280,"The grizzly and cubs may soon be taken off the endangered species list in the Northwest.
Grizzly bears are considered one of the great symbols of the American wilderness. When explorers Lewis and Clark traveled west in the early 1800s, they found a healthy grizzly-bear population.
At the time, about 50,000 grizzly bears roamed the West. But as pioneers moved westward, the number of grizzly bears began to shrink. Illegal hunting, trapping, and habitat loss were to blame for the bears' disappearance. A
is the place in nature where an animal makes its home.
Today, there are only 800 to 1,000 grizzlies remaining in the lower 48 states, but there is hope for these creatures. About 550 of the grizzlies live in the Yellowstone National Park area in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. That is almost double the number that lived there in the 1980s.
Thanks to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the grizzly is making a comeback. Congress passed the act to protect animals that were in danger of becoming extinct.
Wildlife officials hope to remove grizzly bears in the Yellowstone National Park area from the endangered species list within the next year. Steven Williams, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told USA Today that the change is ""a tribute to the American people's commitment to wildlife [protection].""
Why is it important to protect endangered animals?
Scientists have worked to help bring grizzlies back from the brink of extinction. They set the animals free in their original habitats. They also plan to limit the number of roads in areas where grizzlies live. That action will give grizzlies more room to roam-and will help make life more bearable for them!

tales in all. The books have been translated into 14 languages and describe the crazy adventures of George, whose curiosity often lands him in trouble. The man with the yellow hat helps George out of his various scrapes.
movie stars actor Will Ferrell as the voice of the man with the yellow hat. ""For years, Curious George has amused, entertained, and taught children around the world,"" Ferrell told
""His adventures make us laugh, and we all depend on humor in life.""

Our classroom play celebrates Philadelphia's hometown hero. Discover how his hard work helped to improve the lives of all Americans.
Honor the 300th birthday of one of our countrys greatest thinkers, inventors, and statesmen with our classroom play.
Each morning, Benjamin Franklin asked himself, ""What good shall I do today?"" And that is how he lived his life.
His can-do attitude launched him into the history books as one of Americas most famous citizens. Ben was a printer, a writer, an inventor, a community leader, and a founder of our nation.
Ben was born in a cottage in Boston on January 17, 1706. He attended school only between the ages of 8 and 10. Bens education was cut short because his family was poor and needed him to work.
His love of learning, however, stayed with him throughout his life. Ben read all the time. He often went without food to buy books! At 12, he began his lifelong love of printing.
In honor of the 300th anniversary of Bens birth, our three-act play looks at some key events in the life of this great American. Find out how his good deeds helped shape the history of our country.
ACT 1: Ben the Young Man, Boston, 1718-1723
Bens older brother, James, owns a printing press that publishes a very popular newspaper,
In 1718, Bens father decides that 12-year-old Ben should work for James.
At that time, Ben signs a document promising he will work for his brother until he is 21, without pay. In return, his brother is to provide Ben with food and clothes.
Ben likes to read and is a good editor and proofreader. Over the next few years, he learns all about printingand even begins writing letters to the newspaper under a different name. Thanks to Bens sense of humor and clever writing in those letters,
becomes one of the most-read newspapers in Boston.
James finds out that the letters are from his brother and he becomes jealous of Ben. James is furious and vows never to publish any of Bens writing again. He also finds fault with Bens work, even though Ben rarely makes errors.
I know I am a better printer than he is.
You cant leave! You have to work for me until you are 21!
Youll never find a job in this city! Youll come crawling back to me.
But Ben never comes back to his brother. Instead, he leaves in the early morning and runs away to New York City, in hopes of finding work as a printer. After not finding a job there, he heads to New Jersey where he boards a boat to Philadelphia.
The journey is three days long, and Ben is dirty, hungry, and penniless. But Philadelphia is a lively city, and Ben loves it.
ACT 2: Ben the Community Leader, Philadelphia, 1723-1740s
After arriving in Philadelphia, Ben works to establish himself as a printer. In 1728, he opens a printing shop and begins publishing his own newspaper,
A few years later, he also publishes
The book includes weather forecasts, recipes, and jokes. It also contains some of Bens sayings, such as ""Well done is better than well said."" The almanac becomes a best seller and makes Ben wealthy.
Although Ben works to better himself,it is also important to him to help the community. He considers Philadelphia his hometown and works to make life in the city better.
Ben starts projects to pave and sweep Philadelphias streets. He redesigns the citys streetlights so that roads are safe at night.
Ben also helps set up the first public library, hospital, and volunteer fire department. At this time, most houses in Philadelphia are made of wood and stand side by side. When a fire breaks out, it can destroy an entire neighborhood.
Extra! Extra! Fire destroys row houses on Market Street!
We need to train men to fight fires so that this doesnt keep happening.
Ben persuades more than 30 men to form the Union Fire Company.
We nominate Ben as our fire chief.
Ben is appointed fire chief. He makes sure that firefighters are trained to put out fires and rescue people.

The Union Fire Company meets once a month to discuss fire prevention. Ben also publishes fire prevention tips in his newspaper.
Bens ideas for Philadelphia help shape how fire departments, hospitals, libraries, and post offices work in other cities.
ACT 3: Ben the Statesman, Philadelphia, 1776
Along with his work in Philadelphia, Ben helps change the course of American history.
At the time, America is made up of 13 Colonies ruled by Britain. England has passed many laws that the Colonists think are unfair.
Ben works to mend the relationship between the Colonies and Britains ruler, King George III.
Despite his efforts, the Colonies decide to break away from Britain. They fight Britain in the Revolutionary War (1775-1783).
Ben is appointed to the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence. This document frees the Colonies from Britains rule.
We have to decide who should write the Declaration of Independence.
I wont. Many people disagree with my opinions.
I cant. I am not a writer.
I am unsure about independence from Britain.
You must write this very important document. Your writing style is perfect.
When Thomas Jefferson finishes his draft, he shows it to Ben.
Ive made small changes. For example, you wrote, sacred and undeniable, and I changed that phrase to make it stronger.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.
On July 4, a group of representatives from the 13 Colonies approve the Declaration of Independence and some people sign the document.
This for King George, so he can read it without his glasses.
On August 2, Ben and others also sign the document. They know they are risking everything for freedom from Britain.
Seven years later, in 1783, Ben negotiates the treaty that ends the Revolutionary War. In 1787, at age 81, he signs the U.S. Constitution.
Ben Franklin dies on April 17, 1790, at the age of 84. He is buried in Philadelphia. In honor of the 300th anniversary of his birth, people across the country will celebrate the life of this remarkable man.
If you could award a medal to Ben Franklin for one of his achievements, which accomplishment would it be? Why?

167,96,"Eleven-year-old Tilly Smith was recently honored at the United Nations in New York City for her courage during last years tsunami. Two weeks before the December 26, 2004, disaster, she had studied tsunamis in her geography class at her school just outside London, England. Her teacher showed the class a video of a tsunami. Tilly paid very close attention.
When her family was vacationing on a beach in Phuket, Thailand, Tilly immediately recognized the warning signs of a tsunami. Her quick thinking saved the lives of about 100 people in the area.
""I saw this bubbling on the water, right on the edge, and foam sizzling just like in a frying pan,"" Tilly says. ""The water was coming in, but it wasnt going out again.""
Tilly knew the waves would pound the shore within minutes. With the help of a security guard and a chef, Tilly spread the warning. People
or fled, the beach just minutes before the tsunamis devastating waves struck.
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton praised Tillys smart and courageous act. At the U.N. ceremony, President Clinton said, ""Tillys story is a simple reminder that education can make a difference between life and death.""

Every Saturday morning! I used to get sent to the principal's office for doing my impression of the Tasmanian Devil in class. Now the director let me do Taz in the movie. Aaaah, revenge is sweet!
: What was the best part of acting in this movie?
Having to imagine that you're in a cartoon world is no easy task. I loved the challenge of believing I was alongside the characters each day.

169,463,"Emi is a nervous mother-to-be. She should be, because there is a lot of pressure riding on her.
Emi is a Sumatran rhinoceros. She lives at the Cincinnati Zoo in Ohio and has been pregnant since June 2000. When she delivers her calf this fall, it will be the first Sumatran rhino born in a zoo since 1889!
The Sumatran rhino is a very rare animal. According to the International Rhino Foundation, only about 300 Sumatran rhinos live in the wild.
The rhinos' numbers have dropped because they are hunted and because their
, or land where rhinos live, is shrinking. Indonesia and Malaysia, two countries in Southeast Asia, are home to most of the remaining Sumatran rhinos.
Zoos, governments, and scientists around the world are helping to protect rhinos. Breeding rhinos in zoos is one way of helping.
Organizations such as the foundation are also working to protect the rhino's habitat. In addition, Rhino Protection Units have been formed to protect rhinos from
. Poachers are people who break the law by hunting animals that are off-limits.

170,120,"There's good news for manatees. For some time, manatees have been in danger of dying out. Now some scientists in Florida say the number of manatees has increased and the sea mammals should no longer be considered endangered.
Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.
Is it important to save manatees and other endangered plants and animals? Discuss in class and let us know at

171,327,"Watch out, Spider-Man. You may soon have company. The superhero's powers might someday become more than comic-book science fiction.
Researchers from England say that people may actually be able to scale walls and climb ceilings with gloves made of a special material. However, the researchers who came up with the material didn't get the idea from wall-crawling spiders.
Scientists are developing a sticky tape based on the hairs on a gecko's foot.
. Geckos are little lizards that use their sticky feet to cling to walls and ceilings. They can climb the most slippery glass surfaces and dangle from the ceiling with a single toe.
What's the secret behind their amazing grip? Geckos have millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of their feet. When a gecko comes in contact with a surface, the hairs create an electrical force that lets it cling to a wall or a ceiling.
""If human palms were covered by this [sticky] material, it would support the weight of an average human,"" said one scientist.
Scientists hope the material can be used with robots or in medicine. But they have a way to go before turning their idea into reality. The material is expensive, and it quickly loses its stickiness. Spider-Man would not be pleased to hear that!

172,684,"Polar bears reign as the kings of the Arctic. Yet there is trouble underfoot for those snow-colored creatures and other wildlife as their icy habitat slips away.
The Arctic is the icy, cold region located around the North Pole. In November, scientists from eight countries released a report saying that the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of Earth.
In the report, scientists predict that at least half of the summer sea ice in the Arctic will melt by the end of this century. The scientists blame
for the Arctic thaw. That is the gradual rise in Earth's temperature.
Arctic ice is melting at an alarming rate. Winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen between 4 and 7 degrees Fahrenheit. During the past 30 years, polar bears have lost more than 386,000 square miles of ice--an area larger than the states of Texas and Arizona combined.
More than 20,000 polar bears live in the Arctic regions. Disappearing sea ice threatens polar bears and other cold-weather animals. Polar bears use the ice as a bridge to hunt seals, their primary source of food.
As the sea ice disappears, the mighty
, or hunters, catch fewer seals and risk starvation. Seals also depend on the ice to rest and give birth. Scientists fear that polar bears, seals, and other animals that rely on the ice could be wiped out by the end of the century if the warm-up continues.
Some of the 4 million people who live in the Arctic have also found themselves on shaky ground. As the frozen land thaws, buildings and roads have weakened.
Inuits (IH-nyoo-wets), a group of native people in the region, fish and hunt Arctic animals, including polar bears. They depend on those animals as their main source of food. Inuit hunters are also falling through thinning ice.
Rising sea levels have forced some people in the Arctic to move their coastal villages inland. The report warns that melting ice could cause sea levels to continue to rise--up to 3 feet by the end of this century. Towns and cities along coastlines around the world could flood as a result.
The warm-up also affects other parts of the planet. Arctic ice and snow reflect heat from the sun into space. Without the ice and snow, the planet would be much warmer. ""The polar regions are essentially the Earth's air conditioner,"" said scientist Michael McCracken.
Who cranked up the thermostat on the Arctic? Scientists say human activity is to blame for global warming. People use
, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to power cars, heat homes, and create electricity.
Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Burning those fuels gives off gases that trap heat from the sun and add to the overheating of the Earth.
To protect life in the Arctic, scientists say people need to limit their use of fossil fuels. ""Climate change is not just about the future,"" said scientist Pal Prestud, who worked on the report. ""It is happening now.""
The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Those gases collect in a layer and trap heat from the sun. The layer of gases is like the windows in a greenhouse. The process is called the
Too much of those gases in the air causes temperatures to rise. That is known as
What are some ways people can reduce their need for fossil fuels?

173,243,"A new study shows that kids who have a TV in their bedrooms get less sleep than other kids. Sleep experts at Brown University say about 30 percent of kids have a TV in their bedrooms.
According to sleep experts, kids who have TVs in their bedrooms go to bed later, have problems going to sleep, and are more likely to wake up during the night than kids who don't have TVs in their rooms.
One of the experts said the best way to help kids sleep better is to ""clear the bedroom of TVs and make the bedroom a place for relaxation and sleeping.""

174,478,"Snakehead fish and other invasive species threaten the environment.
Scientists were conducting a study of fish at Meadow Lake in New York City. To their horror, they found a fish with a long body, a snakelike head, and razor-sharp teeth. They counted another and another, until there were five in all. At that point, they knew they had a problem.
Snakehead fish can slither over land from one body of water to another and can breathe air. They dine greedily and can clear a pond of all its fish. They are among the hundreds of
that currently threaten environments in the United States.
An invasive species is a plant or an animal that does not belong in the area in which it is living. Many invasive species lack
in their new environments. Predators are animals that hunt other animals. Although invasive species don't damage their own environments, they can cause massive destruction when they invade another area.
Snakehead fish arrived in the United States from China and Korea, most likely as pets. When their owners no longer wanted them, they threw the fish into nearby lakes and streams. Snakehead fish now live in several states, from Maryland to California.
Snakehead fish aren't the only accidental arrivals. In the Great Lakes region, fingernail-sized zebra mussels hitchhiked from Russia in the water tanks of ships. Now the mussels clog pipes that provide drinking water to homes and schools.
In Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, young emerald ash borers have killed more than 6 million trees. These beetles likely arrived from China in wood packing material carried in ships or airplanes.
And in Hawaii, tiny coqui (koh-KEE) frogs are now a huge problem. The frogs hitched a ride to the ""Aloha State"" in a plant shipment from Puerto Rico. The noisy frogs produce a piercing sound that keeps people awake at night.
Scientists in New York are trying to control the snakehead fish population by increasing the salt levels in the lake. Snakeheads can't survive in salty water.
Robert Wiese of the Fort Worth Zoo also advises people not to release unwanted pets into the wild, which is especially a problem with tropical fish that are put into rivers and lakes. Invasive species, like snakehead fish, disrupt
An ecosystem is a group of plants and animals that live together in the same area.
""Our natural ecosystems are the primary source of our food and drinking water,"" scientist Lisa Gould told
. ""Ecosystems help keep our air clean. They give us medicines. Without them, we could not exist for long.""

The young beetles chomp through the inner bark of ash trees, destroying the tunnels inside that move water from the roots to the leaves.
Coqui frogs have an appetite for Hawaii's insects and are leaving nothing for many endangered birds in the area. To hear these ear-piercing frogs, visit
Each year, a female zebra mussel can lay 30,000 to 100,000 eggs. When those eggs hatch, the baby mussels gobble up food and oxygen, leaving nothing for other underwater creatures.

175,258,"The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle's grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles.
The disease attacks an infected bird's brain and spinal cord.
At first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird.
In recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year.
Although the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased.
By the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild.
Wildlife experts are especially concerned because they don't know much about the disease, including what causes it. ""We have some ideas, but we don't have any answers,"" John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said.
Experts also don't know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. ""This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn't noticed,"" Fischer said.
While wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Scientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America's bird--the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn't true in 1782.
Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol.
""I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country"", Franklin wrote. ""He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird"".

176,583,"Germany, Chile, and Liberia elect their first female leaders.
Germany, Chile, and Liberia dont seem to have much in common. The three countries lie on separate continents. They do not share a language, currency, culture, or history.
But a closer look shows that the three nations are more similar than they may appear to be. In the past six months, each country has elected a woman as its leader for the first time in its history.
Angela Merkel of Germany, Michelle Bachelet of Chile, and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia join a small but growing group of female heads of state. Only 11 of 193 countries in the world have women in charge.
Johnson-Sirleaf vows to unite Liberia and create jobs.
The three recently elected women have bold plans for their countries. Merkel, the first woman to serve as the chancellor of Germany, promised that the government would work to reduce
or joblessness, in her country. ""We want to give people hope of having jobs,"" she says.
As the first woman president of Chile, Bachelet plans to bridge the large gap between the countrys rich people and poor people. She says, ""Chile needs to unite behind the goals of reducing poverty and creating more equal opportunities so that everyone can benefit from what the country has to offer.""
Johnson-Sirleaf is not only Liberias first woman president. She is also the first elected female head of state in all of Africa. As president, she faces the huge task of rebuilding Liberia after 14 years of war.
Although the war ended more than two years ago, the country still has no regular electricity or running water. More than 80 percent of the people in Liberia do not have jobs.
or bring back together, her country. ""I am excited by the potential of what I representthe aspirations and expectations of women in Liberia, African women, and women all over the world,"" she said in her inauguration speech.
Those recent elections have made some Americans think about a woman president too. Nearly 80 percent of Americans are ready for a female commander in chief, according to a Roper Public Affairs poll.
Some people think Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will run for president in 2008. Time will tell if the United States will have two female front-runners in that presidential election.

178,300,"If two heads are better than one, a newly discovered turtle is head and shoulders above other turtles. May Toro found a two-headed turtle in Florida. ""I was shocked. I couldn't believe it,"" Toro said after she picked up the turtle.
Toro works for Mary Kraus, who studies turtles. Kraus says she has seen the eggs of two headed turtles before. However, she has never seen a living two-headed turtle. ""This is the first time I've ever seen one alive, fully developed, and hatched,"" Kraus said.
The two-headed turtle is a loggerhead turtle. The U.S. government says the loggerhead turtle is an endangered species. Loggerhead turtles can grow to be 3 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds!
After studying the turtle for a couple of days, Toto and Kraus let the turtle go. ""We didn't want it to become a freak in a freak show"", Kraus said.

179,61,"Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, homeland security has become an important issue for many people.
This week Grade 4 looks at where the two major candidates for president stand on
. Both candidates recognize that the world has changed since the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Each candidate has his own plan to make the United States more secure and keep its citizens safe.
President Bush's antiterrorism program has included removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and restoring freedom to the country. He has also worked to stop terrorist groups in Afghanistan.
In October 2001, shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush signed the Patriot Act. The law gives the government more power to investigate suspected terrorists. President Bush believes that the law should be renewed when it comes up for review in 2005.
Bush also created the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 to keep our airports, borders, and ports safe from attacks. He says that he has worked to improve national security at airports through increased screening and advanced equipment.
Senator Kerry promises to continue to track and stop potential terrorists. He voted for both the Patriot Act and the Department of Homeland Security.
Kerry supports the Patriot Act's renewal in 2005 if some changes are made to it. He argues that certain sections of the Patriot Act violate citizens' rights. Some of those parts include allowing the government to wiretap phone conversations and search business and library records.

180,301,"Sumeyya Mamuk, 8, of Van, Turkey, fed and cared for the chickens in her backyard. As they started to get sick and die, she hugged them and kissed them good-bye. The next morning, she had a high fever, and her face and eyes were swollen.
Sumeyyas father rushed her to the hospital where she was told she had bird flu. Thanks to quick treatment with medicine, Sumeyya recovered. ""Shes gotten better,"" says her doctor.
Health officials in Turkey and around the world are alarmed by a dangerous disease called
or bird flu. The disease mainly affects birds. But the H5N1
or type, can infect people who come in close contact with sick birds. However, experts say eating cooked poultry is safe.
Turkey has experienced a recent outbreak as bird flu has raced across Southeast Asia and into Russia and eastern Europe. About 100 million chickens, turkeys, and ducks have died of the disease. Officials have killed millions more in an attempt to stop the spread of bird flu.
Sumeyya is among the very few people who have caught the disease. So far, the H5N1 virus has infected about 150 people, killing at least 85 people since 1997. The virus does not usually spread from person to person.
Health officials around the globe, however, fear that the virus could
or change, into a form that spreads among people. They are racing to prevent a
or worldwide outbreak of the disease. Scientists developed a new
but further studies are still needed. A vaccine is a medicine that protects people against a type of disease.
Although there have been no reported cases of bird flu in the United States yet, the government is working to make sure the country is prepared. In November, President Bush announced a $7.1 billion plan to purchase large amounts of vaccines and medicines and develop new treatments. The United States also recently pledged $330 million to help other countries fight bird flu.

181,723,"What qualities do you look for in a friend? Do you look for someone you share common interests with, someone you enjoy spending time with, and someone you trust? If so, it turns out you aren't very different from fish.
A new study shows that fish carefully choose their friends and stick together with their pals. Creators of the hit animated movie
must have been onto something. In that film, a clown fish named Marlin recruits his ocean buddies to help rescue his lost son, Nemo.
Scientists conducted the study to find out how fish mate and how they protect their
. A habitat is a place in nature where a plant or an animal lives. For their research, scientists studied fish called three-spined sticklebacks that live in rivers and streams in England.
Scientists also found that to make friends, the sticklebacks rely on senses other than vision. Scientists believe that fish use their sense of smell to find familiar fish.

182,360,"If you listen to music, you are probably like millions of other kids--you turn up the volume when you hear your favorite song. Listening to loud music may be fun, but a government study shows it may also be dangerous.
According to the study, which was paid for by the U.S. government, more than 5 million kids, ages 6 to 19, have suffered some hearing loss. That's more than one out of every ten kids. Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss.
Amanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. ""It was assumed in the past that children wouldn't have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage,"" Niskar said.
Niskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a ""problem for children,"" she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems.
Hearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems.
For example, hearing loss ""can influence [a] child's ability to learn in the classroom,"" Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions.
Niskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead.
Listen Up! This diagram shows the parts of your ear. Loud noises can damage the cochlea and cause hearing loss.

Teachers from around the United States have been working at McDonald's restaurants for a day. The teachers are taking part in McDonald's McEducation program.
First, the teachers learn how to use the cash registers. Then they take orders from customers. McDonald's donates 20 percent of the sales made by the teachers to schools. The money is used to buy library books.
The McEducation program helps schools and gives students a chance to see their teachers outside of school. ""It's really funny because they are teachers, and they don't look like they belong here,"" said one student from New Haven, Connecticut, after seeing his teachers working in a McDonald's restaurant.

184,687,"While surfing, Matt Kraskiewicz, age 17, felt something tug on his leg. ""It was like someone dropped a weight on my foot,"" he said. That weight was a shark taking a bite out of Matt's leg.
Eleven-year-old Taylor Holley was standing in waist-deep water when a shark suddenly bit his leg, leaving a 2-inch gash.
Should humans be afraid of sharks, or should sharks be afraid of humans? Debate this issue.
The above incidents took place in Florida during October. After reading such stories, many people might think that they should not swim in Florida's waters. But shark experts say that would be an overreaction. As scary as they are, shark attacks are rare.
The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) says you are more likely to be hit by lightning than be bitten by one of the more than 350 shark species. In fact, each year about 500 people are hurt by lightning in the United States. In 1999, only 58 shark attacks occurred
Scientists say some species of sharks can live up to 50 years.
The largest shark, the whale shark, can be 50 feet long.
Shark skeletons have no bones. The skeleton is made of a tough substance called
Not all sharks are meat eaters. Basking sharks, for example, eat
, tiny plants and animals that float in water. As a result, basking sharks don't have teeth.
Shark Expert Rodney Fox explained, ""Sharks do not like humans; we are too bony. A lot of people who have been bitten by sharks have survived because the shark spat them out.""
One reason that shark attacks may seem more common than before is that more people are using shorelines for recreation, said George Burgess of ISAF.
Sharks that do bite humans have often mistaken people for other kinds of animals. For example, ISAF officials say sharks attack surfers wearing dark-colored wetsuits more often than they do anyone else. To a shark, the wetsuits make surfers look like seals, a favorite food.
Some shark experts say sharks should fear people, not the other way around.
One of the biggest threats to sharks, said Burgess, is
. Finning happens when a fisher catches a shark, cuts off its fins, and tosses the dead fish overboard. The fins are used to make delicacies such as shark fin soup.
Conservation groups are urging governments to protect sharks. During the summer, the U.S. House of Representatives acted to protect sharks when it passed a bill that could prevent finning in U.S. waters. In order for that bill to become law, the U.S. Senate has to pass it, and the president must sign it.
U.S. Rep. Randy Cunningham introduced the bill. ""We must end the harmful and wasteful practice of shark finning,"" Cunningham said.

185,765,"Larry Stevens lives in a remote, quiet area of Hawaii. Recently, that changed when new neighbors moved into the area. The noisy neighbors are two kinds of frogs.
Even though the coqui and greenhouse frogs are each only about the size of a dime, they make a huge racket. Instead of making soft chirping or gentle croaking sounds, the frogs chirp as loudly as a lawnmower. ""You'd never believe so much noise could come from a creature that small,"" Stevens said.
Scientists say the frogs in Stevens's backyard recently arrived in Hawaii. They came from islands in the Caribbean Sea, south of the United States mainland. Scientists think the frogs were accidentally shipped to Hawaii in flowerpots.
Since arriving in Hawaii, the foreign frogs have spread to 150 areas. In some areas, more than 8,000 can be found on a single acre of land. Each one is adding to the noise level.
The frogs are more than a noisy nuisance; they are causing other problems, as well. They eat insects that birds and other frogs used to eat. Each night, each thunderous frog can eat at least six insects.
The number of frogs is increasing because no other animals prey on them. If the foreign frog population keeps growing, other frogs and birds in Hawaii might not have enough insects to eat and might starve.
Some officials worry that the frogs might cause some people to leave Hawaii because of the racket. ""We get a lot of complaints from residents,"" said Fred Kraus, a spokesperson for the state. ""Some [have] threatened to leave the state.""
Residents of Hawaii are trying to capture the shrill frogs, which live in trees. Recently, Stevens and some of his neighbors went out looking for the noisy critters. They used ladders to climb into trees and capture frogs. ""We got them all,"" he said.
However, within a few months of the frog roundup, more frogs moved into Stevens's neighborhood. ""It was hopeless,"" Stevens said. ""There were just too many [frogs to capture]. Now they're out of control.""

186,556,"Scientists are thrilled about some tiny, furry finds. They have discovered two new species of lemurs on Madagascar, an island located off the southeast coast of Africa.
The endangered animals are found only in Madagascar and a few of the country's nearby islands. Madagascar is home to some of the world's most
, or unusual, plants and animals. Lemurs live mainly in forest trees and are
One of the newly discovered creatures has wide eyes, is small enough to fit in a hand, and bounces from tree branch to tree branch in the dark. Its name in Malagasy means ""good man."" Malagasy is the official language of Madagascar. The animal was named after scientist Steve Goodman. He has been studying the tiny creatures in Madagascar for 20 years. It is truly an honor to have an animal named after me,"" says Goodman.
The other species is a giant mouse lemur with a bushy tail. It was named in honor of Madagascar's children. Its name in Malagasy means ""child."" The scientists chose that name to remind Madagascar's children to care for the many plants and animals in their country.
Finding a new lemur species is rare because many of the tiny creatures have become extinct. The recent find means that there are now 49 known species of lemurs in the wild.

188,365,"Being bullied is all too familiar to 12-year-old Drew Landry from Maine. When he was in sixth grade last year, Drew was bullied by an eighth grader. ""It was hard to get through,"" Drew told
With the help of his parents and school officials, the bullying has stopped.
Drew is not alone. More than 16 percent of U.S. school children report having been bullied, a recent survey shows. As a result, many states across the country are passing anti-bullying laws.
At least 22 states have enacted anti-bullying laws since 1999. However, many Maine law makers said those laws were not tough enough. As a result, Maine passed a new law that requires school officials to develop stricter policies to deal with bullying. Teachers must also be trained to deal with bullies.
is someone who picks on another person again and again. Many kids think of bullying as hitting or pushing, but it is more than that. Bullying often takes the form of name-calling, leaving someone out of a game or a group on purpose, teasing, threatening, and spreading rumors.
Bullying isn't limited to the schoolyard. Bullies today have new turfcyberspace. Online bullies often use e-mail, instant messages, and blogs to spread nasty rumors, post embarrassing photos, and tease other kids.
After his tough experience, Drew wants to make sure no other kids are bullied. He spoke in front of Maine lawmakers to support the new law. ""I helped change the law to help other kids feel better about themselves,"" he says. ""It makes me feel [safer].""
What is Drew's advice to other kids who are bullied? ""Don't be afraid to tell an adult.""
If you are being bullied, you can do something about it. Here are three tips from the National Center for School Safety.
No! If you are being bullied, tell the bully in a firm voice that you do not like what he or she is doing.
Tell! Find an adult and explain what happened.

189,375,"Meet a robot that has been busy tooting its own horn. A trumpet-playing robot made its debut at a hotel in Japan in March.
The robot played the song ""When You Wish Upon a Star."" After its performance, the 4-foot-tall droid bowed its head and waved its arms in response to the audience's applause.
Although the musical droid doesn't have a name yet, it is the latest in a string of
that scientists have built in the past few years. Humanoid robots are high-tech machines that act lifelike and are programmed to do jobs that people typically do.
Japanese companies lead the way in creating humanoid robots. Japan is thought to be the leader in
Other humanoid robots created by Japanese companies have been getting plenty of attention even without playing the trumpet.
Japanese scientists introduced ASIMO (ah-SEE-moh), the world's first stair-climbing robot, in 2000. The 4-foot, 115-pound ASIMO's many talents include walking, holding objects, speaking Japanese, and recognizing faces. ASIMO recently finished a world tour. The tour included several stops in U.S. cities so kids and adults could learn more about it.
Like ASIMO, QRIO (KYOOR-ee-oh), can talk and recognize faces. QRIO, which was unveiled in Japan in December 2003, can also run, jump, throw a ball, dance, and even belt out a tune.
In March, QRIO conducted Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in Japan. Before the rehearsal in front of a live audience, the robot grumbled, ""I'm feeling nervous.""
Today, robots come in all shapes and sizes. Many robots are used in factories. They help build cars, inspect computer parts, and package food. Robots speed up production on assembly lines and help save companies both time and money.
Robots also perform tasks that are difficult or dangerous for humans. Robots have explored the far reaches of space and traveled into active volcanoes.
that when robots were first introduced in the 1960s, they performed only jobs that were ""dirty, difficult, and dangerous."" That, however, is starting to change. Today's engineers hope that the new breed of humanoid robots will improve people's lives.
Many people are excited that humanoid robots may one day be able to lift people confined to beds or wheelchairs. The robots may also be able to help elderly people with chores such as vacuuming and taking out the garbage. Some people, however, worry that robots may take away jobs that are now performed by humans.
Although the humanoid robots have been busy making public appearances, they aren't for sale yet. If you really want a robot that will clean your room and help out with chores, you still have to wait a bit longer.
1. QRIO shows off some dancing skills. QRIO stands for ""quest for curiosity."" Why do you think the robot was given that name?
2. ASIMO (which is short for Advanced Step in Innovative MObility) walks down a flight of stairs.
3. In March, this latest humanoid robot-still unnamed-plays the trumpet at its first public appearance in Japan.
Robots are used for a variety of purposes from helping out in offices to performing surgery.
2. Sico the robot helps children paint pictures at an Arkansas hospital.
3. There is a two wheeled robot that can guide blind people.
How does technology help improve people's lives?

190,147,"Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will take a look at where the two candidates for president stand on important
, or problems facing the country. This week's issue is the
President Bush went to war in Iraq because, he said, the country's dictator, Saddam Hussein, had harmful, illegal weapons. Bush claimed that Iraq and its weapons threatened the United States and other nations. Bush says that the world is safer now that Saddam has been removed from power. His goal is to rebuild Iraq with its own government and establish peace there.
Senator Kerry supported a law that allowed the United States to go to war in Iraq. Since then, he has criticized Bush's handling of the war. Kerry said that Bush misled the nation by claiming that Iraq had harmful, illegal weapons. To date, none have been found. Kerry wants to persuade other countries to help rebuild Iraq and ""win the peace.""

191,276,"Scientists have given new meaning to the words ""jet speed."" In early March, a NASA jet set a new record for speed.
The unpiloted X-43A jet flew nearly 5,000 miles per hour. That is equal to seven times the speed of sound. The aircraft made a 10-second powered flight and then glided for six minutes before plunging into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.
Before taking off on its own, the jet launched from the wing of a plane in midair.
A rocket, which was later released, helped boost the jet's speed.
""Everything worked according to plan. It's been wonderful,"" said NASA's Leslie Williams. ""We've been waiting a few years.""
NASA attempted to fly a similar unmanned jet three years earlier. However, a failure in the launch system caused the flight to explode.
In 1947, American pilot Chuck Yeager became the first person to fly at

An expedition to the Arctic has uncovered a giant sea reptile.
Scientists have discovered the skeleton of a sea monster near the North Pole. Researchers from Oslo, Norway, recently announced that they have found a complete
skeleton. A plesiosaur is a prehistoric marine reptile about the size of a bus. The recent discovery is believed to be the first complete plesiosaur skeleton ever found.
during an expedition to the Svalbard islands, 300 miles off the coast of Norway, in August. Fossils are the remains of plants or animals from millions of years ago preserved in rock.
The meat-eating reptile lived more than 150 million years ago, during the Jurassic Period. Some scientists call it the
of the sea. ""We think it is [a 26-foot] skeleton from snout to tail,"" team leader Jorn Hurum told
He described the plesiosaurs long teeth as being ""the size of bananas.""
The expedition also uncovered fossils from 27 other marine reptiles on the islands. ""We hope to find lots more in the years to come,"" says Hurum. ""We have just scratched the surface.""

193,322,"Scientists are going ape over orangutans (o-RANG-oo-tanz). They are working to help save these endangered tree dwellers before they disappear from the wild.
In recent years, the red-haired apes have found themselves out on a limb. Wildlife experts warn that they may die out, or become
, within the next 20 years. Scientists estimate that only 30,000 orangutans are left in the wild.
Today, orangutans can be found only in tropical rain forests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, in Southeast Asia. They are
creatures, which means they eat, sleep, and travel mainly in trees.
To search for food, orangutans swing from branch to branch. They like to dine on leaves, flowers, bark, and sometimes insects.
""Orangutans spend most of their time in the trees and won't cross open grounds, so the only way they can [move]... is through the trees,"" said one wildlife expert. ""We need to maintain these forest [areas] so that orangutan populations of the future have the opportunity to continue to survive.""
What is causing the numbers of orangutans to decrease at an alarming rate? The main reason is the destruction of their rain forest
Humans pose the greatest threat to orangutans for a number of reasons, say experts. People cut down trees for lumber. This illegal logging is destroying much of the animals' homes. Many countries, including the United States, buy the lumber. It is often used in shelves, picture frames, and floors.
Forest fires and farming are also to blame. As forests are cleared to make way for plantations, orangu-tans lose parts of their habitat.
In addition, orangutans have fallen victim to the recent boom in the illegal pet trade. People steal baby orangutans from the forest to sell them as pets.
To help bring these animals back from the brink of extinction, wildlife groups are working to protect orangutans and stop illegal logging. The government in the area is also involved in the effort to help orangutans. Police go into national parks to prevent illegal loggers from cutting down trees.
""Help is needed to save these amazing creatures,"" orangutan expert Cheryl Knott told
. ""If we can save the rain forest for orangutans, we can save it for other animals as well.""
The average life span for orangutans is about 50 years. Experts hope that orangutans born today will still be swinging through the trees at that age.
The orangutan got its name--which means ""person of the forest""--for a reason. Orangutans are remarkably intelligent. In the wild, scientists have spotted these clever creatures using sticks as tools to open fruit. Orangutans have been observed using large leaves as umbrellas to shelter themselves from heavy rains. Sometimes, the apes even use leaves as cups, from which they drink water.
Are there any endangered animals in the area where you live? What can people do to help them?

194,433,"In wartime, U.S. Navy ships face many dangers. As the ships cruise at top speeds through the ocean, one of the deadliest threats is from underwater bombs called
. Ships use special sensors to locate mines.
Within the next few months, that same technology will be used to protect something a lot smaller and slower--manatees.
In the winter, West Indian manatees are found in many of the warm, shallow waters around Florida.
. A lock is an area of water in a canal enclosed by a set of gates at each end. The gates open to allow a ship to enter. The lock then fills with water to raise the ship or drains water to lower it. A lock allows a ship to move from one elevation to another.
Canal locks, however, can be deadly traps for manatees. An average of ten manatees a year have been killed in the gates in the past decade.
A little more than a year ago, the canal lock at Port Canaveral, Florida, was fitted with sensors like those used by the U.S. Navy to detect underwater mines.
The sensors work using sound waves, said Larry Taylor, the engineer overseeing the project. ""When the canal lock sensors [detect] a manatee, they stop the doors from closing,"" said Taylor.
Within a few weeks after the Port Canaveral installation, the sensors had saved seven manatees, Taylor said. He said there are plans to install the sensors at seven more Florida canal locks. ""This is a great system that will really help the manatees,"" Taylor recently told

196,45,"Third grader David Bates won the Weekly Reader American Values contest. The U.S. Army and the Pentagon sponsored the contest. Nearly 14,000 kids in grades 3 through 6 entered the contest.
The contest asked kids to write an essay that answered this question: Which of seven American values-loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, or courage-is the most important in your daily life? Those seven American values are the core values of the U.S. Army.
David chose selfless service as the most important value in his life. David wrote that the other six values are part of selfless service. ""It is most important in my everyday life because it incorporates all the other values.""
David; his younger brother, Andrew; and his parents traveled from their home in Spanish Fork, Utah, to Washington, D.C., to get his prize. On November 11, they attended the Veterans Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery.

197,291,"Crews restart construction on the space station.
Mission completed! On September 21, astronauts returned to Earth aboard the space shuttle
The six-person crew had come back from a successful journey to the
about 220 miles above Earth. The astronauts added new solar panels to the giant space lab. The solar panels will power the station, which
or travels around, Earth. It was the first major delivery to the space station since 2002.
Once completed, the space station will be about the size of a five-bedroom house. It will measure 361 feet end to end.
The space station is being built as a joint effort by 16 countries, including the United States. Construction began in 1998, and the first crew arrived in 2000. The diagram shows when parts of the space station were added.

198,102,"Wispy lights danced through the night sky in October. Observers worldwide saw the lights.
People saw green, blue, and red lights. The lights formed different patterns. Some looked like rings. Others looked like curtains. And still others looked like pillars. The lights continually changed shape and color.
are also called the northern lights and southern lights.
Usually, only people living close to the North Pole and South Pole see auroras. But auroras were unusually active this fall. Even people in Arizona saw the lights.
Auroras are caused by the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The solar wind is made of tiny particles that stream away from the sun. Earth's magnetic field is similar to the field that surrounds a magnet. When the solar wind strikes Earth's magnetic field, gases in our atmosphere glow. Those glowing gases form an aurora.
The kind of glowing gas determines an aurora's color. Glowing oxygen makes red, yellow, and green auroras. Glowing hydrogen and helium make blue and purple auroras.
Don't worry if you missed the colorful auroras in October. An aurora can form at any time of year. If the solar wind continues to be as strong as it was in the fall, you may see the northern lights on any clear night.
The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth. You could line up more than 1 billion hot dogs end to end between Earth and the sun.
If you could drive to the sun in your family's car, it would take you nearly 2 million years. That's if you drove 55 miles per hour and didn't take any rest stops.
Light from the sun travels a lot faster than you can in your car. A beam of light travels at about 186,000 miles per second. It takes sunlight a little more than 8 minutes to reach Earth.

199,446,"One Missouri family finished a yearlong history lesson. The family visited all 50 capitol buildings in the United States.
Fred and Ginger Gall and their three sons--ages 13, 11, and 6--wrapped up their adventure in early August. Their final stop was at their home state's capitol building in St. Louis.
It took them a little more than a year to complete their journey, covering a total of 48,000 square miles. They traveled across the country in a mobile home.
Although the kids attend school in Missouri, they were home-schooled during their trip. Their parents said the trip was a chance to teach their sons about the history of the United States. As part of their schooling, the kids used their textbooks from their school.
They had many field trips to add to the mix. In addition to visiting all the capitol buildings, the family stopped at science and history museums and national parks along the way.
What sent them packing? ""Our friends from another country had seen more of [the United States] than we had,"" said Ginger Gall. ""There was something wrong with that picture.""

200,659,"History in the Making: Mercury 3 Rescue Mission
The Mercury missions were the first attempts by NASA, the U.S. space agency, to send a human into space. The rocket missions took place from 1961 to 1963. During the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union competed to build the best space program. That period was called the space race. Tia interviewed her grandfather, Clark Presler, about his role in the 1961 Mercury 3 mission, during which astronaut Alan B. Shepard Jr. became the first American in space.
What do you remember from your experiences in the Navy?
I remember being part of the pickup crew [aboard the U.S.S.
] when the first manned space capsule returned to Earth. It was May 5, 1961. The name of the [rocket] was the Mercury-Redstone 3.
What was the purpose of this mission?
NASA wanted to send a man into orbit and back safely. His name was Alan B. Shepard Jr.
The capsule reached [an altitude of] about 187.45 kilometers, which is 114.61 miles.
The orbit flight lasted only 15 minutes.
In the Atlantic Ocean, near Cape Canaveral, Florida.
How did you pick up Mr. Shepard?
Well, we lifted the capsule up on the chain. Alan was standing up on it, hanging on to the chain. He came out without a single scratch on his body.
At first, I thought this project would be easy, but after the interview I knew I had to learn what this was all about. So later that day I asked Grandpa to explain this to me. After that, it sounded a lot clearer, and it's fun having a member of your family actually do something, well, famous.

201,758,"Talk about a bird's-eye view of an ostrich farm!
visited the Westcoast Ostrich Show Ranch near Cape Town, South Africa. South Africa is a country in Africa.
Ostriches are the world's biggest birds. They have plump, round bodies covered with feathers, and long, skinny necks covered with soft fluff. Male ostriches weigh up to 350 pounds and can grow up to 8 feet tall. That's a foot taller than basketball player Shaquille O'Neal!
Ostriches don't fly. Instead, they use their wings to attract mates, alert other ostriches to danger, and keep their balance. Being stuck on the ground doesn't slow ostriches down, though. They can run as fast as a car can travel--up to 50 miles an hour for about 30 minutes.
At the farm in South Africa, the ostriches roam an area of flat land almost the size of 200 football fields. The workers at the farm take care of the ostrich eggs--the biggest of all bird eggs. At almost 3 pounds, each egg is about the size of a football. Even though an ostrich egg looks fragile, it is very strong. You could put a 300-pound weight on the egg without cracking its shell. Believe it or not, even a baby elephant could sit on an ostrich egg!

202,23,"Did you know that the average child will spend more time in front of the television than at school this year? That's according to the TV-Turnoff Network.
Beginning April 21, millions of children and their families across the country will trade some TV time for other activities. They will zap off their television sets for an entire week.
April 21 through 27 is the ninth annual TV-Turnoff Week. ""The idea of the week is to encourage people to take a break from TV,"" said Frank Vespe of the TV-Turnoff Network. ""One of the things we learn is that TV is taking away from other things that we might do for fun.""
The goal of the week, according to its organizers, is to help kids discover other activities they enjoy. Then kids may make lasting changes in their lives.
Health experts warn that too much television can have negative effects on kids. Children who spend too much time watching television often get too little exercise. They also don't perform as well in school as do children who watch less TV.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
1. This is the ninth year of TV-Turnoff Week.
2. Many kids like to watch TV.
3. TV-Turnoff Week lets kids discover other activities they enjoy.
So think about what you might do if you zapped off your television set for an entire week. Would you read a book? Head outside to ride your bike? Play a board game with your mom or dad?

203,144,"Nine-year-old Ben Duskin is reaching out to kids who have a serious disease called cancer. Ben invented a video game for kids about fighting cancer.
Ben, who is from California, is no stranger to the disease. He learned that he had a type of cancer called leukemia when he was five years old.
Why did Ben invent the video game? When he was in the hospital, he relied on video games to take his mind off being sick. That inspired him to help other kids who have cancer.
The result is ""Ben's Game""--named after its creator. The game takes place inside the body and stars a boy hero who moves around the screen on a skateboard. The boy is modeled after Ben. The object of the game is to blast cancer cells.
Thanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Ben's idea became a reality. The foundation helped Ben work with a software designer to create his video game. Ben's game is now available free online. To play, visit

204,492,"On March 22, Kelsey Penfield, age 9, was working at her desk at Maplehurst Elementary Schook in Norwalk, Ohio. She was also chewing her pen cap. Suddenly, she swallowed the cap.
The pen cap became lodged in Kelsey's throat, and she began choking on it. She tried coughing up the cap, but the cap wouldn't move. Unable to breathe, Kelsey began pointing at her throat.
Kelsey's classmate Elizabeth Muirhead, age 9, realized that Kelsey was choking. Elizabeth immediately sprang into action and performed the Heimlich maneuver on her classmate, saving her life.
Elizabeth had learned the Heimlich maneuver in an issue of
caught up with the two girls to ask them about that fateful day.
: What happened the day that Kelsey started choking?
We were in class doing our grammar work. That's when Kelsey started choking. There was a boy between us, but he didn't know what was going on. Kelsey was pointing to her neck. I asked her if she was choking, and she nodded. That's when I ran over to her and did the Heimlich maneuver.
What were your thoughts? Were you scared?
: I was really scared. The first time I tried the Heimlich, I didn't do it that hard. I was afraid of hurting Kelsey. The second time, I squeezed a little harder. Then the third time, the pen cap just flew out. All the time I was thinking that Kelsey is my best friend and I'm not going to let her die.
How did you know how to perform the Heimlich maneuver?
: We read about it in an issue of
. Mrs. Moore put us in groups of two, and we practiced doing it.
: Kelsey, What was this experience like for you?
: I was really scared. I was chewing on a pen cap, and all of a sudden it slid down my throat. I couldn't breathe. I'm not going to chew on pen caps anymore. You shouldn't really chew on anything. You never know when you can accidentally choke.
1. Stand behind the choking victim and wrap your arms around his or her waist.
2. Make a fist and hold it against the victim's stomach, about halfway between the belly button and the rib cage.

When 13-year-old Katie recently went online, she couldn't believe that some classmates were making fun of her. The seventh grader from New Jersey discovered mean and hurtful comments written about her in an online Web journal.
""It was really offensive and upsetting to me because I knew everyone could see it online,"" Katie told
. ""There was nothing I could do to take it down.""
Katie's story is not unusual. She is one of the many victims of
. ""Cyberbullying is when a child torments, humiliates, or tries to frighten another child using interactive technology,"" online safety expert Parry Aftab told
Instead of teasing or picking on kids in the school yard, bullies have new territorycyberspace. The explosion in technology, such as computers, cell phones, and interactive games, gives bullies more places to do their dirty work.
Cyberbullies use e-mail, instant messages, text messages, and online journals to spread nasty rumors, post embarrassing photos, and tease other kids. Breaking into others' e-mail accounts and sending out mean messages to their buddy lists is a common practice for cyberbullies. Cyberbullies also run up other kids' cell phone bills with text messages. Some kids have even conducted online votes for the ugliest person in class.
For many kids like Katie, online bullying has become part of everyday life. Most cyberbullies are between the ages of 9 and 14. Studies show that about 55 percent of kids in grades 4 through 8 have had mean or hurtful remarks made to them online. ""Cyberbullying is a huge problem in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades,"" said Aftab.
Why is cyberbullying such a growing problem? For starters, kids spend a lot of time online at both home and at school. Nearly two-thirds of American kids have computers in their homes, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Online experts say being mean online is easier because computers give kids a sense of being
, or not being known. Kids say things on the Internet that they would never say face-to-face.
Some kids also don't realize that they're cyberbullies because they don't see the consequences of their actions. ""In face-to-face communication, we see when we've gone too far,"" she says. ""We lose all those visual cues online.""
To address the problem, more schools and communities are educating kids about online etiquette and are holding anti-bullying seminars. Aftab trains groups, called TweenAngels and TeenAngels, to become safe and responsible cybercitizens who share their knowledge with others.
TeenAngel Kendall, 12, experienced cyberbullying when kids at school blocked him out of gaming sites. His advice for dealing with a cyberbully: ""Don't be afraid to tell your parents, teachers, or whomever you trust the most.""
, or fight, cyberbullying, is to take a stand against it. ""The only way cyberbullying will stop is if kids protect each other,"" says Aftab. ""If you stand by and let someone else hurt someone, you're part of the problem. You need to be part of the solution.""
Online safety experts offer the following tips to protect yourself from cyberbullying:
Don't give out your passwords or any private information to anyone, even close friends.
Don't post any information online that you don't want others to read.
Don't answer a mean or threatening e-mail, block the person who sent you the offensive message, and tell a trusted adult. That person can help you take action.
Don't react to a mean message. Walk away from the computer and do something else that you enjoy for a few minutes.
Run your name through search engines, such as Google, to check whether there is information that you don't want on the Internet. Some search engines let you set up alerts that send you an e-mail if a new posting includes your name.
How is face-to-face communication similar to or different from sending a message by e-mail or IM?

206,745,"William Jefferson Clinton is the 42nd president of the United States. He has been the president since 1993. He will leave office when the next president takes the oath of office on January 20, 2001. Recently, Bill Clinton answered questions from
What were the most important accomplishments of your presidency?
I think that one of the most important things I've accomplished was helping to strengthen our economy so that more Americans have jobs and more families can afford to buy homes and send their kids to college.
I'm particularly proud of a new program created in 1993 called AmeriCorps, which gives young people a chance to serve their communities while earning money for college.
What advice would you give the new president?
A president has tremendous responsibilities-- from keeping our economy growing to working with foreign leaders and commanding our armed forces. The president is the leader, but he or she can't do the job alone. So my advice is build a strong team, stay focused on your priorities, and make every day count.
Why should kids be proud to be Americans?
We should all be proud to be Americans because this truly is a land of opportunity. Regardless of your background, you can work hard and achieve your dreams. You may face challenges or obstacles along the way, but if you set your sights high, work hard, and stick to your priorities, you can achieve your goals.
What has been the best part of being president?
The best part of being president has been having the opportunity to make America a better place. Every day, I have the chance to make a difference in people's lives.
After being president for eight years, what will you do now?
The first lady and I recently bought a new home in Chappaqua, N.Y., and I look forward to spending more time there. I also plan to spend time in Arkansas putting together my presidential library and launching a new public policy center. I'm sure I'll be very busy, but I also hope to spend more time with my family and friends and to simply relax after what has been eight of the most incredible years of my life.
William Jefferson Blythe IV was born on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas.

207,462,"Where does famous TV puppet Howdy Doody belong? That was the question that a court in Hartford, Connecticut, had to answer. The court recently decided that Howdy belongs to a museum in Detroit, Michigan.
, the first children's TV show seen across the country. The show was aired between 1947 and 1960. It featured host Buffalo Bob and his sidekick puppet, Howdy Doody.
When watching the show, kids saw Howdy on their TV screens, but they never saw the man who controlled the puppet--Rufus Rose. When the show ended, Rose kept Howdy. After Rose died, his children held on to Howdy.
However, officials at the Detroit Institute of Arts said that Rose had promised to donate the puppet to the museum. Rose's family didn't want to give up the puppet, and the two sides asked a court to decide Howdy's fate.
The court decided that Rose promised to donate Howdy to the museum. Soon, adults can be kids again when they visit with their old friend Howdy Doody.

208,645,"A new fashion trend has hit some public schools across the country. More schools are requiring students to wear uniforms or are enforcing stricter dress codes.
Students at Lakeside Elementary School in Cincinnati, Ohio, said good-bye to jeans, T-shirts, and oversized, baggy clothes this school year. Instead, they must wear tan, navy, or black pants and shirts with a collar. Girls are also allowed to wear jumpers or skirts.
The students in Ohio are not alone. From California to New York, an estimated 11 million public schools
, or require, dress codes for students.
Some people support the idea of dress codes. School officials say that dress codes often improve discipline and lessen teasing and bullying. Students focus on schoolwork instead of fashion.
""I like uniforms,"" Brittany, a student at Lakeside, told
. ""No one judges you, because you are wearing the same thing that they are.""
Some parents say that another benefit of wearing uniforms is that it saves money. They think uniforms are less expensive than designer clothes.
Not all people are in favor of dress codes. Some parents say that dress codes

These students do not have to follow a dress code.
Others argue that dress codes take away their kids' creativity by preventing them from choosing what to wear. Maggie, a student at Lakeside, told
that she doesn't like to wear a uniform, because ""all the outfits are the same.""
Some parents don't agree that buying uniforms is less expensive. They say it can be costly to purchase clothes to meet dress codes.
Should public schools have dress code policies?

209,625,"Pilot whales are members of the dolphin family.
A happy ending took place off the southern coast of Florida in August. Five pilot whales were released back into the ocean. Pilot whales are members of the dolphin family.
Rescue workers had nursed the whales back to health after the creatures had become stranded in shallow water in April. Their return to the water marked the first time in history that five whales stranded at the same time were returned to the ocean together.
Using a crane, volunteers lowered the whales headfirst into the water. The whales had been fitted with special devices for scientists to track their progress. As the whales swam away, many volunteers cheered. Some were moved to tears.
Later in the day, people in a helicopter spotted the whales swimming together. Rescuers hoped that the five would join a larger group of nearby whales.
""Walt Disney couldn't write a story better than this,"" said one animal-care worker.

Each Friday, 8-year-old Cody Lozano and his older sister, Cherokee, 9, carry heavy backpacks home from school. Their backpacks are not stuffed with books and supplies. Instead, they are loaded with nutritious food.
The two siblings are members of the BackPack club at Douglas Elementary School in Tyler, Texas. Before they head home on Fridays, students in the club are given backpacks stuffed with donated food for the weekend. The goal of the program is to help kids who face hunger. ""This BackPack club is great for Cherokee and Cody,"" their mother, Karen Lozano, told
""The kids dont have to go hungry.""
Cody and Cherokee are among the nearly 14 million children in the United States whose families dont have enough money to buy food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Free school meal programs help some of those kids during the week, but they still need to eat on the weekends.
Thats where the BackPack program lends a hand. ""We purchase the backpacks and the food, and volunteers [stuff] the backpacks and distribute them,"" says Robert Bush, the executive director of the East Texas Food Bank in Tyler. BackPack programs operate in 39 states to help thousands of hungry children.
Although the BackPack program is one way to help, people are looking for solutions to end
(Poverty is the state of being poor.) About 38 million Americans go hungry each year, and many of those are children. With Thanksgiving around the corner, many people will be thinking about what they can do to help.
of U.S. families cant afford enough food to eat.
children in the United States lives in poverty.

211,155,"Report Points to Mice As Asthma Cause
17 million Americans suffer from asthma. About 5 million kids suffer from asthma.
Each year, more than 3 million kids visit the doctor's office because of asthma attacks.
When you run hard and play hard, you may have trouble catching your breath. Some kids, however, lose their breath even when they're not running or playing. Those kids have
, a disease that makes it hard to breathe.
For many years, scientists have known that cigarette smoke, dog and cat
, dust mites, and cockroaches can trigger asthma attacks. Dander is tiny bits of fur and skin. Now scientists have added a new culprit to that list--mouse dander.
Scientists studied dust samples from 608 U.S. homes with children ages 4 to 9 who suffered from asthma. The scientists found many things in the dust, including evidence of mice. About 95 percent of the homes had at least one room that had mouse dander.
The scientists then tested the kids in each of the homes to see if mouse dander triggered asthma attacks in them. The dander triggered attacks in 18 out of every 100 kids.
As a result of those tests, Dr. Robert Wood of Johns Hopkins University concluded that mice trigger many asthma attacks. In fact, he said, the ""mouse is second in line [after the cockroach in causing asthma attacks].""
Mouse dander was found in many of the houses, even though not all of them had mice. Sometimes, kids tracked dander from mice and other animals into their homes when they came in from outside. Sometimes, the dander was from mice that had been in the home in the past.
Daniel, who lives in Clarksville, Maryland, suffers from asthma. Last year, scientists collected and studied dust from his home. The scientists found cat dander in the dust, even though his family didn't own a cat. It was cat dander that was triggering Daniel's asthma attacks, said Daniel's doctor.
To keep cat dander out of their home, Daniel and his mother frequently wash the floors, walls, and other surfaces. As a result, Daniel's mother said Daniel hasn't had an asthma attack in the last year.
Many kids who suffer from asthma might be able to breathe more easily if they could find ways to keep the dander of mice, cats, and other kinds of animals out of their homes.

, or military students, wear. It also reminds the cadets that they are part of a long tradition, which celebrates its 200th anniversary this year.
On March 16, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson founded a school to train military officers and teach engineering. The school was established at West Point, which had been used as a fort.
The school's first class of students was smaller than the one that entered this year. In 1802, only two students were enrolled at the school. The youngest was 10 years old!
When West Point was founded, the United States was much smaller than it is today. The country extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River.
Until 1817, West Point did not have a set course of study. In that year, Sylvanus Thayer was appointed the superintendent of West Point. He developed the school's curriculum and turned West Point into one of the best schools in the United States. George Woodbridge, who graduated from the school in 1826, explained Thayer's accomplishment, saying, ""His object was to make [us] gentlemen and soldiers.""
The officers who graduated from West Point helped build and defend the United States. They explored the vast areas west of the Mississippi River. They designed the roads, bridges, dams, railroads, and canals that the United States needed as it grew. They also helped design some of our greatest buildings and monuments. For example, they worked on the Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the base of the Statue of Liberty.
Many of the school's graduates have gone on to play important roles in U.S. history. They have been famous generals and U.S. presidents. Both President Ulysses S. Grant and President Dwight D. Eisenhower were generals and graduates of West Point. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, also graduated from West Point.
Even though all West Point graduates serve America in different ways, they all share important lessons learned at the academy. For example, they learn about taking responsibility for one's actions. They also share the school's motto. ""Always there echoes and reechoes in my ears [the motto]: Duty. Honor. Country,"" said General Douglas MacArthur, a West Point graduate.
George Washington Whistler graduated from West Point in 1819. He spent most of his career building railroads. He also built steam locomotives.
While building his first locomotive, Whistler also built the first American train whistle. He placed his whistle on top of the locomotive. He called his locomotive the Whistler. The sound of Whistler's whistle can still be heard on old steam locomotives.

214,115,"Who gets burger bragging rights? A meaty battle is sizzling among three states over the history of the hamburger. In Texas, lawmaker Betty Brown proposed a bill declaring Athens, Texas, the home of the hamburger. Wisconsin has also jumped into the food fight. State Representative Tom Wilson argues that Seymour, Wisconsin, is the place where the famous sandwich was invented.
Not so fast, say the owners of Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut. Established in 1895, the restaurant is maintaining its claim as the burger birthplace. ""It's a well-known and established fact that New Haven is the home of the hamburger,"" says New Haven Mayor John DeStefano Jr. ""In fact, New Haven's claim to the hamburger is even supported and documented in the Library of Congress.""

215,217,"An Iowa class heads into high-tech tests.
Every student in class has a remote control, and the kids are clicking away at the screen. But they aren't changing channels. They're taking a test! Terry Rex's fourth graders at Wings Park Elementary School in Oelwein, Iowa, are using a new kind of classroom technology. Instead of writing with pencils on exam papers, the students use remote controls to take tests.
""It's more fun,"" Courtney Ricchio, 9, told
""I don't have to write, and my hand doesn't get tired."" The remote controls are part of the Classroom Performance System (CPS). When students use CPS to take a test, the questions appear on an electronic screen. Students key in their answers on the remote-control response pad.
Rex is one of the first teachers in Iowa to use CPS. His students use the technology for more than taking tests. They also play learning games with the system. Sam Myott, 9, says his favorite CPS activity is a football game. ""It's a math game with multiplication and subtraction,"" he told
""Since it's on the computer, it's more fun than a worksheet on your desk.""
Some teachers think using CPS to grade a test is more
or a better use of time, than grading a written test. The computer keeps track of the students' answers and prints out their grades at the end of the day. The computer also reports which questions the class found most difficult to answer, so Rex can review them with the group.
Classrooms across the country are trying out new teaching gadgets.
Sixth graders Marina Gagliano and Kerry O'Conner of Wellwood Middle School in Fayetteville, New York, label parts of a microscope on an interactive whiteboard. The whiteboard allows students to use their fingers to click and tap answers on the projected image.
Fourth and fifth graders at Elton Hills Elementary School in Rochester, Minnesota, are on the move. Their classrooms have no chairs! Tiny desks hold high-tech gadgets, such as laptops and iPods, with different lessons. Researchers say this setup may be healthier for students than sitting at desks all day.

216,415,"Thunder provides a wake-up call to head indoors.
""When thunder roars, go indoors,"" says meteroologist Ron Holle.
Scientists say lightning strikes the surface of Earth about 100 times each second. Thunderstorms are most frequent during the spring and summer. During those seasons, experts warn people to be especially aware of the dangers of lightning.
is the flash of light that occurs when electricity moves between clouds or between a cloud and the ground. The huge spark of electricity is like the tiny kind you get when you run a comb through your hair or scuff your feet on a carpetonly much stronger.
A lightning bolt that crackles through the air can reach a temperature of 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun! The intense heat from lightning causes the surrounding air to expand, resulting in the loud sound known as
Thunder is nature's warning to head indoors. As meteorologist Ron Holle from Tucson, Arizona, told
, ""When thunder roars, go indoors."" A
Holle also recommends following the 30-30 rule. If you hear thunder less than 30 seconds after you see lightning, head indoorsthe storm is only about 6 miles away. After the storm ends, wait 30 minutes before going outside. To determine how far away lightning is, count the seconds between the flash and the thunder. Every 10 seconds equals 2 miles.
Lightning strikes the ground in the United States about 25 million times each year! Although getting hit by lightning is unlikely, it is important to stay safe. In the United States, about 60 people are killed each year by lightning.
To stay safe, follow the golden rulehead for cover. ""There is no place outside that is safe from lightning,"" Holle said firmly. ""There are two safe placesinside a [permanent] building or a metal-topped vehicle.""
Lightning expert Ron Holle shared the following tips with
Find shelter in a building or a metal-topped vehicle (not a convertible), and close the windows.
If you're caught outdoors, stay away from open spaces and avoid standing near tall objects, such as trees.
Avoid using electrical equipment, such as computers, TVs, and phones. (Cell phones are safe to use.)
Stay away from sinks and showers. Lightning can travel through water pipes.
Wait 30 minutes after the last sound of thunder or flash of lightning before going outside.

219,467,"How will a growing U.S. population affect the countrys future?
The United States is about to reach a huge milestone. The population will hit 300 million sometime in late October, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The estimate is based on a running total of births, deaths, and the number of people moving in and out of the country.
""[The 300 million mark] is like a birthday. Its a number that gives us an opportunity to see where weve been and think about where we want to go,"" scientist Howard Hogan of the U.S. Census Bureau told
Its been almost 40 years since the U.S. population hit the 200 million mark. The country has added about 2.8 million people each year. On average, a baby is born every eight seconds in the United States.

Hispanic Heritage Month is September 15 to October 15.
Hispanic Americans are the fastest-growing minority group in the United States. Nearly 43 million Hispanic Americans live in the country, reports the U.S. Census Bureau. They are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries.
To honor Hispanic traditions and history, Americans celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. It began on September 15. That date marks the anniversary of independence for Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.
During Hispanic Heritage Month, many Americans will take part in festivals and parades. Students across the country will also spend the month learning how people of Hispanic heritage have added to our countrys history.
WR News / U.S. Census Bureau, July 2005

is a person who comes from one country to live in a new country. Many immigrants come to the United States in search of freedom or a better life for themselves and their families.
Illegal immigrants have been a topic of debates throughout the country this past year. Congress is currently working on changing immigration laws to tighten the countrys borders. The laws may also give many illegal immigrants a chance to become citizens. A
is a person who is a member of a country.
With the 300 million milestone getting closer, more people are discussing the issue of illegal immigration, along with other aspects of the countrys future. For some, the population growth means more power.
Others argue that a bigger population means more traffic jams, fewer jobs, and a strain on natural resources. For example, more people could lead to
Deforestation occurs when farmers and loggers cut down trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads.
""Population growth and change brings opportunities and challenges,"" says Hogan. ""At the Census Bureau, we provide information. ... Thats when weve done our job.""

Anthony Comeau, 10, loves his Lego building blocks. When he heard that students in schools in New Orleans, Louisiana, had no Legos, Anthony decided to
or contribute, some of his own building blocks. ""It's nice to have something to play with in school during free time, so I was happy to give to other kids,"" the fifth grader told
Anthony is just one of thousands of children who donated more than 800,000 Lego blocks to the Lego Brick Drive last year. The collection was organized by the Lego company to help schools in New Orleans. Many of the schools were destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
Children in every state made donations. Anthony's schoolRye Elementary School in Rye, New Hampshiredonated more than 7,000 Lego bricks! The Lego company made a brick-for-brick matching donation. Altogether, more than 1.6 million Legos were given to New Orleans schools.
At a ceremony in November, Lego artist Nathan Sawaya presented his Lego structure of New Orleans. He built the structure using ideas from students who donated building blocks. ""Their suggestions inspired me to create a fun, colorful structure of Lego bricks that symbolizes a bright future for the children of New Orleans,"" Sawaya told

221,359,"Many Americans are flying and hanging the flag today. U.S. law and custom tell us how the flag should be displayed. For example, a flag should never touch the ground andcshould not be flown at night unless it is illuminated. Here are some other rules governing how the flag should be displayed.
The flag can be displayed vertically or horizontally. The union, or blue corner, should be displayed to the upper left of an observer.
The flag should be placed to the right of the speaker. Other flags should be placed to the left.
When a flag is suspended over a street, it should hang with the stars to the north or east.
The flag should be flown at half-staff only during periods of official morning. The flag should be raised to the top of its pole and then lowered to half-staff. At the end of the day, when the flag is lowered, it should be raised to the top before it is lowered.
The American flag should fly above a state flag.

223,785,"Twelve-year-old Sydney Davis is riding the wristband wave. Inspired by the popular yellow wristbands introduced by champion cyclist Lance Armstrong to raise money for cancer research, Sydney had her own idea. ""I thought, 'Why can't we have one for diabetes?' "" she told
since she was in kindergarten. She is one of 18 million people in the United States with this disease. In a person with diabetes, the body makes little or no
. That is a substance that the body needs to help convert
, a sugar in food, into energy.
With the help of her friend Daniel Rosen, 13, who also has diabetes, Sydney ordered blue wristbands with the slogan ""Cure Diabetes Today.""
The two friends started selling the wristbands in their New Jersey community to raise money for research aimed at curing diabetes. After only a month, they had sold 10,000 bracelets and donated the contributions to the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center in New York City.

226,26,"Gary Gero says he has the best job in the world. As one of Hollywood's top animal trainers, Gero prepares his animal ""talent"" for their onscreen performances.
Recently, Gero completed work for the movie
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
, which opens in theaters June 4. His team, which included six trainers for this movie, worked with dozens of animals. Their lineup for the film included cats, dogs, owls, rats, crows-and even a hippo!
Fang the dog, Mrs. Norris the cat, Scabbers the rat, and Hedwig the owl star in this film. They also appeared in the previous
To train the animals, Gero and his team reward them with food and praise when they follow instructions correctly. Owls may get a reputation for being wise, but Gero knows differently. Gero told
that Hedwig learned to fly in front of a fan-a trick that was mastered after six months of training.
""Owls are difficult to train because they're not very clever,"" he said. ""It takes a long time to teach them things.""

227,528,"Steroid scandal blocks slugger from Hall of Fame.
Two star athletes will join the National Baseball Hall of Fame this summerCal Ripken Jr. and Tony Gwynn. Former St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire, however, will have to wait for admission.
McGwire didn't come close to receiving the 75 percent of the votes required for a player to be elected. This is the first year McGwire was
or qualified, for the honor. (To be on the ballot, an athlete must be retired for at least five years.)
when he broke a major-league record with 70 home runs in the 1998 season. Steroids are drugs that build up muscles to increase strength. During his career, McGwire hit 583 home runs, the seventh highest of all time. Before joining the Cardinals, he played first base for the Oakland Athletics.
Retired Baltimore Orioles shortstop Ripken and San Diego Padres outfielder Gwynn have never been suspected of using steroids. They are admired by many baseball fans for their fairness and honesty. Both played their entire careers on one team (see ""
""). In July, the pair will be
or admitted, into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.
McGwire has never openly admitted to steroid use. However, during a hearing before the U.S. Congress in 2005, he did not deny using the muscle-building drugs. That testimony has led many people to believe that McGwire did use steroids. In 2002, Major League Baseball banned the use of the drugs, which are
After learning he was not voted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, McGwire defended his baseball career. ""I had an absolutely wonderful career that I'm very proud of,"" he told the
newspaper of California State University, Fullerton. McGwire added that he wasn't in control of getting into the Hall of Fame. ""I was in control of hitting the ball.""
Check out the stats for the two newest members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.
Ripken grew up near Baltimore, Maryland, where he played pro baseball throughout his 21-year career. He was a two-time American League Most Valuable Player and set a record for playing the most games in a row: 2,632.
Gwynn grew up in California, where he played basketball and baseball. He decided to play baseball professionally and became one of the sport's best hitters. During his 20-year career, he led the National League in batting average eight times.

228,49,"This greeting wishes others good fortune and happiness in the Chinese New Year. People kick off the holiday on February 18 this year.
The Chinese calendar is split up into months based on the
or moon, cycle. The Chinese New Year begins on the first new moon falling between January 21 and February 20. It ends on the full moon 15 days later, when the moon is brightest.
People in Chinese communities around the world celebrate the holiday with music, dancing, fireworks, feasts, and parades. At celebrations, people wear red clothes and give children red envelopes with money for good luck. Red is considered a color that wards off bad luck.
The Chinese New Year ends with the Lantern Festival. On that night, children carry lanterns in a parade under the light of the full moon. The highlight of the Lantern Festival parade is the traditional dragon dance, when dancers guide a long, colorful dragon made of silk, paper, and bamboo through the streets.
Each year in the Chinese calendar is named after one of 12 animals. Legend has it that people born in each animal's year inherit some of that animal's qualities. This year is the Year of the Pig. People born in pig years are considered honest, kind, and well informed.

230,238,"Laura Bush (above) thinks that reading is one of the most important things you can do.
kid reporter Fabien Navidi-Kasmai visited the White House on a special assignment. The 10-year-old found out what it's like to be a member of the press. He interviewed First Lady Laura Bush as part of the National Book Festival in early October.
The National Book Festival, which was held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., celebrates books and reading. Approximately 75,000 people attended the festival this year. Laura Bush told Fabien that she was happy to see such a large turnout at the festival.
Fabien was nervous before the interview, but the first lady quickly put him at ease. They discussed the Harry Potter book series and shared their love of reading.
In fact, the fifth grader learned that Laura Bush especially enjoyed reading Weekly Reader when she was in elementary school. ""Reading is one of the most important things you can do,"" the first lady told Fabien. ""If you love to read, you'll never be lonely-you'll always have a friend.""

231,385,"Rosa's paws are big, her nose is wet, and her coat is fluffy. But she doesn't live a dog's life. The 9-year-old shepherd is a land mine-detection dog.Rosa's nose has sniffed out some of the world's 50 million
. Land mines are explosive devices left in the ground from wars.A land mine can explode if someone touches it, killing or injuring the person. Children often mistake the land mines for toys.
Now Rosa's job is to teach U.S. children about the dangers of land mines so they can help fight the problem. I recently caught up with the clever canine at Paradise Valley Elementary School, located in Casper, Wyoming.I watched as Rosa did her job sniffing out some fake land mines. ""She's cool,"" gushed fifth grader Josh Yelton.
Rosa's visit kicked off the Children Against Land Mines Program, also known as CHAMPS. The goal of the program is to raise money to buy, train, and transport mine-sniffing dogs.Wyoming students raised $5,000 in quarters in just a few short weeks, and adults chipped in an additional $8,000. The money will help sponsor a new dog.
A dog's sense of smell and smarts make it the best land-mine locator. In fact, a team of six humans can search about 120 square feet of land in a day. A team of six dogs can search up to 3,000 square feet in a day's time.
The pooch paid for by the Wyoming students will be named Wyoming. That dog will help find buried land mines in Sri Lanka, a country off the southern coast of India.
Land mines not only injure and kill many people, but they also
, or stop, people from moving around freely. For example, the lush fields of Sri Lanka should be filled with crops. Instead, many fields lie unplanted. Farmers are afraid that mines litter their fields. Wyoming's job will be to help get rid of those land mines.
A Sri Lanka government official told me what a huge effect Wyoming and other mine-sniffing dogs will make in his country.
He said, ""The best part of the CHAMPS program will be when all the land mines have been removed.""
In what other ways do dogs help humans?

232,112,"What's purple and gold, wears sneakers, has horns and a tail, and weighs several hundred pounds? A statue of a cow, of course!
People in several U.S. cities are being treated to herds of cow sculptures. The sculptures are part of Cows on Parade.
Cows on Parade started in Switzerland in 1998. A U.S. businessman saw the cows and brought the idea to the United States in 1999. This year, about 1,000 cows are on display in several U.S. cities.
Each cow is made of fiberglass and was decorated by a local artist, including some kids. The cows will be left on display until October.

233,648,"Coins were available for buying and selling at the World's Fair of Money.
Collectible coins and currency worth about $1 billion were on display at the World's Fair of Money. The fair was held this August in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
During the five-day event, money was displayed for looking at, buying, and selling. Some coins were worth as little as half a cent. Other coins were worth millions.
The event drew thousands of coin lovers from around the world. That's not surprising--coin collecting is one of the world's most popular hobbies.
, or a way to make money in the future. Most collectors, however, are not in it for the money. They participate in the hobby because of each coin's story. One coin expert referred to money as ""history that you can hold in your hand.""
Among the fair's most valuable coins were two Liberty Head nickels. The nickels were worth between $2 million and $3 million each.
A 1794 coin couldn't be missed at the fair either. Experts say the coin, believed to be the first silver dollar in the United States, is worth about $10 million.
Coin hobbyists point out that just because a coin is old doesn't necessarily mean it's valuable. A coin's worth depends on how many exist, on how many people want it, and on its condition.
Coin collectors are used to paying more for a coin than its original value. They say their hobby is worth every penny.
Each day, the government prints 37 million bills, worth about $696 million.
About 18 tons of ink per day go into printing those bills.
If you had $10 billion and you spent $1 every second of every day, you would go broke in 317 years.

234,548,"Brazil protects part of the Amazon rain forest.
Jaguars and anteaters in northern South America can rest easy. A section of the Amazon rain forest as big as Illinois was recently placed under government protection. The land in Brazil links to protected areas in other South American countries, including Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana.
In total, these protected forests cover nearly 58,000 square miles. The land also contains more than 25 percent of the world's
A tropical rain forest is a dense forest in a warm region that gets at least 100 inches of rainfall a year.
Environmentalists from the group Conservation International say this area of the northern Amazon has more
than all tropical forests on the planet. Biodiversity is the variety of plants and animals in an environment. The Amazon is home to more
or types, of plants and animals than any other place in the world.
Since 1970, more than 232,000 square miles of the Amazon rain forest have been destroyed. That is nearly the size of Texas! The destruction has endangered many animal species. Experts predict that the continued
or clearing of trees, at this rate would endanger the entire region by 2050.
Officials were especially concerned about preserving the forests. Part of the area is believed to contain more than half of all bird, animal, and plant species found in the Amazon. Many endangered animals, including the giant Amazon otter, make their homes there. Under the government's plan, those parts of the Amazon will be off-limits to the public.
""If any tropical rain forest on Earth remains intact a century from now, it will be this portion of [the northern Amazon],"" says Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International.
The Amazon rain forest is the world's largest tropical rain forest. It covers about 2 million square milesroughly two-thirds the size of the United States. The map shows the location of the Amazon rain forest and its newly protected areas.

To enter the exhibit, visitors walk through a turnstile similar to one they would find at a baseball stadium. Inside, more than 100 objects from 1840 through the present are on display. The exhibit includes scorecards, baseball cards, bats, painted baseballs, artwork, and even an autographed quilt among its many items.
""It's baseball history and trivia,"" Elizabeth Warren told
when describing the exhibit she organized. ""It combines baseball and art.""
Warren says that Jackie Robinson is depicted on many objects, more than any other baseball player. In 1947, Jackie Robinson made history. He became the first African American baseball player in the major leagues when he joined the Dodgers. At that time, the Dodgers were located in Brooklyn. Today, they are in Los Angeles.
""Jackie Robinson was a hero both on and off the field,"" said Warren. ""He's such a great role model.""
The exhibit runs through February 1, 2004

236,279,"Thirteen-year-old Scott Cory may one day become the Tiger Woods of the rock-climbing world. Like the golf star, this eighth grader is one of the world's youngest and most accomplished athletes.H3:Record Breaker
With a Spider-Man-like ability to cling to rocks, Scott holds several records. He is the youngest person to climb to the
, or peak, of Half Dome and El Capitan in one day each. Those famous granite peaks are located in Yosemite National Park in California.Now Scott has set his sights higher. This spring, he plans to climb both mountains within 24 hours. Scaling nearly 4,900 feet of rock is equal to climbing four Empire State Buildings in a day.
Only a few experienced adult climbers have accomplished this feat in 24 hours. Climbers may take up to eight days to reach both summits. Leading Scott on his
, or journey, will be a skilled adult climber.
At 3:30 am, Scott will begin climbing a route on El Capitan called The Nose
At 3:30 pm, he will ""top out"" on the summit
At 5:40 pm, after a two hour hike down El Capitan, Scott will begin another two hour trek to Half Dome's base.
At 7:30 pm, Scott will begin climbing the Northwest Face. He will reach Half Dome's summit at 2:30am.
Scott has been climbing mountains since he was 7 years old. He first fell in love with the sport during a family vacation.
Why does Scott like the challenge of the sport so much? He sums it up this way: ""Climbing is fun for me.""
He also points out that climbing has taught him valuable lessons. ""You learn about trying over and over and not giving up.""

? This new movie is about a boy who boards a magical train to the North Pole.
is based on the classic children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. To make the book into a movie, filmmakers used a new type of technology called performance capture.
spoke to Douglas Chiang about his work on
. Chiang created the artwork for the movie to capture the feeling of the book.
: What does a production designer do?
Douglas Chiang: I get to play with the visual design of the movie. I read the script, come up with ideas, [draw] them on paper, and show the director.
: Do you have advice for kids who want a job like yours?
DC: Study the basics. You need to learn how to draw properly, then worry about techniques.
DC: It's really about believing in yourself and believing that anything is possible.
This latest technology helped filmmakers to get the movie to resemble the beautiful paintings in the children's book. How does performance capture work? Tiny sensors, which look like mini jewels, captured the actors' movements.
Actor Tom Hanks performed with 150 sensors attached to his face. He also wore special body gear with more sensors. Hanks acted on a stage that resembled the inside of a black box.
While Hanks acted inside the black box, special cameras picked up light reflected from the sensors. The cameras then sent the information to computers.
Finally, Hanks's performance was placed into a computerized setting of the book. What the audience will see on the screen is part real and part computer animation.
is the first movie shot this way. It enabled Hanks to play five characters, including the boy and the conductor!
""Our dreams were always at work,"" Hanks said.

238,361,"The Heat Is On: Will Global Warming Affect Animals?
Polar bears in Alaska are having trouble catching one of their main meals--ringed seals. To get to the seals, the bears often walk across islands of ice floating in the water.
Ice throughout Alaska is melting earlier and faster in the spring than it did several years ago. So polar bears don't have as much time to catch seals before the ice melts. As a result, polar bears are catching fewer seals.
Ice along Alaska's coast is melting because the temperature is higher worldwide. In the last 100 years, Earth's temperature has risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit.
. Global warming is changing the environment worldwide. As a result, many plants and animals are being affected, say scientists from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
As temperatures rise, more and more animals will have to
, or move, in order to survive, said scientist Jay Malcolm of the WWF.
Many plants and animals that can't adjust or migrate will not survive the rise in temperature, said WWF scientists. In some areas of the world, the WWF says, as many as two in ten species of plants and animals will die out by the year 2100.
Here are some examples of how global warming is affecting some animals in North America.
The numbers on the map show where each animal can be found.
The black guillemot (GIL-uh-maht) is a bird that lives on an island off Alaska's coast. It eats Arctic cod, a fish that lives in water under ice. Rising temperatures have caused much of the ice to melt. The Arctic cod has moved to other parts of the sea where water is still covered with ice. The guillemot no longer has enough fish to eat.
The American bistort is a plant that lives in Mount Rainier National Park. The Edith's checkerspot butterfly drinks nectar from bistort flowers. The warming temperatures have caused the butterflies to hatch earlier, before the flowers bloom, so the butterflies don't have enough food right after they hatch.
Global warming is actually helping some animals.
The Mexican vole lives in areas with warm temperatures. It is spreading northward into Arizona and Colorado because of the rise in temperatures there.
For years, red fire ants lived in the warm southern part of the United States. Today, because of rising temperatures, they are spreading northward.
Scientists have learned that global warming is already affecting Earth. ""We should not expect the effects of global warming to take place 50 years in the future,"" said scientist Rafe Sagarin. ""It's happening right now.""
Scientists agree that Earth has been getting warmer for the last 100 years. They don't agree on
Gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming. Carbon dioxide in the air traps heat from the sun, causing Earth's temperature to rise.
Volcanoes and forest fires release carbon dioxide into the air. Some scientists blame the rise in temperature on volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and other natural events.
Other scientists blame human actions for the rise in temperature. They say Earth has always had volcanoes and forest fires, so why is Earth warming now? Those scientists say the carbon dioxide from automobiles and factories is causing the recent increase in global warming.

239,232,"The Liberty Bell no longer rings today. During the move, wireless technology will be attached to the bell.
The Liberty Bell is about to get a new home. This fall, it will move from its current location at Liberty Bell Pavilion in Philadelphia to a new building down the street.
Why the change of address? It is part of improvements being made to the area where the bell now hangs.
Moving the bell, which weighs 2,080 pounds, could be tricky. Movers want to make sure that no additional harm is done to the bell's famous crack.
During the move, scientists will attach wireless technology to the bell. That technology will sound an alarm if strain from the move causes the crack to enlarge. Earlier this year, scientists conducted a test using wireless technology, and the crack did not appear to change.
""The bell is fragile because of the way it was [made],"" said one historian. The bell was built mostly of copper.
In 1752, the bell was brought to Philadelphia from England. The bell was rung to mark special events. It became a symbol of freedom in the United States. It was rung to call people to the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence on July 8, 1776. That document was signed on July 4, 1776.
This is not the first time the Liberty Bell has moved. From 1885 to 1915, the Liberty Bell traveled across the country, taking part in several World's Fair exhibits. During those years, it visited more than 400 cities and towns, including New Orleans, St. Louis, and San Francisco.
The last time the Liberty Bell changed location was in 1976.
At that time, it was taken from Independence Hall to its current nearby home. Many people consider Independence Hall the birthplace of the United States. Both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were signed there.
The Liberty Bell cracked the first time it was rung in 1752. However, the bell was rebuilt twice in its early years. The Liberty Bell cracked again sometime between 1817 and 1846. How it cracked remains a mystery. According to one report, its famous split occurred in February 1846 while it was ringing to celebrate George Washington's birthday.

Polygons - The exterior angle of a polygon
The exterior angle at a vertex (corner) of a shape is made by continuing one edge.
The exterior angles of a polygon add up to 360.
Imagine walking round the outside of the polygon. By the time you get back to where you started you have completed one full turn. So all the corners you turned must add to 360.
In this diagram the exterior angles have been given different colours. You can see how they can be put together to make a full circle.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The proposal
Meanwhile, a nobleman called Paris visits Capulet to ask him if he can marry Juliet. Capulet asks him to wait two more summers, but suggest he romances his daughter and invites Paris to a party that evening. He gives his servant a list of names of people to invite.
The servant can't read. He bumps into Benvolio and Romeo and asks them to read the list for him. Rosaline's name, amongst others, is on the list. The servant doesn't know that Benvolio and Romeo are Montagues and invites them to the party, too.
Lady Capulet is sent to tell Juliet about Paris's proposal. They aren't very close so she asks Juliet's Nurse to stay and listen. Juliet will be fourteen on Lammas-eve, 31st July. Juliet tells her mother that she has never thought about marriage, but promises to take a look at Paris.

Variation and classification - Inherited & environmental
Some variation within a species is inherited, and some variation is due to the environment.
Variation in a characteristic that is a result of genetic inheritance from the parents is called
Children usually look a little like their father, and a little like their mother, but they will not be identical to either of their parents. This is because they get half of their inherited features from each parent.
Each egg cell and each sperm cell contains half of the
needed for an individual. When these join at fertilisation a new cell is formed with all the genetic information needed for an individual.
Here are some examples of inherited variation in humans:
Gender is inherited variation too, because whether you are male or female is a result of the genes you inherited from your parents.
Characteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle. For example, if you eat too much you will become heavier, and if you eat too little you will become lighter. A plant in the shade of a big tree will will grow taller as it tries to reach more light.
Variation caused by the surroundings is called
. Here are some other examples of features that show environmental variation:
flower colour in hydrangeas - these plants produce blue flowers in acidic soil and pink flowers in alkaline soil.
Some features vary because of a mixture of inherited causes and environmental causes. For example, identical twins inherit exactly the same features from their parents. But if you take a pair of twins, and twin 'A' is given more to eat than twin 'B', twin 'A' is likely to end up heavier.

245,182,"It is hard to answer this question just by looking at the fractions. However, if you write the fractions with the same bottom number, the question will be easy.
4 and 7 both divide into 28, so rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 28.
To compare fractions, first write them with the same number at the bottom.

246,497,"> Atmosphere and setting - Implicit meaning
- it's suggested, but not openly stated. Implicit meaning can be harder to figure out than explicit meaning. Writers like to be clever and draw you into their text. It's up to you to make your mind up about a setting, in just the same way that it's up to you what to make of a new place you visit. Writers often use language in clever ways to build up a sense of atmosphere and setting.
Take a look at the following extract from Robert Westall's novel, 'Urn Burial'. Ralph has been captured by an alien race...
This was the worst nightmare yet. He was standing with his back pressed against a smooth wall cold as ice. The cold nibbled at his buttocks and legs; it ran up and down the knobbles of his spine, making him shiver; it invaded his lungs so he could hardly breathe; he felt he had been shivering a long time.
In the extract, the writer intends to create a very creepy, sinister atmosphere. The way that he describes Ralph's imprisonment makes it sound very unpleasant. He is ""pressed"" against a wall that is ""cold as ice"" and the cold is creeping into every part of his body, making him shiver. Ralph also feels as if he can ""hardly breathe"" because of the cold.
. The simile; ""a smooth wall cold as ice"", helps the reader relate to Ralph as they will know what ice feels like. The writer also uses personification; the cold ""nibbled"" at Ralph, it ""ran up and down"" his back and ""invaded"" his lungs. This makes the cold sound as if it were alive, running over and into Ralph, trying to eat away at him. This adds to the feeling that he has been overpowered and is in danger.
What does it all mean? Find out with this activity.

More on transformations - Fractional scale factor
You already know that the size of an enlargement is described by its scale factor.
For example, a scale factor of 2 means that the new shape is twice the size of the original. A scale factor of 3 means that the new shape is three times the size of the original.
It therefore follows that a scale factor of

What is the scale factor of enlargement in this diagram?
Remember that OA is 6 units and OA' is 2 units.
BC is 3 units and B'C' is 1 unit, so each side on the image is
of the length of the original shape.
Always check which is the object and which is the image, so that you don't confuse the scale factors. For example, a scale factor of 2 might be mistaken for a scale factor of
, or a scale factor of 3 mistaken for a scale factor of

251,112,"> Drama - Working from a script
There's much more to acting than just reading a script out loud. If you're nervous, it's tempting to read the lines really quickly, using the same tone of voice all the way through, but this isn't very interesting for your audience.
Try to think of the punctuation as musical notes telling you when to pause for a breath (or for dramatic effect!). Don't be tempted to take a little break at the end of each line - the piece might not make sense.
To understand this, first read the script below, pausing at the end of each line. Then try again using the punctuation as your guide for when to pause.
Juliet is waiting for the nurse to come home and tell her whether the wedding with Romeo is still on. Time is ticking and she's pretty fed up.
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood
She would be as swift in motion as a ball:
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
But old folks, many feign as they were dead -
Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.
Which way worked better? Using the punctuation as your guide makes it sound like a real person thinking aloud.

Variation and classification - Variety within a species
Within a population of animals, plants or any living organisms, there will be
. Within each species the individuals with the variations best suited to the environment will survive better than the others. More of them will survive to reproduce than the others. When they do, they pass on the genetic information for these variations to their offspring.
Species gradually evolve in this way. This process is called
Over time a population can change so much it may even become a new species, unable to reproduce successfully with individuals of the original species.
to produce new varieties of a species. A variety is a type of a particular species that is different in some clear way from other varieties of that species.
For example, pedigree dogs come in lots of different varieties, called breeds of dog. They may be different colours and sizes, but they are all still dogs. They are all still the same species. Different varieties of dog have been produced by selective breeding.
Suppose you wanted a variety of cow that produced a lot of milk. This is what you could do:
choose or select the cows in your herd that produce the most milk
select the offspring that produce the most milk
keep repeating the process of selection and breeding until you achieve your goal.
The key here is to identify the feature you want, and only breed from the individuals that have that feature. Here are some examples of what selective breeding can produce:
hens that lay big eggs of a particular colour
tomato plants that produce lots of tomatoes
crops that are resistant to certain plant diseases.

The Tempest second key extract - Language
Think about how language is used in the two Key Extracts - for example, patterns of language that appear in both, or how language changes from the first to the second extract.
Love is strongly linked to magic. Miranda thinks that Ferdinand is a ""spirit"". He thinks that she is a ""goddess"". It is strongly suggested that their love at first sight is simply an illusion.
Miranda and Ferdinand's speeches are very honest and loving. Ferdinand is ""humble"", whilst Miranda talks of her ""modesty"".
When Prospero describes love he uses terms linked to control, e.g ""They are both in either's powers""; his daughter will ""control"" Ferdinand.
Prospero recognises that Miranda and Ferdinand's love is real and beyond their control. He compares it to a disease. He says his daughter is ""infected"".
There are lots of references to freedom and slavery. Prospero promises to free Ariel; he threatens to ""manacle"" Ferdinand. Ferdinand doesn't mind being a slave as long as he has Miranda to love.
Ferdinand uses a metaphor linked to slavery to describe his past crushes. He admits that he only suffers the indignity of being Prospero's slave for Miranda's sake.
The exchanges between characters are short to speed up the action.
The speeches between Miranda and Ferdinand are much longer. The content is moving and romantic.

If there are two middle numbers, the median is the mean of those two numbers.
Find the median of each of the following sets of numbers:
a) 2, 4, 7, 1, 9, 3, 11
b) 4, 1, 3, 10, 6, 9,
1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11
The middle number is 4. Therefore the median is
there are two middle numbers (4 and 6), so we find the mean of these two numbers. The median is therefore:
If there are n numbers, the median will be the (n + 1)  2 = th number
If there are 3 numbers, the median will be the (3 + 1)  2 = 2nd number.
If there are 4 numbers, the median will be the (4 + 1)  2 = 2

Romeo and Juliet first key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Montagues and Capulets have just had a fight in a public place in Verona. Prince Escalus stopped it and warned that if it happens again, those involved will be punished by death.
The first set scene begins with Montague asking Benvolio how the fight began.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
Benvolio tells him that servants from both families were fighting and that when he tried to stop them, Tybalt turned on him.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.
After that, lots of other people joined in until the Prince came and stopped the fighting.
Lady Montague is worried about her son, Romeo. He wasn't involved in the fighting but she wonders where he is. Benvolio explains that he saw him skulking about before dawn. Montague says that this is not unusual behaviour for Romeo: people have seen him crying and sighing on his own before daybreak before.
The audience finds out a lot about Romeo before he even walks onto the stage. What are your first impressions of Romeo?
Montague says he has tried to talk to his son, but he won't open up to him.
Parents and children - You might be able to sympathise with Romeo not wanting to talk about his feelings with his father.
He says he is like a flower that never gets to open because it has been stopped from blossoming by a worm that has eaten into it.
This is a simile to show that no one can get near to Romeo whilst he is in such a bad mood.
When Romeo arrives, Montague and Lady Montague leave Benvolio to try and find out why he is in such a bad mood all of the time.
- Time - There are lots of references to time in this play. The events in this play take place in just less than one week. Romeo and Juliet both feel that time drags whilst they are apart from one another.
Romeo tries to explain that he is in love with a girl who doesn't love him back. He doesn't make himself very clear though and Benvolio has to work hard to get him to tell him about it. Romeo comes up with lots of confusing descriptions of love to try and explain how he feels.
The list of opposites in Romeo's speech ('loving hate', 'heavy lightness', etc) are called oxymorons. They give us an important clue to his character. His confusing speech shows us how confusing the world is to him as a young man. It also shows us that Romeo likes to play with language.
""Here's much to do with hate, but more with love""
- Love and Hate - Romeo is commenting on the street brawl that has just happened: it's about hating an opposing family and feeling love and loyalty towards their own. Taken on its own, the line sums up the play as a whole: it's about two families that hate each other, but more about the love between Romeo and Juliet.
Romeo speaks in rhyme to try to describe how he feels.
Romeo's speeches are often in rhyme. He also likes wordplay, metaphors and similes. Romeo loves to talk about love, but does he really know what love is at this point? You could say that Romeo, at this point is 'all talk and no action'.
He says that love is like smoke made from the hot breath of lovers and that the flames are the sparks in their eyes. But if it doesn't work out, love is a sea of tears. He also describes love as a kind of madness and a poison.
- Love - The language that Romeo uses to describe love gives us an idea of what Romeo believes love to be at this point. For him it's about desire, which sounds like lust rather than true love.
Benvolio brings Romeo back to earth with a straightforward question: who is the girl he is in love with?
Whilst Romeo is pouring his heart out, Benvolio's responses could be performed in a number of ways- sympathetic, impatient, humorous. All three work.
Romeo still won't give him a straight answer though.
Romeo and Benvolio are good friends. We can see this through the way they banter with one another.
He tells Benvolio that the girl is very beautiful but she doesn't want to fall in love. It seems that she is very pure and Romeo says that because she isn't interested in men, her beauty will be wasted!
- Love - We never meet Rosaline in the play and only have Romeo's description of her to go by. It's hard to tell whether she really is a very good girl or whether she simply doesn't fancy Romeo!
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste
Benvolio says that the best thing to do is to forget her. He advises Romeo to look at other attractive girls. Romeo swears that he can never forget her; he'll never find anyone as beautiful as her. Benvolio bets that he will.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - Performance
There are a lot of different ways to perform a particular scene. How is the drama created in the two Key Extracts?
From the table below, you will see there are elements of the two Key Extracts that are quite similar. But whereas there is some humour in the first extract, the second extract is more moving and romantic. This needs to be brought out in the performance.
Set in a public place in Verona.
Set in Capulet's Orchard - the two characters are alone.
Is a more gentle and humorous end to what has been a very tense and action-packed scene.
A moving and romantic extract that contrasts with the scene before it which is full of Mercutio's rude jokes.
Montague and Benvolio describe how Romeo has been behaving, before he actually appears on stage.
Whereas in the first extract, Romeo talks about love, in the second extract we see how he behaves when he is in love.
The movement of characters is less obvious - it's just two characters having a chat. The director has to make sure that this is interesting to look at on stage.
Again, in the second extract, two characters are talking. The director has to think creatively so that the action is interesting to watch.
The potential for humour comes from the banter and word-play between Romeo and Benvolio.
The language of this extract creates a romantic and moving tone.
Once you understand how the audience should feel, you can decide how you might direct particular parts of the play.
Answer the question you have, not the question you would like.

262,37,"> More on formulas - Multiplying brackets
When multiplying expressions in brackets, make sure that everything inside the bracket is multiplied by the term (or number) outside the bracket.
Use either method, but remember that everything inside the bracket must be multiplied by the term (or number) outside the bracket.
What happens when we have more than a single term or number outside the bracket? What happens when we have another bracket.
For example, if we want to expand
, we need to make sure that everything in the second bracket is multiplied by everything in the first.
We can do this in two ways, using boxes or lines.

A sunny beach gives you all sorts of possibilities to use your senses. For instance:
The shouts of excited children mingled with the screams of seagulls and the soft roar of breakers on the sandy beach
. I looked down the beach towards the blue sea criss-crossed by the white triangles of sails
. The hot sun burned down onto my back and neck
, and the air was heavy with the smells of suntan oil, sea salt and ice cream
. I could taste the vinegary tang of chips even before I found the busy fish and chip shop
You don't want to overdo the senses, but they are a useful way of making your writing more interesting. Another way of doing this is to look for more original words and phrases to write something that is fresh, not stale.
Avoid clichs. These are phrases that are used so much that they have lost their power. For instance, if you are ""over the moon"" about something, or ""waiting until the cows come home"", then you are using clichs. Look for original phrases instead.
How could you improve the following sentences?
1) He was scared out of his skin.
2) The trees danced in the breeze.
3) She felt that her heart would break.
1) He felt his fingers uncontrollably tighten and clench together so that his nails dug deep into his palms.
2)The wind gradually got stronger and they could see the leaves on the top branches swirling rhythmically, rising and falling.
3) She knew that she wouldn't be able to speak or even look at him, and she kept blinking back the tears.
Hopefully, you'll find these second versions more accurate, creative and involving. So write down exactly what you see in your head when you imagine the scene. Don't take short cuts!
Can you match Viral Vinnie's appetite for English, Maths and Science?

Fractions - Mixed numbers and improper fractions
A whole number can be written as
, because it is made up of a whole number and a fraction.
, because the top number is bigger than the bottom number.
Converting from a mixed number to an improper fraction
You can write the whole number part as a fraction, then add the fractions together.
Converting from improper fractions to mixed numbers
You can separate out the fraction into smaller fractions, like this:
Another way to convert an improper fraction is to find how many whole numbers you get, by using a division.
We start by dividing the top number by the bottom number.
17 divided by 5 is 3 remainder 2.
So the whole number part is 3, and the remainder 2 means there are
= 20  7 = 2 remainder 6, so
If your calculator has a fraction button you can use this to convert from improper fractions to mixed numbers. Type in the improper fraction, press '=', and the calculator will convert it to a mixed number.

Magnets and electric current - Bar magnets
Before we look at electromagnets let's recap
magnets. This means that their magnetism is there all the time and cannot be turned on or off. They have two poles:
The north pole is normally shown as
Magnets are made from magnetic materials. These are metals that can be magnetised or will be attracted to a magnet. Most materials are not magnetic, but
is mostly iron, so steel is magnetic too.
If you bring two bar magnets together, there are two things that can happen:
if you bring a north pole and a south pole together, they
if you bring two north poles together, or two south poles together, they
and the magnets push each other away.
We say that unlike poles attract, and like poles repel.
How can you test if a piece of metal is a magnet. Seeing if it sticks to a magnet is not a good test, because unmagnetised iron, steel, cobalt and nickel objects will be attracted to either pole of a magnet.
So you can't test for what it is attracted to. But you can test what it repels:
You can only show that an object is a magnet if it repels a known magnet.

The second type of rock we'll look at is igneous rock.
The inside of the Earth is very hot - hot enough to melt rocks. Molten (liquid) rock forms when rocks melt. The molten rock is called
. When the magma cools and solidifies, a type of rock called igneous rock forms.
Igneous rocks contain randomly arranged interlocking crystals. The size of the crystals depends on how quickly the molten magma solidified. The more
You may have done an experiment at school with a substance called salol. If molten salol cools slowly, you get big crystals. If it cools quickly, you get small crystals.
If the magma cools quickly, small crystals form in the rock. This can happen if the magma erupts from a volcano. Obsidian and basalt are examples of this type of rock. They are called
igneous rocks because they form from eruptions of magma.
If the magma cools slowly, large crystals form in the rock. This can happen if the magma cools deep underground. Granite and gabbro are examples of this type of rock. They are
igneous rocks because they form from magma underground.
Unlike sedimentary rocks, igneous rocks do not contain any fossils. This is because any fossils in the original rock will have melted when the magma formed.

The second half of the writing focuses on the points in favour of the healthier options. Again, if you want any further information, click the check ideas button to see our comments.
However, this evidence does not show the whole picture. Many students say they would prefer to see more choice in the canteen. They point out that eating jacket potatoes every day is boring, and that the cold fillings are inadequate in winter. It has been suggested that more sandwiches, salads and a bigger range of hot main meals would be much more appealing. Many of these students currently bring their own food to school simply because they feel there is so little choice. These numbers include Grange High's many vegetarians.
Now the writer moves on to the views in favour of healthy food. The impersonal tone is maintained in the first sentence. The formal connective 'However' is used to signal a change in the argument. The writer returns to the facts - jacket potatoes are the only healthy option - and suggests some alternatives. She builds on the evidence mentioned earlier. She is building up towards her conclusion now.
Nevertheless, it remains true that junk food is popular and easy to produce. If students start going off site they may get injured or into trouble, and the school could be held responsible. Therefore, it seems impractical to ban junk food altogether. But is there another answer? I believe there is: the canteen could offer a wider selection, including healthier options, for one term, and see whether it is successful. If it is, and we see more students using the canteen and eating the healthy options, the canteen could make this change permanent.
This detailed paragraph begins to suggest the solution. Formal connectives are used ('nevertheless' and 'therefore') to signal that the argument is coming to an end. She returns to a personal expression, 'I believe there is...' because she is summing up her findings.
In conclusion, the solution seems clear: if a good selection of food is provided then everyone will be happy - and the canteen will almost certainly gain more customers. Thank you for your time.
The final paragraph is short and direct. It sums up the main conclusion of the speech in a positive way: 'everyone will be happy' and 'the canteen will almost certainly gain...' which leaves the audience with a clear picture of her final point of view. Rather than trying to persuade people one way or the other, the speech has tried to suggest a solution where everyone gains. This isn't always possible, but it can be a helpful way of concluding without sitting on the fence and telling the audience to make up their own minds. As you can probably guess, this is an excellent answer.
Make all that writing make sense. Try this!

269,374,"Now consider the following extract. Read through it carefully and note down three things you think it tells us about the main character. Once you've done this, compare your ideas against ours.
Stanley didn't have many friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.
What does this extract show us about the main character?
Stanley is another big male, but it is clear that the writer wants us to react differently to him than we did to Jim Wellings in the earlier extract.
Stanley is a lonely boy, because he ""didn't have many friends at home"". He is bullied and teased, even by adults. The fact that the teacher causes him ""embarrassment"" by showing him up in front of the class proves that he feels uncomfortable about his weight.

270,382,"> Magnets and electric current - Electromagnets
When an electric current flows in a wire it creates a magnetic field around the wire.
we can strengthen the magnetic field. Electromagnets are made from coils like this.
We can make an electromagnet stronger by doing these things:
The magnetic field around an electromagnet is just the same as the one around a bar magnet. It can, however, be reversed by turning the battery around.
Unlike bar magnets, which are permanent magnets, the magnetism of electromagnets can be turned on and off just by closing or opening the switch.

Rocks gradually wear away. This is called weathering. There are three types of weathering:
Remember, when you answer questions about weathering, mention what is causing the weathering and what it does to the rock.
Physical weathering is caused by physical changes such as changes in temperature, freezing and thawing, and the effects of wind, rain and waves.
a little, and when a rock gets cold it
a little. If a rock is heated and cooled many times, cracks form and pieces of rock fall away. This type of physical weathering happens a lot in deserts, because it is very hot during the day but very cold at night.
Wind, rain and waves can all cause weathering. The wind can blow tiny grains of sand against a rock. These wear the rock away and weather it. Rain and waves can also wear away rock over long periods of time.
Water expands slightly when it freezes into ice. This is why water pipes sometimes burst in the winter. You might have seen a demonstration of this sort of thing at school - a jar filled to the brim with water eventually shatters after it is put into a freezer.
The formation of ice can also break rocks. If water gets into a crack in a rock and then
and pushes the crack further apart. When the ice melts later, water can get further into the crack. When the rock freezes again, it expands and makes the crack even bigger.
This process of freezing and thawing can continue until the crack becomes so big that a piece of rock falls off.

Writer's tricks - The effect on the reader
You will now be very familiar with the idea that every text is intended to affect its readers in some way.
Every reader is, of course, different too, and sometimes a text will affect you in ways a writer didn't imagine, or you might notice depth in it that others won't. This is particularly true if the text matches your personal experience. A story about your home town might interest you more than one about somewhere else, or a text about smoking might affect you more if you know somebody who is trying to give it up.
Remember, you get marks for noticing the intended effect on the reader. Even if something doesn't interest, horrify, amuse or persuade you, you need to spot what the writer meant to do. It's usually better not to mention your personal opinion unless you are asked to.

279,499,"> Drama - Drama from your imagination
Taking part in drama doesn't always involve learning lines from scripts - often you'll be asked to improvise. Usually you will work in groups or pairs to devise a piece of drama from your own imagination. You'll need to be able to think on your feet and become a different character.
This might sound difficult, but you've probably improvised before without realising it - in games you used to play as a child. If you've ever played pirates, nurses or superheroes when you were younger, you were improvising - although don't think running around your classroom with a tablecloth for a cape pretending to be Superman will impress your drama teacher - it probably won't!
As with any English work, you need to think about your audience when you devise drama. Your drama needs to entertain them and keep their attention. Your drama also needs to be believable - your audience is likely to become disconnected if your story or characters are too far fetched.
The story of your drama begins with your character. Ask yourself: what does my character feel, think and react?
Here are two ideas for a character:
You are a journalist who has uncovered a story that will have big consequences and you're about to tell the world. Would your character be confident or scared?
You are a global superstar - singer, actor and producer - and paparazzi follow your every move. You live a glamorous and privileged life, but what are the secrets behind the smiles?
When you have decided on your character, you need to create a scene.
Here are some ideas for a scene based on the characters above. Can you think of any more?
You're about to appear on the most popular morning TV programme and expose your discovery when you suddenly receive a startling phone call. Who is on the phone? What do they say? How do they make you feel?
You've landed a part in a popular soap but you don't get on with the other actors. Should you tell the press the truth or pretend that you all get along?
You've been working late in the library just double checking a few facts for your article when you notice a menacing looking man watching you. Does your character panic or keep calm? Do they run or confront the man? Maybe they are being paranoid?
The press have published some false rumours about you and you're really upset. Your agent has secured a slot on a popular chat show to give your side of the story. Do you accept the offer or decide to lie low? How do you feel?
Your article has been published and has been a massive hit. You're receiving job offers from high profile newspapers and magazines and your life is about to change for the better. How do your family react? What do you decide to do?
You've found out that one of the other band members is planning to leave the group and go solo. You confront them - can you persuade them to stay, or would it be better for everyone if they left?
When you have a rough idea of your character and scene, you can think about what your character might say. If you're given time to prepare you should write a short script. If working in pairs or a group, you could improvise the scene first to get more ideas.
You may be allowed to use props to make your scene more realistic and interesting. Only use a prop if it is relevant, otherwise it could end up distracting you and your audience. If you decide to use props and costumes, always practice with them first.

280,144,"Cutting the cake into six equal pieces and eating two is
to cutting the cake into three equal pieces and eating one. You eat the same amount of cake in both cases.
If the cake is cut into 12 equal pieces, how many will we have to eat in order to have the equivalent of 1/3 of the cake?
because the top and bottom numbers have been multiplied by 2.
because the top and bottom numbers have been divided by 4.
When writing equivalent fractions, do the same multiplication or division to the top and bottom numbers.
For example, if you multiply the top by 2, you must also multiply the bottom by 2.

288,386,"Here are two examples of instinctive behaviour in animals:
Instincts are useful because they do not have to be learned and they can be complex, like the examples above. Instincts let animals form groups for protection, choose mates, fight to be in charge, and show many other behaviours.
Reflexes are a type of instinct. They happen automatically because of a particular stimulus. For example, if your hand touches something hot by accident, it automatically and quickly moves away. You do not have to learn to do this.
In order to see this content you need to have both
When the school bell rings at the end of break time, the students leave the playground and go to their lessons. People may say that the students are acting on instinct. But they would be wrong.
An instinct is a behaviour that happens automatically without any learning needed. The students have learned that the bell is a signal to do something, so leaving the playground when the bell rings is not an instinct. It is learned behaviour.
Is it instinct or conditioning that makes you study science?

291,523,"> Graphs - Plotting y = ax + b using tables
Graphs - Plotting y = ax + b using tables
To plot a graph, you need to find some coordinates that satisfy the equation of the graph.
Plot the graph of y = 2x + 1
We need to choose values for x and see what value of y they give.
y = (2  -2) + 1 = -3
y = (2  0) + 1 = 1
y = (2  2) + 1 = 5
You can show this in a table:
You can now plot these points and join them to give the graph of y = 2x + 1:

292,197,"Another way to look at sentences is to think about their purposes. For instance, we can talk about...
Statements, which tell us things. We tend to see these in school text books, in newspapers, or in an encyclopedia. For instance:
This Revision Bite is all about sentences.
Questions, which ask us things or make us think about things. For instance:
When did the First World War end?
Orders, which are also called commands. These tell us what to do, so we find these in instructions, recipes and signs. For instance:
Next, take a small pinch of salt and mix it all together.
Exclamations, which are shouted out. You'd hear these at a football match, in arguments, or if you told a joke. For instance:
You don't have to know the names but you do need to know how and when to use them.
You write sentences all the time. Find out when and where to use them.

To solve equations with fractions, you must do the same to each side of the equation to get the answer.
If we multiply both sides by 2 we get the answer:
Solve the equation 2x - 3 =
The number at the bottom is 2, so multiply both sides by 2. Remember you must multiply every term of both sides by 2, to give:
Add 6 to both side to give
Divide both sides by 4 to give

The weathering of rocks by chemicals is called chemical weathering. Rainwater is naturally slightly acidic because
from the air dissolves in it. Minerals in rocks may react with the rainwater, causing the rock to be weathered.
Some types of rock are easily weathered by chemicals. For example,
are made of a mineral called calcium carbonate. When acidic rainwater falls on limestone or chalk, a chemical reaction happens. New soluble substances are formed in the reaction. These are washed away and the rock is weathered.
Chemical weathering can hollow out caves form and make cliffs fall away.
are hard rocks that are weathered only slowly. Still some of their minerals do react with the acids in rainwater to form new, weaker substances that crumble and fall away.
When fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas are burned,
escape into the air. These dissolve in the water in the clouds and make the rainwater more acidic than normal. When this happens, we call the rain '
Acid rain makes chemical weathering happen more quickly. Buildings and statues made from rock are damaged as a result. This is worse when the rock is limestone rather than granite. Acid rain also kills trees and fish.

299,539,"> Variation and classification - Genetic engineering
Variation in living organisms can also be created by
Using laboratory techniques scientists can alter the genetic code within the DNA of a living organism. They can add genes from a different species to an organism's DNA
For example, GM can be used to alter the DNA in a bacterium so that it produces insulin. This is a human hormone and valuable to people with diabetes. Bacteria reproduce quickly, so a lot of insulin can be made quickly and used to help people suffering from diabetes.
Some people are concerned that there may be negative aspects to GM.
For example, there are people that believe GM is unethical and should be banned.
Other people are concerned that there may be unexpected long term problems of using GM, producing changes that could not be reversed. Such changes could create new pathogens or ""superweeds"" by the GM organisms breeding with other species. This could cause the natural balance of living organisms in the environment to be upset.

304,101,"Try out these example questions about relative frequency.
Q1. 100 people were asked whether they were left-handed. Four people answered 'yes'. What is the relative frequency of 'left-handed'?
Q2. A white counter was taken from a bag of different coloured counters, and then replaced. The relative frequency of getting a white counter was found to be 0.3. If the bag contained 20 counters, estimate the number of white counters.
A1. The relative frequency is 4/100 =
A2. The relative frequency of white counters is 0.3, and there are 20 counters in the bag, so, as an estimate, 0.3  20 =
Relative frequency can only be used as an estimate.

Approximation - Rounding to a given number of places
Decimal places are counted from the decimal point:
So, the number 5.1492 has four decimal places and 4.34 has two decimal places.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places, look at the number in the next decimal place.
If it's less than 5 round down
If it's 5 or more, round up
Q1. Round 7.2648 to 2 decimal places (d.p.)
Q2. Round 8.352 to 1 decimal place
To round to two decimal places, look at the number in the third decimal place. It's a 4, so round down.
To round to one decimal place, look at the number in the second decimal place. It's a 5, so round up.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places then the answer must have that number of decimal places, even if you have to add some zeros.
For example, rounding 3.40021 to two decimal places gives 3.40 (2 d.p.).
You need to write both decimal places, even though the second number is a zero, to show you rounded to two decimal places.
Remember to look at the number after the one you're interested in. If it's less than 5, round down. If it's 5 or more, round up.

311,79,"The following table shows the times of the buses from Cambridge to Duxford and Whittlesford:
a) I want to go to the Duxford Imperial War Museum. Which bus should I catch from Cambridge?
b) The 0805 from Cambridge is running 6 minutes late. What time does it reach Pampisford?
c) If I arrive in Sawston at 0932, what time do I leave Cambridge?
d) How long does the journey from Great Shelford to Duxford Wheatsheaf take?
a) The only bus which goes to the Imperial War Museum leaves Cambridge at 0835.
b) The 0805 usually arrives in Pampisford at 0838. So if it's running 6 minutes late it will arrive at 0844.
d) The bus leaves Great Shelford at 0722 and arrives at Duxford Wheatsheaf at 0745. So it takes 23 minutes.

If you are making orange squash and you mix one part orange to four parts water, then the ratio of orange to water will be 1:4 (1 to 4).
If you use 1 litre of orange, you will use 4 litres of water (1:4).
If you use 2 litres of orange, you will use 8 litres of water (2:8).
If you use 10 litres of orange, you will use 40 litres of water (10:40).
Both sides of the ratio can be multiplied or divided by the same number to give an equivalent ratio.
Write the ratio 40:28 in its simplest form.
To work this out, look for a number that will divide into 40 and 28.
2 divides into both numbers, so 40:28 can be written as 20:14.
You can divide these by 2, so the simplified ratio is
No number divides into 10 and 7, so 10:7 is the simplest form of the ratio.

313,456,"Test your listening skills with this quiz. Note down your answer to the questions and then 'click ideas' below to see what kind of listener you are.
1. Your group is having an informal discussion about an issue in a book. No one can agree and everyone is talking at once. Do you:
a) Shout the loudest to make sure that everyone hears what you have to say.
b) Seize the opportunity for a nap - no one will notice as they're all too busy arguing.
c) Suggest that you all take it in turns to speak whilst someone writes down everyone's ideas.
2. You've been asked to do a group presentation and there's a girl in the group who is really nervous. She starts to speak, but she suddenly goes silent and bright red. She's forgotten what else to say. Do you:
a) Point at her and burst out laughing.
b) Feel glad that everyone is staring at her and not you.
c) Help her by asking her a question about what she's already said.
3. You've prepared an individual talk on your hobby for homework. Someone else in the class has just given their talk on exactly the same subject. Do you:
a) Just read out what you had written in your notes. You weren't listening to the person who was just speaking, anyway.
b) Screw up your notes and lock yourself in the toilet until the bell rings.
c) Refer back to some of the things the other student said as you go along.
4. Your teacher puts you into pairs and asks you to improvise a missing scene from the play you've been reading. Do you:
a) Say as much as you can to fill the two minute slot you've been given. It doesn't matter if it's irrelevant and it doesn't matter if your partner doesn't get a chance to speak.
b) Allow your partner to do all the talking and keep your reactions to a minimum.
c) Swallow your sense of panic, listen carefully to what your partner says and try and react accordingly, taking turns so that the improvisation makes sense and is balanced.
You are confident and outgoing. You might find yourself going out alone though if you don't try to listen to others more often.
You probably are a good listener...but nobody knows it. Try to be brave and ask people questions during discussions. At least it will take the focus away from you, if that's what you want.

314,506,"goes roughly through the middle of all the scatter points on a graph. The closer the points are to the line of best fit the stronger the correlation is.
10 pupils in a school study French and German at GCSE. Their marks for a recent test are recorded in the table below:
You can draw a scatter diagram to represent these marks. As Pete was absent on the day of the German test you do not have enough information to mark his score.
Looking at this scatter diagram there is strong positive correlation between the marks in French and the marks in German, so you can draw a line of best fit to show that trend.
Pete scored 70 in French, so using the line of his best fit, you can estimate that his mark in German would have been 72.
A line of best fit can only be drawn if there is strong positive or negative correlation.
The line of best fit does not have to go through the origin.
The line of best fit shows the trend, but it is only approximate and any readings taken from it will be estimations.

317,104,"What is wrong with the following statement?
The probability of obtaining a 6 when I throw a die is
- so if I throw the die 6 times I should get exactly 1  6.
In theory this statement is true, but in practise it might not be the case. Try throwing a die 6 times - you won't always get one 6.
Kate and Josh each throw a die 30 times.
a) How many times would you expect Kate to obtain a 6?
b) How many times would you expect Josh to obtain a 6?
c) How many times would you expect Kate or Josh to obtain a 6?
a) In theory, Kate should obtain a 6 on
of her throws. Therefore, in theory she should throw a 6 on
b) Josh should also throw to obtain a 6 on
c) In total, Kate and Josh have thrown the die 60 times. You would expect them to obtain a 6 on 10 of those throws. However, it is very unlikely that Kate and Josh obtained exactly the same results, or that either of them threw a 6 on 5 occasions.
As you can see, if an experiment is repeated, the results are not necessarily the same each time.
However, it is more likely that their combined results were closer to the expected outcome (10  6s) than their individual results.
In other words, if you do a large number of trials you will get a more accurate result.

321,1615,"is part of a line which has two end points (ie, it is not infinite). Each end of a line segment is usually labelled with letters.
If A is the point (1, 1) and B is the point (4, 5), what is the length of the line segment AB?
It is not easy to picture this without drawing a sketch. Have a look at the diagram below:
A has an x-coordinate of 1. B has an x-coordinate of 4. So, to get from A to B, we move along 3 units.
A has a y-coordinate of 1. B has a y-coordinate of 5. So, to get from A to B, we move up 4 units.
We have created a right-angled triangle. So to find the length of AB we use Pythagoras theorem.
If P is the point (1, 5) and Q is the point (5, 1), what is the length of the line segment PQ? Give your answer correct to 1 decimal point (d.p.).
If you get a question like this, it is fine to draw a sketch or diagram. If you get really confident, you might be able to answer the question without using a diagram.
If X is the point (1, 1) and Y is the point (3, 5), what is the midpoint of the line segment XY?
It is clear from this diagram that the midpoint of (1, 1) and (3, 5) is (2, 3).
In fact, the x-coordinate of M is the average of the x-coordinates of X and Y
And the y-coordinate of M is the average of the y-coordinates of X and Y.
What is the midpoint of (2, 7) and (4, 1)?
The midpoint of (2, 7) and (4, 1) is:

322,5729,"Making decisions on moral issues is not easy. Religion helps followers to make decisions that are pleasing to God and create a society where people respect and care for each other
People draw on a variety of sources of authority to help them make a decision. For example:
religious leaders and the official teaching of their religion
There are two types of morality that affect the decisions people make  absolute morality and relative morality.
If you believe in absolute morality you will have faith that there is a right course of action to take in a moral dilemma, which is true in all situations regardless of culture, religious tradition, time or age.
How would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment Do not kill? They would try to make sure that they were not involved in any killing, which would affect their views on issues such as war, abortion and euthanasia. They would say that these actions are wrong in all circumstances.
If you believe in relative morality you would agree that different courses of action might be needed in different situations.
How would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment Do not kill? They would agree that killing is wrong, but would look at a range of other issues as well and say that sometimes killing might be necessary in a particular situation, such as abortion, if continuing the pregnancy would result in the birth of a very disabled child, or if the mother had been raped.

323,3857,"We often use formulas without even noticing. For example, we might convert miles to km by multiplying by 1.6, or find the circumference of a circle by multiplying pi by the diameter.
km = 1.6 x miles is an example of a formula.
We have already seen that km = 1.6 x miles and C =
 d are examples of formulas. There are many others that we use regularly in other subjects. Sometimes we have to construct our own formula:
A taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00. Write down a formula for the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles.
Travelling 1 mile would cost 2 + 50p.
Travelling 2 miles would cost 2 + 2 x 50p.
Travelling 3 miles would cost 2 + 3 x 50p.
So travelling for 'n' miles will cost 2 + n x 50p.
The formula is C = 2 + (n x 50p)
A rectangle has a width of x and a length of 2x.
Write down a formula for the perimeter (P) in terms of x.
P = 2x + x + 2x + x
Did you remember to include all 4 sides?
To recap, the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles, when a taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00 is:-
C = 2 + (n x 50p)
To find the cost of the taxi for a journey of 20 miles, replace 'n' with 20.
C = 2 + (20 x 50p)
What is the cost of hiring this taxi for 16 miles?
Remember that C = 2 + (16 x 50p)
The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.
r, so we divide both sides by 2
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c

324,6076,"Farmers started to work scientifically for the first time during the 1830s. Many new improvements were the result of individuals, such as Justus von Liebig, experimenting, observing and explaining how crop yields could be enlarged and improved.
The main improvements introduced in the 1830s, which were the main characteristics of High Farming, covered fertilisers, drainage and steam power coupled with support from government initiatives.
Illustration of a bird with guano (bird droppings)
- a scientist called Sir John Lawes started the production and use of phosphate fertilisers and super phosphates, which were initially by-products of industrial processes. The other most commonly used fertiliser from the 1830s onwards was guano (bird droppings) from the Andes Mountains in Peru. Soil in Britain became richer and produced higher yields as a result.
- new steam-operated machines were invented that could lay drainage pipes in straight lines. These drainage pipes cleared water from flooded fields and subsequently improved the quality of agricultural land in Great Britain.
- steam became the new method of powering farming machinery, which made the agricultural process more efficient. Examples of new steam-powered machinery included ploughs, seed drills, threshing machines and from 1852 onwards, steam-powered reapers. Unfortunately, most of these new steam-powered machines were invented in America and were not practical for use on the smaller enclosed British fields in the late 19th century.
- for the very first time, the government gave out 28 million in loans to help farmers use these new techniques and ideas on their fields. The government also forced remaining open land to be enclosed.

325,7331,"One government that is often seen as an example of 'reforming' by introducing positive changes that really improve peoples' lives is the Liberal government in Britain of 1906-1914. Many historians label this period the beginning of the
A state (or a country) where the government provides welfare benefits such as education, health care, and unemployment payment to its population free at the point of use, although paid for by general taxation.
, but why did the Liberal government introduce its reforms?
Some governments in history seem to have implemented changes that have particularly improved people's lives. For instance, Roosevelt's New Deal in America, or the Labour government in Britain after the First World War. The dynamism and positive achievements of these governments make them look much better than the governments that came before or after them.
A study of poverty in 1901 by Seebohm Rowntree found that in a society where those who didn't work didn't eat, there were three times in people's lives when they were especially vulnerable:
After 1906, the Liberal government, with Lloyd George as Chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced reforms to help these three groups:
Children and Young Persons Act introduced a set of regulations that became known as the

) of 7s 6d a week for 15 weeks in return for a payment of 2d a week.
1906 - the Trades Disputes Act ruled that unions were not liable for damages because of strikes.
1906 - the Workers Compensation Act granted compensation for injury at work.
1910 - half-day a week off for shop workers.
A Merchant Shipping Act improved conditions for sailors.
From 1911, MPs were paid. This gave working men the opportunity to stand for election.
Why did the Liberal government introduce these reforms?
in 1901 found that 28 per cent of the population did not have the minimum to live on at some time of their life.
- when Britain went to war in 1899, the army found that two-thirds of the men who volunteered for the army were unfit to join up.
- which had a good system of state welfare for workers, was passing Britain as a great industrial power.
meant politicians feared that, unless standards of living improved for the workers, they might turn to Communism or rebellion.
and it was attracting working-class voters because of its demands for welfare reform.

of seats in the House of Commons, so it had a coalition with the 42 Labour Party MPs who had been elected.

326,3877,"Owen's anti-war sentiments contrast starkly with the work of other poets.
Owen makes clear to the reader that he is unconvinced by the rhetoric of previous poets who have declared the glory of dying in war. Poems such as Tennyson's
offer a final message of glory and bravery, with sacrifice for one's country a noble and desirable end. Wilfred Owen's poem
rejects 'The old Lie'. Owen experienced war, and so his poems are more closely reflective of the views of the serving soldiers.

- which is thought to be a major cause of global warming.
When fossil fuels are burnt - by industry, in power stations and in vehicles and planes - the gases enter the
The Earth's atmosphere is the envelope of gasses that surround the Earth. The gasses are held there by the Earth's gravity. The important gasses in the atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide.
. Although these gases have always been present in the world's atmosphere, their concentration is gradually increasing as more and more fossil fuels are burnt.
Scientists believe that the build-up of these so-called
The main greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. They are naturally occurring in atmosphere, but are believed to have increased through burning more oil, petrol, and coal, while forests have been removed.
in the atmosphere acts like a blanket or greenhouse around the planet; heat is trapped inside the Earth's atmosphere. This is the
, and the resulting increase in global temperatures is called
It's thought that the build-up of greenhouse gases impacts on global temperature in two ways:
The gases allow more of the sun's rays to enter the atmosphere. Some
Energy from the sun - consisting of visible light, heat or infra-red radiation, ultra-violet and other forms of radiation.
is still reflected back into space by the outer parts of the atmosphere, but it's believed the amount reflected back is gradually reducing.
At the same time, the greenhouse gases absorb more of the solar radiation that is reflected back from the Earth's surface - trapping heat and keeping it in the atmosphere. The ability of the atmosphere to capture the sun's warmth is essential for life on earth. But if significantly MORE warmth is being captured, this is bad news for the planet.
Another group of greenhouse gases includes the
for short). CFCs have been responsible for depleting the
ozone layer as they attack and destroy ozone molecules.
The ozone layer is a high level layer of gas in the stratosphere. The ozone helps to keep out harmful ultra-violet rays, which cause sunburn on human skin and damage plants.
The resulting ozone holes let harmful ultra-violet radiation in and add to the greenhouse effect.
CFCs can be used in aerosols, such as hairspray cans, fridges and in making foam plastics.
CFCs were banned in many countries in the mid-1990s after it was found that they were breaking up the Earth's ozone.

may have one theme or many. Understanding the themes makes the text more than 'just' a text. It becomes something more significant because we're encouraged to think more deeply about the story - about how it connects to real-life issues, and about what it might mean to us.
The boys try to construct a civilisation on the island; but it breaks down in blood and terror because the boys are suffering from the terrible disease of being human.
A central, unifying idea that runs through a text or performance.
is that of things breaking down. This is shown in a number of ways. Violence replaces peace, friends turn into enemies, life ends in savage death. Everything degenerates.
The boys are on the island because the plane that was evacuating them from Britain during a fictional nuclear war was attacked. Piggy reminds Ralph:
""Didn't you hear what the pilot said? About the atom bomb? They're all dead.""
Ralph is proud of his father - a commander in the Navy. So, the

who tries hardest to keep peace comes from a home that revolved around war.
We know that the civilisation from which they were trying to escape is being destroyed. When Roger stops himself throwing stones at the littluns, we're told:
""Roger's arm was conditioned by a civilisation that knew nothing of him and was in ruins.""
The dead parachutist who lands on the island was gunned down during an overhead battle.
Ironically, the naval officer who comes to their rescue is himself involved in the war. The boys may have been saved from life on the island, but what sort of life are they going back to?
Violence is always present. It starts as a game, but grows more horrific throughout the novel. For example:
When he first finds out Piggy's name,
""Ralph danced out into the hot air of the beach and then returned as a fighter-plane, with wings swept back, and machine-gunned Piggy.""
When the first pig is killed, Jack boasts,
""Kill the pig. Cut her throat. Bash her in.""
The boys become like wild and savage animals: when Jack hunts a pig he is
; Ralph becomes like a hunted animal, not a boy, at the end:
""He raised his spear, snarled a little, and waited.""
The murder of Simon is particularly horrific because it involves
the other boys - they get caught up in the frenzied chant:
""The crowd ... leapt onto the beast, screamed, struck, bit, tore.""
All the friendships and good relationships on the island break down, either through bullying and violence or death.
Ralph and Jack seem to be friends at the start, yet Ralph knows Jack is hurt when he is not elected chief. This rivalry for power is at the root of some of the violence.
Ralph finds it hard even at an early stage to get things done. He and Simon are left to build the third shelter by themselves, because everyone else is too busy having fun. The community spirit of the assemblies is hard to maintain.
Even the littluns' games involve violence and broken friendships. Once Roger watches them playing:
""Percival had gone off, crying, and Johnny was left in triumphant possession of the castles.""
As pressure builds, the boys find that they have to take sides. When Jack defies Ralph and goes off alone, he challenges,
""Anyone who wants to hunt when I do can come too.""
He ignores Ralph's effort to make peace.
Jack's tribe becomes ruled by fear. Most boys don't want to be involved, but have no option. He keeps control by intimidating them and bullying them, such as when he ties up and beats Wilfred.
Roger rules by terror too. When Samneric are captured,
""Roger advanced upon them as one wielding a nameless authority.""
The island is first seen as like paradise, too good to be true. Ralph thinks:
""Here at last was the imagined but never fully realised place leaping into real life""
However, the island is soon found to contain many dangers. For example, coconuts fall from the trees and just miss injuring Roger, the sun burns them, and the isolation is a curse.
Ralph reflects at the end that the island once had a
All this echoes the Bible story of the Fall of Man, when Adam and Eve were cast out of Paradise as a punishment for disobeying God. The island becomes a burnt wasteland, as if as a punishment for all the violence committed by the boys.
The language used by the boys progressively degenerates.

The title of the novel comes from the Arabic for one of the manifestations of the Devil. Baal-Zebub - or Beelzebub - means 'lord of the flies'.

of how far the violence has come. The pig was killed by Jack and his hunters and the head is put on a stick as an offering to the 'beast'. Only Simon really appreciates that the 'beast' is actually the evil inside the boys themselves and it is that which is breaking things up.
So, the title of the novel reinforces the idea that we all have something of the 'devil' within us - and that the 'devil' can be released all too easily.

Diabetes  risk and benefit (Ideas about science)
Weighing up the consequences - higher only
Everyone has to make choices about whether to accept the risks associated with some activities. We accept risk every day. Crossing a busy street involves a risk of being knocked over by a car. We accept this risk because we know that this event is very unlikely to happen. But we also know that if it did happen the result could be very serious.
To decide whether we should accept a risk, we need to consider:
what is the chance of the event occurring
what are the consequences to us if the event does occur
With reference to diabetes, each person must make a decision about the diet they eat based on:
the chance of their getting diabetes if they eat poorly or are obese
the consequences of having diabetes in terms of its effect on their lives
Put down that pen and listen to some Science audio.

331,1862,"A group of lines of poetry that make up a unit - like a paragraph in a piece of prose; a verse.
A description of one thing in terms of another - implicitly comparing the two, but without using 'as' or 'like'. 'Sea of troubles', and 'drowning in debt' are metaphors. Something that represents another thing.
for trust in real life situations. In the exercise, the person falling trusts that they will be caught by those behind them. In the minefield of personal relationships, you rely upon family and friends to 'catch' you.
The second stanza is full of colour. The jacket is canary-yellow (line 5) and becomes blackened (line 7). The child see[s] red - Armitage chose a phrase that uses colour to depict anger - and Blue murder is threatened. Yellow, red and blue are the primary colours: perhaps Armitage used these to show how vivid and 'colourful' the child's memories of the row are - it is obviously still important to him many years later.
The mother is described as the very model of a model of a mother (line 8). Does this suggest that she is a typical mother figure (as if like a child's model toy, reproduced in a factory) or a more-than-perfect mother (model as an adjective can mean 'ideally perfect')? Either way, she makes the wrong assumption about how the jacket got dirty - in the child's eyes, as least.
It is midnight when the child escapes to the phone box - always a time when special things may happen! This call seems to have been a symbolic attempt to get in touch with his future adult self.
The father figure (line 17) is in silhouette: the child can see his shape, but not his whole body. Does this suggest that their relationship with him is not now as 'rounded' as a result of the row? It is not definite that he is the child's actual father - only a father figure. The fact that he is waiting outside shows that he is concerned for the welfare of the child, but also that he wants to set things straight (line 17) - perhaps implying that the argument is not over yet!
The final stanza is an extended metaphor. The embrace between the child and the family is likened to putting on the yellow jacket that caused the row in the first place. Parts of the body become parts of the jacket, to show us how warm and loving the hug is. The poet does not know exactly what the jacket looks like -
""these fingers make a zip / or buckle, you say which""
(line 20), but it does not matter as
(line 23). In other words, continuity is restored, the family is whole again.
We can 'hear' some of the family row. Stanza two has many short phrases, showing tension rising in the household. Armitage uses
that the child and the mother may actually have spoken.
(line 11) could be the order of a furious parent: we can imagine their finger pointing towards the door!

332,3215,"The Internet is a worldwide system of interconnected computer
. When you connect your computer to the Internet via your Internet Service Provider (ISP) you become part of the ISPs network, which is connected to other networks that make up the Internet.
(WWW or Web for short) is the part of the Internet that you can access using a
an application used to browse the Internet or view web pages
. It consists of a large number of web servers that host websites. Each website will normally consist of a number of web pages. A web page can contain text, images, video, animation and sound.
You can access a website or web page by typing its URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the address bar of your browser. An example of a URL is
a request/response standard, web browsers send requests and websites or servers respond to requests
an area of control or management, eg bbc.co.uk is controlled by the BBC
the Internet country code for the United Kingdom
). What goes in between is arbitrary, but often has the term ""www"", eg http://
.bbc.co.uk, but it doesnt have to, eg http://
is the secure version of http. When you use https any
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
you send or receive from the web server is encrypted. For example, when banking online https is used to keep your account details safe.
Most sites have a page that links the user to the other main areas of the site. This is called the homepage.
Web pages are connected by hypertext links. When a link is clicked you will be taken to another page which could be on another
a computer that provides services to users, eg access to shared files, web hosting, file storage
An intranet is a network that works like the Internet but is only available within a particular organisation, not to the public. An intranet may have web pages used to share company specific data within that company, such as internal telephone numbers or details of employee benefits.

333,5968,"Calculating the interior and exterior angles of regular polygons
We already know how to find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon using the formula
We also know that all the interior angles of a regular polygon are equal.
Interior angle of a regular polygon = sum of interior angles  number of sides
Find the interior angle of a regular hexagon.
We know from the formula that the interior angles of a hexagon add up to 720.
As a hexagon has six sides, each angle is equal to
We know that the exterior angles of a regular polygon
add up to 360, so the exterior angle of a regular hexagon is
The interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle always add up to 180. (For a hexagon, 120 + 60 = 180.)
Calculate the exterior angle of a regular octagon, and write down the value of the interior angle.
The sum of the exterior and interior angles is 180, so the interior angle is 180 - 45 =

always state which side the person quoted is on.
You will need to examine the source and read between the lines to find information that gives you a clue about what type of Chartist wrote or drew the source. Your answer should include details about what the clue was.
""My desire is to try moral force as long as possible, but I would have you remember that it is better to die free men than to live as slaves. Physical force is treason only when it fails; it is glorious freedom when it is successful.""

335,6930,"William Blake: The Little Boy Lost / The Little Boy Found
are deceptively simple poems, written as if spoken by children. They are generally hopeful and optimistic. The
are also childlike in approach, but darker and more pessimistic.
When Blake published them together, he called them
Shewing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul.
This suggests he believed people needed both 'states' to understand life. Many of the
poems have a poem that 'answers' them in the

336,4343,"All the alkali metals react vigorously with cold water. In each reaction,
is produced. The speed and violence of the reaction
as you go down the group. This shows that the reactivity of the alkali metals increases as you go down Group 1.
When lithium is added to water, lithium floats. It fizzes steadily and becomes smaller, until it eventually disappears.
lithium + water  lithium hydroxide + hydrogen
When sodium is added to water, the sodium melts to form a ball that moves around on the surface. It fizzes rapidly, and the hydrogen produced may burn with an orange flame before the sodium disappears.
sodium + water  sodium hydroxide + hydrogen
When potassium is added to water, the metal melts and floats. It moves around very quickly on the surface of the water. The hydrogen ignites instantly. The metal is also set on fire, with sparks and a lilac flame. There is sometimes a small explosion at the end of the reaction.
potassium + water  potassium hydroxide + hydrogen
The hydroxides formed in all of these reactions dissolve in water to form alkaline solutions. These solutions turn universal indicator purple, showing they are strongly
. Strong alkalis are corrosive, so care must be taken when they are used - for example, by using goggles and gloves.
Put down that pen and listen to some additional Science audio.

Most browsers have standard features, but different web browsers show things in slightly different ways. This is why it is always important to test your webpages and graphics in
browser, to ensure the end user sees what you want them to see.
. This type of browser displays only text and no images. You can provide a text description of all the images you use in your webpages in the image tags in your

. This ensures that visually impaired users are aware of the point of the image.
It is vital that you test your webpages in different web browsers.
If you are building a webpage in a package such as Dreamweaver, you can preview your page in different browsers within the package.
You can download a number of browsers using the useful links below.
You must consider bandwidth when you are designing your images. If you are designing a website with lots of images, it is important to think about how long these images will take to download to a user's
an application used to browse the Internet or view web pages
The higher the bandwidth, the faster the images will download. Large image files can take up a lot of
Bandwidth measures the amount of data that can transfer through a communications channnel over a given period of time.
, so it is important to reduce the file size of your images when saving them to use on a webpage. A
are the most suitable file formats for saving images to use on the web, because the size of the original file is dramatically reduced.
Sometimes images for screen are not displayed in a

. For example, the images might be displayed in a presentation or a TV screen. You need to consider the audience and the medium they are likely to view the image in.
You will need to consider two important things:
The fineness of detail that can be seen in an image - the higher the resolution of an image, the more detail it holds. It is measured in dots per inch (dpi).
of the image, the clearer it will be. You should aim to use the highest possible resolution. You must be careful though, as an image with a high resolution will often take longer to display, due to the large file size.
You should also consider where the image will be seen. Will it be projected onto a screen? Will it be viewed from a computer screen? Will it be on a TV screen? How big will the display be?
of the screen. The aspect ratio is the ratio of the
of the screen. A standard television, for example, has an aspect ratio of 4:3, while a widescreen television has an aspect ratio of 16:9.

The structures of control in the Nazi state
Measures were imposed to make sure that schools and youth associations became Nazified:
Non-Nazi teachers and university professors were sacked; teachers had to join the National Socialist Teachers' League.
Textbooks were re-written to include Nazi political and racial ideas.
There was a concentration on physical fitness.
Girls were taught cookery; boys were taught science and maths.
The Hitler Youth was compulsory; it indoctrinated boys and prepared them for war.
The Nazi Girls' youth organisation - the BDM - was compulsory; it indoctrinated girls and prepared them for church, children and cooking.
The following points are examples of how the Nazis took control of workers lives:
The RAD (National Labour Service) sent young men on public works.
Hitler introduced conscription in 1936; most men went into the army after the RAD.
The DAF (German Labour Front) controlled workers' conditions at work.
The KdF (Strength through Joy) movement regulated their leisure time.

Here is an example of music with a homophonic texture, written by Henry VIII.
This literally means 'different sounds or voices'. Polyphonic music has parts that weave in and out of each other. Sometimes this is called contrapuntal music - it means the same thing.
Polyphonic music may contain an element of imitation, where one voice or instrument copies what has just been played by another. (Think of a roundsong like
Listen to this example of music that has a polyphonic texture, from JS Bach's
A fugue is a special type of polyphonic texture. Fugues always begin with a tune that is played on a solo instrument/voice or by instruments/voices in unison. This tune is then played by all the other instruments or voices in turn but not necessarily at the same pitch.
Here is an example of a fugue. Notice how the solo starts the fugue tune and then the other voices join in one at a time.
A capella music is always for voices. It describes vocal music that has no instrumental accompaniment.
A capella music can be polyphonic, homophonic or unison - so you might see a piece of music described as 'homophonic a capella' or 'polyphonic a capella'.
The words 'a capella' in Italian mean 'In the style of the chapel'. This is because early music for the church was for unaccompanied voices.
Listen to this example of a capella singing - yodelling from Gabon in Africa.
This is a melody which can be sung or played on an instrument, with an accompaniment. A song with piano accompaniment falls into this category.
Here is an example of melody and accompaniment:
This texture is when a solo is heard which is immediately answered by another tune played or sung by a group. It is used a lot in popular music, jazz music and music from other cultures.
Here is an example of a call-and-response song from Latin America
Listen to this extract of music by Mozart that only uses the words 'Kyrie Eleison' and 'Christe Eleison' and comment on the textures voices and instruments you hear.
: The music starts with just one instrument and one voice. The other voices and instruments then join in one at a time. At the end, all the instruments and voices play their own tune starting at different times.
Talvin has obviously heard that the voices have tunes starting at different times, but has not gone into enough detail about it. He didn't mention any instruments or voices by name and couldn't mention any of the textures by name either.
: The music starts with just the trombones and the bass voice. This type of texture is called 'unison'. The alto voice then joins in making the texture weave in and out. The voices sing Kyrie Eleison. A high voice then comes in singing a tune to the words 'Christe Eleison' which adds to the weaving style. There are timpani and strings in this piece. At the end, all the voices are weaving in and out of each other.
This is a good answer by Sarah. She has named one texture, unison. She heard that the music was 'weaving' but didn't use the proper word 'polyphonic'. She has also correctly identified one voice and an instrument.
: The music begins with the trombones and bass voices in unison. The voices sing the words 'Kyrie Eleison'. The alto voices then join in with faster notes singing the words 'Christe Eleison'. The texture is now polyphonic. The Soprano voices then sing the 1st tune (that the basses sang at first) to the words 'Kyrie Eleison' while the tenor voices sing the tune that the altos sang earlier to the words 'Christe Eleison'. The texture is still polyphonic. Timpani are heard to add emphasis to the bass part. Towards the end, all the voices sing both tunes to both sets of words in a polyphonic texture. Overall, the music has two tunes. The style is a fugue, where the tunes overlap each other.
Geeta has used the proper words to describe the textures and the voices/instruments used in this excerpt. She spotted that each set of words 'Kyrie Eleison' and 'Christe Eleison' has its own tune. Finally, she correctly identified the piece of music as being a fugue.

Jamie needs to give far more explanation. He should use business terms and show he understands what fixed costs are.
They have to pay Ashley's father each month, as well as the loan from the bank. They may have other costs, like the cleaning materials they buy to run their business.
Morag started her answer quite well, mentioning both loans which, as fixed costs, have to be repaid. The cleaning materials, however, form part of the variable, rather than the fixed costs.
Costs which have to be paid, regardless of the level of output, are called fixed costs. Martin and Ashley have the fixed costs of repaying Ashley's dad 50 a month, and they probably pay bank interest on the loan. Their pay is a fixed cost. They might want to consider paying themselves piece rate, to help their business survive. The road tax and insurance on the van are fixed costs they have to pay. They have already bought the van, so this is a sunk cost, and no longer a fixed cost they have to pay.
Rani's answer would probably get a A grade. She has answered the question well, and has shown she can use business terms like fixed costs. She has thought about the pay they only receive when they have the business, and correctly counted it as a fixed cost.

342,3552,"Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. Attitude can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
A good way to decide on the tone of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
Angrily, to show the poet's attitude to the fact that nothing has changed?
Or in a resigned way, as if he knows that it's almost too much to hope that things can change?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
Tatamkhulu Afrika wrote this about his poem:
Nothing's Changed is entirely autobiographical. I can't quite remember when I wrote this, but I think it must have been about 1990. District Six was a complete waste by then, and I hadn't been passing through it for a long time. But nothing has changed. Not only District Six... I mean, we may have a new constitution, we may have on the face of it a beautiful democracy, but the racism in this country is absolutely redolent. We try to pretend to the world that it does not exist, but it most certainly does, all day long, every day, shocking and saddening and terrible.
Look, I don't want to sound like a prophet of doom, because I don't feel like that at all. I am full of hope. But I won't see it in my lifetime. It's going to take a long time. I mean, in America it's taken all this time and it's still not gone... So it will change. But not quickly, not quickly at all.

343,6813,"There are three main production methods used in manufacturing: one-off, batch and mass production.
, this is where a single item is required - for example a suspension bridge or a custom-made engine for a racing car. The unit cost is high for this method, as the production system needs to be changed for each different unit.
This occurs where quantities of an item are sold regularly - for example a local baker producing many batches of specialist loaves each day for sale in local shops. Batch production will involve producing and storing the components which will make up the end product, eg the batch production of

346,4852,"Generators can be turned directly, for example, by:
When electricity is generated using wave, wind, tidal or hydroelectric power (HEP) there are two steps:
Generators can be turned indirectly using fossil or nuclear fuels. The heat from the fuel boils water to make steam, which expands and pushes against the blades of a
. The spinning turbine then turns the generator.
These are the steps by which electricity is generated from fossil fuels:
Heat is released from fuel and boils the water to make steam.
The turbine turns a generator and electricity is produced.
The electricity goes to the transformers to produce the correct voltage.

350,6315,"You will usually be able to choose your own presentation topic, from a list provided by your teacher. It is important to pick a topic that allows you to show off your best level of language.
In this section - Personal and Social Life - it is tempting to choose to talk about your family, as it is a topic you know well, but simple descriptions of your family won't score you the highest marks.
You can afford to be ambitious in your choice of topic, as you can prepare your presentation in advance. So in this unit we are looking at the topic 'Special Occasions', which allows you to show off a high level of language, and knowledge about other cultures.
Many of the names of festivals such as 'Diwali' and 'Eid' are known by the same names in both English- and German-speaking countries.
Here are some example questions you should learn the answers to. See if you can finish off the sentences.
1 - What festivals and holidays do you celebrate in your family?
2 - Which festival is your favourite?
7 - What do you send and receive?
10 - What did you do last year?
11 - What will you do next year?
12 - What do you know about special occasions in German-speaking countries?

351,3442,"Read the sources below by Petrarch and Mirfield on suspicion of doctors.
I know that your bedside is besieged by doctors, and of course this fills me with fear. As Pliny said, in order to gain fame they buy it with our lives. They learn their art at our cost, and even our death brings them experience; only a doctor can kill without punishment. Remember what it says on the gravestones: ""I died of too many doctors"".
A letter from the poet Petrarch to Pope Clement VI (c.1350)
Medical men are well educated, for I do not think that an illiterate man can do the work of a doctor. Even so, at the present time, ignorant amateurs and even worse and more horrible worthless and presumptuous women, grab the profession and abuse it and make mistakes and kill people. You need three qualifications to be a doctor nowadays: to be able to lie cleverly, to seem honest, and to be able to kill without caring.
Johannes de Mirfield, 'Flowers of Bartholomew' (c.1375). (Mirfield, a monk and a doctor, copied this from a book written by the Italian surgeon Bruno of Calabria in 1252)

some did not approve of doctors who were
Petrarch quoted the Roman writer Pliny, Mirfield quoted Bruno of Calabria.

Teacher's notes: This question is worth 6 marks in the exam. Give yourself 7 - 8 minutes to answer it.
Mark Scheme: In History you are marked by levels. The higher the level the more marks you get and so the higher grade you will achieve.
The answer will provide few reasons for the emergence of NICRA with no real explanations offered.
The answer will provide more reasons with some explanations offered.
The answer will provide a number of reasons with detailed explanations.
NICRA was set up because of events in the USA where Martin Luther King Jr. was leading a similar campaign in America in the 1960s. At the same time discrimination in Northern Ireland was still continuing. NICRA campaigned for ""One Man, One Vote"".
John would get a level 1 for this answer. The candidate only touches on the influence of the USA and events in Northern Ireland. The candidate does not develop the two points to answer the question fully and directly.
NICRA emerged due to a number of events and influences. A major factor in its emergence was the impact of the 1947 Education Act. This made Catholics more confident in the 1960s to demand civil rights. A further influence was the establishment of the Campaign for Social Justice in 1964. This organisation highlighted the forms of discrimination that existed in Northern Ireland by the mid 1960s. This helped bring about the establishment of NICRA in 1967.
A final factor to explain the emergence of NICRA was Labour's victory in the 1964 General Election.
Paul would get a level 2 for this answer. The candidate makes two valid points in the first paragraph. However other important factors are omitted and he does not explain the last point in the second paragraph.
The emergence of NICRA can be explained by a number of events, both within Northern Ireland and outside of Northern Ireland. The 1947 Education Act helped to create a larger professional and educated Catholic class in Northern Ireland. It was more assertive and confident in demanding civil rights for all by the mid 1960s.
Also within Northern Ireland there was the Campaign for Social Justice that was set up in 1964. This organisation acted as a forerunner for the emergence of NICRA in 1967.
Furthermore within Northern Ireland by the mid 1960s, members of a number of political parties, as well as labour and republican groups were working to establish a civil rights movement. They felt that O'Neill's government had done little to address grievances in voting, housing, policing and employment.
Outside of Northern Ireland there were other influences. The 1960s witnessed the emergence of a civil rights movement in the USA. It was having some success and this inspired a similar movement in Northern Ireland.
Also in 1964 a Labour government was elected in Britain. Labour was seen as being more sympathetic to the nationalist cause. This may have raised the expectations of Catholics into believing that a protest group campaigning for civil rights might succeed. A year later over 100 MPs in Britain formed the Campaign for Democracy in Ulster. This further raised the expectations of Catholics and influenced the establishment of NICRA.
Michael would get a level 3 for this answer. This response is very direct and extremely comprehensive. The candidate is aware of all the important factors that account for the emergence of NICRA.

The Battle of the Little Bighorn 1876
Custer's last stand at the Little Bighorn, from a contemporary engraving
This painting depicts the traditional view about the heroism of Custer and his men at the Battle of the Little Bighorn - Custer can be seen brandishing two guns, fighting until the very end.
However, this painting illustrates the problem of
of sources. This depiction is almost certainly wrong. An archaeological survey in 1983 found that Custer's men fell in a running battle, perhaps as they scattered and fled down the hillside towards the river. It also found that Custer was not scalped, which suggests that he shot himself, because the Sioux did not scalp a suicide.

360,4850,"Hemingway does not give a lot of direct explanation of how people are feeling, or what their motives are. His language is also quite bare. Instead, he likes to use symbols.
Remember the setting and think about what it might represent:
The minnows are described as sprinkling the surface ""like a handful of shot"". Hemingway does not use many similes in his writing, so why this one? What is the significance of what the minnows are being compared to?
How well is the fishing going? Who is in charge when they are setting the night-lines? What could that symbolise about their relationship?
Marjorie is described as not reeling in (that is, stopping) ""until the boat touched the shore"". She hopes for it to go well right up until the last minute. What does that tell you about her attitude to Nick?
The body language of the main characters is important. Think about how their positions on the blanket are described through the course of their conversation. How many times does Hemingway mention their positions, and why?
The moon seems to be significant. It could represent the end of their relationship. Look at what the characters say about it, and think about what they might really mean. It is only when the moon has finally come up completely that Nick has the courage to tell Marjorie what is really on his mind.

Floods can cause damage to homes and possessions as well as disruption to communications. However, flooding can also have positive impacts on an area.
Flooding deposits fine silt (alluvium) onto the floodplain, making it very fertile and excellent for agriculture. People living on or near floodplains may rely upon regular flooding to help support their farming and therefore provide food.
A Less Economically Developed Country [LEDC] has low levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the southern hemisphere (eg countries in southern Africa, southern Asia and South America) are LEDCs, while more of the countries in the northern hemisphere are More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs].
A More Economically Developed Country [MEDC] has high levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the northern hemisphere are MEDCs, eg UK, USA, Canada, Europe. More of the countries in the southern hemisphere are Less Economically Developed Countries [LEDCs].
by the effects of flooding. This is partly because LEDCs have more farms, and farming communities are attracted to fertile flood plains. LEDCs often do not have the resources to prevent flooding or deal with the aftermath of flooding.

362,1074,"Why does Mr Rochester marry Bertha Mason? In part, it is because he believes he is marrying an attractive woman. In part, it is to oblige his family by making a good marriage financially speaking. And in part it is because his father and brother, and Bertha's relatives, kept the madness in her family from him. While Rochester blames himself for falling for Bertha's superficial charm, he cannot forgive the betrayal of the deception. Even after his brother and father die, he is still trapped by the situation.
It is clear that he tries to hide from the reality of it, but when he meets Jane he sees her as extraordinarily different and refreshing. He falls deeply in love, but does not have the courage to tell her. He admits, after Mason has stopped the wedding, that he wanted to have her ""safe"" first, knowing her moral stance as he does. The fact that he was prepared to deceive her, even after his own experience, might suggest he needs a period of
before the happy ending. What is never in any doubt is how much he loves Jane:
""Oh, Jane! my hope - my love - my life!"" (Chapter 27.)

363,4118,"The following scenes use flash-backs into the past to describe the story:
Megan is in the headteacher's office, with the Head (DSL/R). The Head gives the victim's account of what happened. As she tells her account the lights dim and Megan joins the group CS, and re-enacts the scene as the lights go up. The commentary fades out as the scene is played. Freeze. Megan rejoins the Head in her office with her Head bowed. The Head asks what she has to say. She apologises, and says that she's ashamed etc. The Head brings in the victim, and Megan has to apologise - the victim doesn't answer.
Megan is now a mother, whose daughter has been accused of bullying. The scene takes place in the headteacher's office. Megan is horrified to hear of what her daughter has done, and tells of what happened when she was at school. Lights dim. She joins group CS and re-plays the scene. Freeze. She returns to the headteacher's office and it is still in the past (slightly dimmer lighting than previously). The scene unfolds, with a telling off and a statement by (young) Megan about how she feels about what she's done and what her parents will say. Freeze. Lights fully up and the scene is now today. Megan's daughter is told about what happened in the past, and is thoughtful. The headteacher asks that Megan's daughter be excluded from school for a day, to think about what will happen in the future.
These scenes will need more than three actors. Again, they focus on Megan's regret, and the guilt she feels about being a bully.

We have split Gamze's work journal into two halves, so you can see her research development and then the final ceramic pieces she created.
She started work by studying things from the sea from first-hand experience. She looked at shells, coral, fish, sea creatures, seaweed etc, and used water colours, pen and pencil.
Gamze looked at pictures of sea life in books, and at artwork by different artists. She planned to work in ceramics and so she also looked at the work of ceramicists like Kate Malone.
Gamze also developed her ideas by looking at work from different times and places in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Remember that when you make a point, you need to support it with a quotation and then explain exactly how the quotation highlights what you want to show.
At the start of the novel, we are told:
""Ralph and Jack smiled at each other with shy liking""
Yet by the end, they are mortal enemies. What happens to ruin their friendship?
Introduction - Discuss the quotation in the title. It occurs just after the first vote for chief in Chapter 1. What does it show about them?
Paragraph 1 - Look at Chapter 3, when Ralph builds huts while Jack hunts for pigs. What does it show about Ralph and Jack's priorities? Are they still together?
Paragraph 2 - Discuss what happens in Chapter 4 when Jack lets the fire go out when he goes hunting and a ship sails by. What impact does this have on the friendship?
Paragraph 3 - Examine how Jack undermines Ralph's authority more and more, such as when he rejects the law of the conch and other rules on the assembly in Chapter 5.
Paragraph 4 - Comment on Chapter 9, when Jack sets up his own tribe and Simon is killed in the 'dance'. What has happened to Ralph and Jack's relationship now?
Conclusion - By the end, Jack is in control of the fort and of all the boys. He wants Ralph dead. What does this show about the differences between the former friends?

- as promised, Lenin made the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany although it meant that Russia lost vast amounts of its best industrial and agricultural land in Poland and the Ukraine.
- the Bolsheviks gave the land previously owned by the nobles to the peasants, and factories were handed over to workers' committees.
- the Bolsheviks banned religion; brought in an eight-hour day for workers, as well as unemployment pay and pensions; abolished the teaching of history and Latin, while encouraging science; and allowed divorce.
- there was a huge campaign to teach everyone to read. Agit trains' went around the country showing communist newsreels and giving lectures to teach peasants about Communism.

The means of production should be owned equally by the whole community (hence communism), not as in capitalism where individuals (who might be very rich) own the means of production and leave the rest of society to be poor and oppressed wage slaves.
A deterministic interpretation of history, which said that society must inevitably develop through successive stages of slavery, feudalism, then capitalism, ending up with the violent overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a communist society.
They should work to overthrow capitalism throughout the world by means of a revolution by the proletariat (workers).
Class was a feature of capitalist society, and should be destroyed and replaced by a society of equals.
The economy should be planned - controlled by the government.
Lenin changed Marx's ideas to add that a Communist government first had to be a dictatorship which was essential in order to bring in the communist state safely.

367,41,"An electronics product can be thought of as a
with inputs, processes and outputs. The most common method of manufacturing electronic products is the batch method - though one-off production and continuous-flow production are also important.
ICT is used extensively in electronics manufacturing. The use of machines that are controlled by computers is called computer-aided manufacture or CAM.
Electronics systems diagrams are used to show how the parts of a product work together. Many electronic products are made up of a number of standard system circuits (circuits that are common to many different products), such as sensors, amplifiers, timers, counters and output devices.
System diagrams usually take the form of a
in which each part of the electronic system is represented by an input, a process or an output.
The block diagrams below shows two types of system.
has no feedback mechanism, so the accuracy depends on how well the system was set up before hand.
electronic systems use sensors to provide feedback. This means that if the output is not satisfactory, the inputs or processes can be altered.

How can we know if there is something we call God?
There are five main arguments used to give proof that God exists. These arguments are usually applied to Christianity.
""that than which nothing greater can be conceived""
. Therefore God (like unicorns) exists in the mind.
It is not possible to think of any being greater than God (as God is
""that than which nothing greater can be conceived""
). Therefore God must exist in reality.
Everything has to come from something. You cannot make something out of nothing.
Therefore there must have been a First Cause that created the something (the universe). That First Cause is God.
If you were walking on a heath and saw a watch on the ground you would assume that its parts had not come together by chance because it is too ordered and complicated. Therefore someone must have designed it or it would not work.
Because the universe is also ordered and complicated, someone must have designed that too. That 'someone' is God.
Some people claim that they have had a religious experience eg, a miracle (a fortuitous event believed to have been caused by divine intervention), a vision, or a particular prayer to God answered.
Some people say that everyone knows the difference between right and wrong. They describe this as having a sense of morality.
This sense of morality has to come from somewhere, and the only possible source is God. Therefore God exists.

369,1793,"The search to combat disease gained enormous
in the 19th century. Instruments such as the
were invented, and research into inoculation began to bear fruit.
Methods of diagnosis changed massively during the course of the 19th century.
(France: 1816) invented the stethoscope and started the practice of 'auscultation' (listening to the patient's chest).
(France: 1834) argued that symptoms were irrelevant, and that what was happening inside the body was much more important when it came to diagnosing illness. As a result, doctors made diagnoses on the basis of a full clinical examination of the 'signs' made by the disease on the body.
(Germany: 1878) developed the technique of biopsy (removing cells to determine if they were cancerous).
to measure the functions of the body precisely:
(Germany: 1847) invented the kymograph (which measured the pulse).
(Holland: 1900) invented the electrocardiograph (which measures heart activity).
The search for new ways to cure disease also gained momentum in the 19th century, and included the discovery of how
Usually a medical injection, which introduces a weakened dose of harmful disease-causing organisms into a patient's body. This induces the body to develop an immunity to the disease, which protects the patient from the full-blown sickness.
(France: 1880) discovered by chance (when he left bacteria exposed to air) that injecting chickens with an attenuated (weakened) form of chicken cholera gave them immunity to the disease (ie he discovered the principle of inoculation).
That realisation was the start of an important chain of events.
developed an effective inoculation against anthrax (1881), and rabies (1885).
(France: 1906) developed the BCG injection against TB.
(Germany: 1913) developed an anti-toxin against diphtheria.
(Germany: 1890s) reasoned that, if certain dyes could stain bacteria, perhaps certain chemicals could kill them. He set up a private laboratory and a team of scientists. By 1914 they had discovered several 'magic bullets' - compounds that would have a specific attraction to disease-causing microorganisms in the body, and that would target and kill them. These were methylene blue (for malaria), trypan red (for sleeping sickness) and Salvarsan (for syphilis) - although Salvarsan was more effective than the other two.
Preparations, often made of weakened viruses of a disease. These are given to a sick person (often by injection), in order to protect him or her from that disease, by causing the body to form antibodies against it.
, however (eg one developed by Robert Koch against TB in 1891), were not successful. And against
. They carried, as one medical historian wrote, 'a box of blanks'. So people looked elsewhere for their cures - sometimes in strange places.
A home medicine encyclopaedia of 1910 recommended cures that included electrical shocks, injection with animal hormones, and a range of
Other alternative medical treatments included mesmerism (hypnotism), homeopathy (taking tiny doses of poisons), 'health reform' (a religious movement which recommended a healthy lifestyle - it was run by John Kellogg whose brother invented cornflakes) and Christian Science (which taught that disease only existed in the mind).
Travelling 'quacks' sold patent medicines (such as Lily the Pink's

371,707,"Line graphs, frequency polygons and stem and leaf diagrams
For the exam, you will need to know how to draw and interpret statistical diagrams including two way tables, line graphs, frequency polygons and stem and leaf diagrams.
Below is an example of a two-way table showing the number of boys and girls in a 6th form college:
We can find out lots of information from this table, for example:
There are 260 girls in the college (120 + 140)
of the boys are in U6 (100 out of 240)
48% of the pupils are boys (
If a girl is chosen at random, the probability that she is in class L6 is
(there are 260 girls, and 120 of them are in L6, so
If a boy is chosen at random, what is the probability that he is in U6?
There are 260 pupils in L6 (140 boys and 120 girls)
Line graphs are made by joining up points plotted on a graph.
This table shows a country's grape production (in thousands ['000s] of tonnes) for the years 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980 and 1990.
This data can be represented in the form of a line graph as shown below.
Frequency polygons can be used to represent grouped data.
Fifty bags of sweets were opened. The number of sweets in each bag is recorded in the table below:
Represent this information in the form of a frequency polygon.
The frequency polygon is plotted at the
A maths test is marked out of 50. The marks for the class are shown below:
This data can be more easily interpreted if we represent it in a
This stem and leaf diagram shows the data above:
The stem and leaf diagram is formed by splitting the numbers into two parts - in this case, tens and units.
The tens form the stem and the units form the leaves.
This information is given to us in the
It is usual for the numbers to be ordered. So, for example, the row
shows the numbers 21, 23, 24, 24, 25 and 27 in order.
From the stem and leaf diagram how many children scored more than 40?
6 people had a score of more than 40
To find this look down the ""stem"" to the the column labelled 4, and don't forget to include the child who scored 50!
As well as providing valuable evidence to support your finding, statistics can be misleading. They are often used to prove a point, and can easily be twisted in favour of that point.
Here are some examples of misleading graphs.
What is wrong with this bar chart? How should the information be represented?
From this graph, it looks as though house prices have trebled in one year! It is misleading because the vertical axis does not start at 0. Look at the 'improved' version of the same graph. This gives a much more accurate picture of what has happened.
Although the vertical scale starts at 0, it does not go up in even steps. This distorts the graph, and makes it look as though the biggest jump is between 1 and 2, rather than 3 and 4.
Also, there are no labels on the axes, so we have no idea what this graph represents!
What is wrong with this 3D bar chart?
This 3D bar chart might look very attractive, but it is also very misleading. There is no scale on the vertical axis and, because of the perspective, it looks as though sales for 1995 were far greater than those for any other year. In fact, they were identical to those in 1997.
The data would be better represented on a 2D-bar chart, with appropriate labelling on each axis:
What is wrong with this pictogram showing the number of people who own different types of pets?
On this pictogram, there is no category for people who do not own a pet. The pictures are different sizes, and it appears that more people own a horse than any other animal.
An improvement would be to redraw the pictogram, with each of the animals the same size and aligned with one another like this:

The Romans did, however, have a large number of

Alan Davie: 'To a Celtic Spirit, 1'
Alan Davie is a prominent Scottish artist well known for his work in a range of mediums including drawing, painting, and screenprinting.
He was born in 1920 and graduated from the Edinburgh Royal College of Art in 1940. After serving in World War II he began teaching in Edinburgh and in 1947 became a professional jazz musician.
In 1948 he took up a travelling art scholarship from the college and travelled throughout Europe in 1948-9. In Venice he met
, an influential art collector, who introduced him to
. Whilst exhibiting in New York in 1956 he befriended other artists including
Jackson Pollock, Willem De Kooning and Mark Rothko
His work continues to be widely exhibited across the USA and Europe.
and reflects the artist's love of jazz music, non-western cultural symbols, ancient religious and ethnic influences.
My ideas are intuitive and most ideas come from my thoughts. The art I create is no way expressive or impressionist, it just comes from an artist drive I have to keep on creating.
The work of art seems to be something thrown off, a by-product of the process of being and working. Art just happens, like falling in love.
When I am working, I am aware of a striving, a yearning, the making of many impossible attempts at a kind of transmutation  a searching for a formula for the magical conjuring of the unknowable. Many times the end seems just within reach, only to fly to pieces before me as I reach for it.
I paint because I have nothing, or I paint because I am full of ideas ... or I paint because after I last painted, something appeared miraculously out of it.
The titles are not necessarily directly linked to the image, they are more often terms I have to use to catalogue the artwork I have created.
Inside is a place of magic; resounding, surrounding, where big hanging works in progress are constantly being transformed and re-worked, making a shifting environment of developing moods, spaces, colours, forms, poetry fragments, script, signs and symbols, laughing, singing.

376,4832,"Guarding against hazards: food workers in a prawn processing plant
Safety is vitally important in the food industry, for obvious reasons. As in any other type of production, the most important part of safety-consciousness is identifying and monitoring potential
anything likely to cause harm and/or damage
) and taking steps to avoid them. There are three main types of hazard in food production:
is where foods become dangerously infected by bacteria. This might lead to food poisoning, such as salmonella.
occurs where foreign bodies, such as nuts and screws from factory machinery, personal jewellery and fingernails, fall into the food.
is where potentially dangerous fluids or pesticides have found their way into food.
Control of Substance Hazardous to Health (COSHH)
regulations help to protect workers in the food and other industry from hazardous substances such as cleaning fluids and pesticides. It encourages employers to put safety procedures in place to prevent accidents.
is a set of procedures used by caterers to ensure food is always safe to eat. This is based on
Critical control points (CCPs) are pre-determined checks which take place at specified points in the food production or preparation process. They must be carefully documented, with details of the checks themselves, the processes being checked, any faults and remedial action taken. Some of these checks will be done by hand - others may be computerised under CAM. They will include checking:
speeds at which machines and conveyor belts move
scanning for impurities, such as metal, and other potential hazards

377,5417,"AO3 is all about experimenting - but you can't start on that until you've found a theme that inspires you. This Revision Bite should help you find subjects you can really go to town on.
You can get lots of ideas by making a spidergram, mindmap or flowchart. Don't stop until there's nothing left to write, however strange the connections you make!
Write the theme your teacher has given you in the middle of a piece of paper. Then just see what that theme makes you think about. Whatever it is, write it down, and then see what that makes you think about next. Just let each idea connect in some way with the next. Let your ideas flow. Don't worry that they might seem silly.

When a substance is described as impermeable it means that fluids, especially water, are unable to pass through it.

, due to the combination of high rainfall and impermeable rock.
V shaped river valleys formed by the numerous surface streams. Valley sides are steep due to the resistant nature of the granite.
Contour lines are found close together on a map.
The land is at a higher altitude than the surrounding area due to the resistant nature of the rock.
Most of the large settlements, eg Tavistock, and Ashburton are found near the outskirts of Dartmoor.

. Kaolin, also known as china clay, is a product of hydrolysis and is used in ceramics and papermaking. The industry is very important for employment and the local economy.
. Granite blocks were used for dry stone walling, buildings and road stone. Many quarries are now abandoned.
. Dartmoor is a National Park. It is popular for walking, camping and pony trekking and over 10 million people a year visit the area.
. The soils are poor and acidic, and frequently used for sheep farming rather than growing crops.
. Copper and tin mining used to be common. The metals were found in thin 'veins' within the granite.
Quarrying, mining and china clay extraction can leave scars on the landscape. This makes it less attractive for both tourists and locals.
Tourism causes pollution and congestion on the roads. Tourist activities can sometimes lead to conflict with locals.
Tourists buying second homes pushes property prices up which means locals cannot afford to buy. Rural poverty is becoming a problem in areas such as Dartmoor.

384,1375,"Martin Parr talks about why he loves using a camera and how he decides what to take and which photos to use.
Martin Parr was born in Surrey in 1952 and is an acclaimed documentary photographer and photo-journalist.
He studied at Manchester Polytechnic and since then has used photography and film to take a critical look at mass tourism, food and the family amongst other subjects.
Martin Parr still shoots in medium-format colour but has experimented with fill-in flash and a 35mm ringflash camera.
His work can be poignant and joyful at the same time and conveys his natural curiosity:
Photography is the simplest way of articulating how I feel about the world.
I don't crop my pictures. I just move in and out with my feet. So if I want to get closer I won't change lens I'll just get nearer to the subject.

? Briefly note down some points that you would want to include in your essay, then compare your ideas with those in our sample answer on the next page.
War transforms soldiers, breaking them physically and mentally: 'Bent double' 'Knock-kneed'. Rather than glorious men, Owen presents the soldiers as weakened old 'hags'.
The experience of war is something no soldier can escape: 'In all my dreams, before my helpless sight, / He plunges at me'.
The effect of gas used in World War One is communicated to the reader through Owen's use of verbs linked to death by a lack of oxygen: 'guttering, choking, drowning', 'smothering'.
Owen offers the reader very graphic imagery associated with suffering, aiming to present the truth about the war experience, arguably arising from his first-hand experience of war.
Owen presents the soldiers as victims who have been betrayed by those who encouraged them to go to war. He uses words such as 'innocent' and 'children' to reinforce his positive attitude to the soldiers.
Owen is bitter about war and the encouragement given to go to war. He angrily refers to 'The old Lie' that dying for your country is sweet and honourable.
The detailed description of a soldier dying as a result of gas attack is intended to make the reader feel discomfort, forcing him or her to confront the reality of war, something which is far from honourable or sweet.

Coal is an example of a fossil fuel
The fossil fuels include coal, natural gas and the products from the fractional distillation of crude oil, such as petrol and diesel. When any fossil fuel is burned, one of the combustion products is carbon dioxide.
amounts of fossil fuels have been burned each year. This has led to an increase in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air. Many scientists believe this is causing
Global warming refers to the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's surface. In the last 100 years it is believed to have risen by 0.6 degrees C. There are estimates that in the next 100 years, the global temperatures could rise by as much as 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.
One way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air is to burn
fossil fuels. Unfortunately, we depend on the burning of fossil fuels for heating, electricity generation and transport. If we are to burn less fossil fuels, we will need alternatives for these essential activities.

387,1598,"If you are mainly painting and drawing, you'll be expected to develop your knowledge and understanding of colour, form, tone, texture and shape.
You'll need to explore the results of painting on different surfaces, the qualities of different paints, and the effects of using different painting tools. For example, acrylic paint can be used to create flat surfaces of colour but if it's watered down sufficiently, it can be used to create washes of colour.

How has each artist used paint to show how they feel about their subject matter?
How have time and/or place influenced each artist?
Does it look like the artist has used a brush or palette knife to apply the paint?
Does the way in which each artist has used the paint affect the mood, atmosphere or the way it looks?
Does the size of either of the paintings affect the viewer?
What (painting) devices does Justin Mortimer use to show Mick Scarletts personality. How does he show his response to and feelings about him?
How does Robert Maclaurin show that the atmosphere and mood of a place is more important to him than the accurate recording of its details?

surface. By adding turpentine to the mix, you can make the paint thinner, more
and have a more matt finish. By adding oil (such as linseed or poppy oil) you make the paint thinner, more transparent and give it a more glossy finish. Adding wax will give a soft matt finish and make the paint thicker too.
Acrylic paint can be mixed with anything water based, such as water, soap, PVA glue and other water based paint. It can be applied thin or thick. You can try mixing in an acrylic medium to make the paint more transparent. This is useful for glazing effects and more subtle colouring.
Water colour and gouache paints are both water based, so like acrylic they can be mixed with anything water based.
experiment with the surface you are painting on
. Try wood, paper, card, glass or metal. Create a collage, cut into the surface, or tear the paper and rejoin it in a different way.
Surfaces can be changed in a variety of ways, scratched, roughened, made uneven or smoothed
. Try using sandpaper to remove some of the paint from previous painting and then paint onto it some more.
Try painting onto a wet surface, and a dry surface. Try painting over old painting once it's dry. You can be surprised how good the results can be.
Make use of a palette knife to discover new textures, or draw into the paint with the wrong end of your paintbrush. Try adding things such as glue, rice or sand onto, or into, the paint to build up or create a variety of interesting textures.
Try different sizes and shapes of brushes. Decorating brushes are a cheap alternative to large artist quality brushes. Try painting without brushes, using pieces of wood or plastic as scrapers, or bits of rag to apply the paint.
When you are experimenting have an idea in mind of what you want to achieve, and then see what techniques give you the most success.

explore a range of materials on which to draw
, such as different thicknesses, types and textures of paper. Experiment to see the difference it makes what type of marks you use to draw the same subject. Try making marks that are all the same all over. Then try to get a wide range of different marks into the same drawing.
a collective name for images, video and audio
. Try drawing with wet media like watercolours, ink or watered-down acrylic paint. Try different mark-making materials from pencils to pastels, inks, pens, charcoal, sticks, matches. Try fine aquarelle pencils for subtle colour blending, or make a delicate wash by brushing over them with water.
Try using different types of eraser. Try using erasers to make marks and remove parts of the drawing. Putty rubbers are very soft and can be used to lighten shadows, to give delicate shading, by rubbing gently at areas you've already shaded. Try rubbing out an area and then drawing back into the mess that is left behind.

388,5734,"In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!

confusion about the nature of the Industrial Revolution
, and where the revolution in the British economy started.
Recently, certain economic historians have claimed that there was

393,3764,"Atticus takes on the defence of Tom Robinson, a Negro. Scout is taunted about this by various children, including her cousin Francis at a family Christmas gathering - he calls Atticus a 'nigger lover'. Jem and Scout's admiration for their father rises enormously, though, when he shoots a dangerous mad dog with one shot.
When old Mrs Dubose also insults the children because of Atticus' involvement in Tom Robinson's case, Jem is so furious that he beheads every camellia in her yard. As a punishment, Jem has to read to her every night for a month. When she dies, Atticus explains to the children that she was a morphine addict who was trying to break the habit and succeeded just before her death ' rather than hate her they should admire her courage.

Listen to the poem and watch the slideshow
'I rise in the dawn, and I kneel and blow
Till the seed of the fire flicker and glow;
And then I must scrub and bake and sweep
Till stars are beginning to blink and peep;
And the young lie long and dream in their bed
Of the matching of ribbons for bosom and head,
And their day goes over in idleness,
And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress:
While I must work because I am old,
And the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold.'
The poem is about a hard-working, poor old woman who compares herself to the young women of the house who spend their days dreaming of love and worrying about their appearance. It is not clear whether these young women are her own children or the children of people she works for as a maid. The poem is written in the

Renaissance knowledge about the body and disease
The Early Modern Age was an exciting time for medicine, with knowledge of the human body progressing in fundamental ways - although the causes of disease remained a mystery.
Two key practitioners moved knowledge forwards in the Early Modern Age:
Follower of Vesalius in graveyard, searching for bodies to dissect
, whose patron was Charles V of Spain. He trained at Louvain, Paris and Padua universities, and ransacked cemeteries and gibbets for bones and for bodies to dissect.
. He also realised that the famous doctor Galen could be wrong, when he discovered that the great man was mistaken about there being two bones in the jaw, and about how muscles were attached to the bone.
He became professor of medicine at Padua University. He said that medical students should perform
""... our true book of the human body is man himself.""
He published 'Fabric of the Human Body' (with high-quality annotated illustrations).
- who discovered the principle of the
through the body. He trained at Cambridge and Padua universities, and became doctor to James I and Charles I of England.
He calculated that it was impossible for the blood to be burned up in the muscles (as Galen had claimed).
He published 'Anatomical Account of the Motion of the Heart and Blood', which scientifically proved the principle of the circulation of the blood. This book marked the end of Galen's influence on anatomy.
