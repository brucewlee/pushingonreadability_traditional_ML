0,563,"It took 100,000 people about 20 years to build the Great Pyramid.
It is made of more than 2 million blocks of stone.
Most of the blocks weigh about 6,000 pounds each!
Workers poured water onto the logs so the blocks would roll more easily.
The Earth has many mysteries, or things that are not known or explained. People use science to try to understand those mysteries.
The pyramids are giant tombs, or graves, for Egyptian kings. Pyramids are made of huge stone blocks. Experts know that the Egyptians didn't have the same tools that we have today. So, how were those heavy blocks moved and lifted? Some experts believe that the Egyptians pushed and pulled them into place.
1. Workers cut and shaped the stone into blocks.
2. The workers floated the blocks down the Nile River on big barges.
3. The workers rolled the blocks over logs from the river to the pyramid.
4. The workers built dirt ramps so the blocks could be rolled to the top of the pyramid.
5. Workers carefully fit the stone blocks into place on the pyramid.
No one knows for sure what the dinosaurs looked like. Some experts think that dinosaur skin might have looked and felt like the scaly skin of reptiles today.
Experts study how animals today use skin color to survive. Some animals, like the chameleon, can change skin color in order to hide. Experts also say that other animals, like poison arrow frogs, have brightly colored skin to keep away their enemies.
It is likely that dinosaurs also used skin color to survive, say experts. For example, some experts say that Stegosaurus's plates might have changed color and size to scare its enemies.

2,20,"Tornado season has started in the United States. A
is a powerful, spinning wind. It is also known as a twister.
Most tornadoes last fewer than 15 minutes. During that time, a twister can travel across a large area of land and destroy everything in its path.
The strong winds in some tornadoes reach speeds of up to 300 miles per hour. Those winds can toss cars and other objects high into the air.
Tornadoes can happen any time of the year. However, they are most common from March through July.
A tornado can destroy homes and trees.
Most tornadoes start as thunderstorms. During those storms, heavy rain and lightning are common. Large
, or ball-shaped pieces of ice, may also fall.
Large thunderstorm clouds appear in the sky. The clouds become dark. Thunder can be heard.
Warm and cold air meet. Air rises from the ground to the clouds. If the rising air starts to spin, a funnel-shaped cloud can form.
The funnel-shaped cloud spins faster. When the bottom of the cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.
As the tornado travels across the ground, it picks up anything in its way.
Why is it important to learn about tornadoes?

3,465,"Imagine having to quit school to help your family earn money. Or think about what it might be like to be in a class with 49 other students and only one teacher.
Kids in some countries must deal with problems like those. But a special worldwide organization is trying to help them.
UNICEF helps children around the world. One way it helps is by providing schools and supplies. Three of the countries where UNICEF helps with education are Colombia, in South America, Rwanda (ruh-WAHN-duh), in Africa, and Thailand (TIGH-land), in Southeast Asia.
Those countries are probably far from where you live. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to go to school in another country?
In Colombia, the government requires kids to go to school for at least five years. Some people are poor and must work hard to survive. Some children must quit school to help their parents earn money.
With UNICEF's help, Colombia's government is creating a special school for those children. The students learn at their own pace and attend when they can. They have a small library and a garden where they grow vegetables.
One or two teachers must teach all the students, from grades 1 through 5. Students of the same age work together in small groups, helping one another learn.
Children in Rwanda must go to school from ages 7 to 15. But there is not enough space in some schools in Rwanda to fit all the students. Some students cannot afford to buy the uniforms and notebooks they must have to go to school.
To help solve those problems, UNICEF has created a special program called Schools-in-a-Box. Each box contains school supplies, workbooks, and learning games. When teachers use the Schools-in-a-Box, kids can be taught wherever they are.
Children in Thailand must go to school for six years. Though school is free, some families cannot afford to buy the uniforms children must wear to school.
Some classrooms in Thailand have as many as 50 kids and only one teacher! Often, children of all ages are in the same grade. The children must share the few books and school supplies that are in the school.
But UNICEF is working to help these people. The organization has built Village Education Centers in parts of Thailand. At night, adults gather there and take classes. During the day, the buildings are schools for children.
UNICEF is an organization that works to help children all over the world. UNICEF tries to provide health care, nutritious food, clean water, and an education for all children. The organization raises money and talks to world governments about helping children.

6,109,"Fire officials are alarmed. Some lighters are made to look like toys. Parents who think they are toys are buying them for their
children. Kids have started fires when playing with the lighters.
Now fire officials are fighting back. They want to stop the sale of those lighters. This year, Maine became the first state to pass a law to stop the sale of the lighters. Then Tennessee passed a law. Fire officials in Oregon are working to do the same.
Lighters are tools, not toys, says Richard Hoover. He is a spokesperson for the Oregon state fire marshal. A dangerous tool should not look like a toy.
This guitar and the frog (above) are lighters. They are tools for adults, not toys for kids.

7,499,"Some places get wet weather during spring.
Grab your raincoat and boots! Spring is here. That means warmer, rainy weather in some parts of the United States. Read the answers to some questions about wet weather.
A few wet drops land on your head. Its raining! Rain falls from clouds. Clouds are made of tiny bits of water and ice. The bits grow bigger as they join together. Some get so heavy that they fall to the ground. The ice melts if the air is warmer along the way. The raindrops reach the ground as water.
. Those are storms with heavy rain, lightning, and thunder. As lightning strikes, it heats the air around it. That causes the air to
, or get bigger. When that happens, you hear a loud sound called thunder.
When it rains, you may see a rainbow. It appears when sunlight passes through drops of water in the air. The drops break up the sunlight into seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Why? Sunlight is always made up of those colors. They look white when they are together. The drops of water separate each color.
Why might it be useful to learn about weather?

8,113,"Many people visit Hawaii each year. They admire the coral reefs that surround the islands. But those beautiful reefs have been damaged by people and ships. Recently the United States government made a law to protect the reefs around Hawaii.
is a large strip of hard sea animal skeletons that is close to the ocean's surface. More than half of the United States' coral reefs are located in the waters around Hawaii.
Coral reefs provide homes for sea animals. Reefs also protect coastlines from dangerous, pounding waves. When waves pass over reefs, they slow down and get smaller.
Hawaii's reefs are being hurt. People have polluted the water around the reefs and have taken too many fish.
Before he left office, President Bill Clinton created the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Reserve. A
is an area protected by the government. This reserve is underwater and covers 84 million acres. That is almost as big as the states of Florida and Georgia combined.
Special rules make sure the reef reserve will be protected. People are not allowed to remove coral from the reefs. The number of fish taken from the reserve area cannot go up. Hawaii's reefs are now protected from further damage.
A coral reef is built by tiny sea creatures called coral
Coral polyps have hard outer skeletons that protect them. When the polyps die, their skeletons stay. After a long time, the coral skeletons build up, forming a reef.
More than 2/3 of the world's coral reefs have been damaged by pollution and too much fishing.
Coral can be tan, orange, yellow, purple, or green.
The Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef in the world. It is about 1,250 miles long and is located off the northeast coast of Australia.

12,12,"Smile! New studies show that people who have healthy teeth and gums also have healthy hearts. Thats why brushing and flossing your teeth is so important. It removes the bacteria that can cause problems in other places in your body, says Dr. Sally Cram. She is a spokesperson for the American Dental Association.
Here are some ways you can keep your teeth and gums healthy:
 Brush your teeth twice a day with toothpaste. Replace your toothbrush every three to four months.
 Floss gently once a day. Dental floss is thread that cleans between your teeth.
 Visit a dentist twice a year. Your dentist will clean your teeth and make sure they are healthy.
 Eat foods that are good for you. Those foods include fresh fruits and vegetables.
What are some ways to keep your whole body healthy?

14,595,"How do stinkbugs and burrower bugs send messages? They use plants like telephone lines! That is what a new study shows. The insects drum on leaves and stems. They also shake their bodies. That makes the plants vibrate. Other insects hear the vibrations.
To do the study, scientists watched 21 species of stinkbugs and burrower bugs. The scientists measured the tiny vibrations using a laser. They learned that different species have their own vibration patterns. Males and females of the same species have different patterns too.
A stinkbug uses a leaf to send vibrations to other stinkbugs.

 He started writing in a journal at age 16. He had good handwriting. He wrote about what he did each day.
 He was a soldier and a farmer before he became president.
 He had many dogs and horses. He also had a parrot named Polly.
 At the age of 22, he started to lose his teeth. When he became president, he had only one tooth left. He wore false teeth.
 He never lived in the White House. Why? It had not been built yet. Work on the White House was started in 1792. It was finished in 1800.
Abraham Lincoln was our 16th president. He was born in Kentucky on February 12, 1809. He was president from 1861 to 1865.

27,507,"Summer is almost here! Why do experts say that summer is the most dangerous time of the year for kids? During the summer, most schools are closed. Kids have more time to play outside, ride bikes, and swim. That means kids have more chances to get hurt.
Playing outside gives you a chance to breathe fresh air, but it also exposes you to harmful sun rays. Harmful sun rays can cause sunburns. You can get a sunburn even if you are outside for a short amount of time. So when you are in the sun, always wear sunscreen. Use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher, and be sure to rub it evenly into your skin. You should also wear a hat and try to play in the shade.
Whether you ride a bike, ride a scooter, or use in-line skates, be wheel safe. The most serious way kids get hurt while on wheels is by hitting their heads. So always wear a helmet when you are playing on wheels. When you ride scooters and use in-line skates, always wear wrist guards, kneepads, and elbow pads.
What's the Right Way to Wear a Helmet?
A helmet should be straight on the head, just above the eyebrows.
The chin strap should be snug but not too tight.
The rear straps go behind the ears; the front straps should run up and down.
One way to beat the summer heat is by swimming in a cool pool. To stay safe when you swim, you need to follow water-safety rules. Be water safe by swimming only when a grown-up is nearby. You should always swim with a buddy.

29,546,"About 47 million American kids went back to school in September. Some live in cities that do not have big enough schools for all the kids. Some of those cities do not have space or money to build new schools.

32,127,"Scientists have never seen a living giant squid. They want to learn more about this huge animal that lives deep in the ocean.
Scientists believe giant squids live about a mile down in the ocean. They live in the coldest, darkest part of the ocean.
Recently, scientists traveled in submarines to look for the giant squid. Even with the light from the submarine, they could not see the huge giant squid.
The sperm whale is the giant squid's only enemy. Scientists attached video cameras to the heads of some sperm whales with suction cups. They hoped the cameras would take pictures of giant squids swimming. The cameras filmed other types of squids, but not the giant squid. For now, the giant squid remains a mystery.
What Does a Giant Squid Look Like?
A giant squid has eight arms and two
. A tentacle is like an arm, except it is much longer.
A giant squid can be 60 feet long and weigh 1,000 pounds.
A giant squid has huge eyes, as big as a kid's head.
A giant squid has a beak that looks somewhat like a parrot's beak.
Debra Ingrao works at Mote Marine Laboratory in Florida. Last year, Debra flew to New Zealand to bring back a dead giant squid to study. She talked to
I love the ocean and want to learn more about the sea animals living in it.
What do you love most about your job?
I enjoy studying sea animals in their natural habitats. [A
is the place where an animal lives.]
Why is studying the giant squid important?
Everything we learn helps us understand the deep sea better.
Should we be afraid of the giant squid?
Its large size is scary! But giant squids don't live where people swim.
What does a giant squid's skin feel like?
The skin is very smooth and a bit slimy.
Do you want to go on a search for a living giant squid in the future?
If I got to go on a search, it would be my wildest dream come true!

35,81,"Earth Day is a time for people to think about taking care of Earth. People can celebrate Earth Day by keeping plants and animals healthy. They can also help keep Earth clean. But taking care of Earth is important all of the time. Turn the page to see how you can be Earth-friendly every day!
Each person in the United States makes about 4 pounds of trash per day! So landfills, or places where people dump trash, are starting to get full. People should reduce, or make smaller, the amount of trash they throw away.
Paper takes up the largest amount of space in most landfills. Paper does not easily biodegrade, or break down. But paper is easily recycled, or used again, after going through a special process.
Recycle by taking old newspapers or old homework to a recycling center.
Some trash in landfills could be used for other things! Instead of throwing trash away, people should find more ways to reuse it, or use trash again.
Reuse the top of a pizza box as an easel. Use the bottom part of the box to store your art supplies.
Many times people forget to respect, or care for, Earth. One way to show respect for Earth is to use less water, electricity, and gasoline.
Respect Earth by turning off the water faucet while you are brushing your teeth.

36,608,"Put on your party hats! February 12 is the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincolns birth. He was the 16th president of our country.
A big birthday event takes place on February 12 at the Lincoln Memorial. A
is something that keeps a memory alive. The Lincoln Memorial is a building in Washington, D.C., that honors Lincoln. There, Americans will gather to hear speeches about Lincoln.
Events honoring Lincolns birthday actually began a year ago. A giant birthday party was held at the Lincoln Museum in Kentucky. That is the state where Lincoln was born.
Statue of Abraham Lincoln sitting in a chair.
Since then, many other events have taken place across the United States. They have included poetry readings, plays, dances, and tours of places where Lincoln lived. Events will continue until February 2010.
Why is the country having such a big celebration? It isnt just because Lincoln was a great president, says David Early. Early is a spokesperson for the group that has been planning the celebration. Lincolns story could be anybodys story, he explains. He grew up poor on a farm and rose to become president of the United States.
When Lincoln was president, some people owned slaves. He worked to help end slavery. One of the things that makes Lincoln great is that he believed everyone should be treated the same, says Early.
If Abraham Lincoln were here today, what would you ask him? Why?

38,386,"In Harlem, a section of New York City, playing hockey and doing well in school go hand in hand.
A program called Ice Hockey in Harlem teachers kids how to play hockey. They learn the rules of the game and about hockey equipment. Then, one night per week, kids practice hockey at a local skating rink.
To play hockey, the kids have to go to tutoring sessions. The sessions use hockey information as learning tools. For example, the kids practice math skills by comparing hockey teams' scores. If the kids keep their grades up, they can play on hockey teams. Some travel across the country playing other teams.

40,242,"People in the United States will celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day on January 15. That day is King's birthday. He will be honored for the important work he did. Soon, a monument will be built in Washington, D.C., to honor King.
A Memorial for Martin Luther King Jr.
will soon be built for Martin Luther King. A memorial is a special statue or place meant to remind people of a person or event. The memorial will honor the work King did for all Americans.
The memorial will sit on the shore of the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. It will cover an area of land about the size of three football fields. Visitors will be able to walk along a path lined with large stone panels. Each panel will show words from King's important speeches. There will also be a 20-foot-high stone statue of King.
Workers will probably begin building the memorial this year. They plan to finish the memorial in 2003.
On August 28, 1963, King gave an important speech in Washington, D.C., to more than 200,000 people. King asked that all people be treated
or the same. That speech is often called the ""I Have a Dream"" speech.
For many years, African Americans were not treated equally in the United States. King worked hard to solve that problem. He told people to work out their problems by talking, not fighting.

41,246,"When snow first falls, it is usually soft and fluffy. But tightly packed snow is very strong, and it is almost as hard as ice. Tightly packed snow is so strong that some people use it to build homes called igloos. Some Inuit (IN-oo-it) people in Canada use blocks of snow to build igloos.
Snow is a good insulator. An insulator holds heat inside. Sometimes people, such as campers and hikers, dig a hole in the snow or make a snow cave to stay warm.
The largest snowflake ever measured was almost a foot across.
Stampede Pass, Washington, is called the snow capital of the United States!

42,269,"The Pilgrims landing on Plymouth Rock, December 1620.
landed at the place that is now Massachusetts. There were 101 Pilgrims aboard the ship. After some time, the Pilgrims built a town called Plymouth. Read below to learn more.
The Pilgrims landed near the area where the Wampanoag (wahm-pah-NOH-ahg) people already lived. The Wampanoag people knew how to stay safe during cold winters. They made homes called
(weh-TOOZ) to protect themselves from the cold. They also made warm clothing from deerskin.
The Pilgrims arrived close to wintertime. That winter was very cold, and many Pilgrims died. When spring came, a Wampanoag man named Squanto helped the Pilgrims. He showed them where to hunt, and he taught them how to grow corn. This helped the Pilgrims get food to eat.
When the fall harvest came, the Pilgrims had plenty of food to eat! They were very thankful for Squanto's help. Together, the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag people had a harvest celebration. For three days, people ate, played games, and told stories to celebrate and give thanks.
Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division [reproduction number LC-USZC4-4961]
That harvest celebration helped start the American tradition of Thanksgiving. Today, people still share food with their families and friends on this holiday. People also play games, tell stories, and spend time together to show they are thankful. Many people travel to be together on Thanksgiving too.
How do you show you are thankful?

45,533,"A fisherman in Japan recently spotted a rare shark. Staff at a nearby marine park discovered that it was a frilled shark. They caught the shark and took it to the park. The staff filmed it swimming and opening its jaws.
Frilled sharks are sometimes caught in fishing nets, but they are rarely seen alive. That is because their natural home is between 2,000 and 3,000 feet underwater, in the twilight zone.

48,281,"When kids get flu shots, everyone may end up healthier. That is what a new study shows. Almost 50 farming
in Canada took part in the study. A community is a group of people living in an area.
Kids in half the communities were given flu shots. Kids in the other half were not given flu shots. No adults were given flu shots.
What did scientists learn? Fewer adults and kids in the flu shot group got the flu. The scientists say that giving flu shots to kids can protect the whole community.
Health experts say kids should get a flu vaccine every year.

50,151,"Shark attacks are on the risebut probably not in the way you think. These days, the mighty fish are the ones being hunted.
About one-third of the worlds sharks are threatened. That is according to a recent study. Scientists studied 64 shark
. A species is a type of plant or animal. The scientists found that some types of sharks are
. Something that is endangered is at risk of dying out completely. That includes the oceanic whitetip shark (pictured below).
Fishing is partly to blame. People catch about 100 million sharks each year. Some of those fish are captured illegally.
World leaders are fishing for solutions to help sharks. Recently, representatives from fishing companies met in Spain. That is a country in Europe. They agreed to ask the companies to try to stop people from hunting sharks illegally.
We are pleased that governments ... have at last [understood] the ... need for shark [protection], says shark expert Sonja Fordham.

51,239,"You were fine a moment ago. Now you're tired and achy. The school nurse takes your temperature. You have a fever. Bad news-those are all symptoms of the flu, or
Hang in there; you are not alone. This flu season started early, and the virus spread quickly. The good news is that flu season appears to have slowed down.
Some health experts say this flu season was most harmful to kids. Doctors' offices and hospitals have been flooded with sick kids.
Schools in several states have closed for ""sick days"" because so many kids had the flu. To keep the virus from spreading, many teachers have asked students to wash their hands often. School officials want to make sure healthy students don't get sick.
Along with washing your hands, what else can you do to stay healthy?
The best way to stay flu-free is to get a flu
(vak-SEEN), or shot, say experts. ""If you get the flu, don't panic. Most kids will recover just fine,"" Dr. Carol Baker of Houston, Texas, told

52,439,"Thats not a koala earring. The colored tag in Yellows ear helps scientists tell her apart from the other koalas on St. Bees.
Koalas are pictured everywhere in Australiafrom boxes of chocolate to sports team jerseys. Yet the animals live only in small areas along the east coast.
The koalas were once widespread on the east coast. However, farmers cut down many of the forests where koalas lived. Hunters also killed the animals for their fur.
I recently joined Bill Ellis and his team in a forest on St. Bees Island. Ellis is a scientist who studies koalas. He and other scientists hope that studying koalas on the island will teach them how to protect koalas elsewhere in Australia.
We spotted a koala named Abby in a blue gum tree. The blue gum is a
or type, of eucalyptus (yoo-kuh-LIP-tuhss) tree. The leaves of eucalyptus trees are the main food source for koalas.
Whenever we find a koala, we collect information about the trees in the area. We measure how tall and how fat the trees are. Then we put tags on their trunks, so we know theyve been recorded.
We also capture and tag the koalas. Before releasing them back into the wild, we give them a health checkup.
Ellis wonders if the St. Bees koalas are headed for hard times. The island is filled with wild goats, which may be eating small blue gum trees. Ellis hopes more research will help him understand how to protect the blue gumsand the koalas that depend on them.
 Volunteers shake a tree branch on which a koala named Yellow sits. Yellow falls onto a plastic sheet and is placed into a sack.
 Volunteers hold Yellow in the sack. They adjust a radio collar around the koalas neck.
 The colored tag on Yellows ear helps scientists tell that koala apart from others on St. Bees Island.
What are some ways that people might protect koalas?

59,19,"Beep! Beep! A small bus on the road is getting a lot of attention. It is a pollution-free bus that uses
vegetable oil as fuel. (When something is recycled, an old item is turned into something new.)
The veggie bus is meant to inspire people to vote on Election Day. A group of musicians from California came up with the idea. They are driving the bus from coast to coast to spread their message.

61,289,"Some students in Pennsylvania recently made a hair-raising find. The kids at Landisville Intermediate Center discovered a
hair. Mastodons were furry, elephant-like animals. The creatures lived until about 10,000 years ago.
The students uncovered the hair while working on the Mastodon Matrix Project. That project allows volunteers to study material from sites where the remains of mastodons were found.
The class used paintbrushes to comb through the dirt. It felt like I was a scientist, Katie Minnich told
Students (above) found a hair that belonged to a mastodon.
Buried within the soil was the 8-inch-long hair. Each student studied the strand using a magnifying glass. They knew it did not come from a human, a dog, or a cat. It felt like a wire, explains Cameron Aksu.
The students were amazed at their brush with history. It was really cool, says Allee Glinsky. We knew [the hair was] a part of something really old.

64,327,"Talk about a toy that sticks around! The National Toy Hall of Fame recently added a surprising playthinga stick!
Other toys to join the Hall of Fame this past fall include the skateboard and the baby doll. The toys are kept at the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, N.Y.
The twiggy toy holds many playtime possibilities. [It] can be used ... to draw in the sand on a beach or [used as] a magic wand, says Chris Bensch. He is the museums
. A curator is a person in charge of a place where things are on display.
Plus, kids dont have to save money to get their hands on a stick. The best toy is often a plaything thats free [and] easy to get, Bensch says.

Puss in Boots fights his way into theaters.
Kaitlyn Rentala: Why did you want to direct
I love the character. ... Hes the coolest. Hes the most fun. Hes got this huge heart, but hes also a bit of a troublemaker. I always liked that about him.
KR: How do you decide which actors voices to use?
It can be [hard]. ... We know what the character should look like, so we take a picture of it and we put it on a TV screen. Then we play different actors voices ... and imagine the voice coming out of that character.
KR: What do you hope kids take away from the new movie?

66,141,"Scientists in Canada are playing Go Fish. They recently counted sharks that swim in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Canada.
Why? To find out how many sharks there are, of course! Some, such as the porbeagle shark, were once in danger of becoming extinct. The porbeagle shark is a species, or type, of shark. People hunted them for their meat and fins. Now, laws protect porbeagle sharks in the Atlantic Ocean.
Scientists want to make sure porbeagles are still safe. Traveling in boats, scientists caught about 1,000 sharks. Most were porbeagles. The scientists put tags on the female sharks and released them back into the ocean. The tags will allow the scientists to
or watch, the sharks in the coming months.
Scientist Steve Campana took part in the shark count. He says not all sharks are safe like those near Canada. ""Worldwide, sharks are in trouble,"" he told

67,695,"Get ready to sing Happy Birthday! On July 9, a new nation will be born.
That country may be called the Republic of South Sudan. It is in Africa. Earlier this year, southern Sudans people voted to become an
or free, country. They recently announced the results of the election.
The future nation is currently part of Sudan. That is the largest country in Africa. More than 2 million people in southern Sudan voted to
from northern Sudan. To separate is to pull apart.
The north and the south had been at war on and off for more than 50 years. Most people in the north follow a religion called Islam (iss-LAHM). People in the south practice Christianity and other religions. Some of the fighting happened because Sudans government tried to make people in the south follow Islams rules.
Soon, southern Sudans people will govern themselves. It wont be easy, world leaders say. The area is very poor. More than half of southern Sudans population lives on less than $1 a day. Many people do not have access to clean water.
A man works on an oil rig in southern Sudan.
The young nation will be rich in one thing, thoughoil. Southern Sudan produces about 375,000 barrels of oil a day. The south used to share its oil money with the north. Now it will keep the money and pay the north to help move the oil.
Southern Sudans leaders are hopeful about the future. We are a ... nation that has just been born, says official Pagan Amum. And like a human baby, we are
[or weak] but have the [chance] to become great.

Should gray wolves be taken off the endangered species list? Why or why not?
Not all people agree with the plan to remove gray wolves from the endangered species list. They are especially worried about the recovery of gray wolves in the Northeast. ""We don't believe there are wolf packs in the Northeast,"" Peggy Struhsacker told
. She is a scientist who studies gray wolves. ""The Endangered Species Act must recover wolves back to their [original] range,"" she said. ""This has not been done. Right now, wolves only live in a small area of the country.""

69,1,"People who live in poverty do not have enough money, food, and medical care for a healthy life.
Fifteen-year-old Matthew Hector called on a crowd of20,000 people to fight world poverty. He was one of many people who spoke out at a recent
, or a large meeting, in London, England. ""We believe the world should be fair so that everyone has the same opportunity to ... have a good life,"" he said.
The rally launched a worldwide campaign called ""Make Poverty History."" The goal is to challenge world leaders to end poverty.
do not have enough money, food, and medical care for a healthy life. More than a billion people around the world are poor. About half of those people are children. Many of the poorest countries are in Africa.
One of the most famous speakers at the rally was Nelson Mandela. He is the former president of South Africa. Mandela urged people to help those in need. He said, ""While [there is poverty], there is no true freedom.""
Many of the world's poorest countries are in Africa.
If you wanted to inspire others to help poor countries, what would you say?
In his speech, Mandela challenged world leaders not to ""look the other way"" from the problem of poverty. In July, leaders of the eight wealthiest countries, including the United States, will meet in Scotland. They have promised to take action to end poverty. Mandela and other supporters of ""Make Poverty History"" hope that world leaders keep their promise.

72,275,"One kissed a yak. One jumped from a plane. One ate fried worms. Do you think thats insane? Possibly, but it was all for a need. School principals were challenging students to read!
Those crazy stunts by school principals were all for Read Across America Day. The celebration takes place each year on March 2. That date is the birthday of childrens book author Dr. Seuss (19041991). Millions of kids have learned to read through his silly and clever rhymes.
On March 2, kids and adults across the country will take part in reading activities. Some will wear red-and-white striped top hats. And yes, some daring principals may even kiss a yak.

73,610,"We live in a jam-packed world. In fact, more people live here than ever before. The population recently hit a whopping 6.5 billion! The big news was reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.
The number of people on the planet has doubled since 1960. And that number continues to grow. As you can see from the graph, experts estimate that six years from now, Earth will be home to about 7 billion people. That is not surprising when you consider that 261 people are born each minute.

74,101,"Hello! My name is Jasmine Padilla. I'm 8 years old and in the third grade. I live in a town called Tusayan. It is a town next to Grand Canyon National Park. My family has lived here a long time. I go to Grand Canyon School.
The Grand Canyon has very tall cliffs for walls, and it is so wide that the trees on the other side look like trees for ants! The rocks are shades of pink and brown.
My favorite time of year in the Grand Canyon is winter. I like the winter because we play in the snow and can make a snowman. I also like to play with my friends and hike. I have seen rabbits, deer, and elk. Sometimes I can hear coyotes howling.

75,116,"Whoa! Dont look down! The newly opened Mike OCallaghanPat Tillman Memorial Bridge is the second-highest bridge in the United States. The bridge rises 890 feet above the Colorado River. It connects Arizona and Nevada.
The arch took nine years to build. The bridge is made from 16 million pounds of steel and 2 million feet of cable.
David Goodyear helped design the bridge. He cant get enough of the archs views. Its just such a fabulous setting, he says.
The bridges backdrop is the Hoover Dam. It was completed in 1935. The dam is considered a construction
or something that causes wonder. The dam stores water from the river. That water is used to make electricity.

76,3,"A Look Back at a Leader: Martin Luther King Jr. 
On January 17, Americans will celebrate the life and work of Martin Luther King Jr.
""A day on, not a day off!"" Since 1994, that has been the slogan for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Many students have the holiday off from school. Kids at Greene Street Friends School in Pennsylvania, however, will make it ""a day on.""
The kids will sew quilts for needy infants and pack meals for elderly people. ""I like that I'm helping people,"" 10-year-old Justine Baird told
The students at Greene Street Friends School are among the thousands of kids across the country who will take part in community service projects. The projects honor King's memory.
A Look Back at a Leader: Martin Luther King Jr.
Delivered the ""I Have a Dream"" speech in Washington, D.C.
Martin Luther King Jr. Day first observed as a national holiday
King was an African American leader who devoted his life to improving the lives of others. He once said, ""Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve.""
When King was growing up in the South, African Americans did not have the same rights as white people. African Americans had to live in separate neighborhoods and send their kids to separate schools. Some African Americans were not allowed to vote.
Many Americans felt that such laws were unfair. When King was older, he gave speeches and led peaceful marches to try to change those laws. As a result of King's work,
were passed. Those laws protect the rights of all Americans.

77,139,"If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
Fish may be a rare sight by 2048. That is what a team of scientists predicted after making a four-year study. They say ocean life is being wiped out by pollution and too much fishing.
The loss of ocean life will mean less food. It will also affect the balance of the oceans ecosystem, say the scientists. An ecosystem is a group of plants and animals and the environment working as a unit to live.

The Great Lakes have a great big problem. Theyre under attack! Odd creatures from faraway places are moving in and taking over.
. Invasive species are animals or plants that get moved to a new place and harm the people, animals, or plants that live there.
Zebra mussels in the Great Lakes block pipes that people depend on for water. Sea lampreys kill the lakes fish. Those and other invasive species are putting the areas 3,500 types of
plants and animals in danger. Something that is native has always lived in that part of the world.
Even more trouble is on the way, scientists say. U.S. researchers recently found 28 species in the lakes that could become
That worries scientist Vic Serveiss, who helped with the research. Invasive species ... compete for the same food ... as the native species, he told
. Many times [they] are more successful ... than the native species.
Some invasive species enter the lakes on ships from other places. Some ships carry water in tanks for balance. That water is called
. When the ships arrive at the Great Lakes, they dump the ballast water. Any species in that water end up in the lakes.
Its important to stop new invasive species from entering, says Tim Eder of the Great Lakes Commission. That group helps protect the lakes. Were trying to get Congress to pass new laws to require ships ... to clean [their] tanks before they release water into the lakes, he says.

The Great Lakes make up the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world. They cover more than 94,000 square miles.
More than 40 million people rely on the lakes for water. About 350 species of fish live in the lakes.
Lake Ontario is the smallest of the Great Lakes. It is about one-fourth the size of Lake Superior, the largest lake.
Why might getting rid of invasive species in the Great Lakes be hard?

81,603,"The hard work continues for U.S. troops in Iraq.
This month marks the fifth anniversary of the war in Iraq. No one knows that better than Logan Jordan, 9, of Kailua, Hawaii. The third grader's father, Christopher, is a Marine. Christopher Jordan served in the war for two years. He will return to Iraq in September. Iraq is a country in the Middle East.
Iraq. To invade is to enter by force. U.S. President George W. Bush thought Iraq's former leader, Saddam Hussein, had weapons that he could use to hurt other countries. No such weapons were found.
, or in place, in Iraq. They are working to help the Iraqi people rebuild their country. The troops are also battling violent groups that don't want the United States there.
The goal is for Iraq to one day
, or manage, itself. However, that is not an easy task. The country has three groups of people with different customs and interests. They are called Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds. Each group wants to make sure it receives its fair share of power and resources in the new Iraq. Since the war began, more than 3,900 U.S. troops and thousands of Iraqis have died.
How long U.S. troops remain in Iraq will be a decision the next U.S. president will have to make when Bush leaves office in January. Until then, service members like Logan's father will continue their work. ""My dad is a brave man,"" Logan told
. ""I am very proud of him.""
People have lived in Iraq for thousands of years. The area was once called
Iraq has the third-largest crude oil supply in the world. The country produces about 2.5 million barrels of oil a day.
What might life be like for a U.S. troop who is serving in Iraq?

82,150,"Green sea slugs (below) dont just look like leaves. They act like them too! Experts recently found that the slugs are able to carry out
(foh-toh-SIN-thuh-sehss). That is the process plants use to turn sunlight into energy. The slugs are the only animals scientists know of that are able to carry out that process.
The sneaky slugs get their green thumbs from
Algae are plantlike creatures that carry out photosynthesis. Eating algae gives the slugs special materials that allow them to get energy from the sun instead of from food.
It takes only one helping of algae for the colorful critters to be able to perform photosynthesis, explains Sidney K. Pierce. He is one of the scientists who made the discovery. After eating algae once, the slugs depend on only the sun for energy. They never have to eat again, Pierce told

87,442,"What would you get if you crossed a dinosaur, a bird, and Bugs Bunny? You might get a bucktoothed dinosaur. Scientists recently found the remains of such a dinosaur in China. The dino has birdlike wings and two large buckteeth!
Scientists say the bucktoothed dinosaur's teeth were not sharp. That is why they think the creature was most likely a plant eater. The dinosaur is related to the T. Rex. Until now, scientists thought all dinosaurs related to T. Rex were meat eaters!

88,387,"A military dog missing in Afghanistan returns to her troops.
Sabi is one smart pup. The dog knows how to sniff for bombs and protect soldiers. Recently, the black Labrador learned another skill: how to live on her own in Afghanistan for more than a year.
Afghanistan is a country in the Middle East. U.S. troops are at war in Afghanistan. They are fighting people who supported the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
About 70,000 U.S. troops are currently fighting in the war in Afghanistan. President Barack Obama recently announced that hes sending 30,000
The United States is not the only country fighting. Soldiers from more than 40 other countries are involved in the war. Sabi is part of a
of soldiers from Australia. A unit is a group. The military dog helps troops by
, or finding, bombs with her nose.
In September 2008, Sabis unit was fighting in Afghanistan. During the battle, she became separated from the soldiers. For months, Sabis unit searched for her without any luck.
Finally, a U.S. soldier spotted Sabi in November 2009. With the soldiers help, Sabi was
with her Australian unit. To reunite is to bring back together.
The troops will probably never know what their furry friend was up to all that time on her own. Theyre just glad to have found her. Says Australian leader Kevin Rudd, Sabi is back home in one piece.
The dog probably wouldnt mind lending another helping handor pawif soldiers need it.
251,827 square miles (slightly smaller than Texas)
28.4 million; about half are kids younger than 15
mostly mountains and deserts; only about 12 percent of the land can be farmed
What are some other ways dogs might help troops serving overseas?

91,301,"Would you believe a nickel could be worth a million dollars? That's how much a coin dealer recently offered to pay for one.
The coin is rare. It's a 1913 Liberty Head nickel. Only five of them were made at the U.S. Mint. The nickel had been missing for more than 40 years.
The last owner of the nickel was a man from North Carolina. When he died in 1962, he left the rare coin to his family. However, they thought it was a fake and kept it in a closet.
A few months ago, the coin dealer announced a million-dollar reward for the nickel. That's when the family took it to the dealer and learned it was the real thing!
The family decided not to sell the nickel right away. If they do sell it, experts say the coin could go for more than 2 million dollars. ""It's like holding a winning lottery ticket,"" said the coin dealer.

92,683,"What is a three-letter word for trouble? Flu! That is short for
(in-floo-EN-zah). The flu is caused by a virus that can be passed easily from person to person. People who catch the virus often have fevers, sore muscles, and coughs.
Doctors say the best way to keep from getting the virus is to get a flu shot. However, this year there weren't enough flu shots for everyone. Health experts found that one company's flu shots weren't safe. That company was supposed to supply the United States with half of the 100 million doses needed.
This year, there were not enough flu shots for everyone. The people at highest risk received a flu shot first.
Hang in there! The flu strikes the United States for only part of the year. Flu season usually runs from November to March.
Despite the short supply of flu shots, there are ways to stay flu-free. To keep the virus away, practice healthful habits.
Wash your hands often with soap and water.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Germs can easily enter your body there.

93,771,"How much weight do you carry in your backpack? In October, we asked kids to answer that question. The good news is this: Most of you are not overloaded. The average backpack weighed 7 pounds. But some weighed more than 15 pounds! Ouch!
Doctors advise kids not to carry too much weight in their backpacks. They say most third graders should not carry a backpack that weighs more than about 8 pounds.

94,581,"Orangutans have babies only once every eight years.
Orangutans (aw-RANG-oo-tanz) eat and sleep high in the treetops of rain forests. However, these great apes are not safe.
When she was 8 years old, Misha liked to jump up and down on her nest. She played with her food. Sometimes she needed her mothers help to cross from one tree to another.
Misha is one of thousands of orangutans that live in Asia. They are found on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra.
Scientists are worried about the survival of these red-haired apes. They are in danger of becoming
, or dying out. Scientists say orangutans could be extinct in the wild within ten years.
Why are orangutans in such danger? Their
is being destroyed. A habitat is the area where an animal makes its home.
People are the main threat to these apes. Some people cut down trees in the areas where orangutans live. The trees are sold as lumber. In addition, people steal baby orangutans from the forest and sell them as pets.
Do you think it is important to save orangutans? Why?
""Help is needed to save these amazing creatures,"" scientist Cheryl Knott told

95,670,"Secrets about the past lie deep below the surface of the sea. In January, explorers reported their discovery of an ancient Greek ship on the bottom of the Black Sea. The Black Sea is located between Europe and Asia. Scientists say the ship is about 2,400 years old!
""The Greeks went into the Black Sea for fish and gold,"" said Robert Ballard, the explorer whose team found the wreck. Ballard is the same explorer who discovered the
Ballard said the ship in the Black Sea was used for trade. The ship was filled with jars. At one time, the jars held items such as fish, olive oil, and honey.
This summer Ballard's team plans to dig up the shipwreck. They are hoping to learn more secrets about the ancient world.

96,199,"Scientists have been studying how much the ground beneath Machu Picchu has been sliding. In January, some Japanese scientists warned that if the ground continued to slide, a big landslide might destroy Machu Picchu.
Experts have also warned that tourists visiting Machu Picchu are damaging the Inca ruins. In recent years, tourists have started small fires and have littered the Machu Picchu area.
The government of Peru, however, disagreed with the warnings. ""Machu Picchu won't collapse,"" said one government official.
The official said that Machu Picchu has lasted for more than 500 years. He added that he doesn't see why landslides or tourism would destroy the city anytime soon.
The Incas built Machu Picchu sometime around 1460. The blocks used to build Machu Picchu were wedged so tightly together that a razor blade cannot fit between the stones. The ruins include about 200 stone buildings, including palaces, temples, and small homes.
The Incas were a South American Indian people who ruled one of the largest and richest empires on the continent. By 1532, the Incas ruled an area that stretched for 2,500 miles along the west coast of South America. The Inca empire included parts of what are now Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.
The Incas were skilled in farming and in building stone structures and roads. They were also skilled craftspeople, making many fine gold and silver ornaments. They studied the stars and knew how to predict the seasons of the year.

97,28,"Too much chocolate may be unhealthy for you, but researchers have found a way to make the treat good for the environment.
This veggie vehicle can reach 135 miles per hour!
in England are using chocolate to power the worlds first Earth-friendly race car. An engineer is a person who designs and builds things. England is a country in Europe.
The vehicle is named WorldFirst. Engineers built the car with
parts. Something that is renewable can be used again.
WorldFirst can run on fuel made from chocolate and vegetable oils. The car zooms from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds.
The fuel isnt the only part of the car that can be bought at a grocery store. WorldFirsts steering wheel is partly made from carrots and other vegetables. The cars mirrors are part potato, and the seat is made with soybean oil. Does that sound nutty? You bet! WorldFirsts brakes will be made with cashews.
By building the car, engineers say that they are helping to put the world first by [using] the planets natural resources.

or circles, Earth. Hubble takes pictures of space for scientists to study. The movie,
follows astronauts on a mission to repair Hubble.
student reporter Peter Brosnan interviewed Massimino about the mission.
How would you describe Hubble to kids?
Id say its as big as a school bus.
How did you feel saying good-bye to the Hubble Space Telescope?
We were happy that we didnt break it! ... We had done our job correctly, and it was on its way.
I think the best thing is the view of the Earth. ... Its as close as you can [get] to actually seeing it [from space]. Youll see how beautiful the Earth is.

Ten-year-old Emily Hartman of Michigan saved her mother's life last year. Emily's mother was eating breakfast. She took a big bite of cereal and started to choke. That is when Emily jumped into action and performed the Heimlich maneuver. It worked, and her mother was able to breathe again.

100,78,"After school, would you rather do your homework or play computer and video games? If you are like many kids, you have to finish your homework before you can play games. In some schools, however, teachers are actually assigning video games as homework!
The third graders at Prairie View Elementary School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, play special computer games for homework. Students spend at least 20 minutes four times a week playing the games. Each game is based on their schoolwork.
Laurene Lanich, the principal at Prairie View, says the games help kids learn. Other educators agree.
""The kids love it,"" said Joy Davis, a principal at a school where the games are given as homework. ""If you can get students where they think they're learning and playing, it has hit the magic mark,"" she said.
Kids like to play the computer games. ""I like it because it's challenging, and when I mess up I do it over and over again,"" student Adel Ahmed said.
Lightspan, a company in San Diego, California, designs the games. More than 4,000 schools in 46 states use them. The games have helped a few schools increase scores on standardized tests. The new games might even improve grades, and kids say the games are fun.

103,96,"Eleven-year-old Tilly Smith was recently honored at the United Nations in New York City for her courage during last years tsunami. Two weeks before the December 26, 2004, disaster, she had studied tsunamis in her geography class at her school just outside London, England. Her teacher showed the class a video of a tsunami. Tilly paid very close attention.
When her family was vacationing on a beach in Phuket, Thailand, Tilly immediately recognized the warning signs of a tsunami. Her quick thinking saved the lives of about 100 people in the area.
""I saw this bubbling on the water, right on the edge, and foam sizzling just like in a frying pan,"" Tilly says. ""The water was coming in, but it wasnt going out again.""
Tilly knew the waves would pound the shore within minutes. With the help of a security guard and a chef, Tilly spread the warning. People
or fled, the beach just minutes before the tsunamis devastating waves struck.
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton praised Tillys smart and courageous act. At the U.N. ceremony, President Clinton said, ""Tillys story is a simple reminder that education can make a difference between life and death.""

105,108,"Map of Washington, D.C.: The World War II memorial is located between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument.
Francis Campane and his wife took a train trip from Connecticut to Washington, D.C., in the spring. They were headed to the nation's capital to visit the newly opened National World War II Memorial.
is a special monument that honors a person, a group of people, or an event. The World War II memorial opened in April. It was built to honor the 16 million men and women who had served in the armed forces during World War II (1939-1945).
The trip was especially meaningful to Campane, 80, because he is a World War II
. Veterans are people who have served in the armed forces. Campane served in the U.S. Navy during the war. He was stationed aboard a ship called the U.S.S.
""I was amazed at the memorial and the gratitude the American people have shown World War II veterans,"" Campane told
. ""It's great to know our generation will be remembered.""
A plaza, a reflecting pool, fountains, and stone arches are among the memorial's main features. A wall of gold stars at the memorial honors the more than 400,000 Americans killed in the war.
An artist's drawing of the World War II memorial.
The World War II memorial is one of many places across the country where people will remember the U.S. military on November 11. That is Veterans Day--a holiday set aside to honor our nation's armed forces.
People will pay tribute to the 140,000 U.S. troops still serving in Iraq and to the more than 1,000 members of the U.S. military who have died there. For his part, Campane plans to volunteer at a hospital that cares for veterans.

106,455,"Should Native American mascots and logos be banned from college sports?
A spectacular tradition of college football takes place before every Florida State University (FSU) home game. A student dressed as the famous Seminole leader Chief Osceola (ah-see-OH-luh) charges down the field on a horse. The student launches a flaming spear into the air, which lands midfield. The fans, a sea of red and gold, cheer wildly.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tried to end that tradition. The NCAA is the organization that oversees college sports. The NCAA banned the use of Native American names, logos, or
by sports teams after the regular season. A mascot is a symbol that represents a sports team.
Seminole tribes in Florida and Oklahoma objected to the ban. The NCAA then removed FSU from its list of universities that are not allowed to use such names and mascots. Although the chief will ride again, the ban remains for at least 17 schools with Native American team names and mascots. Check out both sides of the debate.
Some Native Americans are offended that some sports teams use mascots and logos from their culture. They think it promotes
A stereotype is an idea that all members of a group of people are alike in a certain way. It may be untrue or only partly true.
""It is not respectful to parade around in war paint and feathers, speak in broken English, and dance barefoot,"" John Sanchez, a member of the Yaqui/Apache tribe, told
""This is not honoring; it is making fun of.""
Those against the NCAA's new rules, including many Native Americans, say the recent ban is ridiculous. They believe that team names and mascots honor the traditions of Native Americans.
Florida Governor Jeb Bush challenged the ban. He said it insulted Seminoles who support FSU's traditions. Seminole tribe members designed the mascot's costume, say others. They add that the student who rides Chief Osceola's horse earns that honor after studying the tribe's culture.

107,659,"History in the Making: Mercury 3 Rescue Mission
The Mercury missions were the first attempts by NASA, the U.S. space agency, to send a human into space. The rocket missions took place from 1961 to 1963. During the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union competed to build the best space program. That period was called the space race. Tia interviewed her grandfather, Clark Presler, about his role in the 1961 Mercury 3 mission, during which astronaut Alan B. Shepard Jr. became the first American in space.
What do you remember from your experiences in the Navy?
I remember being part of the pickup crew [aboard the U.S.S.
] when the first manned space capsule returned to Earth. It was May 5, 1961. The name of the [rocket] was the Mercury-Redstone 3.
What was the purpose of this mission?
NASA wanted to send a man into orbit and back safely. His name was Alan B. Shepard Jr.
The capsule reached [an altitude of] about 187.45 kilometers, which is 114.61 miles.
The orbit flight lasted only 15 minutes.
In the Atlantic Ocean, near Cape Canaveral, Florida.
How did you pick up Mr. Shepard?
Well, we lifted the capsule up on the chain. Alan was standing up on it, hanging on to the chain. He came out without a single scratch on his body.
At first, I thought this project would be easy, but after the interview I knew I had to learn what this was all about. So later that day I asked Grandpa to explain this to me. After that, it sounded a lot clearer, and it's fun having a member of your family actually do something, well, famous.

108,102,"Wispy lights danced through the night sky in October. Observers worldwide saw the lights.
People saw green, blue, and red lights. The lights formed different patterns. Some looked like rings. Others looked like curtains. And still others looked like pillars. The lights continually changed shape and color.
are also called the northern lights and southern lights.
Usually, only people living close to the North Pole and South Pole see auroras. But auroras were unusually active this fall. Even people in Arizona saw the lights.
Auroras are caused by the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The solar wind is made of tiny particles that stream away from the sun. Earth's magnetic field is similar to the field that surrounds a magnet. When the solar wind strikes Earth's magnetic field, gases in our atmosphere glow. Those glowing gases form an aurora.
The kind of glowing gas determines an aurora's color. Glowing oxygen makes red, yellow, and green auroras. Glowing hydrogen and helium make blue and purple auroras.
Don't worry if you missed the colorful auroras in October. An aurora can form at any time of year. If the solar wind continues to be as strong as it was in the fall, you may see the northern lights on any clear night.
The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth. You could line up more than 1 billion hot dogs end to end between Earth and the sun.
If you could drive to the sun in your family's car, it would take you nearly 2 million years. That's if you drove 55 miles per hour and didn't take any rest stops.
Light from the sun travels a lot faster than you can in your car. A beam of light travels at about 186,000 miles per second. It takes sunlight a little more than 8 minutes to reach Earth.

109,604,"No, this isn't a scene from the movies. A submarine designer is planning to build a new hotel in the Bahamas in which half the rooms will be underwater. The Poseidon Undersea Resort is expected to open late next year. In the hotel's most expensive rooms, guests will be able to watch ocean life outside their windows. Visitors won't need to dive to their accommodations. They can reach their rooms from a tunnel on the beach.

110,136,"Latest Finds at La Brea Tar Pits
A saber-toothed cat leaps from behind a bush. It moves toward the side of a stream. It's a hot day, and the cat is thirsty. What the cat doesn't see is the shallow pool of liquid asphalt that is covered by a thin layer of sand. As the cat nears the stream, it steps into the sticky black asphalt.
The bones from about 2,000 saber-toothed cats have been pulled from La Brea.
Soon, all four paws are stuck in the muck, and the cat is trapped. Struggling to get free, the cat becomes covered in the asphalt. Several days pass, and the cat, still stuck in the asphalt, dies of starvation.
Now, 35,000 years later, that sandy streamside spot is known as the La Brea (BRAY-ah) tar pits in Los Angeles, California. Last month, scientists finished their annual dig at La Brea's Pit 91.
The scientists unearthed nearly 1,000 fossils and spent time studying those fossils. ""The information we captured will tell us more about what life was like in this area 35,000 years ago than we've ever known before,"" said scientist Chris Shaw. By studying the fossils pulled from the tar pits, scientists are learning more about how Earth's environment has changed through time.
Shaw has been working at the La Brea site for nearly 30 years. ""My favorite part of the job is when I'm actually in the pit digging,"" Shaw told
. He added that he has become used to being covered in dirt and asphalt. ""It's like working in a big sandbox.""
Shaw spends much of his time at the George C. Page Museum in Los Angeles overseeing the huge collection of fossils pulled from La Brea. The museum holds thousands of fossils of prehistoric animals that died in the tar pit.
Some of the animals that fell into La Brea include woolly mammoths, bison, horses, ground sloths, western camels, and llamas. Many of the fossils that have been collected are from about 25,000 to 35,000 years ago.
During that time, Earth was cooler and was just coming out of one of many ice ages.
During ice ages, when Earth's temperature cooled, great sheets of ice, called
, formed at Earth's poles and over huge areas of land.
Digging at Pit 91 has stopped until May 2001. In the meantime, Shaw and other scientists will study the many fossils they have pulled from La Brea.
After 30 years, Shaw still loves his work. ""The coolest thing about doing fieldwork,"" Shaw said, ""is realizing that the fossil you're touching has not seen the light of day for about 30,000 years.""

111,77,"Groundbreaking begins for a monument dedicated to an important leader.
Martin Luther King, Jr. at the March on Washington, August 28, 1963.
On a summer day in 1963, more than 200,000 people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to rally for equal rights. There, they heard Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Today, construction of a memorial honoring King is under way about a half mile from the Lincoln Memorial, where King gave that famous speech. The new memorial will be the first on the National Mall to honor an African American.
The groundbreaking ceremony for the King memorial was held on November 13. President George W. Bush, former President William Jefferson Clinton, poet Maya Angelou, and talk show host Oprah Winfrey were among the speakers at the event. ""We give Martin Luther King his rightful place among the many Americans honored on the National Mall,"" Bush told the crowd of about 5,000 people.
King (19291968) dedicated his life to helping others. As a boy growing up in the U.S. South, King witnessed African Americans being treated unfairly. At that time, the South was
or separated by race. Under the law, African Americans were not allowed to attend the same schools as white people and had to sit in the backseats of buses. African Americans also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains.
When King was older, he worked to change those unjust laws. During the 1950s and 1960s, he gave speeches and organized peaceful marches and protests.
Beginning in 1955, King led the famous Montgomery bus boycott to protest segregation. For 381 days, African Americans
or refused to use, public buses in the Alabama city. A year after the boycott began, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregation on buses was illegal.
King gained national attention from the boycott. As a result of his work, civil rights laws were passed.
are personal rights to freedom and equality guaranteed to all U.S. citizens and protected by the Constitution.
The King memorial is scheduled to be completed in 2008. The design uses water, stone, and trees to represent the themes of justice, democracy, and hope. The King memorial will also include a boulder called the Stone of Hope, from which will emerge a 30-foot figure of King. The memorial will contain a circular stone wall chiseled with King's words.
King's dream was for all people to be treated fairly and equally under the law. The design of the memorial is based on a line from his historic ""I Have a Dream"" speech: ""We will be able to hew [cut] out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.""

As of June, about 39 million Hispanic Americans are living in the United States. That number marks a jump from the 2000 census count. At that time, Hispanic Americans numbered about 35 million. Today, the total population of the United States is estimated at more than 288 million people.
Currently, 1 out of every 6 kids in this country is Hispanic. Officials estimate that by 2020, 1 out of 4 children will be Hispanic American.
Hispanic Americans have influenced food, music, and customs in the United States. Hispanic Heritage Month marks a time for Americans to celebrate the traditions and history of Hispanic people. It takes place from September 15 to October 15.
People in communities around the country will celebrate the month with festivals. Many students will recognize the month by learning about the important roles Hispanic people have played in our countrys history.
Ellen Ochoa, the first Hispanic American astronaut, told
that to understand the history of the United States, people should learn about the contributions of different groups, including Hispanic Americans.

Dr. Novello was born in Puerto Rico. In 1990, she became the first Hispanic American to serve as the U.S. surgeon general. That is the doctor who leads our country on health issues. She worked to improve healthcare for Americans, especially children, women, and minorities.
Gary Soto is an award-winning Hispanic American author. He writes fiction and poetry for adults and children. His writing is based on his experiences growing up as a Mexican American in California. His books, including
Baseball in April and Other Stories and Taking Sides
, are popular with many young readers.
In 1990, Ellen Ochoa became the first Hispanic American woman astronaut when she was accepted into NASAs training program. Ochoa, whose fathers parents were from Mexico, flew her first space shuttle mission in 1993. Since then she has clocked more than 720 hours in flight.
Why is celebrating a variety of cultures important?

113,98,"Scientists are testing Columbus's bones to settle a dispute over where he is buried.
Christopher Columbus may be going on one more journey. Scientists have opened a tomb in Spain that they believe contains his bones. The bones are traveling to a laboratory in Spain for testing.
Scientists are trying to solve a mystery: Where is Christopher Columbus buried? The Dominican Republic-an island in Central America-also claims to have the remains of this famous explorer.
In 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain and arrived in North America. He made four trips altogether. Before he died in 1506, he asked to be buried on the island that is today the Dominican Republic. It is part of the area he explored on his third and fourth trips.
When Spain lost control of the island, his body was moved. Spanish officials think it was taken to the island of Cuba before possibly being moved back to Spain. However, the Dominican Republic says the Spanish travelers took the wrong remains. By testing the bones, Spanish scientists hope to get to the truth of the matter.

Over time, scientists think that the bacteria will help tube worms grow in the area.
Later, crabs will come to feed on organisms, such as the tube worms, near the vents.

116,258,"The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle's grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles.
The disease attacks an infected bird's brain and spinal cord.
At first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird.
In recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year.
Although the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased.
By the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild.
Wildlife experts are especially concerned because they don't know much about the disease, including what causes it. ""We have some ideas, but we don't have any answers,"" John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said.
Experts also don't know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. ""This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn't noticed,"" Fischer said.
While wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Scientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America's bird--the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn't true in 1782.
Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol.
""I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country"", Franklin wrote. ""He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird"".

Our classroom play celebrates Philadelphia's hometown hero. Discover how his hard work helped to improve the lives of all Americans.
Honor the 300th birthday of one of our countrys greatest thinkers, inventors, and statesmen with our classroom play.
Each morning, Benjamin Franklin asked himself, ""What good shall I do today?"" And that is how he lived his life.
His can-do attitude launched him into the history books as one of Americas most famous citizens. Ben was a printer, a writer, an inventor, a community leader, and a founder of our nation.
Ben was born in a cottage in Boston on January 17, 1706. He attended school only between the ages of 8 and 10. Bens education was cut short because his family was poor and needed him to work.
His love of learning, however, stayed with him throughout his life. Ben read all the time. He often went without food to buy books! At 12, he began his lifelong love of printing.
In honor of the 300th anniversary of Bens birth, our three-act play looks at some key events in the life of this great American. Find out how his good deeds helped shape the history of our country.
ACT 1: Ben the Young Man, Boston, 1718-1723
Bens older brother, James, owns a printing press that publishes a very popular newspaper,
In 1718, Bens father decides that 12-year-old Ben should work for James.
At that time, Ben signs a document promising he will work for his brother until he is 21, without pay. In return, his brother is to provide Ben with food and clothes.
Ben likes to read and is a good editor and proofreader. Over the next few years, he learns all about printingand even begins writing letters to the newspaper under a different name. Thanks to Bens sense of humor and clever writing in those letters,
becomes one of the most-read newspapers in Boston.
James finds out that the letters are from his brother and he becomes jealous of Ben. James is furious and vows never to publish any of Bens writing again. He also finds fault with Bens work, even though Ben rarely makes errors.
I know I am a better printer than he is.
You cant leave! You have to work for me until you are 21!
Youll never find a job in this city! Youll come crawling back to me.
But Ben never comes back to his brother. Instead, he leaves in the early morning and runs away to New York City, in hopes of finding work as a printer. After not finding a job there, he heads to New Jersey where he boards a boat to Philadelphia.
The journey is three days long, and Ben is dirty, hungry, and penniless. But Philadelphia is a lively city, and Ben loves it.
ACT 2: Ben the Community Leader, Philadelphia, 1723-1740s
After arriving in Philadelphia, Ben works to establish himself as a printer. In 1728, he opens a printing shop and begins publishing his own newspaper,
A few years later, he also publishes
The book includes weather forecasts, recipes, and jokes. It also contains some of Bens sayings, such as ""Well done is better than well said."" The almanac becomes a best seller and makes Ben wealthy.
Although Ben works to better himself,it is also important to him to help the community. He considers Philadelphia his hometown and works to make life in the city better.
Ben starts projects to pave and sweep Philadelphias streets. He redesigns the citys streetlights so that roads are safe at night.
Ben also helps set up the first public library, hospital, and volunteer fire department. At this time, most houses in Philadelphia are made of wood and stand side by side. When a fire breaks out, it can destroy an entire neighborhood.
Extra! Extra! Fire destroys row houses on Market Street!
We need to train men to fight fires so that this doesnt keep happening.
Ben persuades more than 30 men to form the Union Fire Company.
We nominate Ben as our fire chief.
Ben is appointed fire chief. He makes sure that firefighters are trained to put out fires and rescue people.

The Union Fire Company meets once a month to discuss fire prevention. Ben also publishes fire prevention tips in his newspaper.
Bens ideas for Philadelphia help shape how fire departments, hospitals, libraries, and post offices work in other cities.
ACT 3: Ben the Statesman, Philadelphia, 1776
Along with his work in Philadelphia, Ben helps change the course of American history.
At the time, America is made up of 13 Colonies ruled by Britain. England has passed many laws that the Colonists think are unfair.
Ben works to mend the relationship between the Colonies and Britains ruler, King George III.
Despite his efforts, the Colonies decide to break away from Britain. They fight Britain in the Revolutionary War (1775-1783).
Ben is appointed to the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence. This document frees the Colonies from Britains rule.
We have to decide who should write the Declaration of Independence.
I wont. Many people disagree with my opinions.
I cant. I am not a writer.
I am unsure about independence from Britain.
You must write this very important document. Your writing style is perfect.
When Thomas Jefferson finishes his draft, he shows it to Ben.
Ive made small changes. For example, you wrote, sacred and undeniable, and I changed that phrase to make it stronger.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.
On July 4, a group of representatives from the 13 Colonies approve the Declaration of Independence and some people sign the document.
This for King George, so he can read it without his glasses.
On August 2, Ben and others also sign the document. They know they are risking everything for freedom from Britain.
Seven years later, in 1783, Ben negotiates the treaty that ends the Revolutionary War. In 1787, at age 81, he signs the U.S. Constitution.
Ben Franklin dies on April 17, 1790, at the age of 84. He is buried in Philadelphia. In honor of the 300th anniversary of his birth, people across the country will celebrate the life of this remarkable man.
If you could award a medal to Ben Franklin for one of his achievements, which accomplishment would it be? Why?

118,375,"Meet a robot that has been busy tooting its own horn. A trumpet-playing robot made its debut at a hotel in Japan in March.
The robot played the song ""When You Wish Upon a Star."" After its performance, the 4-foot-tall droid bowed its head and waved its arms in response to the audience's applause.
Although the musical droid doesn't have a name yet, it is the latest in a string of
that scientists have built in the past few years. Humanoid robots are high-tech machines that act lifelike and are programmed to do jobs that people typically do.
Japanese companies lead the way in creating humanoid robots. Japan is thought to be the leader in
Other humanoid robots created by Japanese companies have been getting plenty of attention even without playing the trumpet.
Japanese scientists introduced ASIMO (ah-SEE-moh), the world's first stair-climbing robot, in 2000. The 4-foot, 115-pound ASIMO's many talents include walking, holding objects, speaking Japanese, and recognizing faces. ASIMO recently finished a world tour. The tour included several stops in U.S. cities so kids and adults could learn more about it.
Like ASIMO, QRIO (KYOOR-ee-oh), can talk and recognize faces. QRIO, which was unveiled in Japan in December 2003, can also run, jump, throw a ball, dance, and even belt out a tune.
In March, QRIO conducted Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in Japan. Before the rehearsal in front of a live audience, the robot grumbled, ""I'm feeling nervous.""
Today, robots come in all shapes and sizes. Many robots are used in factories. They help build cars, inspect computer parts, and package food. Robots speed up production on assembly lines and help save companies both time and money.
Robots also perform tasks that are difficult or dangerous for humans. Robots have explored the far reaches of space and traveled into active volcanoes.
that when robots were first introduced in the 1960s, they performed only jobs that were ""dirty, difficult, and dangerous."" That, however, is starting to change. Today's engineers hope that the new breed of humanoid robots will improve people's lives.
Many people are excited that humanoid robots may one day be able to lift people confined to beds or wheelchairs. The robots may also be able to help elderly people with chores such as vacuuming and taking out the garbage. Some people, however, worry that robots may take away jobs that are now performed by humans.
Although the humanoid robots have been busy making public appearances, they aren't for sale yet. If you really want a robot that will clean your room and help out with chores, you still have to wait a bit longer.
1. QRIO shows off some dancing skills. QRIO stands for ""quest for curiosity."" Why do you think the robot was given that name?
2. ASIMO (which is short for Advanced Step in Innovative MObility) walks down a flight of stairs.
3. In March, this latest humanoid robot-still unnamed-plays the trumpet at its first public appearance in Japan.
Robots are used for a variety of purposes from helping out in offices to performing surgery.
2. Sico the robot helps children paint pictures at an Arkansas hospital.
3. There is a two wheeled robot that can guide blind people.
How does technology help improve people's lives?

119,726,"U.N. Day this year will focus on literacy.
Did you know that more than 113 million kids around the world do not go to school? Most of those children do not know how to read.
The United Nations (U.N.) is working to solve that problem. The U.N. is an organization made up of countries around the world. The countries work to promote world peace and to better the lives of poor people, including children.
The U.N. was formed on October 24, 1945. Each year, the U.S. president asks people to observe this anniversary as U.N. Day. This October, the day will be focused on
, which is the ability to read and write.
Many communities around the world will celebrate U.N. Day. Some schools will participate in special projects to draw attention to improving reading skills.
To do our part for this special day,
has donated 800 children's books to a literacy organization in Darien, Connecticut. Called the Book Aid Plan, this group is run by volunteers. They help put books in the hands of people in need around the world.
Book Aid receives letters from people who are setting up schools and libraries in poor areas of the United States as well as in countries as far away as Romania, Thailand, and China.
The organization gets the most requests for children's books. Based on the letters they receive, the volunteers at Book Aid decide which books to send and then pack the boxes.
This year, they will ship more than 50,000 pounds of books to almost 100 different countries. ""We may think a shipment is small, but we'll hear from volunteers saying we tripled the size of their library,"" said Barbara Gardner, the president of Book Aid. ""The books are small tokens that really help people out.""

120,279,"Thirteen-year-old Scott Cory may one day become the Tiger Woods of the rock-climbing world. Like the golf star, this eighth grader is one of the world's youngest and most accomplished athletes.H3:Record Breaker
With a Spider-Man-like ability to cling to rocks, Scott holds several records. He is the youngest person to climb to the
, or peak, of Half Dome and El Capitan in one day each. Those famous granite peaks are located in Yosemite National Park in California.Now Scott has set his sights higher. This spring, he plans to climb both mountains within 24 hours. Scaling nearly 4,900 feet of rock is equal to climbing four Empire State Buildings in a day.
Only a few experienced adult climbers have accomplished this feat in 24 hours. Climbers may take up to eight days to reach both summits. Leading Scott on his
, or journey, will be a skilled adult climber.
At 3:30 am, Scott will begin climbing a route on El Capitan called The Nose
At 3:30 pm, he will ""top out"" on the summit
At 5:40 pm, after a two hour hike down El Capitan, Scott will begin another two hour trek to Half Dome's base.
At 7:30 pm, Scott will begin climbing the Northwest Face. He will reach Half Dome's summit at 2:30am.
Scott has been climbing mountains since he was 7 years old. He first fell in love with the sport during a family vacation.
Why does Scott like the challenge of the sport so much? He sums it up this way: ""Climbing is fun for me.""
He also points out that climbing has taught him valuable lessons. ""You learn about trying over and over and not giving up.""

121,11,"As the wheels on the bus go round and round, many kids are getting bounced around. A new study, published in the medical journal
shows that about 17,000 school busrelated accidents occur each year. Thats more than double previous estimates. Those injuries range from cuts to broken bones.
Researchers reported that crashes arent causing all those bumps and bruises. Slips and falls, getting jostled during stops and turns, and roughhousing are other ways kids get hurt. Nearly one-quarter of those injuries occur when kids are getting on and off buses.
Though the numbers are higher than thought, they represent a small fraction of kids. There are about 24 million kids who travel on school buses each year. School buses are still the safest way for kids to ride to school, according to the National School Transportation Association.
The results may prompt stronger arguments for requiring safety belts on buses. But not all safety experts agree. Seat belts wouldnt reduce injuries and wouldnt be worth the added expense for school districts, says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

125,25,"When you read a newspaper, do you usually open it to the comics section? Many people do! That's because those cartoons are funny.
The cartoons in the comics section may make you laugh, but another type of cartoon will also make you think. It's called an
. An editorial cartoon expresses an opinion about specific people or events in the news.
Lately, many editorial cartoonists have been focusing on the presidential candidates and the election. Artist Gary Markstein created two political illustrations to express his opinions about this year's election.
The economy is one of the main issues in this year's presidential election. (The economy refers to the way a country runs its jobs and industries.) The economy is like the weather--sometimes it's good, and other times it's bad. Political polls show that many people ""vote with their pocketbook."" That is, they vote based on how the economy is doing.
to make his point about the economy. Symbols are objects that represent other things. One cartoon shows two weather maps labeled ""Economy."" George W. Bush stands in front of a weather map covered with smiling faces. John Kerry holds an umbrella as he stands in front of a map with bad-weather symbols.
A forecaster is someone who predicts the weather. Why does the artist depict Bush and Kerry as weather forecasters?
What point is the cartoonist making about the candidates and the economy?
How do the symbols help convey the message? What do the suns represent? What do the hail and thunderstorm clouds represent?
Do you think the cartoonist prefers one candidate over the other? Why or why not?
What dirt are the presidential candidates digging up about each other? Some people think election campaigning is a messy business. In one cartoon, Markstein draws attention to negative campaigning and
between candidates. In politics, mudslinging refers to speaking negatively about another person or opposing party.
To make his point, the artist shows two men talking about dirt for sale. One man says to the other, ""The Bush and Kerry campaigns each ordered 2 tons...""
Why might the Bush and Kerry campaigns be ordering mud?
What message do you think the cartoonist is sending about the election campaign?
When Gary Markstein was in the fourth grade, he dreamed of being a cartoonist and having his own comic strip. He even put out a humor magazine with a friend that lasted for one issue.
Today, Markstein's audience is much larger. He draws cartoons for the
Markstein draws five cartoons a week that focus on politics and sports. To get ideas, he reads several newspapers each morning. ""Coming up with a good idea is the hardest and most challenging part, but it's also the most rewarding,"" he told
What's the best part of his job? ""I get paid to play!"" said Markstein. ""I draw on a different topic every day. I think it's the best job in the world!""
If you think you'd like to be an editorial cartoonist, Markstein has some tips:
Draw well and write well. (Yes, there is writing in most cartoons!)
Read the newspaper to learn what is going on in the world.
Be creative, use your imagination, and have a good sense of humor!

127,634,"Ann Thompson is one of the best athletes in the world. She is the captain of the U.S. Paralympic women's basketball team. She has already won five medals in earlier Paralympic games, and she is determined to win another in Sydney, Australia. Recently,
The Paralympics run from October 18 to 29.
: The Paralympics began in 1960. They parallel the Olympic Games. That's where the name comes from.
: What sports are part of the Paralympics?
: Eighteen sports are included the Paralympics. This year, we have two new sports, wheelchair rugby and sailing.
: Who can compete in the Paralympics?
: This year, 125 countries are sending 4,000 athletes, each with a physical disability.
: Besides the health benefits, sports teach many skills. First, there's the mental discipline involved with sports. You always have to concentrate, think, and plan ahead. Also, sports teach teamwork, leaderships skills, and self-confidence.
: Sports have always been a part of your life. What happened when you were 16 years old that almost ended your sports career?
: When I was younger, I was a skier. I was training in Austria when I fell and severed my spinal cord.
: How did that accident change your life?
: It didn't change anything. I never missed a beat. The accident didn't change my goals. My mind was not touched in the accident. I could do everything after the accident that I could do before it, except walk.
I'm the same person today that I was before the accident.
: Well, one thing changed. I switched sports. I'm no longer a skier. In the 1988, 1992, and 1996 Paralympics, I competed in track and field events, winning four medals. This year, I'm on the basketball team.
: What do you plan to do in Sydney?
: If you could say one thing to the kids of America, what would you tell them?
: Try. And I mean really try. If you want to do something, give it your best effort. If you find a roadblock in your path, take a detour. If you really want to do something, you can find a way to do it.

130,414,"The waters in the San Francisco Bay, off the California coast, are cold, choppy, and infested with sharks. But that didnt stop 9-year-old Johnny Wilson from braving the waves. The fourth grader swam the 1.4 miles between Alcatraz Island and San Francisco in just less than two hours. He swam to raise money for Hurricane Katrina victims.
Although Johnny trained for three months, the water was colder and wavier than he had expected. Johnny made it to the shore by telling himself, ""Im almost there. Im almost there.""
His classmates were waiting on shore, cheering ""Go, Johnny! Go, Johnny!"" When he came out of the chilly water, his father hugged him and said, ""Can you believe it? You did it!""
Johnny successfully made the trek that Alcatraz prisoners had dared to cross years ago. Alcatraz Island housed a prison from 1934 to 1963. In 1962, three prisoners escaped by swimming across the bay. They were never heard from again, so it remains a mystery whether they made it through the frigid waters to land.
Johnny didnt only raise more than $30,000 for his swim. He also reportedly became the youngest person to swim the distance from Alcatraz to San Francisco.

131,465,"Overfishing is harming the world's sea life.
Troubled waters are ahead for the world's fish. Those finned creatures and shellfish, such as crabs and clams, may be a rare sight by 2048, according to a fouryear study. The study, recently published in the journal
was conducted by a team of 14 researchers in four countries.
If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
The study warns that ocean life is being wiped out because of overfishing and pollution.
Global warming (a rise in Earth's temperatures) and habitat loss are also to blame for the decline in seafood.
Although the world's sea life is in serious danger, it's not too late to reverse the problem, says the study's lead author, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. The researchers have called for measures to protect current fish populations, such as reducing large-scale fishing and pollution. ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we don't change things,"" Worm told reporters.
The loss of ocean life will cause more than just a shortage of seafood. It could spell disaster for ecosystems too. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that work together as a unit to live. A declining fish population would cause a disaster up and down the food chain. Larger animals, such as seals and dolphins, depend on fish for food. Without enough fish to eat, those animals would be in trouble.

133,280,"The grizzly and cubs may soon be taken off the endangered species list in the Northwest.
Grizzly bears are considered one of the great symbols of the American wilderness. When explorers Lewis and Clark traveled west in the early 1800s, they found a healthy grizzly-bear population.
At the time, about 50,000 grizzly bears roamed the West. But as pioneers moved westward, the number of grizzly bears began to shrink. Illegal hunting, trapping, and habitat loss were to blame for the bears' disappearance. A
is the place in nature where an animal makes its home.
Today, there are only 800 to 1,000 grizzlies remaining in the lower 48 states, but there is hope for these creatures. About 550 of the grizzlies live in the Yellowstone National Park area in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. That is almost double the number that lived there in the 1980s.
Thanks to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the grizzly is making a comeback. Congress passed the act to protect animals that were in danger of becoming extinct.
Wildlife officials hope to remove grizzly bears in the Yellowstone National Park area from the endangered species list within the next year. Steven Williams, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told USA Today that the change is ""a tribute to the American people's commitment to wildlife [protection].""
Why is it important to protect endangered animals?
Scientists have worked to help bring grizzlies back from the brink of extinction. They set the animals free in their original habitats. They also plan to limit the number of roads in areas where grizzlies live. That action will give grizzlies more room to roam-and will help make life more bearable for them!

134,492,"On March 22, Kelsey Penfield, age 9, was working at her desk at Maplehurst Elementary Schook in Norwalk, Ohio. She was also chewing her pen cap. Suddenly, she swallowed the cap.
The pen cap became lodged in Kelsey's throat, and she began choking on it. She tried coughing up the cap, but the cap wouldn't move. Unable to breathe, Kelsey began pointing at her throat.
Kelsey's classmate Elizabeth Muirhead, age 9, realized that Kelsey was choking. Elizabeth immediately sprang into action and performed the Heimlich maneuver on her classmate, saving her life.
Elizabeth had learned the Heimlich maneuver in an issue of
caught up with the two girls to ask them about that fateful day.
: What happened the day that Kelsey started choking?
We were in class doing our grammar work. That's when Kelsey started choking. There was a boy between us, but he didn't know what was going on. Kelsey was pointing to her neck. I asked her if she was choking, and she nodded. That's when I ran over to her and did the Heimlich maneuver.
What were your thoughts? Were you scared?
: I was really scared. The first time I tried the Heimlich, I didn't do it that hard. I was afraid of hurting Kelsey. The second time, I squeezed a little harder. Then the third time, the pen cap just flew out. All the time I was thinking that Kelsey is my best friend and I'm not going to let her die.
How did you know how to perform the Heimlich maneuver?
: We read about it in an issue of
. Mrs. Moore put us in groups of two, and we practiced doing it.
: Kelsey, What was this experience like for you?
: I was really scared. I was chewing on a pen cap, and all of a sudden it slid down my throat. I couldn't breathe. I'm not going to chew on pen caps anymore. You shouldn't really chew on anything. You never know when you can accidentally choke.
1. Stand behind the choking victim and wrap your arms around his or her waist.
2. Make a fist and hold it against the victim's stomach, about halfway between the belly button and the rib cage.
3. Grab your fist with your other hand. Press it in with an upward thrust. Repeat until victim stops choking.

135,105,"If you had to choose one invention you couldn't live without, which would it be-the toothbrush, car, cell phone, or microwave oven? That was the question asked of American teens and adults in a survey conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
The toothbrush emerged as the number-one invention that Americans can't live without. Following closely in second place was the car.
These findings show that important inventions do not have to be complicated. ""In today's high-tech society, we thought people would be voting for the high-tech inventions,"" said Kristin Joyce, a spokesperson at MIT. ""The results show that simple, low-tech inventions are important to people.""
The toothbrush has a long history, dating back to the 15th century. According to the American Dental Association, the first toothbrush was invented in 1498. To make the brush, a Chinese emperor placed hog bristles in a bone handle.
In 1938, nylon bristles replaced pig bristles. Dentists today are eager to remind people that while the toothbrush has taken the throne as king of the invention list, it still needs its handy sidekick-dental floss.

Does thinking about spiders and their hairy bodies, long legs, and sticky webs make your skin crawl? Many people shiver at the thought of spiders.
That is not the case for Rich Bradley, a real-life Spider-Man. He can't get enough of the creepy crawlers. Bradley is an

Scientists say about 3,500 species of spiders live in North America, and nearly 35,000 live worldwide. Spiders live in different places, including gardens, water, deserts, and caves.
Many people think spiders are insects, but they are actually

Along with fangs and eight hairy legs, a spider has two body parts--a head and an abdomen. The abdomen contains

To capture their food, some spiders spin webs. Other types of spiders chase down their

Although the hairy creatures spook many people, there isn't much reason to be afraid of spiders. ""Most spiders are not very dangerous,"" said Bradley.
In fact, most are timid creatures that are unable to give humans more than a harmless bite. Although spider venom is deadly to insects, it often has little effect on humans because of our larger size.
Spiders may have a bad reputation for being scary, but they are important to us. Bradley hopes his work shatters some
about spiders. (A myth is a false idea that many people believe is true.)
Spiders eat mosquitoes and other insects that harm farmers' crops and carry diseases. Bradley's research is teaching scientists more about how spiders help control
, or communities of plants and animals. If spiders didn't exist, there would be a lot more insects!
""Spiders are your friends,"" Bradley said. ""They make our life more pleasant.""
Get caught up on some different types of spiders. Spiders come in all shapes and sizes. Crab spiders, jumping spiders, and orb weavers have made Rich Bradley's Ohio count. Find out more about them and other spiders.
Can you guess how this spider got its name? It may not live in the ocean, but it looks like a crab. The crab spider lives on flowers. It can match its body color to the flower's color. That allows it to sneak up on insects.
What a leap! The jumping spider can jump between 10 and 40 inches. To catch an insect, this hunting spider sneaks up on its prey and pounces.
The trap-door spider lives in a tunnel. The spider, common in the southwestern United States, lines the tunnel with silk and fashions a door made of silk and dirt. It peeks out of the slightly open door and grabs passing insects.
The tarantula is a large, hairy spider found mainly in warm regions, including the southwestern United States. Although the tarantula's bite is painful, it is not very poisonous to humans. Tarantulas hunt insects, lizards, mice, toads, and frogs.
E. B. White's famous spider Charlotte was an orb weaver. The orb-weaving spider spins a wheel-shaped web. When an insect flies into the web, the spider races toward its meal.

In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln declared the last Thursday in November a national day of thanksgiving. Later, the U.S. Congress said the holiday should take place on the fourth Thursday in November. This chart shows the number of turkeys raised in the United States from 2001 to 2005.

Republicans and Democrats compete for control of Congress.
The countdown to Election Day has begun. On November 7, Americans will head to the polls to vote in the
Midterm elections happen in the middle of a presidents term in office. (Voters choose a president every four years. The next presidential election is in 2008.)
Members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate meet in the Capitol in what is called a joint session.
Midterm elections give voters a chance to choose people to represent their state in
Members of Congress make up the U.S.
Congress, the legislative branch of government, makes our nations laws.
On Election Day, candidates will compete for 33 of 100 seats in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Elections for governors will also be held in 36 states.
Members of Congress typically belong to one of the two main
in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about government goals. This election will decide whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party controls Congress for the next two years.
Republicans currently have control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Republicans have had the upper hand in the House since 1994. Republicans have also controlled the Senate for most of the past 12 years.
A party controls the House of Representatives or the Senate when its members win a
or more than half, of the seats in it. (See
.) Why is control of Congress so important? The party in power can more easily accomplish its goals and shape U.S. law.
For months, representatives from both political parties have tried to win over voters. Their members have been speaking about important issues, or problems, our country faces. Some of those issues are the war in Iraq, gas prices, and health care. (See
""Our country is facing some serious challenges here and around the world,"" Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told
""At home, our economy has made it harder and harder for working people to make ends meet."" He added that ""the war in Iraq and emerging threats from other nations present new challenges to our national security.""
""Our top priority is to ensure that we continue to keep Americans safe while spreading freedom and democracy abroad,"" Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told
""Republicans will also work to keep taxes and healthcare prices low so that families have more money to spend on things that are important to them.""
Which party will come out on top in this election? Its up to the voters to decide.
Here are some key issues on voters minds this election season.
Recent polls show that Americans support for the war in Iraq has dropped. President George W. Bush and many Republicans say the war is an important part of making the United States safer. Many Democrats say its time to rethink U.S. strategy in Iraq.
Gas prices have been high for the last year. Only recently have they begun to dip. Many voters are worried about the high cost of gas. They want to hear plans for making gas more affordable.
About 45 million Americans dont have health insurance. If they get sick, it will be difficult for them to pay for medical care and drugs on their own. Voters are looking for ways in which the government can make health care more affordable.

139,679,"This will be a very different school year for Rand Amir. The fifth grader is among millions of schoolchildren who went back to school in Iraq in early October.
On the first day of school, Rand said, her classmates ripped out pictures of Saddam Hussein from their textbooks. Saddam is the former president of Iraq. The students tossed the pages out the window, yelling ""Bye, bye, Saddam.""
That was not an unusual sight at some schools throughout this war-torn country. Saddam's government was toppled in April. At that time, U.S.-led forces took control of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.
During Saddam's rule, teachers were forced to mention him in every lesson, from history to music to gym class. Students even learned math by adding 4 + 28. That's because April 28 is Saddam's birthday. Now schools are erasing Saddam's image and teachings from their lessons.
Iraqi officials are rewriting the country's textbooks. That will give students the opportunity to learn new ideas about the world.
The new textbooks, which will arrive this month, don't include any references praising Saddam. Pictures of Saddam have been removed from classrooms. Students are no longer forced to chant ""Long live our leader, Saddam"" during their classes.
Despite the changes, U.S. soldiers report that many of Iraq's schools are in various states of
, or poor condition. Although many schools were failing before the war began, many more schools were destroyed or seriously damaged during the fighting.
Some schools have broken windows and doors and are still without electricity or running water. Some lack chalkboards, desks, and other much-needed furniture and supplies.
The good news is that help is on the way for teachers and students. U.S. soldiers and aid groups are helping rebuild many of the run-down schools, restoring water and electricity.
They are also providing children with school supplies that Americans have donated. One 9-year-old Iraqi student was all smiles as soldiers unloaded boxes of new crayons, markers, book bags, and other donated supplies.
Despite the challenges, the new school year offers a fresh start for many teachers and children. ""Memories of the war are still fresh, but we shall go past that,"" said one teacher in Iraq. ""[The students] will be safer now.""
A fourth-grade class in Maine is reaching out to schoolchildren in Iraq. The students are collecting notebooks, colored pencils, rulers, and other supplies to send to Iraq.
that he hopes the care packages will improve the lives of schoolchildren in Iraq. His classmate Maddie Brochu feels the same way. ""They don't have very much at their schools,"" she said.
The project is close to their teacher's heart. Barbara Winslow's two sons serve in the U.S. military in Baghdad. Winslow told
that donating the supplies helps her students make a personal connection with children in another culture.
Why is it important to be able to think and learn freely?
The class also made a picture book and wrote a message of friendship. The message was translated into Arabic and included in each box. Arabic is the official language of Iraq. ""We hope we can reach out in friendship and make a difference,"" said Winslow.

140,41,"Recently, historians found an old well in Jamestown, Virginia.
Historians believe that colonists from England dug the well nearly 400 years ago. Shortly after the well was completed, it dried up. The colonists then used the well as a dump.
The historians have found a piece of old armor in the well. Studying the armor and other ""garbage"" from the well will help us learn about life in early Jamestown.
The history of Jamestown begins in England. On December 20, 1606, three ships sailed from England. The ships were bound for Virginia. After the colonists on the ships landed in Virginia, they built a fort. The colonists arrived in North America 14 years before the Pilgrims.
Most of the colonists came to Virginia to search for treasure. Most did not know how to grow crops to feed themselves. They became so hungry that they ate dogs, rats, and snakes.
Eventually, more people settled in Jamestown. They turned the fort into a town. The colonists began to grow and sell crops. The small fort became the first permanent English settlement in North America.
The ""garbage"" from the well is helping historians better understand how the colonists lived.
""When one stands at Jamestown today, it is hard to imagine how much hope, regret, fear, hatred, hunger, pain, and death were experienced at this place,"" historian Ivor Noel Hume wrote of the fort's earliest colonists.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
The settlers at Jamestown were often hungry.
Historians are studying artifacts from a well to learn about Jamestown.

141,691,"Many kids think cell phones are cool. The portable phones come in fun colors and let you chat with friends anytime and anywhere. For many kids, owning the right cell phone is just as important as wearing the coolest sneakers or latest style of jeans.
Even though cell phones are a hot fad, some scientists are ringing an alarm about them. The scientists say that cell phones might pose a health threat.
In the United States, more than 90 million people use cell phones. Many of those people are kids. For kids, cell phones are about more than phone calls, says Anne Charlton of the University of Manchester in England. ""It's all about the cool factor,"" Charlton said. She added that a cell phone is not just about making calls, it's also a fashion statement.
Most cell phone users don't think about the health risks the phones might pose. Some scientists warn that cell phones give off radiation that might be harmful to users. One recent study shows that cell phone radiation might increase a person's chance of getting some kinds of cancer.
Other medical experts say cell phones don't pose a health threat. They point to studies that have not found any link between phone use and cancer.
Scientists say that people can protect themselves from cell phone radiation. One way is to use a headset instead of talking directly into a cell phone. Or, for an even simpler solution, people can make shorter calls.
When the first cell phones were sold, they all had the same ring. Today, most cell phones can be made to ring one of several different tones. But at least one cell phone manufacturer plans to change that.
Nokia plans to start making phones that play pop tunes when they ring. Users could choose tunes by the Spice Girls, Enrique Iglesias, Lenny Kravitz, and many other artists.
By choosing pop tunes instead of the standard ringing sound, cell phone users can program their phones to match their personalities and moods, explained a company spokesperson.

142,330,"Wild Weather: Is Global Warming Causing Unusual Storms?
Residents of Barrow, Alaska, are stunned when a severe thunderstorm roars through town. The storm shocks the town; it is the first thunderstorm they have ever seen.
For over 36 hours, a wild blizzard dumps about 100,000 tons of snow on a ski course in Austria. When even the ski lifts stop working, the storm puts a world championship skiing competition on hold.
Those are just two of the many cases of wild weather, such as blizzards, tornadoes, hurricanes, and heat waves, that have been taking place around the world. A recent report from the United Nations (U.N.) says that wild weather may become increasingly common worldwide.
The U.N. report blames the unusual weather on
, or a rise in temperature worldwide.
Certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, settle in Earth's atmosphere. Those gases act like the glass windows in a greenhouse, trapping heat from the sun and causing a rise in temperature.
According to the report, during the next century, global warming will cause average temperatures worldwide to increase by 2 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit.
World temperatures have been slowly increasing at least since 1850, when scientists began keeping records of world temperatures. The 1990s were the hottest ten years on record.
Scientists aren't sure what is causing global warming. Most scientists agree that burning gasoline, oil, and coal as fuel is the most important cause. Burning those fuels releases lots of carbon dioxide.
Some scientists, however, say global warming is mainly caused by forest fires, volcanic eruptions, and other natural events that release carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere.
Craig Idso, from the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, said he doubts that worldwide temperatures will increase much more than they have already. According to Idso, an increase in carbon dioxide may be a good thing, since plants need carbon dioxide to grow. By taking in more of the gas, plants ""will grow like gangbusters,"" he said.
The effects of global warming will vary from place to place, scientists say. In the United States, global warming could cause warmer weather in Alaska, more forest fires in California, crop failures in the Midwest, and longer growing seasons in the Northeast.
In the meantime, many companies are working to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere. For example, automobile manufacturers are developing new fuels that could replace gasoline and limit carbon dioxide emissions.
Michael Glantz, from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that people will learn how to live with global warming. ""Society is more robust than we give it credit for,"" he said. ""People may learn to live more comfortably in a new, warmer world.""

143,86,"Plans for an African-American history museum in Washington, D.C., have been in the works for more than a year. Recently, several African-American leaders were appointed to help manage the project. They include talk-show host Oprah Winfrey and Robert Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television (BET).
The museum will be part of the Smithsonian Institution. Although its exact location has not yet been determined, officials hope that it may find a home on the National Mall. The U.S. government is paying for about half the museum's $400 million cost. The museum's leaders will help raise the rest of the money.
President George W. Bush authorizes the creation of a Smithsonian museum dedicated to African-American history and culture.
The museum will celebrate the contributions of African Americans in the United States. It will highlight African-American history and culture from the Civil War (1860-1865) to the present.
""I look forward to the day the National Museum [of African-American history] opens and I can take my children and grandchildren to not only see history but be part of it,"" said one of the committee members. The museum is expected to open in 2013.

144,31,"visits India and finds hope after tragedy
A year after the devastating tsunami that hit southern Asia, rebuilding efforts continue in full force.
Each day, 10-year-old Sarjm walks through the hot sand and past
the rubble where homes used to stand. He can see and even taste the ocean. The ocean used to make him happy. It provided fishermen like his father a way of making a living.
But on December 26, 2004, the ocean turned black and changed his village. It left behind destruction and fear. A memorial outside his school is a constant reminder of the 49 schoolchildren who lost their lives in the tsunami that struck on that date.
Debris of beach resorts washed away in the December 26 Indian Ocean tsunami at Khao Lak, Thailand, seen December 30.
The young boy talks about how his older brother and younger sister were both ""taken by the black wave."" Clapping his hands together, he told
Sadly, it is a story shared by thousands of other children. Sarjm lives in Kottapalli, a fishing village located at the southernmost tip of India. India was one of 12 countries devastated by last years tsunamione of the worst natural disasters in history. The series of gigantic waves, which resulted from an undersea earthquake, flattened coastlines and reduced fishing villages to rubble. More than 280,000 people died.
Now, one year later, many people are still homeless. But slowly, smiles are returning, and laughter once again rings through some of the fishing villages. Relief agencies have been working to help rebuild homes, schools, and lives with donations from people around the world.
Some of those donations came from American students who
or came together, to raise money to help people affected by the tsunami. From schools in small towns to those in big cities, students held bake-a-thons, participated in read-a-thons, and even sold their own belongings at garage sales. The pennies, quarters, and dollars are helping rebuild homes and bringing hope to children whose hearts and lives were shattered.
Nine-year-old Selso, who lives in a fishing village near Sarjms village, was one of those children. Before the tsunami destroyed his home, Selso, his sister, and his three brothers had never had a toilet or electricity in their house. Their house had only two rooms, and at night they all slept together on the dirt floor. ""We knew people who died, but my family was lucky,"" Selso told Weekly Reader. ""We only lost our home.""
Selsos mother used to worry about scorpions and snakes getting inside, but now all that has changed. Volunteers from Habitat for Humanity worked with Selsos family to construct a new home with electricity and plumbing. Habitat for Humanity volunteers build homes with families who have suffered. The organization plans to build 10,000 homes in the area during the next two years. ""This is the happiest day for my family,"" says Selsos dad, Michel. ""My children now have a safe, dry home where they can do their homework.""
With the help of relief agencies, some schools have also opened. Many are housed in temporary locations under thatched roofs. Classrooms are also beginning to receive textbooks and other much-needed supplies.
""When a school opens in a disaster zone, everyone feels a sense of hope,"" said Carol Bellamy, the executive director of the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), after the disaster. The U.S. Agency for International Development is another organization that has helped build playgrounds where children can enjoy new equipment.
As rebuilding efforts continue, many children remain terrified of the ocean. Volunteers have worked with Sarjm and other kids to talk about what happened. ""I was afraid to go back to the ocean,"" Sarjm says, ""but we were taught that the tsunami was very rare and would not happen again. I am not afraid to look at the water anymore.""
Why is it important to feel safe? What makes you feel safe at home? at school?
After the tsunami, countries in southern Asia began to put together a plan for a warning system in the Indian Ocean. Earlier this year, the U.S. government also announced a plan to improve the U.S. warning system by 2007. Under the plan, the number of devices that monitor waves from a tsunami will be increased. The warning system would provide an alert for U.S. coasts ""within minutes, and in some cases, within seconds of a tsunamis formation,"" according to scientist John Marburger.

145,665,"In San Francisco, baseball last season went to the dogs-- Portuguese water dogs, that is.
A team of six Portuguese water dogs helped the San Francisco Giants every time the baseball team played at home at Pacific Bell Park. The dogs are members of the Baseball Aquatic Retrieval Korps (BARK). They retrieved home run baseballs hit into nearby McCovey Cove.
BARK uses Portuguese water dogs because they are excellent swimmers. The dogs have webbed feet and use their tails as rudders. Portuguese fishermen use these swimming hounds to herd schools of fish into nets and deliver messages between ships.

147,421,"Shaquille O'Neal is happy, and it's not because he made a free throw. The basketball star is thrilled that the National Basketball Association (NBA) brought back the leather ball on January 1.
The NBA has brought back its old ball after trying out a new ball covered in synthetic material.
For the past few months, players had to use a ball covered with a synthetic, or human-made, material. Many players, including O'Neal, complained the plasticcoated basketball was a bad decision. They said the new ball didn't bounce as well as the leather ball. The new ball also cut their hands. ""The new ball is terrible,"" O'Neal, the Miami Heat center, says.
Scientists at the University of Texas at Arlington ran experiments comparing the synthetic and leather balls. The biggest difference they found was in the way the new ball absorbs moisture.
The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture than the leather ball does. That means the synthetic ball doesn't become heavier when it comes in contact with players' sweat. It also means the synthetic ball can become slippery because moisture stays on its surface, scientist Kaushik De, who helped conduct the study, told
The return of the leather ball has many NBA players jumping for joy. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us.""

149,698,"How did the universe begin? Most scientists think that it happened with a giant cosmic explosion. That idea is known as the Big Bang theory. A
is a way scientists explain how or why something happens.
In the past, scientists estimated that the universe was between 13 and 15 billion years old. Now, thanks to satellite technology, they are able to confirm its approximate age at 13.7 billion years old-give or take 100 million years. Using satellite technology, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) created a detailed picture of what the universe would have looked like shortly after the Big Bang. The snapshot provides answers to questions about the age and origins of the universe.
""We see the results as a gold mine for learning about our universe,"" said NASA scientist Charles Bennett. ""The patterns in the picture tell us all kinds of things about the universe.""
The space agency says the findings provide evidence that stars began shining about 200 million years after the Big Bang. This was half a billion years earlier than scientists had originally predicted.

151,278,"Behaviour can be investigated in the field or in the laboratory.
It can be observed and measured, and experiments can be designed to test how it works.
Human behaviour is affected by many variables. It can be more difficult to study than the behaviour of other animals.
Fieldwork does not always mean you have to work in a field. It means investigations that take place outside the laboratory.
Some scientists spend many hours watching and studying the behaviour of animals. They may be interested in how the animals live alone, group into families or form large groups such as herds.
Scientists can tag sharks to study their behaviour.
Animals can signal to each other. For example, they may call to each other to warn of danger. Some scientists are interested in such signals. They record and study them to try to work out what the signals mean.
Some animals migrate over large distances to find food or nesting sites.
Animals can be tagged by attaching tracking devices to them. Tagging lets scientists follow the journeys the animals make.
The work of Lorentz and Pavlov has been mentioned in this Revision Bite. These scientists studied animal behaviour under controlled conditions.
The behaviour of woodlice is often studied in schools. Several woodlice are put into a choice chamber with four different conditions:
The woodlice are left on their own for a while, and then the number of animals in each quarter is counted. Woodlice prefer dark and damp conditions. The quarter of the choice chamber with these conditions contains most or all of the woodlice.

Ratio - Equivalent ratios and simplest form
If you are making orange squash and you mix one part orange to four parts water, then the ratio of orange to water will be 1:4 (1 to 4).
If you use 1 litre of orange, you will use 4 litres of water (1:4).
If you use 2 litres of orange, you will use 8 litres of water (2:8).
If you use 10 litres of orange, you will use 40 litres of water (10:40).
Both sides of the ratio can be multiplied or divided by the same number to give an equivalent ratio.
Write the ratio 40:28 in its simplest form.
To work this out, look for a number that will divide into 40 and 28.
2 divides into both numbers, so 40:28 can be written as 20:14.
You can divide these by 2, so the simplified ratio is
No number divides into 10 and 7, so 10:7 is the simplest form of the ratio.

Astronomy and space science - The Moon
The Moon orbits the Earth, so it is called a
. No-one built it or launched it into space.
Gravitational forces between the Moon and the Earth keep the Moon in orbit. The Moon does not produce light. But it does
light from the Sun, which is how we are able to see it from Earth. (Only stars produce light and they are called luminous for that reason.)
It takes the Moon 28 days to make a complete orbit of the Earth. As it orbits, we see the Moon lit from different angles. This is why we see
Sometimes the Moon looks like a full circle. That is called a 'full Moon'. At other times we see a crescent shaped Moon, because we can only see the edge of the part that is lit by the Sun.
Remember that we can only see the part of the Moon that reflects the Sun's light. How much of that we can see depends upon the position of the Moon in its orbit.
This slideshow shows the phases of the Moon, as seen from the Earth.
A common mistake is to think that the phases of the Moon happen because the Earth gets in the way, and casts its shadow onto the Moon. That is not how the phases are caused.
However sometimes it does happen that the Earth's shadow falls on the Moon. Then we get an
of the Moon. The whole Moon goes from full, to dark, and back again to full, in the course of a few hours.

156,30,"Atoms of different elements can join together in chemical reactions to form compounds. For example
are elements. They react together to form
There are countless different ways for the elements to join together, and millions of compounds are known.
The properties of compounds are usually very different from the properties of the elements they contain. For example hydrogen and oxygen are both gases at room temperature, but water is a liquid.
The reaction between iron and sulfur to make
is often used in school to study elements and compounds. Look at the animation to remind you what happens in this reaction.
A test tube is filled with a mixture of iron and sulfur.
The table compares the properties of iron and sulfur (the two elements), and iron sulfide (the compound).
The atoms in a compound are chemically joined together by strong forces called
. You can only separate the elements in a compound using another chemical reaction. Separation methods like filtration and distillation will not do this.
Compounds form when atoms join together in a chemical reaction

157,229,"should introduce the subject. The writer wants to catch the reader's attention and hint at what is to come. If the beginning is poor, the reader could lose interest quickly and stop reading.
section presents the main ideas, thoughts, actions and so on. These will often be presented in stages or with several twists and turns of argument.
generally sums up the piece of text, or makes a final point, or brings a conclusion to a story.
It can add to your marks in a test if you show a plan of how you are going to answer a long question.
A writer will usually plan not only what they are going to write, but also how they are going to write it. For example, how would a writer plan a magazine article about the benefits of health and fitness?
Imagine you are writing a plan for a magazine article about fitness and health.
Beginning: do people need to be fit?
Health angle  unfit people can need more health care
Ending: get fit and eat healthy food and you will benefit
This is an example of quite a straightforward plan. Each box contains a summary of a paragraph and they are organised in a way that steers the reader through a journey. Obviously, the more complex the issue, argument, story, and so on, the more complex the plan will be.

158,353,"The commonly used metric units of length include:
To find a suitable unit to measure something in, you should first estimate how big it is. So, for example, do you think it's better to measure the distance between London and Manchester in metres or kilometres? Or, should an insect be measured in metres or millimetres?
Imagine the length of the objects you are estimating or imagine measuring them in relation to other objects. For example:
Imagine a metre ruler next to a tall man. You would expect him to be taller than 1 ruler, but not as tall as 3 rulers.
Imagine a bag of sugar on some scales. You would expect the needle to move round a little, but not to whizz round to 50kg.
Imagine a 1-litre bottle of cola. You would expect it to hold approximately the same amount as a large flask.
Q1. Which unit of measurement (km, m, cm or mm) would you use for the following?
b) the length of a football pitch
d) the distance from London to Manchester
a) Is the height of a tall man likely to be 90cm, 180cm or 360cm?
b) Is the weight of a bag of sugar about 1kg, 10kg or 50kg?
c) Does a large flask hold roughly 200ml, 1l or 10l of liquid?

Measures - Converting units for area and volume
The method for converting between units works the same as the one for converting units of area and volume.
When you are converting one sort of unit to another, you need to know how many smaller units are needed to make 1 larger unit (eg 1000m
When converting from a larger unit to a smaller unit (eg m
When converting from a smaller unit to a larger unit (eg cm
= 100cm  100cm = 10 000cm
You are converting from a smaller unit (cm
= 50 000  10 000 = 5m
= 10mm  10mm  10mm = 1000mm
You are converting from a larger unit (cm
= 10  1000 = 10 000mm

Atoms and elements - Metals v non-metals
Remember that most elements are metals, rather than non-metals. The table summarises some differences in their properties.
Solid (except mercury, which is a liquid)
About half are solids, about half are gases, and one (bromine) is a liquid
High (they feel heavy for their size)
Low (they feel light for their size)
Brittle (they break or shatter when hammered)
Poor (they are insulators, apart from graphite)
They make a ringing sound (they are sonorous)
Notice that metals and non-metals have opposite properties to each other. It is usually easy to tell metals and non-metals apart, but some tests are more reliable than others
For example using a magnet is not a good test to see if an element is a metal. That's because only three metals are magnetic, not all of them.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The party
Romeo and his friends decide to gate-crash the party. Romeo has a bad feeling about the outcome of this evening, but decides to let fate take its course.
Capulet is having a great time at his party. People are dancing. Romeo and his friends arrive wearing masks. Romeo spots Juliet. He thinks to himself that he didn't really know what true beauty was until he saw her. He doesn't know that she is a Capulet. Tybalt recognises Romeo from his voice and threatens to kill him because he is a Montague, but Capulet stops him. Romeo and Juliet flirt and finally kiss. The Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet and he is dismayed. He leaves with Benvolio. Juliet is distraught when the Nurse tells her who Romeo is.
The Chorus recaps events for us: Romeo has forgotten Rosaline and is now in love with Juliet. Juliet feels the same way.
Romeo runs away from his friends. Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline.
Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom. Juliet doesn't know that he is there at first and, talking to herself, declares her love for him. She is shocked and embarrassed when he replies. They have only met that evening, but they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and what time their wedding will be! They find it difficult to part.
Romeo goes to see Friar Lawrence, the priest, who is worried that he has spent the night with Rosaline. When Romeo says that he wants to marry Juliet, Friar Lawrence tells him off for falling in love so easily, but agrees to the wedding because he thinks that it might be a solution to the rift between the Capulets and the Montagues.

168,136,"> Fractions - Common factors and simplest form
Fractions - Common factors and simplest form
of a number are those numbers that divide into it exactly.
Numbers have common factors if the same number divides into both of them.
So 4 is a common factor of both 8 and 12, as it divides into both of them. 2 is a common factor of both 2 and 6, as it divides into both of them.
4 and 12 have a common factor (4), so
(divide the top and the bottom by 4).
2 and 6 have a common factor (2), so
(divide the top and the bottom by 2).
However, 1 and 3 have no common factors, so
cannot be simplified. When a fraction cannot be simplified we say that it is its

Cells to systems - Cells, tissues, organs and systems
Animal cells and plant cells can form tissues, like muscle tissue. A living tissue is made from a group of cells with a similar structure and function, which all work together to do a particular job. Here are some examples of tissues:
phloem (tubes that carry dissolved sugar around a plant)
root hair tissue (for plants to take up water and minerals from the soil)
An organ is made from a group of different tissues, which all work together to do a particular job. Here are some examples of organs:
An organ system is made from a group of different organs, which all work together to do a particular job. Here are some examples of organ systems:

Ray, the main character in this extract, has stolen a motorbike and caused an accident that killed someone. He has told nobody, but knows that he can't hide for much longer. He is about to get on a bus, but realises that the one person who can link him to the crime is the conductor of that very bus. Before he can run off, he bumps into Mrs Fitzroy, his best friend's mum.
Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. Write one paragraph for each bullet point.
He hung back, groping wildly for some excuse to prevent him getting on, but the bell rang and the engine increased its impatient rumble and his legs carried him upwards on to the platform, and he felt Mrs Fitzroy clamber on behind. The bus began to move. He turned towards the stairs, but she caught hold of his arm.
""Let's go downstairs. I don't like the smoke."" Again he felt her hand guide him, and he ducked his head and began to walk along the aisle. ""Yeah"".
""This'll do,"" she said, and he turned back and sat beside her - the less fuss he made, the less obvious he was, the better. As he settled, he kept his face bent low, aware of the conductor walking towards them. He brushed past, and, noticing things with a total clarity, Ray saw the dark blue uniform that he was wearing and noted the heaviness and thickness of the material. He heard him clumping up the stairs, and he wondered, absurdly, if he was wearing heavy boots, too.
Mrs Fitzroy was opening the bag which she had on her lap, and Ray felt in his pocket for his fare. If he had the right change, he could just hand it to the conductor without looking up. Yes, he had a ten and two pence piece. He glanced at Mrs Fitzroy and saw to his dismay that she was taking out a pound-note from her purse. That would mean a delay while she got her change - plenty of chance for him to be recognised. Could he offer to pay her fare? It would seem strange, but anything was better than being seen.
What kind of atmosphere does the writer create in this extract and how do they do it?
Ray's thoughts and actions as he gets on the bus
how the writer uses language to create the atmosphere.
In this text, the writer creates an atmosphere of fear and tension. Ray's thoughts and actions at the start of the passage show that he is under a lot of pressure. He tries to think of an excuse to 'prevent him getting on' the bus, but knows that this will just make Mrs Fitzroy suspicious. When he tries to go upstairs, she insists they stay downstairs. Nothing seems to be going his way, and this leads us to believe he may well be spotted by the conductor.
As the conductor approaches, Ray's fears increase which creates more tension. He keeps his face 'bent low' to avoid being recognised, and also notices things 'with a total clarity'. This shows that he is very scared and alert, ready for something to go wrong. When he realises Mrs Fitzroy has no change, he feels 'dismay'. The reader is kept on the edge of their seat waiting for the conductor to come along.
The writer uses language, as well as events, to create tension. The phrase 'groping wildly for some excuse' shows Ray's panic and gives the impression that he feels he has no control over events. The way he notices the 'heaviness' of the conductor's uniform, and wonders if he was 'wearing heavy boots as well' might mean that he is afraid of the man. Ray asks himself 'Could he offer to pay her fare?'. This shows he is tense; he is running through possibilities in his mind. The writer uses Ray's fears to create an atmosphere of tension for the reader.

Electric current and voltage - Circuit symbols
We use circuit symbols to draw diagrams of electrical circuits, with straight lines to show the wires. The diagram shows some common circuit symbols.
Notice the difference between the symbol for a
? The battery is made from joining cell symbols together.
Think of what we usually call a single battery, like the type you put in a torch. In physics, each of these is actually called a
- it is only when you have two or more of these cells connected together that you call it a battery.
The idea of a circuit diagram is to use circuit symbols instead of drawing each component in the circuit. Always try to make the wires
lines, and don't be tempted to make them wiggly.
The whole point is to make it easier to see what is connected to what. Here you can see how the symbols for a cell (not a battery!) and a lamp look in a circuit diagram.
If you have to draw a circuit diagram from scratch, it is usually easier to draw the circuit symbols first, and then add all the wires. If you have to draw wires to join circuit symbols that are already shown, use a ruler and don't let the wires cross each other.

177,97,"> Drama - Showing moods and emotions
Being able to recognise changes in mood and emotion in a script is important as you need to convey this to your audience.
Using these methods, decide how you would express the emotion of anger.
What happens to your face, body and voice when you feel angry? How do you walk when you're in a bad mood? Which gestures do you use to show someone you're angry with them?
Frown, tightly clenched jaw, a tight mouth or even bared teeth.
Tense shoulders, a swift and purposeful walk almost like a march.
Strong and forceful gestures. Perhaps even clenched fists.
Either very loud and out of control or very quiet and menacing.
Maybe if you're very angry you won't pause often, you'll talk very quickly without giving the other person a chance to talk. Or the pauses might be long - a deafening silence!
Now try this with other emotions, eg surprise, excitement, happiness, sadness. See how your body, face and voice change with each emotion.
Another way to practise emotions is to do mood walks - put all the elements together to develop a walk that represents each emotion, then greet (or growl at) people with the appropriate tone of voice.
Don't be such a drama queen! Try this activity.

forces. These forces act in the opposite direction to the movement. Friction makes it harder for things to move.
friction between our shoes and the floor stop us from slipping
friction between tyres and the road stop cars from skidding
friction between the brakes and wheel help bikes and cars slow down
Frictional forces are much smaller on smooth surfaces than on rough surfaces, which is why we slide on ice.
Friction can also be unhelpful. If you don't lubricate your bike regularly with oil, the friction in the chain and axles increases. Your bike will be noisy and difficult to pedal.
When there is a lot of friction between moving parts, energy is lost to the surroundings as

as they move. Air resistance is caused by the frictional forces of the air against the vehicle. The faster the vehicle moves, the bigger the air resistance becomes. The top speed of a vehicle is reached when the force from the cyclist or engine is balanced by air resistance.
Racing cyclists crouch down low on their bikes to
the air resistance on them. This helps them to cycle faster. They also wear streamlined helmets. These have special, smooth shapes that allow the air to flow over the cyclist more easily.
Modern cars are also streamlined. Their smooth shapes make the air resistance smaller, which allows them to travel further on the same amount of fuel.

181,164,"The beginning, or opening, is one of the most important sections of your writing. It should grab the reader's attention and make them want to read on. For instance, which is the best beginning for a ghost story?
a) The house was built in 1975. It was a typical semi-detached, but it did have quite an impressive front door. Most of the windows were double glazed and the garden was quite neat.
b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.
There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.
So you need to think about TAP (text, audience and purpose) and make a good start to your writing. You should try to 'set a context', which is like setting the scene. So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on.
a) The subject I am going to write about today is why the local park should not be closed.
b) Have you ever stopped to wonder how many hundreds of people make regular use of our Memorial Park?
a) It is unlikely that newspaper readers who enjoy all the things that our park has to offer will want it to disappear forever under tons of concrete.
b) 'Ashfield Park will be ruined,' claim protestors who held a meeting last night to organise opposition to the council's plans for a car park.
It should be clear that the ""b"" versions are better - they fit the style and show that the writer has used TAP to make their writing work. Remember - you need to make it interesting right from the start.
The importance of beginnings, middles and ends.

182,316,"Respiration is a chemical reaction that happens in all living cells. It is the way that energy is released from glucose, for our cells to use to keep us functioning.
the same as breathing (which is properly called ventilation).
The glucose and oxygen react together in the cells to produce carbon dioxide and water. The reaction is called
because oxygen from the air is needed for it to work.
Here is the word equation for aerobic respiration:
(Energy is released in the reaction. We show it in brackets in the equation because energy is not a substance.)
Now we will look at how glucose and oxygen get to the cells so that respiration can take place and how we get rid of the carbon dioxide.
, obtained through digestion of the food we eat. Digestion breaks food down into small molecules. These can be absorbed across the wall of the small intestine into the bloodstream.
Glucose is carried round the body dissolved in blood plasma, the pale yellow liquid part of our blood. The dissolved glucose can diffuse into the cells of the body from the
. Once in the cell glucose can be used in respiration.
When we breathe in oxygen enters the small air sacs, called
, in the lungs. Oxygen diffuses from there into the bloodstream.
Oxygen is not carried in the plasma, but is carried by the red blood cells. These contain a red substance called
, which joins onto oxygen and carries it around the body in the blood, then lets it go when necessary. Like glucose, oxygen can diffuse into cells from the capillaries.
Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body
Carbon dioxide from cells to the air
The carbon dioxide produced during respiration diffuses out of the cells and into the blood plasma. The blood carries it to the lungs. It then diffuses across the walls of the alveoli and into the air, ready to be exhaled.

Astronomy and space science - Days and nights
as they orbit the Sun. It takes the Earth 24 hours to make one complete turn on its axis, so an Earth day is 24 hours long.
Different planets take different amounts of time to make one complete turn, so they have different lengths of day.
The Sun lights up one half of the Earth, and the other half is in shadow. As the Earth spins we move from shadow to light and back to shadow and so on. It is daytime in the UK when our part of the planet is in the lit by the Sun. And it is night-time in the UK when our part of the planet is facing away from the Sun.
During the day, the Sun appears to move through the sky. Remember that this happens because the Earth is spinning on its axis. In the UK if we look south and follow the path of Sun in the sky during the day, it looks like this:
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west
. That's because the Earth is spinning towards to the east, so we see the Sun first appear there at the start of the day. The Sun 'rises' in the east and 'sets' in the west.
One way to remember which way the Earth turns is to remember ""
"", which means the Earth spins from west to east.
Star trails made by leaving the camera shutter open during the night
During the night, we cannot see the Sun. But the Earth is still spinning on its axis. This means that the stars appear to move from east to west in the sky, just as the Sun does in the day.

Variation and classification - Continuous & discontinuous
Some of the features of the different organisms in a species show continuous variation, and some features show discontinuous variation.
Human height is an example of continuous variation. Height ranges from that of the shortest person in the world to that of the tallest person. Any height is possible between these values. So it is continuous variation.
For any species a characteristic that changes gradually over a range of values shows continuous variation. Examples of such characteristics are:
If you record the heights of a group of people and draw a graph of your results, it usually looks something like this:
The more people you measure, and the smaller the categories you use, the closer the results will be to the curved line. This shape of graph is typical of a feature with continuous variation. Weight and foot length would give graphs similar in shape to this.
Human blood group is an example of discontinuous variation. There are only 4 types of blood group. There are no other possibilities and there are no values in between. So this is discontinuous variation.
A characteristic of any species with only a limited number of possible values shows discontinuous variation. Here are some examples:

194,391,"> Forces - Weight, mass and gravity
People often confuse mass and weight. Remember that weight is a force, and is measured in newtons. Mass is measured in kilograms (kg).
The mass of an object is the
or ""stuff"" it contains. The more matter an object contains, the greater its mass. An elephant contains more matter than a mouse, so it has a greater mass. Mass is measured in
A 100 kg object has a greater mass than a 5 kg object. Remember an object's mass stays the same wherever it is.
All objects have a force that attracts them towards each other. This is called
. Even you attract other objects to you because of gravity, but you have too little mass for the force to be very strong.
Gravity only becomes noticeable when there is a really massive object like a moon, planet or star. We are pulled down towards the ground because of gravity. The gravitational force pulls in the direction towards the centre of the Earth.
""Down"" is towards the centre of the Earth, wherever you are on the planet
Weight is a force caused by gravity. The weight of an object is the
between the object and the Earth. The more mass the object has the greater its weight will be.
Weight is a force, so it's measured in
. On the surface of the Earth an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 10 N.
The mass of an object stays the same wherever it is, but its weight can change. This happens if the object goes somewhere where gravity is stronger, or weaker, such as the Moon.
The Moon has less mass than the Earth, so its gravity is less than the Earth's gravity. This means that objects weigh less on the Moon than they do on the Earth.
The Moon's gravity is one sixth of the Earth's gravity. A 120 kg astronaut weighs 1200 N on Earth. On the Moon they would weigh only 200 N. The astronaut's
The weight of an object changes if the strength of gravity changes
Remember: a mass of 1kg has a weight of about 10N on Earth.

195,31,"> Inequalities and Simultaneous Equations - Algebra
You can solve simultaneous equations by adding or subtracting the two equations from each other.
Add the two equations together and you will find that the y disappears:
3x + 2x + y - y = 9 + 1
6 - 5 = 1 (which is correct)
To make the 3x's disappear we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
3x - 3x + 2y - (-y) = 8 - 5
6 - 1 = 5 (which is correct)
So the solution is x = 2, y = 1

197,80,"> Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts
Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts
A salt is always made when an acid is neutralised by a base. But the exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used.
The name of a salt has two parts:
the first part comes from the metal in the base used
the second part comes from the acid that was used
Where does the name potassium nitrate come from?
These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt:
How can we make copper sulfate? The first part of the name is 'copper', so we need a base containing copper. We could use copper oxide or copper carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'sulfate', so we need to use sulfuric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
copper sulfate + water + carbon dioixde
How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
sodium chloride + water + carbon dioxide
It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced.

198,224,"A food chain shows the different organisms that live in a habitat, and what eats what.
A food chain always starts with a producer, which is an organism that makes food. This is usually a green plant, because plants can make their own food by photosynthesis.
A food chain ends with a consumer, which is an animal that eats a plant or another animal. Here is an example of a simple food chain:
Take care - the arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating. If you get the arrows the wrong way round, instead of showing that humans eat cows, you are showing that cows eat humans, and that grass eats cows.
There are several words used to describe the organisms in a food chain. Study this food chain:
The plant is the producer and the animals are consumers.
Notice that the first consumer in the chain is also called the primary consumer, the next one is the secondary consumer and the one after that is the tertiary consumer.
A consumer that eats plants is called a
, and a consumer that eats other animals is called a
is an animal that eats both plants and animals.
A predator is an animal that eats other animals, and the prey is the animal that gets eaten by the predator. In the food chain above:
the frog is a predator and the grasshopper is its prey.
the hawk is a predator and the frog is its prey.

Any piece of writing. More widely, a text can be anything that conveys meaning - eg, a film, tv programme, advert, website, or image.
. A text may have one theme or many. Understanding the themes makes the text more than 'just' a text - it becomes something more significant, because we're encouraged to think more deeply about the text, to work out what lies beneath its surface.
The title of the book comes from a poem by the 18th century Scottish poet Robbie Burns. It is about a mouse which carefully builds a winter nest in a wheat field, only for it to be destroyed by a ploughman. It is written in Scots

The mouse had dreamed of a safe, warm winter and is now faced with the harsh reality of cold, loneliness and possible death. There is a parallel here with George and Lennie's joyful fantasy of a farm of their own, and its all-too-predictable destruction at the end of the story.

The two main themes in 'Of Mice and Men' - foreshadowed by the reference to Burns' mouse - are loneliness and dreams. They interlock: people who are lonely have most need of dreams to help them through.
Study the table below, showing both the loneliness and the dreams of each of the main characters. You could use a table like this as the basis for an exam answer about

Loneliness and Dreams in Of Mice and Men
George is not lonely during the novel, as he has Lennie. He will be lonely afterwards, without his best friend.
George and Lennie share a dream - to own a little patch of land and live on it in freedom. He is so set on the idea that he even knows of some land that he thinks they could buy.
Lennie is the only character who is innocent enough not to fear loneliness, but he is angry when Crooks suggests George won't come back to him.
George and Lennie share a dream - to own a little patch of land and live on it in freedom. Lennie's main desire is to tend the soft-haired rabbits they will keep.
She is married to a man she doesn't love and who doesn't love her. There are no other women on the ranch and she has nothing to do. She tries to befriend the men by hanging round the bunkhouse.
She dreams of being a movie star. Her hopes were raised by a man who claimed he would take her to Hollywood, but when she didn't receive a letter from him, she married Curley.
When Candy's ancient, ill dog was shot, Candy has nothing left. He delayed killing the dog, even though he knew deep down that it was the best thing, as he dreaded losing his long-time companion.
Candy joins George and Lennie's plan of owning a piece of land. His savings make the dream actually possible to achieve.
Crooks lives in enforced solitude, away from the other men. He is bitter about being a back-busted nigger. He is thrilled when Lennie and Candy come into his room and are his companions for a night.
Crooks dreams of being seen as equal to everyone else. He knows his civil rights. He remembers fondly his childhood, when he played with white children who came to his family's chicken ranch, and longs for a similar relationship with white people again.

201,5617,"Any large-scale economic activity may have a negative impact on the natural environment. Manufacturing industries in particular can cause air, water and noise
The presence of a potentially harmful substance that can reduce quality of a natural resource, such as water, and have knock-on impacts on the environment.
. Industrial pollution can affect the environment in a number of ways:
It may damage the well-being of humans and other species - for example, it can pollute drinking-water supplies or poison plants and animals.
It may interfere with natural processes - for example, it could change local climatic conditions or destroy wildlife habitats.
It may impact on people's livelihoods - for example, pollution of the sea will hurt people who are involved in fishing and tourism.
Some governments have introduced legislation to try to cut down on avoidable pollution and to encourage industries that are more
Sustainable means using something or doing something in a way that minimises damage to the environment and which avoids using up natural resources, eg by using renewable rather than scarce resources.
. These laws need to be enforced by courts.
A recent example of courts taking action against a company for causing pollution was in 2004 when a US court ordered the oil company
to pay 2.5bn for an oil spill in 1989.
ran aground while off course. It spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil contaminating over 1,300 miles of the coast of Alaska. It is estimated that the spill killed as many as 250,000 seabirds, 3,000 sea otters, 300 seals and 22 killer whales.
The court wanted Exxon to pay to help compensate those people in Alaska whose livelihoods were hurt the worst. The 2.5bn pay out is the latest ruling in a long-running court case.

207,3985,"People sometimes say that discrimination is created when prejudice is combined with power. Prejudice is the attitude of someone whose opinion is not based on fact. Prejudice can be triggered by differences of religion, race, colour, sex, language, disability or age. Prejudice is not illegal, as an attitude cant be illegal, but discrimination is illegal.
All forms of discrimination go against the first two Articles of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights:
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.

208,1615,"is part of a line which has two end points (ie, it is not infinite). Each end of a line segment is usually labelled with letters.
If A is the point (1, 1) and B is the point (4, 5), what is the length of the line segment AB?
It is not easy to picture this without drawing a sketch. Have a look at the diagram below:
A has an x-coordinate of 1. B has an x-coordinate of 4. So, to get from A to B, we move along 3 units.
A has a y-coordinate of 1. B has a y-coordinate of 5. So, to get from A to B, we move up 4 units.
We have created a right-angled triangle. So to find the length of AB we use Pythagoras theorem.
If P is the point (1, 5) and Q is the point (5, 1), what is the length of the line segment PQ? Give your answer correct to 1 decimal point (d.p.).
If you get a question like this, it is fine to draw a sketch or diagram. If you get really confident, you might be able to answer the question without using a diagram.
If X is the point (1, 1) and Y is the point (3, 5), what is the midpoint of the line segment XY?
It is clear from this diagram that the midpoint of (1, 1) and (3, 5) is (2, 3).
In fact, the x-coordinate of M is the average of the x-coordinates of X and Y
And the y-coordinate of M is the average of the y-coordinates of X and Y.
What is the midpoint of (2, 7) and (4, 1)?
The midpoint of (2, 7) and (4, 1) is:

209,2154,"Species gradually evolve by a process of natural selection. The individuals in any population with the inherited features best suited to the environment in which they live are most likely to survive and reproduce. When they do, they pass on the genetic information for these features to their offspring.
Over time, a species can change its appearance and may even become a new species, unable to reproduce successfully with individuals of the original species.
Selective breeding, also called artificial selection, involves people taking charge of selection to produce new 'varieties' of various species. A variety is a type of a particular species that is different in some clear way from other varieties of that species.
For example, pedigree dogs come in lots of different varieties (or breeds) - they may be different colours and sizes, but they are all still dogs.
From left to right - Beagle, Wheaten Terrier, Rhodesian Ridgeback, Red Siberian Husky, Irish Setter, Golden Retriever, Boxer, Sheltie
Suppose you wanted a variety of cow that produced a lot of milk. This is what you could do:
choose or select the cows in your herd that produce the most milk
select the offspring that produce the most milk
keep repeating the process of selection and breeding until you achieve your goal
The key here is to identify the feature you want, and only breed from the individuals that have that feature. Here are some examples of what selective breeding can produce:
hens that lay big eggs of a particular colour
tomato plants that produce lots of tomatoes

210,1135,"These are the steps in selective breeding:
from parents to breed the next generation
wheat by crossbreeding wheat plants with disease resistance and wheat plants with a high yield.
by selecting bulls from high yield herds and breeding them with cows that have the best milk production.
Selective breeding can also be used to modify other characteristics of cattle.
Aberdeen Angus bull - bred for beef
Problems with selective breeding - higher tier
Future generations of selectively bred organisms will all share very
more dangerous as all the organisms would be affected. Also there's increased risk of genetic disease caused by
Some genes would be lost, making it more difficult to produce new varieties in the future. In scientific language this would be described as inbreeding can lead to a reduction in the size of the gene pool.

211,5734,"In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!

213,729,"This Revision Bite will help you understand the different types of production costs and how to calculate them.
A manufacturing company's production department will need to consider the quality and quantity of a product in relation to cost. If a firm wants to make a profit, it has to know what it is spending as well as what it is earning. Here are some of the costs it needs to know to do this:
Now look at each of these costs in more detail:
These costs do not change however many units of a product are made. Factory rent, insurance premiums and administration salaries stay the same, whether the factory is working at full capacity or producing nothing. The owner of the business may have taken out a loan to buy equipment or refurbish a building. The loan will have to be repaid whether or not the business has customers.
the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process
changes. For example, the amount of raw materials needed varies as the levels of output go up or down.
The employee is paid according to the number of units produced.
wages also fluctuate, depending on the employees' efficiency and the demand for the company's products.
The fixed costs and the variable costs are added together to establish the total costs. The fixed costs remain constant, but the variable costs increase in direct proportion with output.
The amount spent on producing one extra unit. It is the increase in total cost when one more unit is produced.
is a way of measuring how much more it will cost a company to make one more individual item. Here is an example:
A company produces compact discs. It has produced 99 CDs and the total costs have amounted to 999. If the total costs increase to 1,000 when the hundredth CD is made the marginal cost of the last CD is 1.00.
The firm knows that now each CD should cost only 1.00 or less to produce. As the cost per unit usually decreases with a rise in output, it should become cheaper to produce each one. The firm may be able to offer a more competitive price to customers.
The example of the CD shows the benefits of economies of scale, where mass production results in a lower unit cost. The reason is that the fixed costs do not change and are spread across a greater level of output.
The amount spent on producing each unit of output. It is calculated by dividing the total level of cost by the level of output.
helps a firm to monitor its progress, and makes it easier to set prices. It is calculated by dividing total cost by total output.
Using the example of the compact disc firm above:
This might seem expensive, but if the firm produces another hundred units at a marginal cost of 1.00 per CD, its average cost will fall radically:
The firm can use this information to decide whether it is worth accepting a new order for goods.
The examiner will want to see that you understand what the different costs are, how they are calculated, and why it is important for a firm to work them out. You will be expected to apply your understanding to a real life situation.
A company will always incur costs, no matter how efficient it is. Wages,
Raw materials are anything naturally occurring in or on the earth/in the sea before being processed. These are obtained through primary activities such as mining, fishing, forestry and farming.
, transport and power all have to be paid for. The company needs to establish all its costs to ensure it doesn't lose money.
Read the case study and answer the question below
Martin and Ashley started their window cleaning business with 1,500 they borrowed from Ashley's dad, and a 550 bank loan. They used the money to buy a second hand van and cleaning equipment. Ashley's dad doesn't charge any interest. They pay him back 50 a month. They also have to pay the bank 50 a month over two years. They don't get many bookings in winter when the weather is bad. Martin and Ashley aim to pay themselves 50 a month each.
What costs do Martin and Ashley have to meet even when they have no customers? (10 marks)
When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page.
They have got to pay back the money they borrowed.
Jamie needs to give far more explanation. He should use business terms and show he understands what fixed costs are.
They have to pay Ashley's father each month, as well as the loan from the bank. They may have other costs, like the cleaning materials they buy to run their business.
Morag started her answer quite well, mentioning both loans which, as fixed costs, have to be repaid. The cleaning materials, however, form part of the variable, rather than the fixed costs.
Costs which have to be paid, regardless of the level of output, are called fixed costs. Martin and Ashley have the fixed costs of repaying Ashley's dad 50 a month, and they probably pay bank interest on the loan. Their pay is a fixed cost. They might want to consider paying themselves piece rate, to help their business survive. The road tax and insurance on the van are fixed costs they have to pay. They have already bought the van, so this is a sunk cost, and no longer a fixed cost they have to pay.
Rani's answer would probably get a A grade. She has answered the question well, and has shown she can use business terms like fixed costs. She has thought about the pay they only receive when they have the business, and correctly counted it as a fixed cost.

214,3857,"We often use formulas without even noticing. For example, we might convert miles to km by multiplying by 1.6, or find the circumference of a circle by multiplying pi by the diameter.
km = 1.6 x miles is an example of a formula.
We have already seen that km = 1.6 x miles and C =
 d are examples of formulas. There are many others that we use regularly in other subjects. Sometimes we have to construct our own formula:
A taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00. Write down a formula for the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles.
Travelling 1 mile would cost 2 + 50p.
Travelling 2 miles would cost 2 + 2 x 50p.
Travelling 3 miles would cost 2 + 3 x 50p.
So travelling for 'n' miles will cost 2 + n x 50p.
The formula is C = 2 + (n x 50p)
A rectangle has a width of x and a length of 2x.
Write down a formula for the perimeter (P) in terms of x.
P = 2x + x + 2x + x
Did you remember to include all 4 sides?
To recap, the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles, when a taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00 is:-
C = 2 + (n x 50p)
To find the cost of the taxi for a journey of 20 miles, replace 'n' with 20.
C = 2 + (20 x 50p)
What is the cost of hiring this taxi for 16 miles?
Remember that C = 2 + (16 x 50p)
The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.
r, so we divide both sides by 2
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c
Rearrange the formula to make 'c' the subject.
[To work this out: y = mx + c, so subtract mx from both sides.]

216,2851,"You should know the different types of
The table summarises the main types of electromagnetic radiation and a typical use for each of them.
Unlike sound waves, electromagnetic waves do not need a substance to travel through. They can travel through the
of empty space. In a vacuum, they all travel with the same very high speed: 300 000 000 m/s.
A beam of electromagnetic radiation delivers energy in packets called photons.
The energy delivered by each photon increases with the
of the electromagnetic waves. This means that gamma photons have the most energy, and radio photons the least.
of a beam of electromagnetic radiation is the energy it delivers to a surface each second. This depends on how much energy each photon delivers, and on how many photons per second arrive at that surface.

217,1173,"This modern story about conflict between a mother and her teenage daughter was published in 1991. The mother is the narrator of the story, so we only see things from her point of view.
""You're not here any longer so how can I speak to you?""
A woman who is deeply upset lies in her daughter's darkened bedroom. She clutches a pair of new white trainers that were a present for her daughter.
In the first sentence, we discover that the narrator is telling the story to another character - the daughter - but the daughter is not there to hear it. This style of writing is sometimes called a
An extended speech performed by one person only
, because there is only one character speaking or thinking.
Her 15-year-old daughter has run away from home. The woman worries that her daughter may have to beg for food to survive, or that she has been forced to become a prostitute.
We are told there was an argument between the father and daughter. Bad language was used on both sides.
The doctor has signed the narrator off work; she is taking medication. The mother aims to pretend to the outside world that everything is okay, but fears her daughter may be dead, or at least living on the streets.
We learn more about the argument. The daughter is brought home drunk at 3am. The father calls her a 'dirty slut'.

218,7120,"Have a go at planning and writing your answer away from the computer, before coming back to check your answer against ours. To help you, print off the skeleton answer below and use it as a guide.
How does the relationship between Eddie and Catherine change during the first act of the play? Give reasons for your answer.
Explain the background to the relationship and show what the relationship is like at the start of the play.
Para 2 - The relationship at the start of the play
Discuss Eddie's reaction to Catherine's new skirt and her new job, and what this shows about his feelings for her.
You could also mention Beatrice's view of the relationship at his point - she gives us the first hints that Eddie is over-protective.
Para 3 - Impact of Rodolpho's arrival
Discuss how the arrival of Rodolpho immediately changes the state of Eddie's feelings for Catherine. As she becomes more attracted to Rodolpho, Eddie becomes more desperate to prevent his rival taking Catherine away from him.
Para 4 - Contrast Eddie's and Catherine's feelings for each other
Comment on the difference between Catherine's innocent fondness for Eddie and his shameful love for her. Give examples to show how we know what each of them is feeling.
You could also mention Alfieri's view of Eddie's love and how Alfieri understands it was impossible for Eddie to control.
Para 5 - Fight at end of Act I
Examine the fight at the end of Act I when Catherine makes it clear that she loves Rodolpho more than Eddie. How does this prepare us for Act II?
Look forward to what will happen in Act II. Briefly summarise how what we have learnt about the relationship so far prepares us for the fatal ending.

The basic units of genetic material inherited from our parents. A gene is a section of DNA which controls part of a cell's chemistry - particularly protein production.
in the same places. But there are different versions of the same gene.
Different versions of the same gene are called
, which is pronounced al-eels. For example, the gene for eye colour has an allele for blue eye colour and an allele for brown. For any gene, a person may have the same two alleles, or two different ones.
Alleles may be either recessive or dominant.
allele only shows if the individual has two copies of it. For example, the allele for blue eyes is recessive. You need two copies of this allele to have blue eyes.
allele always shows, even if the individual only has one copy of it. For example, the allele for brown eyes is dominant. You only need one copy of it to have brown eyes. Two copies will still give you brown eyes.
Individuals A and B have brown eyes - only individual C has blue eyes
Only individual C will have blue eyes, because the allele for blue eyes is recessive.
because, even though they have brown eyes, they still carry the allele for blues eyes and can pass this allele on to future generations.

221,3794,"Infectious diseases are caused by the transmission of pathogens, which are microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. Pathogens can be transmitted by direct contact - horizontal and vertical transmission - and by indirect contact - vehicle-borne transmission and vector-borne transmission.
Pathogens are microorganisms that cause infectious disease. Bacteria and viruses are the main pathogens.
Bacteria come in many shapes and sizes, but even the largest are only 10 micrometres long (10 millionths of a metre).
Bacteria are living cells and, in favourable conditions, can multiply rapidly. Once inside the body, they release poisons or toxins that make us feel ill.
Hepatitis C virus. DNA are enclosed in a protein coat.
Viruses are many times smaller than bacteria. They are among the smallest organisms known and consist of a fragment of genetic material inside a protective protein coat.
Viruses can only reproduce inside host cells, and they damage the cell when they do this. A virus can get inside a cell and, once there, take over and make hundreds of thousands of copies of itself. Eventually the virus copies fill the whole host cell and burst it open. The viruses are then passed out in the bloodstream, the airways, or by other routes.

222,6315,"You will usually be able to choose your own presentation topic, from a list provided by your teacher. It is important to pick a topic that allows you to show off your best level of language.
In this section - Personal and Social Life - it is tempting to choose to talk about your family, as it is a topic you know well, but simple descriptions of your family won't score you the highest marks.
You can afford to be ambitious in your choice of topic, as you can prepare your presentation in advance. So in this unit we are looking at the topic 'Special Occasions', which allows you to show off a high level of language, and knowledge about other cultures.
Many of the names of festivals such as 'Diwali' and 'Eid' are known by the same names in both English- and German-speaking countries.
Here are some example questions you should learn the answers to. See if you can finish off the sentences.
1 - What festivals and holidays do you celebrate in your family?
2 - Which festival is your favourite?
7 - What do you send and receive?
10 - What did you do last year?
11 - What will you do next year?
12 - What do you know about special occasions in German-speaking countries?

Read these short descriptions, given by Claudia, Eva, Michael and Lars, of where they live. Don't worry if you don't understand every word at this stage.
Ich wohne seit vierzehn Jahren in Herborn. Ich fahre oft nach Gieen, aber ich bin immer froh, wenn ich von der Uni wieder nach Hause fahren kann. Es gibt zwar nicht sehr viel zu tun, aber das macht mir nichts aus. Ich brauche nur meine Freunde anzurufen und in zehn Minuten sitzen wir zusammen in einer der vielen Kneipen in der Altstadt und reden miteinander. Und nachher kann ich einfach nach Hause laufen.
Ich wohne in einer Wohnung in Offenburg, etwa fnf Gehminuten vom Bahnhof. Es gefllt mir dort, denn ich kann morgens im Stadtpark joggen. Ich habe daran gedacht, nach Freiburg zu ziehen, weil es dort viel mehr zu tun gibt, besonders was Sport betrifft. Aber da so viele Leute dort studieren wollen, sind die Lebenskosten viel hher und ich muss ein paar Jahre warten, bis ich dahinziehen kann.
Ich wohne immer noch bei meinen Eltern in Spiesen-Elversberg. Das liegt am Waldrand, etwa fnf Kilometer sdlich von Neunkirchen. Es ist ganz schn ruhig hier und man kann sich gut vom Schulstress erholen, aber abends und am Wochenende wird es mir langweilig. Meine Eltern sind super und fahren mich nach Neunkirchen zum Kino und holen mich oft sehr spt ab. Ich freue mich schon auf nchstes Jahr. Bis dann habe ich hoffentlich meinen Fhrerschein. Dann htte ich vor allem in Saarbrcken eine grere Auswahl an Filmen.
Seit fnf Jahren wohne ich auf dem Lande. Frher habe ich in Berlin gewohnt. Klar hat das Spa gemacht, in einer Weltstadt zu wohnen. Aber ich denke jetzt nie daran und auf dem Bauernhof habe ich alles, was ich brauche. Das geht allerdings nicht ohne Wagen und Telefon, denn hier gibt es so gut wie keine ffentlichen Verkehrsmittel.
Wer ist das? Schreiben Sie den Namen, der am besten passt.
Eva finds it restful at home after school.
Living costs are too high in Freiburg for Michael to move there.
Lars moved from Berlin five years ago.

228,5417,"AO3 is all about experimenting - but you can't start on that until you've found a theme that inspires you. This Revision Bite should help you find subjects you can really go to town on.
You can get lots of ideas by making a spidergram, mindmap or flowchart. Don't stop until there's nothing left to write, however strange the connections you make!
Write the theme your teacher has given you in the middle of a piece of paper. Then just see what that theme makes you think about. Whatever it is, write it down, and then see what that makes you think about next. Just let each idea connect in some way with the next. Let your ideas flow. Don't worry that they might seem silly.
Have a look at Shreya and Kathy's spidergrams below for examples of the start of a spidergram - click on them to see a bigger version. (If you have Flash, click Magnify to see the detail - to remove the viewfinder just click Magnify again.)
Kathy's spidergram on the theme of food and drink
Go to the next page to follow on.
Now circle the best bits on the spidergram. Use these points as new headings, and try to make more spidergrams. Look below to see how Shreya has chosen to explore the idea of celebrations further.
If you'd been her, what would you have explored further?
Shreya's spider diagram developing the theme of Indian celebrations
- so put them in your work journal.
Now you've lots of ideas buzzing around, you can also write some notes in your work journal. Go to the next page to see how another student has done this.

229,3430,"Website designs vary from basic ones set up by users as a hobby to sophisticated designs that represent large international companies. Before designing a website, you should take a look at other websites to help you decide how your webpages should look.
You should also read the project brief carefully. Make sure you do exactly what the examiners want. There is no point in doing any more - if they say five pages, only do five pages.
Normally, on a website there is a title bar at the top, a menu on the left and then the main information appears in the big space on the right.
Stick to a simple, clear page layout
Try to avoid flashy things like sound, scrolling banners and animated text/graphics. These might look 'cool' to you, but, unless they are really suitable for the purpose and audience, they are more likely to lose you marks than earn you marks.
The examiners will be looking for a consistent house style throughout each publication you produce.
A good example of this can be seen on the BBC GCSE Bitesize website. GCSE Bitesize uses the same font, sizes and layout throughout the site. This gives a much more professional impression than constantly chopping and changing between different pages.
Ideally, you should come up with a few ideas for fonts, layouts and colour schemes and then test them on members of your target audience. Remember to include details of this testing when writing your reviews and evaluations. Always remember the publication has to appeal to your target audience!
Have consistent left-hand navigation on each page.
Don't have too much text on one page - people don't like scrolling down pages.
Break text up using bullet points, short paragraphs and tables. It's more difficult to read text on screen than it is on paper.
Keep graphics to a minimum. Graphics increase the page weight and increase the time pages take to download.
Take a look at the image below. It's a classic example of a badly designed website! Make sure you avoid using garish colours and patterned backgrounds.
Bright colours and poor quality photographs are not very attractive
Here are some important rules to stick to when writing text for a website:
Stick to a single font colour and size on your website. Try to stick to black text on a white or light-coloured background.
Arial size 12 is easy to read on websites. Try not to use a smaller sized font.
Remember the intended audience. Always test your website on users.
Do not use underlining on webpages. Users will think it is a hyperlink and get confused when it doesn't link to another website.
Keep it simple. Be consistent across the whole website.
Webpages need file names. This allows you and visitors to your website to identify each webpage.
There are several rules you need to stick to when naming webpage files.
Use correct file extension names, eg .htm .html or .shtml.
Do not use symbols, eg + & % in file names.
Do no put spaces in your file or folder name. Use either dashes (-) or underscores (_)
Name your files sensibly. Video_intro.shtml, video_movie.shtm are easier to identify than page1.shtml, page2.shtml etc.
Webpage file names should mean something to you and the user
Keep html, image, flash and other media files in separate folders.
Put images in a folder called images, put audio files in a folder called audio.
There should be an index.shtml file in the site folder.
Do not create folders that contain too many or too few files.
All screen-based publications are likely to need some images. The things to keep in mind when selecting images are:
For the current eportfolio, you are only allowed to use jpg, png, gif and tif. You may need to use a graphics package to convert the graphic to a suitable format.
If they are copyright images, you will actually lose marks for putting them in (you could email the person who holds the copyright, but this can take months to sort out).
If not, use a graphics package to re-size or crop them. Editing inside Powerpoint or a website package is likely to spoil the way the graphic appears.
Have you updated your list of sources?
Each time you add a graphic to a publication, you should update your list of sources.
Can you use some of your own graphics?
It's a good idea to create some graphics. This could be with a digital camera or by doing some original artwork on the computer.
How much memory do the graphics take up?
Remember your eportfolio has a maximum size so keep an eye on individual graphics to make sure they are not too big.
At all times, make sure the graphic is suitable for the intended audience and purpose.
Before creating a website, make sure you know the difference between relative and absolute links.
These point to where the file you want to link to is saved. For example, Jeff is saving his files on his school network. He has a file called intro.html for which the absolute link is:
Look at the image below to see the folders in which intro.html sits.
The problem with absolute links is that the examiner will not have access to your schools server. When your folder and files are copied across to the exam boards server, any absolute links will not work.
For example, Jeff hands in his folder called
to the examiner. In this folder is another folder called
. The examiner, therefore, has access to everything stored within the jeffd201 folder. Now look at the absolute link again - everything that has been handed into the examiner is in bold:
The part that is not in bold represents the school's server, which the examiner
Therefore, you must use relative hyperlinks (the part in bold) when linking your webpages together.
As you have read above, an example of a relative link in Jeff's folder is:
This hyperlink just describes where the file (intro.html) is relative to the current file  in this case, in a subfolder called webpages.
Relative links make it easier to type hyperlinks  youre less likely to make errors. Files can be moved from a local system (your school server) to another server (the examination board).
Remember that the examiner will not have access to your school server. Never refer to the server, or absolute address when you use hyperlinks.
Now look at the image below taken from the examiner's computer. Notice how Jeff's files and folders have been copied on to the exam board's server.
The absolute link for Jeff's file has now changed to:
But notice how the relative link is still the same:
It is crucial to thoroughly test your presentations and websites, as well as all the publications you produce.
First, check that all the links work. It is best to copy the website or presentation onto another device (like a memory stick or CD) and try it out away from the school network - this will show if you have used absolute hyperlinks by mistake. All the links must work before you submit your work for marking and moderation.
Secondly, test your publication with members of the target audience.
Listen carefully and improve your publication accordingly.
One good way of doing this is to prepare a checklist for the reviewer to fill in. Include questions like:
Was the information at the right level?
Finally, write the results of your tests in the review section of your eportfolio. Remember to say how well your publication meets the needs of the audience and include ideas on how it can be improved.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a computer language. HTML is used to make webpages. Many software packages such as Dreamweaver and Homesite allow you to build webpages and save them as html files.
The websites listed below offer HTML tutorials and advice for building your first website.
Practise your HTML in this online text editor with examples and tutorials.
This site is a bit patronising but is a good source of basic information
Images on websites can improve the look and style of the page. However, you must be careful to save images in the correct format.
The two main formats for web images are gif and jpg.
These are used for images that have only a few colours, such as line drawings, text and logos.
Images with few colours should be saved as a gif file
These are used for images or photographs that include details and more colours.
If you save a photo or graphic in the incorrect format, how the image looks will be affected. Look at the images below. When the fish photo is saved in a gif format, colours and details are lost.
When the bitesize graphic is saved incorrectly as a jpg, unwanted colours appear and the looks less sharp. Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Cropping allows you to select the part of the image you want to show. It's likely that you may take a photograph or find an image that is too big and you only want to use one part of the image.
To crop an image, you can use image editing software such as Word, Photoshop or Paintshop.
1. Crop this image to include only the penguin.
A penguin surrounded by a large area of pebbles and someone holding a bucket
2. Select the crop tool in a picture editing package.
3. Use the crop tool to outline the part of the image you want to keep. Adjust the size of the area to be cropped by dragging on the boxes on the selection border.

230,5139,"Most tasks allow you to write or talk about how language is used in the play. So imagine your title is: 'How does Beatrice change during the course of
?' There are all sorts of references you can make to language:
When we first meet Beatrice, she seems to be a clever, independent woman. She speaks openly, not waiting to be asked, and seems to like making fun of Benedick in particular. She compares him with ""a disease"", and her repartee makes even the messenger afraid of her. Throughout the play she uses puns, such as saying Claudio is ""civil as an orange"". This shows her witty nature, because she plays on the similarity between ""civil"" and ""Seville"": he is either polite or bitter (just like the oranges from Seville).
This combines much of what we have covered so far. It starts to answer the question without filling up the page with irrelevant facts, plot details and fancy technical terms. Remember, you do not have to tick off the language terms like a trainspotter. Instead, show you appreciate some of the techniques Shakespeare used, and the effects they have on his audience.

231,3552,"Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. Attitude can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
A good way to decide on the tone of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
Angrily, to show the poet's attitude to the fact that nothing has changed?
Or in a resigned way, as if he knows that it's almost too much to hope that things can change?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
Tatamkhulu Afrika wrote this about his poem:
Nothing's Changed is entirely autobiographical. I can't quite remember when I wrote this, but I think it must have been about 1990. District Six was a complete waste by then, and I hadn't been passing through it for a long time. But nothing has changed. Not only District Six... I mean, we may have a new constitution, we may have on the face of it a beautiful democracy, but the racism in this country is absolutely redolent. We try to pretend to the world that it does not exist, but it most certainly does, all day long, every day, shocking and saddening and terrible.
Look, I don't want to sound like a prophet of doom, because I don't feel like that at all. I am full of hope. But I won't see it in my lifetime. It's going to take a long time. I mean, in America it's taken all this time and it's still not gone... So it will change. But not quickly, not quickly at all.

233,5815,"W B Yeats: Song of the Old Mother
Yeats wrote a great deal about the passage of time, and of youth and beauty giving way to old age and death.
A central, unifying idea that runs through a text or performance.
. The poem contrasts two types of human endeavour: the young women's dreams of love and obsession with appearance; and the hard, grinding, thankless work that is the Old Mother's lot.
An interesting cross-current is set going by our uncertainty about who the young women are.
Are they the Old Mother's own children? If so, their idleness is easier to forgive. Perhaps in her youth the old woman herself dreamed of love, lay late in bed, and obsessed about whether her ribbons matched. Perhaps, as old people often do, she has forgotten what it's like to be young!
Or are they the children of the old woman's rich employers? If they are, we are more likely to view them as spoilt and selfish young people whose idle lives are made possible only by the drudgery of poor servants like the Old Mother.
And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress:
While I must work because I am old,
And the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold.'

: material service to other people, eg, giving money to charities or giving time to help people who are in need.
All of these must be done because a Sikh wants to serve

A place in Gods court can only be attained if we do service to others in this world Wandering ascetics, warriors, celibates, holy men, none of them can obtain moksha without performing sewa.

235,5968,"Calculating the interior and exterior angles of regular polygons
We already know how to find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon using the formula
We also know that all the interior angles of a regular polygon are equal.
Interior angle of a regular polygon = sum of interior angles  number of sides
Find the interior angle of a regular hexagon.
We know from the formula that the interior angles of a hexagon add up to 720.
As a hexagon has six sides, each angle is equal to
We know that the exterior angles of a regular polygon
add up to 360, so the exterior angle of a regular hexagon is
The interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle always add up to 180. (For a hexagon, 120 + 60 = 180.)
Calculate the exterior angle of a regular octagon, and write down the value of the interior angle.
The sum of the exterior and interior angles is 180, so the interior angle is 180 - 45 =

, it is useful to know something about the author and what may have inspired her story.
Michle Roberts was born in 1949 in London. She had a strict Catholic upbringing and, as she grew up, came to disagree with the way her religion viewed women. In an interview with the BBC World Service, she said:
""We had to be forgiven for being women before we even began to try to be good, we had to get over having the bodies we had. This really pushed me into wanting to write as a way of opposing what was very constricting, and actually painful, in my life.""
Her family disapproved of her writing. In particular, she had a troubled relationship with her mother, although in recent years she has become close to her again. Roberts explores mother/daughter relationships in much of her writing.

239,1147,"The human population is increasing rapidly. This is increasing the use of finite resources such as fossil fuels and minerals. As a result, the amount of waste and pollution is also on the rise. Certain species are endangered - if they are not helped, they are likely to become extinct.
for resources. Before the beginning of agriculture about 10,000 years ago, small groups of humans wandered across large areas, hunting and gathering just enough food to stay alive. Population numbers were kept low because of the difficulty of finding food.
The development of agriculture led to a population explosion that has accelerated enormously during the past 500 years. Unlike other species, humans can
Human population growth over the past 10,000 years
People in the developed world enjoy a high standard of living, with abundant food, cars and comfortable housing. People in the developing world have a lower standard of living, but many countries are catching up quickly.
The worlds human population has passed 6 billion and continues to increase. The growth in the human population and the increase in the standard of living are putting strains on the global environment. Here are some of the ways in which this is happening:
non-renewable energy resources, such as coal, oil and natural gas, are being used up rapidly
raw materials are being used up rapidly
A mountain of household and industrial rubbish
Pollution is the addition of substances to the environment that may be harmful to living organisms. Population growth and increases in the standard of living cause more waste to be produced. If this waste is not handled correctly, it leads to pollution. The most obvious form of pollution is often simply just litter on the ground, but pollution can affect the air and water too.
Most rubbish is buried in landfill sites and not all of it comprises safe materials. Even common household items can contain
such as poisonous metals. Many smoke alarms contain radioactive americium.
is also discharged onto the land. Many farmers apply
chemicals used to kill insects, weeds and micro-organisms that might damage crops
to improve their crops, but these can damage living things. Toxic chemicals can be washed from the land into rivers, lakes and seas.
Spilled crude oil causes a lot of harm to the environment, both sea and land
Water pollution is caused by the discharge of harmful substances into rivers, lakes and seas.

animals cannot survive in polluted water, so their presence or absence indicates the extent to which a body of water is polluted.
The most common source of air pollution is the combustion of
Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.
. This usually happens in vehicle engines and power stations.
Deposits soot on buildings and trees, causing them damage. Permeates the air, making it difficult for living creatures to breathe.
greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming
depletes ozone in the upper atmosphere, so damages the ozone layer
Lichens are plants that grow in exposed places such as rocks or tree bark. They need to be very good at absorbing water and nutrients to grow there, and rainwater contains just enough nutrients to keep them alive. Air pollutants dissolved in rainwater, especially sulfur dioxide, can damage lichens, and prevent them from growing. This makes lichens natural indicators of air pollution. For example:
leafy lichens can survive a small amount of air pollution
crusty lichens can survive in more polluted air
In places where no lichens are growing, it's often a sign that the air is heavily polluted with sulfur dioxide.
Individuals that are poorly adapted to their environment are less likely to survive and reproduce than those that are well adapted. Similarly, it is possible that a species that is poorly adapted to its environment will not survive and will become extinct.
Here are some of the factors that can cause a species to become extinct:
changes to the environment, such as a change in climate
since life on Earth began. Extinction is still happening and a lot of it occurs because of human activities. We compete with other living things for space, food and water, and we are very successful predators.
The dodo was a large flightless bird that lived on Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean. The island was uninhabited and the dodo had no natural predators. Then Mauritius was colonised by the Dutch in 1638. Dodos were
and easy to catch because they were not afraid of people. New competitors were brought onto the island, including pigs, cats and rats, which ate the dodos' eggs and their young. Within 80 years, the dodo was
The panda and gorilla are endangered, and may become extinct. Some species in Britain are endangered, too, including the red kite, red squirrel and osprey. They could be helped by measures such as:
legal protection and protection of their habitats
making artificial ecosystems for them to live in
These measures are difficult to implement when dealing with certain organisms, such as whales. These animals live in international waters, so international laws and agreements are needed to protect them.
Fish are an important part of the human diet, accounting for a worldwide average 15% of humans' protein intake. Most of these fish are caught wild, and if fish are caught at a faster rate than the remaining fish can reproduce, the stock of fish will obviously decline. Trying to harvest more fish than the sea can produce is an example of
an activity which uses up resources or damages the environment so that it cannot be continued in the future
Since the 1960s North Sea cod have been overfished, as more and more - and bigger - fishing boats caught more and more cod. At first, catches continued to increase each year. But then - surprise, surprise! - they started to decline, as there were not enough breeding fish left to maintain the cod population. Today, North Sea cod are in danger of extinction.
Humans have now been cutting down trees for around 10,000 years - for wood to burn or build with, or to clear land for farming.
Sustainable means using something or doing something in a way that minimises damage to the environment and which avoids using up natural resources, eg by using renewable rather than scarce resources.
as long as forests are allowed to replace themselves, or are replanted after harvesting - but often this is not done. The result is that the area of forest is steadily shrinking - a process called
Deforestation is the destroying of forests by cutting down trees (for timber) or by burning. Often the purpose is to make way for agricultural land.

causes soil erosion, as the soil-stabilising effect of tree roots is removed. Barren land and flooding can result
causes atmospheric pollution - mostly carbon dioxide - as forests are cleared by burning trees
reduces the amount of photosynthesising vegetation, thus further increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
The maps give an idea of how much of the Earth's forest has been lost in the last 10,000 years.
Particularly worrying is the rapid destruction of
. This type of forest is often referred to as 'the Earth's lungs' because it produces around 40% of the world's atmospheric oxygen. It is also home to an estimated 50% of all species on Earth - once lost, the original habitats can never be replaced. Tropical rainforest is being cut down at the rate of 17 - 20 million hectares a year.
Humans reduce the amount of land and resources available for plants and animals. This happens because of farming, quarrying, dumping waste and building.
Urbanisation means the growth of cities. About
half the worlds population live in cities
, and most of the population growth in the future is expected to take place in cities. It is predicted that by 2015,
the worlds six largest cities will each have more than 20 million inhabitants
. These are some of the effects of urbanisation:
land no longer used for food production
decline of rural towns and villages as people leave them to live in cities
means improving our quality of life without damaging the quality of life of future generations. It is important to all of us, not just the other inhabitants of the planet, that sustainable development is achieved. This involves each of us as individuals, and careful planning at local, regional and global levels.

Remember that when you make a point, you need to support it with a quotation and then explain exactly how the quotation highlights what you want to show.
At the start of the novel, we are told:
""Ralph and Jack smiled at each other with shy liking""
Yet by the end, they are mortal enemies. What happens to ruin their friendship?
Introduction - Discuss the quotation in the title. It occurs just after the first vote for chief in Chapter 1. What does it show about them?
Paragraph 1 - Look at Chapter 3, when Ralph builds huts while Jack hunts for pigs. What does it show about Ralph and Jack's priorities? Are they still together?
Paragraph 2 - Discuss what happens in Chapter 4 when Jack lets the fire go out when he goes hunting and a ship sails by. What impact does this have on the friendship?
Paragraph 3 - Examine how Jack undermines Ralph's authority more and more, such as when he rejects the law of the conch and other rules on the assembly in Chapter 5.
Paragraph 4 - Comment on Chapter 9, when Jack sets up his own tribe and Simon is killed in the 'dance'. What has happened to Ralph and Jack's relationship now?
Conclusion - By the end, Jack is in control of the fort and of all the boys. He wants Ralph dead. What does this show about the differences between the former friends?

242,2073,"Obviously designers have to think about what people want from a product. But consumer demand is a complex matter. Consumers are influenced by fashion, by public perceptions, by moral attitudes, and by changing lifestyles.
Product designers need to consider all these factors, as well as making sure the product conforms to current laws and standards.
Design is influenced by what people want, and what people want is affected by
. These influences come in the shape of current lifestyles and fashions, and the influence of design from other times and other cultures.
Market influences are partly caused by the fact that people want to have the same products as their friends. You and your friends will have similar interests, which designers have to understand if their products are to fit in with your lifestyle and sell well. Designers of mobile phones know that they have to design phones which will not only meet you and your friends' needs, but also make the right kind of 'design statement' about you the users.
At the same time, however, people want to be individuals, to stand out from the crowd, and express themselves by, for example, wearing clothes that look and feel unique. Designers need to understand this desire, otherwise their products will not sell.
Consumer choice is the idea that consumers should have a wide range of products to choose from, because different consumers will want different styles, different performance, and different prices when considering a purchase. Consumer choice is an influence on design, because designers need to know what their potential customers are looking for if they are going to design and make successful products.
Car manufacturers, for example, will design and make the same model of car in many slightly different versions, to suit individual drivers' different tastes.
Companies use market research to find out what people want. Interviews or questionnaires are used to gather people's views on the products they like, the functions and features they require, and the amount they would be prepared to pay. Sometimes the research is carefully focused on a particular group of people - eg women, people of a certain age-range or salary level - who have been identified as key potential consumers.
The results of the research are then passed on to the designer, whose job it is to design products which meet these consumer expectations. When designing your own products, you also need to do some basic market research to find out your potential users' requirements.
formal rules adopted by Parliament and enforced by government
guidelines or specifications which are widely agreed and commonly accepted, but do not necessarily have the force of law
exist to protect the consumer from faulty or sub-standard goods and services. There are a wide range of laws which can be enforced by
who work for local councils. These laws allow consumers to get their money back if goods are found to be faulty or if products do not perform in the way claimed by the manufacturer.
You need to know about the following three pieces of legislation:
This replaced the 1973 Fair Trading Act. Its most important provisions are:
control of monopolies (where a single business has a 25% share of the market or more, and is damaging competition)
control of mergers (where two or more companies join together, which might have adverse effects on competition and the public interest)
control of 'rogue traders' - giving the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) power to take action against businesses that persistently breach civil or criminal law when dealing with consumers
prohibiting the manufacture and supply of unsafe goods
making the person who manufactures or sells a defective product responsible for damage it causes
allowing local councils to seize unsafe goods and suspend the sale of suspected unsafe goods
prohibiting misleading price indications - eg, giving misleading information about discounts or sale prices
Makes it an offence for a trader to make false or misleading statements about goods or services. The Act carries criminal penalties and is enforced by local authorities' Trading Standards Officers. This Act makes it an offence for a trader to
apply a false trade description to any goods
supply or offer to supply any goods to which a false trade description has been applied
make certain kinds of false statement about the provision of any services, facilities or accommodation
UK products should be made to safety standards set by both the
. The BSI Kite Mark shows that a product has been made to British standards, while the CE mark shows that a product has been made to EC standards.
When designing your own product, you also need to ensure it will meet safety standards.
Product designers should also take into account
whenever they design or make a product. 'Moral issues' refers to any adverse impact the product might have on other people. 'Environmental issues' refers to any adverse impact the product might have on the environment. In practice, since people must live in the environment, it's difficult to separate these things out from each other.
The list below outlines some of the key moral and environmental questions a designer should ask themselves about their product.
Is the cost of the product justifiable?
Does the product make efficient use of natural resources?
Are there any waste products which could pollute the environment?

244,2508,"German 19th-century scholar, who founded Marxism (key theory of Communism).
People should contribute to the public wealth according to their ability, but receive according to their needs.
The means of production should be owned equally by the whole community (hence communism), not as in capitalism where individuals (who might be very rich) own the means of production and leave the rest of society to be poor and oppressed wage slaves.
A deterministic interpretation of history, which said that society must inevitably develop through successive stages of slavery, feudalism, then capitalism, ending up with the violent overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a communist society.
They should work to overthrow capitalism throughout the world by means of a revolution by the proletariat (workers).
Class was a feature of capitalist society, and should be destroyed and replaced by a society of equals.
The economy should be planned - controlled by the government.
Lenin changed Marx's ideas to add that a Communist government first had to be a dictatorship which was essential in order to bring in the communist state safely.

or atmosphere. Think about when you watch a sports match. When you are up close you can see the players sweating and hear the grunts as they immerse themselves in the game, which in turn arouses your interest. This also applies when capturing images, so focus on what you want to show, and
Photograph taken from a distance of a man talking on a mobile phone, and photo of the same person in close-up
As these images illustrate, getting in close allows you to see people's expressions.
Always remember when taking photographs of people to get their permission first.
To create interesting photographs, you need to fill the frame and minimise the amount of
, and there is no reason why you can't fill the frame with your focal point being taken as an extremely close-up shot. It will help you to capture emotion that wouldn't be detectable from far away.
Capturing action shots requires practise. You could practise capturing images of footballers in action, but make sure you have their permission first. Take
of pictures to see if you can capture a player making contact with the ball. With a digital camera you can take lots of pictures, view them on the LCD display, then delete any unwanted images. Some cameras have a function called
that allows you to take several photos in quick succession. This is great for taking action shots.

object/person in your photograph. Any more than one focal point looks cluttered. If your photograph is expansive - for example, a sweeping landscape - you can choose a tree or small cottage as your focal point.
Two images of a park - the first has too many focal points - a bench, trees, grass, people; the second has one clear focal point - a tree
There are too many focal points (people, trees, bench) in the first image shown above, whereas the second image shows the tree as the clear focal point.
Arrange your subjects to ensure you translate what you want the audience to focus on. Use
. Be selective. If your object is in front of a messy background, move it until you are satisfied with the shot.
Two photographs of an iron - one with a messy background and one with a plain background
In the first image above, the messy background takes the focus away from the iron.
Have you ever taken a picture of a landscape and been disappointed when you have not captured the beauty of it?
There are several reasons why the camera views something differently from the human eye. We have the ability to interpret an image and enhance it, because the brain has the ability to process lots of different things at a time. The camera has a limited focus range whereas the eye is constantly scanning the scenery, recomposing it, and responding to changes in light conditions. The eyes work in conjunction with the brain to create the splendid image that you can see. A camera has a much narrower exposure range than the human eye.
and capture an attractive feature following the rules of taking good digital images. Once again, take lots of photos to ensure you capture one that is perfect.
Photographs with the focal point exactly in the centre can lack depth and interest, so it's better to position your focal point
. To do this, apply the rule of thirds. Draw two horizontal and two vertical lines through the picture you want to capture, to divide it into thirds.
The eyes are naturally drawn to the
illustrated in red above, so place the important elements of your picture on one (or more) of these points.
Compare the two images above. A focal point placed in the centre (as in image 1, above) often just looks boring, so as a rule avoid placing your focal point in the centre. You will see this rule being applied in any magazine you look at.
that is used when the camera senses there isn't enough natural light. It's good to keep the flash on automatic, to make sure your photographs are illuminated well. You need to experiment with your flash, to work out its
. Generally, most flashes work up to 10 metres away - any further, and your subject is likely to appear dark.
Also think about natural light, especially outside. Try to make sure the sun/light source is
When photographing people, be aware that strong bright light will show up their wrinkles and blemishes, so you may need to adjust the light. Similarly, when taking photographs of landscapes, try to take them in the early morning or early evening because the light is softer then.
shots, so experiment with using your camera horizontally and vertically. A photograph of Nelson's Column, for example, would be ideal for a vertical shot to illustrate the towering effect the coloumn has on its surrounding scenery.
Nelson's Column is ideal for a vertical shot.
10. Know when to break the rules
Once you have mastered these rules, you can then begin to break them. With digital photography, it's easy to take lots of pictures, so don't be afraid to
. If you can create an unusual image, it's likely that people will be interested in it.

247,5727,"The poem is about the experience of crossing Westminster Bridge early in the morning and seeing the calmness and beauty of the city of London. The poem describes the city in a very positive way, communicating its power and 'splendour'.
Wordsworth suggests that the view of the city is a rival for anything naturally occurring: 'Earth has not anything to show more fair' is the opening line.
The use of the word 'smokeless' in line 8 gives the reader a clue about why this scene is so powerful. Under normal circumstances, the smoke from homes and factories would have obscured the view of the city; it is as if the speaker is experiencing the true beauty of the city for the first time.

248,1307,"You will need to use your Ideas about science to:
Distinguish questions that can be answered using a scientific approach from those that cannot. For example, science can answer the question, ""What are the chances of my child having cystic fibrosis?"". However, it cannot answer the question, ""Should I have my pregnancy terminated?""
State clearly what the issue in any debate is. For instance, in a debate about treating genetic diseases with gene therapy, some people think that altering our
The material inside the nucleus of cells, carrying genetic information. DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid.
is against nature or God. The ethical issue is whether scientists should be allowed to use
treating or preventing disease by introducing or replacing specific genes inside human cells
You will also need to summarise the different views that different people might hold. For example, if gene therapy saves lives, it can only be a good thing. Or, we should not use gene therapy because we do not know the long-term outcomes.
Identify arguments that are based on the right decision, ie a decision that produces the best outcome for most of the people involved. So, if a certain type of gene therapy involves a risk of causing harm, but 90 per cent of the people who have the therapy are cured, is it worth taking the risk?
Identify when certain actions are never justified because they are unnatural or wrong. For example, we could wipe out cystic fibrosis in one generation if we made sure that anyone who was a carrier was not allowed to have children. However, most people would consider this action to be immoral and wrong.
