A lagoon is an area of shallow water.
During some high tides, water floods the city. For hundreds of years, people have tried to keep water out of the city. Now a group of scientists has introduced a bold plan to prevent the city from flooding. And it means adding more water!
In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads.
Scientists say Venice is sinking about 1 1/2 inches each year. To save the city, scientists want to pump water into the ground through pipes. The team expects the water to expand the sand under Venice and raise the city.
Scientists behind the plan say the pipes will work. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnt done carefully.
Everyone, however, agrees that saving the city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose a tremendous part of [history],"" says Melissa Conn of Save Venice, a group that is working to save the city.
Venice is known as the City of Canals.

The Wiffle ball was invented in 1953. A few years later, the yellow plastic bat became part of the game.
A Connecticut man got the idea for the Wiffle ball after watching his son play ball with a friend. ""He decided he wanted to make a ball that would make it easier for us to pitch,"" said his son.
The Wiffle ball is hollow and has eight holes on one side. In the air, the ball dips and curves. That makes it hard for a batter to hit.
How did the ball get its name? When a kid swung at a ball and missed, kids used to say he or she had whiffed, said the inventor's grandson.

676,"Hours before giant waves pounded coastlines in South Asia, many animals started behaving strangely. In Sri Lanka, elephants trumpeted frantically and fled to higher ground. Bats and flamingos deserted low-lying areas. Many other animals escaped unharmed.
Wildlife experts are amazed that many animals survived the tsunami. The series of huge waves killed thousands of people in South Asia and East Africa about two months ago. Experts say animals might have sensed the approaching waves and moved to higher ground.
""I think animals can sense disaster. They know when things are happening in nature,"" said an official at the national wildlife department in Sri Lanka.
Elephants' sharp senses may have warned them about the tsunami.
Other stories of odd animal behavior before the tsunami have also surfaced. Giant waves flooded low-lying parts of Yala National Park in Sri Lanka, uprooting trees and killing hundreds of people. Wildlife officials reported, however, that few animals died. The park is home to hundreds of animals, including elephants, monkeys, leopards, tigers, deer, and water buffalo.
In Thailand, elephants carrying tourists from Japan bolted for the hills, and other elephants broke free of their chains. In one fishing village, nearly 1,000 locals escaped safely after birds squawked madly.
Although some animals in South Asia successfully fled to higher ground before the tsunami, other animals were not as lucky. Many dogs and other pets lost their owners in the tsunami and are homeless, sick, and without food or water. Cows, goats, and other farm animals are also roaming aimlessly. Many of those animals are drinking polluted water. Rescue groups have been sending animal food and
to the area. Veterinarians are doctors who care for animals.
Why might animals have known trouble was on the way? Forget special powers. Instead, experts say that animals have better senses of hearing, smell, and sight than humans do. Those sharp senses help warn animals when natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes, are about to happen.
""It doesn't surprise me that animals had an early warning of the tsunami,"" animal expert Michael Dee of the Los Angeles Zoo told
. ""The senses of certain species are far stronger than what any human has."" Dee points out that dogs, for example, have a stronger sense of smell than humans and that cats can see better in the dark than people.
Scientists say that animals might have felt the vibrations from the earthquake that set off the tsunami. In addition, many animals, including elephants, pigeons, and dogs, can also pick up
. That is a sound that is too low in pitch for humans to hear.
""Elephants can hear or feel other elephants grumble up to 2 miles away, so they probably felt the earthquake,"" said Dee. ""Their first
would be to move away from the direction of the sound."" An instinct is a natural, untaught behavior or reaction.
Before the tsunami struck, animals may have started to flee because they saw other creatures running. ""Animals take their cues from other animals,"" said Dee.
How animals sense danger has fascinated people for centuries. Most scientists are quick to point out, however, that nothing has ever been proven.
Will animal instincts be used to create a warning system about natural disasters anytime soon? ""I wouldn't count on [it],"" said Dee.
In the meantime, animals are helping out in other ways. For example, elephants are assisting in the cleanup of areas hit by the tsunami.
Scientists say that elephants can pick up vibrations from earthquakes through their broad feet.
Elephants' toenails are in the skin and not attached to the toes.
Elephants' soles have sensitive foot pads that detect vibrations, such as those from an earthquake. That signals elephants to move to more stable ground.
In what other ways might animals' sharp senses be helpful?

722,"Educators spread the word about slavery in the North.
Sojourner Truth is best known as an outspoken
someone who worked to end slavery. But what people may not know is that Truth was one of thousands of slaves in the United States who were bought, sold, and forced to do labor in the North.
""Many people are surprised when you talk about slavery in the North,"" Alan Singer, a professor of education at Hofstra University, told
""We associate slavery with the South, even though the biggest importer of slavesafter South Carolinawas New York City.""
Singer and other educators spread the word about slavery in the North. Although there were fewer slaves in the North than in the South, slavery flourished in New York City, northern New Jersey, rural Pennsylvania, and the shipping towns of Connecticut and Rhode Island. In 1771, slaves made up about 12 percent of the population of New York City.
Some slaves in the North were offered freedom to fight for the British during the Revolutionary War (17751783). However, slavery wasnt abolished in the United States until the end of the Civil War (18611865). New Jersey, for example, reported 18 slaves in 1860.
Singer explains that the slave trade helped support the
in many major Northern cities, such as Boston and New York City. The Industrial Revolution was a rapid change in the economy in the 1800s, when factories and powerdriven machines were introduced. Many U.S. businesses got their start with profits from the slave trade and slave-produced goods.
Singer tells students that the effects of slavery linger today through racial prejudice and discrimination. ""Kids see slavery as something that happened in the deep past. I want children to know that we still live with the effects of that slavery society.""
Isabella Baumfree (17971883) was born one of 13 children but never got to know her siblings because they were sold into slavery. She was emancipated, or freed, in 1828. In 1843, she changed her name to Sojourner Truth. She traveled throughout New England and the Midwest, speaking publicly against slavery and in favor of womens rights.

is a made-up tale that is often accepted as truth. Now an American scientist claims he has discovered the remains of Atlantis on the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.
According to the age-old myth, Atlantis was a place of great wealth. The ancient kingdom gleamed with gold and silver and was a center for art and learning.
Over time, the people there became corrupt and greedy. As punishment, the gods unleashed powerful earthquakes and floods that swallowed up Atlantis and sank it to the ocean floor.
The only account of this legendary lost land comes from the long-ago writings of Plato. He was an ancient Greek writer who lived about 2,500 years ago. People don't know how much of Plato's text is factual, because he wrote about an event that had happened 9,000 years before his time.
Robert Sarmast, the American scientist behind the recent claim, performed sonar tests of the Mediterranean seafloor. Sonar tests use sound waves to find underwater objects.
Sarmast believes that he has found Atlantis in the Mediterranean Sea, between Syria and Cyprus.
Sarmast says his tests revealed human-made walls and structures that matched Plato's description. ""If you compare [my findings to Plato's description], you will be astonished,"" Sarmast told reporters. ""We hope that future expeditions will bring back physical proof.""
A scientist from Germany says the newly found ruins are underwater volcanoes that spewed mud, not the remains of Atlantis. Other scientists say the only location for Atlantis was Plato's imagination.

Eleven-year-old Taylor Holley was standing in waist-deep water when a shark suddenly bit his leg, leaving a 2-inch gash.
Should humans be afraid of sharks, or should sharks be afraid of humans? Debate this issue.
The above incidents took place in Florida during October. After reading such stories, many people might think that they should not swim in Florida's waters. But shark experts say that would be an overreaction. As scary as they are, shark attacks are rare.
The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) says you are more likely to be hit by lightning than be bitten by one of the more than 350 shark species. In fact, each year about 500 people are hurt by lightning in the United States. In 1999, only 58 shark attacks occurred
Scientists say some species of sharks can live up to 50 years.
The largest shark, the whale shark, can be 50 feet long.
Shark skeletons have no bones. The skeleton is made of a tough substance called
Not all sharks are meat eaters. Basking sharks, for example, eat
, tiny plants and animals that float in water. As a result, basking sharks don't have teeth.
Shark Expert Rodney Fox explained, ""Sharks do not like humans; we are too bony. A lot of people who have been bitten by sharks have survived because the shark spat them out.""
One reason that shark attacks may seem more common than before is that more people are using shorelines for recreation, said George Burgess of ISAF.
Sharks that do bite humans have often mistaken people for other kinds of animals. For example, ISAF officials say sharks attack surfers wearing dark-colored wetsuits more often than they do anyone else. To a shark, the wetsuits make surfers look like seals, a favorite food.
Some shark experts say sharks should fear people, not the other way around.
One of the biggest threats to sharks, said Burgess, is
. Finning happens when a fisher catches a shark, cuts off its fins, and tosses the dead fish overboard. The fins are used to make delicacies such as shark fin soup.
Conservation groups are urging governments to protect sharks. During the summer, the U.S. House of Representatives acted to protect sharks when it passed a bill that could prevent finning in U.S. waters. In order for that bill to become law, the U.S. Senate has to pass it, and the president must sign it.
U.S. Rep. Randy Cunningham introduced the bill. ""We must end the harmful and wasteful practice of shark finning,"" Cunningham said.

521,"Hawaii is famous for its fiery volcanoes and rivers of lava. According to legend, those volcanoes were created by the goddess Pele, who made the fiery mountains by driving her digging stick into the ground.
Such legends are important to native Hawaiians. Today, however, ancient gods are a part of a fiery debate in this land of spirits.
Mauna Kea is an extinct, or dead, volcano on the island of Hawaii. According to an ancient Hawaiian saying, Mauna Kea ""is the astonishing mountain that stands in the calm."" These days the 13,700-foot-high peak is anything but calm.
, scientists who study space, say the mountain peak is a perfect spot to place telescopes.
Currently, scientists use 13 telescopes in a special 11,000-acre area called the Science Reserve on Mauna Kea. Using those telescopes, scientists have made several important astronomical discoveries. The scientists who use the telescopes pay a fee to the University of Hawaii, which built the observatories.
The use of the mountain for scientific research, however, is the source of a debate between scientists and some native Hawaiians. Some Hawaiians believe that the top of Mauna Kea is sacred, or an important place to their religion. They believe that the peak is the home of the snow goddess Poli'ahu.
According to officials at the Center for Hawaiian Studies, the university is making money from the site without sharing much of the money with native Hawaiians.
""We don't get a penny from Mauna Kea, and it's our land,"" said Jon Osorio, of the Center for Hawaiian Studies.
University officials say that a master plan, completed in June, addresses native Hawaiian concerns. The goals of the plan include educating people about Mauna Kea. It also states how many telescopes the university can build in the future.
According to observers, the debate will not end soon. A 1968 agreement gives the university control of the area until 2033. Until then, native Hawaiians will fight for what is theirs while scientists keep studying the skies.

Over the next 100 years, more foreigners, including Americans, arrived on the islands. A struggle for power ended in 1893 when American plantation owners helped overthrow Queen Liliuokalani. By 1900, Hawaii had officially become a U.S. territory. A

Collectible coins and currency worth about $1 billion were on display at the World's Fair of Money. The fair was held this August in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
During the five-day event, money was displayed for looking at, buying, and selling. Some coins were worth as little as half a cent. Other coins were worth millions.
The event drew thousands of coin lovers from around the world. That's not surprising--coin collecting is one of the world's most popular hobbies.
, or a way to make money in the future. Most collectors, however, are not in it for the money. They participate in the hobby because of each coin's story. One coin expert referred to money as ""history that you can hold in your hand.""
Among the fair's most valuable coins were two Liberty Head nickels. The nickels were worth between $2 million and $3 million each.
A 1794 coin couldn't be missed at the fair either. Experts say the coin, believed to be the first silver dollar in the United States, is worth about $10 million.
Coin hobbyists point out that just because a coin is old doesn't necessarily mean it's valuable. A coin's worth depends on how many exist, on how many people want it, and on its condition.
Coin collectors are used to paying more for a coin than its original value. They say their hobby is worth every penny.
Each day, the government prints 37 million bills, worth about $696 million.
About 18 tons of ink per day go into printing those bills.
If you had $10 billion and you spent $1 every second of every day, you would go broke in 317 years.

The fourth grader swam the 1.4 miles between Alcatraz Island and San Francisco in just less than two hours. He swam to raise money for Hurricane Katrina victims.
Although Johnny trained for three months, the water was colder and wavier than he had expected. Johnny made it to the shore by telling himself, ""Im almost there. Im almost there.""
His classmates were waiting on shore, cheering ""Go, Johnny! Go, Johnny!"" When he came out of the chilly water, his father hugged him and said, ""Can you believe it? You did it!""
Johnny successfully made the trek that Alcatraz prisoners had dared to cross years ago. Alcatraz Island housed a prison from 1934 to 1963. In 1962, three prisoners escaped by swimming across the bay. They were never heard from again, so it remains a mystery whether they made it through the frigid waters to land.
Johnny didnt only raise more than $30,000 for his swim. He also reportedly became the youngest person to swim the distance from Alcatraz to San Francisco.

413,"Assur was once one of the greatest cities in the world. About 30,000 people lived there. A huge temple tower, or ziggurat, stood about 200 feet above the city streets. Assur (or Ashur) was one of the leading cities of Assyria, the center of a great empire.
Today, ancient Assur is in ruins. Desert sand has covered over much of the 3,500-year-old city. Now Assur faces a new threat: water.
Assur is located in what is now Iraq, a country in the Middle East. Many parts of Iraq are covered by desert. Water is hard to find in the desert areas. To increase the amount of water, Iraqi officials are building a dam on the river Tigris.
The dam will trap the river's water. As the water rises, it might flood Assur and many other nearby ancient ruins.
Scientists worry that floodwaters will destroy artifacts hidden beneath the desert sand. Assur has already been the site of some amazing discoveries.
Scientists recently discovered four hidden tombs at Assur. They found ancient coffins, gold, jewelry, and gems. They also dug up the remains of two ancient Assurian queens.
Scientists used modern medical equipment to study the queens' bodies. They learned about some of the medical problems the ancient queens suffered from. The bodies showed evidence of dental cavities, sinus infections, and poor nutrition.
Michael Mller-Karpe, a scientist who studies ancient Assyria, said, ""The Assyrian queens have just begun to speak to us, and we are looking forward to more answers.""
Mller-Karpe and other scientists worry that the new dam may keep them from getting more answers. Even if the new dam doesn't flood Assur, the rising water could damage the ancient city. Moisture could cause the artifacts to crumble.
""You can't save Assur if it's [near] a dam,"" said scientist Peter Miglus. The soil beneath the ancient city would soak up water like a sponge. The water in the soil would destroy what's left of ancient Assur.
For now, scientists are scrambling to uncover the secrets hidden for centuries in Assur and other nearby communities. Meanwhile, some people are looking for ways to save the ancient cities. ""We don't want the slightest damage to Assur,"" one Iraqi official said.

The Mercury missions were the first attempts by NASA, the U.S. space agency, to send a human into space. The rocket missions took place from 1961 to 1963. During the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union competed to build the best space program. That period was called the space race.

What was the purpose of this mission?
NASA wanted to send a man into orbit and back safely. His name was Alan B. Shepard Jr.

During the 1950s, the law in the South prevented black
people from having the same rights as white people. At that time, the South was
by law. Black people were forced to sit in the back of public buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, drinking fountains, and other public facilities.
Those laws made Rosa Parks angry. She was a well-known leader in the African American community of Montgomery, Alabama. For years, Rosa Parks had stood up to unfair laws against African Americans. She worked courageously with other African American leaders to change them. She also was one of the first women in Montgomery to join the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to fight for
, or equal rights under the law.
Rosa Parks had refused to move from her seat on city buses in the past. Drivers simply forced her off the bus. But 50 years ago, on December 1, 1955, her action changed history. She refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person and was arrested. Her arrest led to the Montgomery
. During the yearlong boycott, African Americans refused to ride public buses. As a result of the boycott and Rosa Parks's courage, the law was changed to provide equal seating on buses. It marked the beginning of the struggle to end segregation.
SCENE 1: Downtown Montgomery, Alabama, December 1, 1955
Rosa Parks, 42, boards a city bus on her way home from work as a seamstress.
At the time, buses are divided into two sections. The section at the front of the bus is for whites only. The section for black people begins five to 10 rows back. Holding her head high, Rosa Parks sits down in the first row of the ""colored"" section.
After the bus grinds to a stop, a few white people get on. They quickly fill the empty seats in the ""whites-only"" section. One white man is left standing. According to a city law, black people are to give up their seats in the colored section if no seats remain in the white section.
There are white people who want to sit down.
You know white people and black people can't sit in the same row. Are you going to stand up?
Then I'm going to have you arrested.
A few minutes later, two police officers board the bus and walk toward Rosa Parks.
Did the driver tell you to stand?
Why do you all push us around?
I don't know, but the law is the law, and you're under arrest.
SCENE 2: Rosa Parks's house, that night
Rosa Parks is released from jail on bail that day. She and other Montgomery civil rights leaders meet at her house to discuss the bus boycott.
For years, civil rights leaders have been planning a bus boycott to fight segregation. They are waiting for the right time and the right leader to spark the boycottand Rosa Parks is that person. They know Rosa Parks has the courage to stand up to segregation. Because most of Montgomery's bus riders are black, the bus companies will lose money if black people refuse to ride the buses.
I know one thing, I will never, ever ride another segregated bus againeven if it means I have to walk to work.
You have to stand up for what you believe in.
Rosa, how would you feel about making your arrest a test case against segregation? We may be able to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.
I don't like being in the spotlight, and I don't want to put my family in danger.
Rosa, this may be our best chance to fight segregation laws.
Good. In the meantime, we're going to boycott the buses.
The next day, community leaders meet to discuss the boycott. At their request, Martin Luther King Jr. agrees to lead it.
SCENE 3: Montgomery courthouse, a few days later
Rosa Parks approaches the courthouse steps with her husband for her trial.
The steps of the courthouse are packed with people. Some bystanders threaten Rosa Parks. Others shout their support.
Your place is in the back of the bus, lady!
Oh, she's so sweet. They've messed with the wrong one now!
After Rosa Parks and her husband manage to push their way into the courtroom, the trial begins. The bus driver takes the stand.
I politely asked her to move to the back, which is required by city law. She refused to listen.
Rosa Parks is not called to the stand. Instead, her lawyers speak on her behalf.
I find Rosa Parks guilty of violating the city law. She must pay a $10 fine plus $4 in court costs.
The crowd of supporters in the courtroom reacts angrily to the verdict.
You haven't heard the last from us.
Despite the boos from supporters, the guilty verdict was exactly what Rosa Parks and her lawyers wanted. Their case eventually made it to the nation's highest courtthe Supreme Court.
Montgomery's black community continued to boycott the buses. On November 13, 1956, their efforts finally paid off. The Supreme Court ruled that Alabama's segregated buses were against the law. After more than a year, the boycott ended.
At the urging of photographers, Rosa Parks boarded a bus on December 20. This time, she sat in the front seat. (See the cover.)

Suppose you were in the middle of nowhere, and there were no signs or landmarks to help you find your way. Would you know how to find your way home? Someone might tell you via phone or radio to 'walk to your left', or 'turn through 60 and then start walking', but how would they know which way you were pointing in the first place?
One way of describing direction from a point is to use
A compass always points north. Bearings are measured from the
So when someone tells you to walk on a bearing of 120, you should face north, turn clockwise through 120 and start walking.

Complete the following table. The data shows the scores in two tests, English and Maths, across a set of ten students.
In order to see this content you need to have both
If you were to compare the scores in the two subjects, English and Maths, which measure of average would you use and why?
The range of scores in English (37) is far greater than that in the Maths (4).
The mean score in each subject is 78 which implies that the scores of the students are more-or-less identical in English and Maths. But looking at the actual scores, you can see that this is not the case.
If you compare the medians (71 and 78), you might assume that the students generally scored less in English, (which is partly true, but there are also some much higher scores there too).
If you just state the modal score for each subject (101 and 78), you have no information about the scores of the other students.
So, which is best? It seems that to give maximum information,
a combination of the median and the range would be best.
So, in summary, English has a median score of 71 and a range of 37, and Maths has a median score of 78 and a range of 4.

154,"> Inform, explain and describe - Describing
When you describe, you need to give lots of detail and make the words interesting for others to read. For example, if you wanted to describe your home, you wouldn't just write lots of facts, like this:
My house was built in 1972 of red brick with a pitched concrete tiled roof. The house was extended in 2003 with a small UPVC conservatory and an adjoining patio area of approximately 8 square metres...
This gives lots of facts, but these are the types of facts that someone buying a house might need. Most people would find a description like this boring. So what should you do?
The first thing is to think about what you want to show other people. Do you want to concentrate on the roof tiles or the types of bricks used? Or do you want to tell them about the fence panel your brother broke when he was chasing you last summer?
You could also write about the time Stephanie threw a tennis ball and it got stuck in the guttering - it's still there - and when it rains really hard the gutter overflows. You might even have a gnome in the front garden, which your grandad bought - it looks stupid, but you won't move it in case you offend him.
Each of these details is far more interesting than roof tiles or measurements. So, when you are describing something, think of drawing a picture or taking a photograph. You focus on a certain point, write a paragraph about it, then move to the next point and the next.

Variation and classification - Inherited & environmental
Some variation within a species is inherited, and some variation is due to the environment.
Variation in a characteristic that is a result of genetic inheritance from the parents is called
Children usually look a little like their father, and a little like their mother, but they will not be identical to either of their parents. This is because they get half of their inherited features from each parent.
Each egg cell and each sperm cell contains half of the
needed for an individual. When these join at fertilisation a new cell is formed with all the genetic information needed for an individual.
Here are some examples of inherited variation in humans:
Gender is inherited variation too, because whether you are male or female is a result of the genes you inherited from your parents.
Characteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle. For example, if you eat too much you will become heavier, and if you eat too little you will become lighter. A plant in the shade of a big tree will will grow taller as it tries to reach more light.
Variation caused by the surroundings is called
. Here are some other examples of features that show environmental variation:
flower colour in hydrangeas - these plants produce blue flowers in acidic soil and pink flowers in alkaline soil.
Some features vary because of a mixture of inherited causes and environmental causes. For example, identical twins inherit exactly the same features from their parents. But if you take a pair of twins, and twin 'A' is given more to eat than twin 'B', twin 'A' is likely to end up heavier.

as they orbit the Sun. It takes the Earth 24 hours to make one complete turn on its axis, so an Earth day is 24 hours long.
Different planets take different amounts of time to make one complete turn, so they have different lengths of day.
The Sun lights up one half of the Earth, and the other half is in shadow. As the Earth spins we move from shadow to light and back to shadow and so on. It is daytime in the UK when our part of the planet is in the lit by the Sun. And it is night-time in the UK when our part of the planet is facing away from the Sun.
During the day, the Sun appears to move through the sky. Remember that this happens because the Earth is spinning on its axis. In the UK if we look south and follow the path of Sun in the sky during the day, it looks like this:
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west
. That's because the Earth is spinning towards to the east, so we see the Sun first appear there at the start of the day. The Sun 'rises' in the east and 'sets' in the west.
One way to remember which way the Earth turns is to remember ""
"", which means the Earth spins from west to east.

Measures of average - Mean and modal class
Calculating the mean and modal class for grouped data is very similar to finding the mean from an ungrouped frequency table, except that you do not have all the information about the data within the groups so can only estimate the mean.
This table shows the weights of children in a class.
To estimate the mean weight, you know that 7 children are between 30kg and 40kg, but you don't know exactly how much they weigh, so assume that they all weigh 35kg (the midpoint of the group).
Do the same for all the other groups:
a) Estimate of mean = 1215  25 =

This is the general word equation for the reaction:
The salt produced depends upon the metal and the acid. Here are two examples:
It doesn't matter which metal or acid is used, if there is a reaction we always get hydrogen gas as well as the salt.
There is a simple laboratory test to see if a gas is hydrogen. A lighted wooden splint goes pop if it is put into a test tube of hydrogen. This is because the flame ignites the hydrogen, which burns explosively to make a loud sound.
All acids contain hydrogen atoms. Apart from hydrochloric acid, this is not clear from their names, but you can tell they contain hydrogen from their chemical formulae. Remember that the chemical symbol for hydrogen is H.

391,"The final thing to remember is there are lots of ways of answering the same question. You don't have to follow a set plan, or include things in a fixed order. It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters, dramatic effects, themes and language. Stick to what is relevant and don't be afraid to put a personal reaction in as well - it shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied ideas you have heard.
So, imagine our task is 'How is the theme of ambition dealt with in
?'. There are all sorts of ways of answering this - one answer might start with different aspects of ambition, another answer with the language of ambition and another with the dramatic effects created. However, try to plan the start of an answer using the character of Macbeth as the focus. Once you've done that, compare your ideas with the answer below.
'How is the theme of ambition dealt with in
One of the main themes in Macbeth is ambition and from the start we can see just how tempted Macbeth is at the thought of becoming king. He recognises his 'black and deep desires' but writes to tell his wife at length and is increasingly torn by a 'suggestion' that killing Duncan will make the witches' predictions come true.
Macbeth recognises where ambition can lead and the contrast between what he thinks he should do, and his inner thoughts. His language reflects this, using antithesis such as 'heaven or to hell'. In fact, his very first words are 'So fair and foul a day'. This repeats what the witches have been saying and it would be obvious to an audience in Shakespeare's day that Macbeth is already associated with the evil the witches represent.
There are many approaches you can take to the same question. This is only the start of the task and there is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction because it keeps to the point as well as using a range of relevant details combined with personal thoughts.

Silica, which is found in sand, has a similar structure to diamond. It is also hard and has a high melting point, but contains silicon and oxygen atoms, instead of carbon atoms.

3857,"We often use formulas without even noticing. For example, we might convert miles to km by multiplying by 1.6, or find the circumference of a circle by multiplying pi by the diameter.
km = 1.6 x miles is an example of a formula.
We have already seen that km = 1.6 x miles and C =
 d are examples of formulas. There are many others that we use regularly in other subjects. Sometimes we have to construct our own formula:
A taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00. Write down a formula for the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles.
Travelling 1 mile would cost 2 + 50p.
Travelling 2 miles would cost 2 + 2 x 50p.
Travelling 3 miles would cost 2 + 3 x 50p.
So travelling for 'n' miles will cost 2 + n x 50p.
The formula is C = 2 + (n x 50p)
A rectangle has a width of x and a length of 2x.
Write down a formula for the perimeter (P) in terms of x.
P = 2x + x + 2x + x
Did you remember to include all 4 sides?
To recap, the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles, when a taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00 is:-
C = 2 + (n x 50p)
To find the cost of the taxi for a journey of 20 miles, replace 'n' with 20.
C = 2 + (20 x 50p)
What is the cost of hiring this taxi for 16 miles?
Remember that C = 2 + (16 x 50p)
The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.

1568,"There are four main stages in setting up a new computer system: Analysis - studying the problem; design - designing a solution; implementation - putting the solution into effect and testing it; evaluation - checking that the solution is working as intended. This process is often called systems analysis.
Developing and activating a new computer system is a long process. It is important to break the process down into smaller stages, each one requiring a different set of professional skills.
An important part of this process is the first stage -
. During this stage the systems analyst will investigate how the current system works and what needs to be improved. This involves finding out whether a new computer system is needed at all and exactly what it will be used for.
Analysis is all about looking at how a job is done at present and seeing if the job could be done better or more efficiently by upgrading or developing a new system.
With this goal in mind, the systems analyst might:
a step by step guide, eg a guide to using a piece of software including instructions, example scenarios and screenshots
and any printouts the current system creates
Having investigated the present system, the systems analyst will produce a
. This will look at whether the new system is:
- is the new system technically possible to implement in the time available?
- will the cost of the new system be offset by savings once it is implemented, ie will it save the organisation time, money or increase its performance?
The project will only continue to the next stage if the answer to both of these questions is yes. At this point the decision makers in the organisation, eg the board of directors, decide whether or not to go ahead.
The next step is to draw up a
that outlines exactly what the new system will do. For example, it will mention:
a general term used to describe an application or a program
the term denoting either an entrance or changes which are inserted into a system and which activate/modify a process
the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process
A test plan will be included in the design phase to explain exactly how the new system will be tested and the expected outcomes for each test.
a general term used to describe an application or a program
is usually very complex. Any mistakes made by the designers or programmer can have a dramatic effect depending on what the software is used for.
Usually software is tested with three distinct types of
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
 this is normal data the system should be working with.
 this is data at the boundary between typical data and invalid data.
Invalid data (sometimes known as erroneous data)
 this is data that should cause the system to tell the user that there is a problem with data entered into the system.
Testing helps to ensure that the system always acts as expected.
Implementation is the next stage of developing a new system, after design. This is where the new system is created and installed.
a list of instructions written in a programming language
a general term used to describe an application or a program
a resource - for example, a collection of documents containing all the information a user needs to know about using and getting support with a piece of software
testing the system using the test plan
If the tests are not satisfactory then any problems will need to be corrected and the system tested again.
User documentation will be written to help staff become familiar with the new system. It will include:
a step by step guide, eg a guide to using a piece of software including instructions, example scenarios and screenshots
the term denoting either an entrance or changes which are inserted into a system and which activate/modify a process
the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process
taking a screen shot of what's displayed on screen and saving it in an image file, eg as a *.jpg, *.bmp or *.gif
details of what error messages mean, ie troubleshooting advice
When the system is ready to go on-line there are different ways of moving from the old to the new system:
Running both the old and new system until you are certain the new system is working correctly. Parallel running is likely to be the most expensive as it involves doing the work twice for a period of time. However, it is the safest. If there are any bugs in the new system, you can always go back to the old system while the problems are corrected.
Changing over in a small part of the company to start with. Only when the system is deemed satisfactory will it be rolled out to the rest of the organisation. A supermarket introducing a new 'self-scanning' system might choose to introduce it in two or three stores at first. This is a pilot changeover.
The old system is scrapped and immediately replaced by the new system. With this option there is a danger that there may still be problems with the new system. Even though it is the most risky type of changeover, many companies use this method.
The change over is split into phases or stages. Each stage is introduced one at a time and the old system is kept running to do the remainder of the tasks that have not yet been changed.
Once the system has been installed it will be monitored to check whether it is working correctly. Sometimes problems with a system will not be found until it is being used by a large number of people or an unusual situation occurs.
Evaluation is really re-analysing - starting the same systems analysis process all over again. Many of the same techniques can be used, such as interviewing staff or sending out questionnaires.
Once a system is running correctly it can still need maintenance. This may be because a bug is found or because the company needs a new feature.

A hindu funeral on the River Ganges
In India people hope to have their funeral at the burning ghats on the shores of the sacred river Ganga (Ganges). Here the body is placed on a large pile of wood, then the eldest son says the appropriate Vedic prayers and lights the fire. Incense and ghee (cooked and clarified butter) are poured into the flames.
Prayers are said for the dead person:
O Supreme light, lead us from untruth to truth, from darkness to light and from death to immortality.
Afterwards the ashes of the deceased are sprinkled on water. Many people take the ashes to India to put on the waters of the Ganga; others may take them to the sea near to where they live.

Human gestation is around 40 weeks although infants can survive if born earlier than this. Other mammals have different gestation times depending on their size, the number of offspring and how independent they are when born. Large animals with a small number of independent offspring have the longest gestation.
When humans are born, their heads are relatively large, and their legs relatively short. Through childhood their bodies grow faster than their heads until they reach maturity. To check that development is happening at normal rates, infants regularly have their mass and head circumference measured.

A state (or a country) where the government provides welfare benefits such as education, health care, and unemployment payment to its population free at the point of use, although paid for by general taxation.
, but why did the Liberal government introduce its reforms?
Some governments in history seem to have implemented changes that have particularly improved people's lives. For instance, Roosevelt's New Deal in America, or the Labour government in Britain after the First World War. The dynamism and positive achievements of these governments make them look much better than the governments that came before or after them.
A study of poverty in 1901 by Seebohm Rowntree found that in a society where those who didn't work didn't eat, there were three times in people's lives when they were especially vulnerable:
After 1906, the Liberal government, with Lloyd George as Chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced reforms to help these three groups:

) of 7s 6d a week for 15 weeks in return for a payment of 2d a week.
1906 - the Trades Disputes Act ruled that unions were not liable for damages because of strikes.
1906 - the Workers Compensation Act granted compensation for injury at work.
1910 - half-day a week off for shop workers.
A Merchant Shipping Act improved conditions for sailors.
From 1911, MPs were paid. This gave working men the opportunity to stand for election.
Why did the Liberal government introduce these reforms?
in 1901 found that 28 per cent of the population did not have the minimum to live on at some time of their life.
- when Britain went to war in 1899, the army found that two-thirds of the men who volunteered for the army were unfit to join up.

- to pay for the reforms, Lloyd George's 1909 budget raised duties on tobacco and spirits, raised income tax by 16 per cent (from 1s to 1s 2d), and introduced a new 20 per cent tax on profits from selling land.
When the House of Lords refused to pass Lloyd George's budget, the House of Commons passed an Act stating that the House of Lords could not reject a bill that had been passed three times in the House of Commons. It also required a general election every five, not seven, years.
Lloyd George became loved - old people cried when they got their pension and blessed 'Lord George' who gave them - and hated - workers who objected to paying national insurance chanted: 'Taffy was a Welshman, taffy was a thief' at him.

Loneliness and Dreams in Of Mice and Men
George is not lonely during the novel, as he has Lennie. He will be lonely afterwards, without his best friend.
George and Lennie share a dream - to own a little patch of land and live on it in freedom. He is so set on the idea that he even knows of some land that he thinks they could buy.
Lennie is the only character who is innocent enough not to fear loneliness, but he is angry when Crooks suggests George won't come back to him.
George and Lennie share a dream - to own a little patch of land and live on it in freedom. Lennie's main desire is to tend the soft-haired rabbits they will keep.
She is married to a man she doesn't love and who doesn't love her. There are no other women on the ranch and she has nothing to do. She tries to befriend the men by hanging round the bunkhouse.
She dreams of being a movie star. Her hopes were raised by a man who claimed he would take her to Hollywood, but when she didn't receive a letter from him, she married Curley.
When Candy's ancient, ill dog was shot, Candy has nothing left. He delayed killing the dog, even though he knew deep down that it was the best thing, as he dreaded losing his long-time companion.
Candy joins George and Lennie's plan of owning a piece of land. His savings make the dream actually possible to achieve.
Crooks lives in enforced solitude, away from the other men. He is bitter about being a back-busted nigger. He is thrilled when Lennie and Candy come into his room and are his companions for a night.
Crooks dreams of being seen as equal to everyone else. He knows his civil rights. He remembers fondly his childhood, when he played with white children who came to his family's chicken ranch, and longs for a similar relationship with white people again.
