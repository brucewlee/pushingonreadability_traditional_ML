Dogs helped locate people injured in wars. When specially trained dogs brought a soldier's helmet to rescue workers, they knew the soldier needed help. Dogs also carried messages and supplies during wars.
The Hartsdale Pet Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York, built a memorial to war dogs in 1923. Since then, the cemetery has held a special ceremony each Memorial Day to honor the dogs.

Why is it important that your helmet fit well? If it does not fit, it wont protect your head. To work properly, a helmet should be straight on your head and fit snugly. If a helmet is too loose, it can slip to one side.
Riding a bike is a lot of fun, but remember that safety comes first, says Dr. Jamie Freishtat. She is a childrens doctor and a spokesperson for Safe Kids. The group works to prevent childhood injuries. Wear an approved bike helmet that fits properly every single time you get on your bike. Remember this rule: No helmet, no bike.

Smoke alarms save lives. Have an alarm inside and outside each bedroom. You should also have a smoke alarm on every level of the home. Push the test button at least once a month. That will let you know whether the alarm is working.
Fire can spread quickly. Every family needs to be prepared. How? Have a home fire escape plan. Draw the plan and talk about it. The drawing should show two ways out of each room. Those may be doors or windows. Then practice the plan twice a year. Practice during the day and at night.
Choose a safe place outside where everyone will meet. Get out and stay out! Never go back inside a burning building.
Once you are outside, dial 9-1-1 or the number for your fire department.

Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.

Very little is known about Pluto, currently the farthest planet from the sun. The tiny planet is one-sixth the size of Earth.

visited the Westcoast Ostrich Show Ranch near Cape Town, South Africa. South Africa is a country in Africa.
Ostriches are the world's biggest birds. They have plump, round bodies covered with feathers, and long, skinny necks covered with soft fluff. Male ostriches weigh up to 350 pounds and can grow up to 8 feet tall. That's a foot taller than basketball player Shaquille O'Neal!
Ostriches don't fly. Instead, they use their wings to attract mates, alert other ostriches to danger, and keep their balance. Being stuck on the ground doesn't slow ostriches down, though. They can run as fast as a car can travel--up to 50 miles an hour for about 30 minutes.
At the farm in South Africa, the ostriches roam an area of flat land almost the size of 200 football fields. The workers at the farm take care of the ostrich eggs--the biggest of all bird eggs. At almost 3 pounds, each egg is about the size of a football. Even though an ostrich egg looks fragile, it is very strong. You could put a 300-pound weight on the egg without cracking its shell. Believe it or not, even a baby elephant could sit on an ostrich egg!

During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote the poem that later became the national anthem.
On September 13, 1814, Key watched British ships bomb Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. The next morning, he spotted the American flag still flying over the fort. The sight inspired him to write the poem. In 1931, Congress made it the national anthem.
Here is the first verse of the four-verse song:

The Vikings were pirates and warriors, known for their sea faring voyages. From the late 700s to 1100, the Vikings lived in Scandinavia. That region of Europe includes the present-day countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
Viking sailors spread fear throughout Europe. They raided and conquered coastal villages in Europe and along the Mediterranean coast. During their raids, Vikings captured slaves. They also
, or stole, treasures, such as silver and gold.
For their voyages, Viking sailors crafted swift, narrow
that could navigate the stormiest seas. The Vikings were the master shipbuilders of their time. Vikings also worked as farmers and craftspeople. Others hunted and fished.
The Vikings' claim to fame may have been their fearsome raids, but they were explorers and traders too. They were among the earliest explorers to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to North America.
The Vikings traveled to other parts of Europe, the Mediterranean, Greenland, and North America.
One of the most famous Vikings was explorer Leif Eriksson. He reached North America almost 500 years before Columbus arrived in 1492.
Longships varied in size, but many were between 60 feet and 90 feet in length.
A larger ship could carry about 50 raiders at a time.
Strong winds allowed a longship, which had one large sail, to reach speeds of up to 17 miles an hour.
Vikings used multiple oars to row the ship when there was no wind.
The front end of a longship curved upward and was adorned with a wood carving of a snake's or a dragon's head.
Over time, the Viking raiders lost their power as people learned to defend against their attacks. Today, the remains of Viking villages can be found throughout Europe and North America.
Archaeologists plan to study the burial ground in England to learn more about the life of the Vikings. Based on the objects found, they believe the site was once a Viking settlement.
Vikings were known to bury valuable items with the dead. As one historian put it, the site will allow experts to ""uncover the secrets of a time capsule more than 1,000 years old.""

Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.
For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.
By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.
You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:
Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:
In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:
To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:
Divide both sides by 2, to give:
a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7
b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7
When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers.
For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7.
7 + 5 does equal 12, so your answer is correct.

There are two key pieces of evidence for Big Bang theory. Theses are
You may have noticed that when an ambulance or police car goes past, its siren is high-pitched as it comes towards you, then becomes low-pitched as it goes away. This effect, where there is a change in frequency and wavelength, is called the Doppler effect. It happens with any wave source that moves relative to an observer.
This happens with light too. Our sun contains helium. We know this because there are black lines in the spectrum of the light from the sun, where helium has absorbed light. These lines form the absorption spectrum for helium.
When we look at the spectrum of a distant star, the absorption spectrum is there, but the pattern of lines has moved towards the red end of the spectrum, as you can see below.
This is called red shift. It is a change in frequency of the position of the lines.
Astronomers have found that the further from us a star is the more its light is red shifted. This tells us that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and that the further a galaxy is the faster it is moving away. Since we cannot assume that we have a special place in the universe this is evidence for a generally expanding universe. It suggests that everything is moving away from everything else. The Big Bang theory says that this expansion started billions of years ago with an explosion.
Scientists discovered that there are microwaves coming from every direction in space. Big Bang theory says this is energy created at the beginning of the universe, just after the Big Bang, and that has been travelling through space ever since.
A satellite called COBE has mapped the background microwave radiation of the universe as we see it. Big Bang theorists are still working on the interpretation of this evidence.
A summary of some of the evidence of the Big Bang and its interpretation
The light from other galaxies is red-shifted.
The other galaxies are moving away from us.
The further away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.
The most likely explanation is that the whole universe is expanding. This supports the theory that the start of the universe could have been from a single explosion.
The relatively uniform background radiation is the remains of energy created just after the Big Bang.

5959,"Calculating the number of sides in a regular polygon, given the interior angle
We already know the following facts about polygons:
The interior and exterior angles add up to 180 (a straight line - eg, a + f = 180), and
The sum of the exterior angles is 360 (a + b + c + d + e = 360).
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 120. Calculate the number of sides.
The interior angles are 120, so the exterior angles are 180 - 120 = 60. The exterior angles add up to 360, so if we divide 360 by 60 we find there are 6 exterior angles. Therefore, there are
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 150. Calculate the number of sides.
If not, remember that the exterior angles are each 30 (180 - 150).
360  30 = 12, so there are 12 exterior angles, and 12 sides.

2476,"will ask you to look at the relationships between the characters, their feelings or problems. You could also be asked to write about how characters are presented by Doris Lessing, the writer, or the methods she uses. Whatever you are asked to do, make sure you read the question very carefully and spend some time planning your answer.
One important thing to remember is that these questions might look very different but they often cover very similar ground. For instance, if you are going to write about the old man, you need to show how the writer presents him. Or if you are writing about the problems a character faces, you should also look at their relationships with other characters in the story.
The other thing to remember is that there are a lot of different ways to answer the same question. You do not have to include things in a fixed order.
It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters and themes.
It is also useful to include a personal reaction. This shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied someone else's ideas. For instance, you might feel sympathetic to the old man's situation, or feel he has no right to try to control Alice as he does.
In addition, try to include short quotes in your answer. The previous sections have plenty of examples, like using in a single word:
When he lets the pigeon escape he smiles 'proudly' at his granddaughter.
You can also use a short phrase, such as:
She stares, does 'not smile' and is 'wide-eyed, and pale' with 'tears shivering off her face.
Many people make the mistake of regurgitating numerous sentences, or even complete paragraphs, from the story. There is no need for this. It wastes time and does not provide a focus to your answer. Instead, look for a specific point and the exact word or words to illustrate it. Next, we will look at an example these techniques.
The old man is clearly the main focus of
. He is the first character we meet, and the one we know most about. For instance, we find out he lives with his daughter and her family, and how important his pigeons are to him.
Lessing also writes the story mainly from his point of view. For instance, we are told his thoughts, such as thinking about how his other granddaughters were 'transformed' by marriage and became 'serious young matrons' rather than girls who doted on their grandfather. In this way, the old man is shown to be rather selfish - he is thinking more about himself than the happiness of others in his family. This is most clearly shown when he asks his daughter about Alice and if they can 'keep her a bit longer'.
This is a good start - it keeps to the point and does not waste time retelling the entire story. It also includes short examples to make each point clearer.
The word 'keeping' might strike us as rather odd, because it is usually reserved for animals, not your children or grandchildren. However, Lessing draws several comparisons between particular characters and animals, in particular the pigeons. I especially liked the old man's fingers 'curling like claws into his palms', because it made me think he was becoming just like his birds. It also indicates that his quiet rage is building up as he starts to speak to Alice.
Alice seems to be the one the old man loves the most, but also despises. At times he is very rude to her, even calling her an 'impudent little bit of rubbish'. Yet it is obvious to me that he loves her deeply and can hardly bear to see her leave. For instance, he almost instantly regrets being rude to her, and starts to cry when he learns she is going to marry Steven.
Lessing seems to use contrasts like this throughout the story. For example, the behaviour of the old man and Lucy is very effectively portrayed. The old man is angry, stamps his feet and shouts like a child, while his daughter is able to humour him, and even 'croons' like one of his pigeons to calm him down.
This is only the start of the task. There is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction. It continues to treat each point fairly briefly, but manages to refer to the plot, language, relationships and themes. It also includes some of the writer's personal thoughts, giving a wide-ranging and detailed discussion of how the old man is presented in the story.

1375,"Martin Parr talks about why he loves using a camera and how he decides what to take and which photos to use.
Martin Parr was born in Surrey in 1952 and is an acclaimed documentary photographer and photo-journalist.
He studied at Manchester Polytechnic and since then has used photography and film to take a critical look at mass tourism, food and the family amongst other subjects.
Martin Parr still shoots in medium-format colour but has experimented with fill-in flash and a 35mm ringflash camera.
His work can be poignant and joyful at the same time and conveys his natural curiosity:
Photography is the simplest way of articulating how I feel about the world.
I don't crop my pictures. I just move in and out with my feet. So if I want to get closer I won't change lens I'll just get nearer to the subject.

3430,"Website designs vary from basic ones set up by users as a hobby to sophisticated designs that represent large international companies. Before designing a website, you should take a look at other websites to help you decide how your webpages should look.
You should also read the project brief carefully. Make sure you do exactly what the examiners want. There is no point in doing any more - if they say five pages, only do five pages.
Normally, on a website there is a title bar at the top, a menu on the left and then the main information appears in the big space on the right.
Stick to a simple, clear page layout
Try to avoid flashy things like sound, scrolling banners and animated text/graphics. These might look 'cool' to you, but, unless they are really suitable for the purpose and audience, they are more likely to lose you marks than earn you marks.
The examiners will be looking for a consistent house style throughout each publication you produce.
A good example of this can be seen on the BBC GCSE Bitesize website. GCSE Bitesize uses the same font, sizes and layout throughout the site. This gives a much more professional impression than constantly chopping and changing between different pages.
Ideally, you should come up with a few ideas for fonts, layouts and colour schemes and then test them on members of your target audience. Remember to include details of this testing when writing your reviews and evaluations. Always remember the publication has to appeal to your target audience!
Have consistent left-hand navigation on each page.
Don't have too much text on one page - people don't like scrolling down pages.
Break text up using bullet points, short paragraphs and tables. It's more difficult to read text on screen than it is on paper.
Keep graphics to a minimum. Graphics increase the page weight and increase the time pages take to download.
Take a look at the image below. It's a classic example of a badly designed website! Make sure you avoid using garish colours and patterned backgrounds.
Bright colours and poor quality photographs are not very attractive
Here are some important rules to stick to when writing text for a website:
Stick to a single font colour and size on your website. Try to stick to black text on a white or light-coloured background.
Arial size 12 is easy to read on websites. Try not to use a smaller sized font.
Remember the intended audience. Always test your website on users.
Do not use underlining on webpages. Users will think it is a hyperlink and get confused when it doesn't link to another website.
Keep it simple. Be consistent across the whole website.
Webpages need file names. This allows you and visitors to your website to identify each webpage.
There are several rules you need to stick to when naming webpage files.
Use correct file extension names, eg .htm .html or .shtml.
Do not use symbols, eg + & % in file names.
Do no put spaces in your file or folder name. Use either dashes (-) or underscores (_)
Name your files sensibly. Video_intro.shtml, video_movie.shtm are easier to identify than page1.shtml, page2.shtml etc.
Webpage file names should mean something to you and the user
Keep html, image, flash and other media files in separate folders.
Put images in a folder called images, put audio files in a folder called audio.
There should be an index.shtml file in the site folder.
Do not create folders that contain too many or too few files.
All screen-based publications are likely to need some images. The things to keep in mind when selecting images are:
For the current eportfolio, you are only allowed to use jpg, png, gif and tif. You may need to use a graphics package to convert the graphic to a suitable format.
If they are copyright images, you will actually lose marks for putting them in (you could email the person who holds the copyright, but this can take months to sort out).
If not, use a graphics package to re-size or crop them. Editing inside Powerpoint or a website package is likely to spoil the way the graphic appears.
Have you updated your list of sources?
Each time you add a graphic to a publication, you should update your list of sources.
Can you use some of your own graphics?
It's a good idea to create some graphics. This could be with a digital camera or by doing some original artwork on the computer.
How much memory do the graphics take up?
Remember your eportfolio has a maximum size so keep an eye on individual graphics to make sure they are not too big.
At all times, make sure the graphic is suitable for the intended audience and purpose.
Before creating a website, make sure you know the difference between relative and absolute links.
These point to where the file you want to link to is saved. For example, Jeff is saving his files on his school network. He has a file called intro.html for which the absolute link is:
Look at the image below to see the folders in which intro.html sits.
The problem with absolute links is that the examiner will not have access to your schools server. When your folder and files are copied across to the exam boards server, any absolute links will not work.
For example, Jeff hands in his folder called
to the examiner. In this folder is another folder called
. The examiner, therefore, has access to everything stored within the jeffd201 folder. Now look at the absolute link again - everything that has been handed into the examiner is in bold:
The part that is not in bold represents the school's server, which the examiner
Therefore, you must use relative hyperlinks (the part in bold) when linking your webpages together.
As you have read above, an example of a relative link in Jeff's folder is:
This hyperlink just describes where the file (intro.html) is relative to the current file  in this case, in a subfolder called webpages.
Relative links make it easier to type hyperlinks  youre less likely to make errors. Files can be moved from a local system (your school server) to another server (the examination board).
Remember that the examiner will not have access to your school server. Never refer to the server, or absolute address when you use hyperlinks.
Now look at the image below taken from the examiner's computer. Notice how Jeff's files and folders have been copied on to the exam board's server.
The absolute link for Jeff's file has now changed to:
But notice how the relative link is still the same:
It is crucial to thoroughly test your presentations and websites, as well as all the publications you produce.
First, check that all the links work. It is best to copy the website or presentation onto another device (like a memory stick or CD) and try it out away from the school network - this will show if you have used absolute hyperlinks by mistake. All the links must work before you submit your work for marking and moderation.
Secondly, test your publication with members of the target audience.
Listen carefully and improve your publication accordingly.
One good way of doing this is to prepare a checklist for the reviewer to fill in. Include questions like:
Was the information at the right level?
Finally, write the results of your tests in the review section of your eportfolio. Remember to say how well your publication meets the needs of the audience and include ideas on how it can be improved.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a computer language. HTML is used to make webpages. Many software packages such as Dreamweaver and Homesite allow you to build webpages and save them as html files.
The websites listed below offer HTML tutorials and advice for building your first website.
Practise your HTML in this online text editor with examples and tutorials.
This site is a bit patronising but is a good source of basic information
Images on websites can improve the look and style of the page. However, you must be careful to save images in the correct format.
The two main formats for web images are gif and jpg.
These are used for images that have only a few colours, such as line drawings, text and logos.
Images with few colours should be saved as a gif file
These are used for images or photographs that include details and more colours.
If you save a photo or graphic in the incorrect format, how the image looks will be affected. Look at the images below. When the fish photo is saved in a gif format, colours and details are lost.
When the bitesize graphic is saved incorrectly as a jpg, unwanted colours appear and the looks less sharp. Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Cropping allows you to select the part of the image you want to show. It's likely that you may take a photograph or find an image that is too big and you only want to use one part of the image.
To crop an image, you can use image editing software such as Word, Photoshop or Paintshop.
1. Crop this image to include only the penguin.

2. Select the crop tool in a picture editing package.

2529,"is not just a book about a man who creates a Monster. Mary Shelley intended her readers to learn from her tale. It contains many of her ideas on how people should behave. These were shaped by her upbringing, relationship with Shelley, and her reading of the works of many famous authors and philosophers. These ideas can be summed up in the main
The novel begins with Walton describing his own voyage of discovery, which he hopes will lead him to the North Pole. On meeting Victor, he hears of another tale of discovery, that of the secret of creating life itself.
The Monster is also on a path of self-discovery, and all three characters share a powerful desire to acquire knowledge - a desire that ultimately leads two of them to their deaths, and which very nearly kills Walton.
The Monster quite naturally seeks knowledge about where it came from and how to survive in a hostile world. Through patient
, it learns how to speak and read. But the knowledge it gains only leads it to curse its existence.
It knows that it can never be accepted in the world of man, yet craves human company and the love of the father who abandoned it. Finally, through learning of the 'sanguinary (bloody) laws of man', the Monster is taught that it can be acceptable to kill in some circumstances. This knowledge leads to the deaths of many innocent people.
Robert Walton was brought up by his uncle, and is self-taught in the art of sea-faring. This is despite his father's dying wish that his uncle forbid him from embarking on a life at sea. His determination to succeed, shown by his willingness to work ""harder than the common sailors during the day (and devote his) nights to the study of mathematics medicine... and physical sciences"", leads him to believe he can be the first to discover the sea passage to the North Pole. However, his real motivation is self-glory, fuelled by overwhelming ambition. This leads to him failing to assess the dangers of his voyage and knowingly putting the lives of his crew at risk.
Victor Frankenstein also puts others' lives at risk, as well as his own, through his ambitious pursuit of knowledge. He neglects his loving family and allows his health to suffer greatly in his obsession to discover the secret of creating life out of death.
Shelley makes it clear she believes knowledge such as this cannot lead to good. Some benefit may have come from finding a way to the North Pole, but no good is shown to come from Victor's creation of the Monster.
She shows Victor's 'success' to have severe and tragic consequences that should serve as a warning to scientists, past, present and future, that knowledge is a very dangerous thing and should only be used for the good of mankind - and certainly not personal gain.
