6425,"Catherine also has some news: she tells Eddie that she has been picked out of all the girls in her typing class to be offered a well-paid job at a big plumbing company. She is excited at the prospect, but Eddie is worried: he doesn't want her mixing with strangers, wants her to finish her education and is concerned for her safety. Beatrice takes Catherine's side, however, so in the end Eddie relents and allows Catherine to take the job.
Because the cousins are illegal immigrants, Eddie reminds Beatrice and Catherine not to mention them outside the house. To reinforce the danger, Eddie tells the story of Vinny Bolzano, who let on to the Immigration authorities that his family were hiding an uncle - and the bloody consequences.

2254,"Deposits laid down by ice are called till or boulder clay which is an assortment of material of various shapes and sizes. Boulder clay can be found in areas of the UK such as Lincolnshire and East Anglia. It is easily eroded, and is one reason why the Holderness coast is so vulnerable to wave attack.
Unlike river deposits that are often sorted into different sizes, all glacial deposits are angular and mixed up (unsorted). The extreme of this can be seen in
. These are large rocks or boulders that are often found on their own, rather than in piles. They are unusual shapes, unusually large and of a rock type uncommon to the area they have been dumped, eg the Norber erratic.
Vale of Eden in the Lake District
are elongated hills of glacial deposits. They can be one kilometre long and 500 metres wide, often occurring in groups. A group of drumlins is called a drumlin swarm or a basket of eggs, eg Vale of Eden. These would have been part of the debris that was carried along and then accumulated under the ancient glacier. The long axis of the drumlin indicates the direction in which the glacier was moving. The drumlin would have been deposited when the glacier became overloaded with sediment. However glaciologists still disagree as to exactly how they were formed.

6736,"The factors surrounding a text which help us to understand it; the background events which help to explain something.
you will need to know a little bit about the author: an English Catholic priest who (like Whitman, at about the same time) developed a radically original approach to the
Gerard Manley Hopkins was born in 1844, the eldest of nine children, and quickly proved himself to be highly gifted. He won a scholarship to Oxford, where he earned a double-first class honours degree.
He was a committed Christian and became a Jesuit priest, but became exhausted after working in several parishes all over Britain. When Hopkins was 40, he was appointed professor of Greek and Latin at University College, Dublin.
He loved writing, but found it hard to be a poet and serve God at the same time: when he first became a priest he stopped writing and destroyed his earlier work. Hopkins was inspired to start again in 1875 when he heard about the terrible shipwreck which inspired his great poem
. Thereafter, he produced quite a large body of uniquely individual work.
Hopkins' poetry was neither appreciated or published in his lifetime. A Jesuit magazine to which he submitted some of his poems turned them down. And only a handful of friends who read his work gave him any encouragement. He died of typhoid in 1889, aged 45.
His poems were often in praise of God, celebrating God's glory through His works. He believed that God's goodness could be seen through the natural world.
He was a priest for a short while in Glasgow in 1881, so it was perhaps then that he travelled in Scotland and saw (and sketched) the stream which inspired this poem. Inversnaid is in the Scottish Highlands, overlooking Loch Lomond.

7554,"Methods of diagnosis changed massively during the 20th century.X-rays, CAT scans, MRI imaging, ultrasound scans, endoscopy etc, together with histology and biopsies, started to allow
of most illnesses as the century progressed. Treatments had to keep up with all the information, so

The list of treatments that finally started to help people cure disease and health problems is a long one. Here are some of the main discoveries:
allowed doctors to prescribe vitamin supplements, which cured beriberi, rickets, pernicious anaemia and pellagra.
. They could not cure diabetes, but they were able to alleviate its results. Today, doctors use hormone treatments to correct thyroid problems, help children grow, improve sexual performance and shrink cancers.
In 1932, the German scientist Gerhard Domagk discovered that a coal tar product (a sulphonamide called prontosil) killed streptococci bacteria. Other
were discovered which could cure pneumonia, meningitis and acne.
During the Second World War, Florey and Chain learned how to mass-produce penicillin - discovered (by chance) in 1928 by the Scottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming - the
. Now, doctors could effectively cure acute infectious disease (although misuse of antibiotics has led to the development of drug-resistant strains of killer diseases such as TB and the MRSA hospital superbug).
The work of Peter Medawar (1950s: Britain) on immuno-suppressants led to the development of
, which prevents allergies and operative shock.
) were able to prevent pregnancy, and after the 1970s (through IVF) to help childless women become pregnant (although side effects of the contraceptive pill are thromboses, migraine and jaundice). In 2005, a 66-year-old Romanian woman gave birth to twins.
In the 1950s, doctors used the drug
to treat morning sickness during pregnancy. It caused terrible deformities in babies, but today is used in the treatment of AIDS, leprosy and some cancers.
In 1952, the Danish surgeon Christian Hamburger used large doses of
and surgical operations to change the sex of George Jorgenson, an American army vet, who returned to the US as Christine.
In 1954, Joseph Salk (America) discovered a
, which helped eradicate polio from the western world in the 20th century, and which may make it extinct worldwide early in the 21st century.
Doctors started using technology - such as
- to help patients. In 2002, American surgeons implanted electrodes connected to a miniature computer into the visual cortex of a blind man. Using a video camera mounted on his glasses, he was able to 'see' well enough to drive a car.

The main character in the story is the
The teller of a story; the 'voice' in a text that describes or narrates the events of the plot; either a character in the story, or an authorial voice who relates but takes no part in events.

A text recounting the writer's own life.
At the start of the story, she lives in her own, intense dream world. She is fascinated by flying, and almost believes Superman could teach her to fly. She also plays superman games with her friend David.
Her father has died and she idealises her Uncle Frank. Superman and Uncle Frank are bound together in her mind.
Gradually, she becomes affected by the war. She is physically sick when she sees graphic pictures of the horrors of the prisoner-of-war camps. Superman cannot save her from her nightmares.
She is at first powerless when accused by Paula Brown, then becomes isolated and a target. Everyone turns against her.
After this, her usual comforts of home and Uncle Frank do not help, although she pretends she is fine.
When her mother and Uncle Frank appear not to believe her story, she leaves the light room and chooses somewhere dark to hide and think.
This shows how everything has changed for her. She has lost her childhood world of innocence (light) and entered the cruel, dark 'real' world.

the wearing away of rocks, soil or other solid materials
Longshore drift is a tide or current that flows along the coast, taking material with it.
Hard engineering options tend to be expensive, short-term options. They may also have a high impact on the landscape or environment and be unsustainable.
A wall built on the edge of the coastline
Protects the base of cliffs, land and buildings against erosion. Can prevent coastal flooding in some areas.
Expensive to build. Curved sea walls reflect the energy of the waves back to the sea. This means that the waves remain powerful. Over time the wall may begin to erode. The cost of maintenance is high.
A wooden barrier built at right angles to the beach
Prevents the movement of beach material along the coast by longshore drift.
Allows the build up of a beach. Beaches are a natural defence against erosion and an attraction for tourists.
Large boulders are piled up on the beach.
Allows the build up of a beach.
Can be expensive to obtain and transport the boulders.
Soft engineering options are often less expensive than hard engineering options. They are usually more long-term and
Sustainable means using something or doing something in a way that minimises damage to the environment and which avoids using up natural resources, eg by using renewable rather than scarce resources.

There are two main types of soft engineering.
beach or cliff material that has been removed by erosion or longshore drift.
The main advantage is that beaches are a

It is a relatively inexpensive option but requires constant
to replace the beach material as it is washed away.
Areas of the coast are allowed to

- eg places not being used for housing or farmland.
The advantages are that it encourages the development of

Sometimes the instructions on the reading exam are in English - but be careful,they may not be as straightforward as they seem!
Read each situation carefully and think about what you actually need to know.
Read every choice all the way through. There might be a word or part of a word that you recognise.
Don't jump to conclusions! Sometimes a word like 'Oficina' can be used in a way that it isn't in English.
Don't panic if you don't know what a word means. Look through all the choices and eliminate the ones you know aren't the right answer.
Be careful! Sometimes the question tries to mislead you by offering you information you don't need.
Don't just read it, practise your Spanish with downloadable audio bites.

3327,"The easiest way to represent covalent bonds is by using straight lines, with each line representing a shared pair of electrons. These 2-D molecular diagrams show which atoms are joined by covalent bonds, but do not show the shape of each molecule. It is possible to draw more complex 3-D diagrams to show the true shape of each molecule.
Below are some examples of 2-D and 3-D models:
, meaning they have two shared pairs of electrons. Others have a
, meaning they have three shared pairs of electrons. A double covalent bond is shown by a double line, and a triple bond by a triple line.
) consists of two oxygen atoms held together by a double bond, like this:

5319,"Leisure time is the time we have when we are not working, taking care of ourselves or completing our family and home duties.
It has increased as a result of:
Better working conditions - paid holidays have increased
We can choose what we do in our leisure time. Local authorities and the leisure industry try to influence us to take part in physical activity and sport. Local authorities have targeted certain user groups by offering them
A reduction in the usual price of a ticket granted to a special group of customers, eg students
, such as special opening times, reduced fees and organised classes- to encourage participation.

125,"The GCSE ICT course is all about ICT systems. You need to know the general structure of information systems, and how they work; the role of input, output, processing and feedback; and the integration of ICT devices and ICT information systems.
An ICT system is a set-up consisting of hardware, software, data and the people who use them. It commonly includes communications technology, such as the Internet.
that is often part of an ICT system.
This is why your GCSE is not just about computers but about how, why and when people use them. It is the power of computers and communications that has allowed ICT systems to become so important. Like any piece of equipment, the important thing about it is what it lets us do.
ICT Systems are used in a number of environments, such as:
They're also used in fields such as:
ICT Systems are everyday and ordinary, yet extraordinary in how they can add extra power to what we do and want to do.
more productive - we can complete a greater number of tasks in the same time at reduced cost by using computers than we could prior to their invention
able to deal with vast amounts of
able to transmit and receive information rapidly
The three main types of ICT system to be considered for GCSE are:
This type of ICT system is focused on managing
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
. Examples of these are a sports club membership system or a supermarket stock system.
These ICT systems mainly control machines. They use
the term denoting either an entrance or changes which are inserted into a system and which activate/modify a process
the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process
, but the output may be moving a robot arm to weld a car chassis rather than information.
The output of these ICT systems is the successful
What comes out of an ICT system is largely dependant on what you put into the system to begin with.
ICT systems work by taking inputs (instructions and
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
), processing them and producing outputs that are stored or communicated in some way. The higher the quality and better thought-out the inputs, the more useful the outputs.
ICT systems cannot function properly if the inputs are inaccurate or faulty; they will either not be able to process the data at all, or will output data which is erroneous or useless.
is a useful term to remember in the exam - it can help explain many issues such as why
is needed and why accurate data is valuable.
GIGO stands for Garbage In, Garbage Out
A system is an assembly of parts that together make a whole. ICT systems are made up of some or all of the parts shown in the diagram. Various devices are used for input, processing, output, and communication.
ICT systems can be made of some or all of the parts shown.
It is sometimes good to have feedback in an ICT system. This is when the
the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process
the term denoting either an entrance or changes which are inserted into a system and which activate/modify a process
A good example is a system set-up to control water temperature in a tropical fish tank. The temperature of the water is taken as an input from
an automatic input device that continuously monitors a set of computer controlled parameters, eg a parking sensor detects how close a vehicle is to the nearest object and alerts the driver if the distance falls outside of the specified parameters
. Processing takes place and the temperature of the water is compared against the pre-programmed parameters, eg maximum/minimum temperature. The outputs include the automatic decision to either turn on or off the heater to warm or let the water cool. The output, ie the change in the water's temperature, is then fed back by the sensors as an input and the process repeats itself.
A system that monitors the water temperature of a fishtank and reacts accordingly.
-based systems as well. Often an output will have a result on further inputs. For example, the output of accepting an online booking for an air ticket will be to reduce the number of tickets available.

from ICT systems vary a lot. In your revision you need to be familiar with examples of
Input and output formats are the different kinds of

that are used to either gather up and collect
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
and instructions or to display, present or issue the outputs of processing.
Up until recently most media formats required dedicated devices - for example, digital cameras to take
data measured at discrete intervals, eg a digital watch typically moves from displaying one second to the next without displaying the values in-between
photographs, scanners to digitise images for use on a computer, or
used to store data, eg a movie
players for video playback - so you needed the correct device in order to work with each media format.
There is now a growing tendency for multi-purpose ICT devices or conversion. The driving force is the communication power of the
a global network connecting millions of computers
, and the increasing availability of small high-powered electronic technology. This means that you can now get an all-in-one box that can do the same thing as several different ones did before it. Here are some examples:
a computer's or another internet-enabled device's connection to the Internet
an application used to browse the Internet or view web pages
mobile phones that can take photos, record video, access the Internet and play back music

Alongside the joining together of technologies, there is also a tendency toward the integration of common public information services.
data measured at discrete intervals, eg a digital watch typically moves from displaying one second to the next without displaying the values in-between
a data communications technology that provides broadband Internet speeds over the cable television infrastructure
or terrestrial aerial now gives access to many channels that have interactive content, which can be used in a similar way to the web. DAB digital radio provides large amounts of text
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
to be transmitted along with the signal. The
a global network connecting millions of computers
now enables broadcasts from radio and TV stations to be 'time-shifted' by the user, who watches or listens to the programme whenever they want to.
News services and the mass media such as newspapers, radio, and television are making themselves available so that people can access them when they want and wherever they are. Two of the key reasons for this are:
Internet access that allows lots of information to be viewed quickly and effectively.
Soon to replace analogue broadcasting in this country altogether. A greater number of channels can be offered as well as interactive services, eg the red button.

6773,"Responsibilities of data controllers: The Eight Principles
a company or an individual that collects and stores data about people
When you read about these, you may find them called
. You may be asked about these in the exam.
Remember: a data controller is the nominated person in a company who applies to the data commissioner for permission to store and use personal data.
For the personal data that controllers store and process:
It must be collected and used fairly and inside the law.
It must only be held and used for the reasons given to the
the individual responsible for enforcing the Data Protection Act
It can only be used for those registered purposes and only be disclosed to those people mentioned in the register entry. You cannot give it away or sell it unless you said you would to begin with.
held must be adequate, relevant and not excessive when compared with the purpose stated in the register. So you must have enough detail but not too much for the job that you are doing with the
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
It must be accurate and be kept up to date. There is a duty to keep it up to date, for example to change an address when people move.
It must not be kept longer than is necessary for the registered purpose. It is alright to keep information for certain lengths of time but not indefinitely. This rule means that it would be wrong to keep information about past customers longer than a few years at most.
The information must be kept safe and secure. This includes keeping the information backed up and away from any unauthorised access. It would be wrong to leave personal data open to be viewed by just anyone.
The files may not be transferred outside of the European Economic Area (that's the EU plus some small European countries) unless the country that the data is being sent to has a suitable data protection law. This part of the
legislation passed by parliament that governs the protection of personal data in the UK
has led to some countries passing similar laws to allow computer data centres to be located in their area.

1459,". Fossil fuel (coal, oil and gas) power stations and nuclear (uranium) power stations both use the same processes to make electricity. These are:
fuel produces heat and heat is used to boil water and is turned into steam
turbine turns a generator and the generator makes electricity
electricity goes to the transformers to produce the correct voltage
The only difference between fossil fuel and nuclear power stations is how the water is heated. Fossil fuel power stations
their fuel while a nuclear power station uses the
. At present the most dangerous waste is sealed in glass-like blocks which are buried deep within rocks. Careless disposal of waste in the past has led to
As well as producing heat the nuclear reactor can be used to make other materials radioactive. The chain reaction inside the reactor releases
. If a material is put into the reactor some of these neutrons may be absorbed by the nuclei of its atoms. This will make an atom's nucleus
which means it has become radioactive. These man-made radioisotopes are often then used as
in hospitals to diagnose and treat patients or in industry to detect leaks in pipes.
The nuclear reactor is designed to allow a
to take place. Each time a uranium nucleus splits up it releases energy and three neutrons. If all the neutrons are allowed to be absorbed by other uranium nuclei the chain reaction will spiral out of control causing an
. To control the energy released in the reactor moveable control rods are placed between the fuel rods. These control rods are made of

6691,"In the exam there will usually be an example to show you what you have to do. Look carefully at this, so you know how you have to answer the question - in English or German, by writing a letter, word, or phrase or by ticking a box.
Always write an answer - you don't get any marks for leaving a gap! You can often have a good guess from the question what the answer might be.
After you have finished writing your answer there will be a pause before the next question, to give you time to read through what you have written.

520,"An electronics product can be thought of as a
with inputs, processes and outputs. The most common method of manufacturing electronic products is the batch method - though one-off production and continuous-flow production are also important.
ICT is used extensively in electronics manufacturing. The use of machines that are controlled by computers is called computer-aided manufacture or CAM.
Electronics systems diagrams are used to show how the parts of a product work together. Many electronic products are made up of a number of standard system circuits (circuits that are common to many different products), such as sensors, amplifiers, timers, counters and output devices.
System diagrams usually take the form of a
in which each part of the electronic system is represented by an input, a process or an output.
The block diagrams below shows two types of system.
has no feedback mechanism, so the accuracy depends on how well the system was set up before hand.
electronic systems use sensors to provide feedback. This means that if the output is not satisfactory, the inputs or processes can be altered.
There are four basic types of production system used in electronics - each one using different types of machine and with different levels of automation. Which system is used depends generally on how many identical products are to be produced, and how continuous the production is to be.
This is used to produce very small amounts or specialised electronic products. This might mean producing a single piece of switch gear for a factory machine. Workers in this type of industry need to be highly skilled in a range of different areas and able to work on a number of aspects of the project.
This is the most common type of production in the electronics industry. It involves making a set number of exactly the same product. Some batches will be small, others could be thousands. Batch production might be used to make PCBs for aircraft controls, for example, or control panels for central-heating boilers.In batch production the operation is sub-divided into a number of separate stages, with each stage being completed by different (often computer-controlled) machines. The stages in an PCB batch production process might be:
checking the board, and mounting it into the product
Printed circuit board being checked after manufacture
This is used when very many identical products are required, such as electronic circuits for cars, washing machines and fridges. The products are assembled as they flow along a production line. The operators tend to be semi-skilled.
In-line production plants are very expensive to set up and thousands of products have to be sold to off-set the capital costs. Production is often difficult to plan and breakdowns are costly.
This is where production is heavily automated and runs 24 hours per day. Continuous-flow production is used in oil refining and chemical processing. A considerable amount of electronic control is used in the running and monitoring of these plants.
CAM is essentially the use of automated machines that are controlled by computers. Some of the advantages of using computer-aided manufacturing are that
machines can be quickly reprogrammed for each new batch of products
specifications can be transmitted quickly from design to manufacturing, and from one machine to another
machines can work continuously for long periods
work can be carried out in conditions which would be hazardous to humans
When computers are used to carry out bespoke precision tasks, such as soldering circuit boards, this is called
or CNC. CNC machines can be programmed and operated from computers or other microprocessor systems - either directly using a keyboard or keypad, or indirectly by means of disks, smart cards or other removable media.
In electronics CNC machines are used - among other applications - to 'populate' PCBs and solder the components in place.

2453,"With the election of 1936 looming and
still a major problem Roosevelt introduced more
in the second New Deal. He wanted to further reform America and improve people's lives.
Although Roosevelt restored hope and staved off the collapse of the banking system, the problem of unemployment was more difficult and at the start of 1934 there was still 11.3 million people out of work. Some historians have said that failing to deal with unemployment was the biggest weakness of the New Deal. Criticism of Roosevelt emerged from several directions.
With this criticism in mind and the 1936 presidential election on the horizon, the New Deal began to change direction. Some historians have interpreted the change by saying there were two New Deals - the first dealing with the immediate emergency of 1933-34 and the second, which emerged in 1935-1936, offering more radical, reforming policies:
- this agency employed people to build schools, hospitals and other public buildings.
- this agency aimed to bring electricity to America's farms.
(Wagner Act) - this act aimed to improve relations between workers and employers, especially as 1934 had seen a series of violent industrial disputes.
Some historians say that, where the first New Deal aimed to save America and its capitalist economic system, the second New Deal aimed to change America.
The wealthy businessmen behind the American Liberty League argued that by increasing taxation and encouraging the development of the trade union movement, Roosevelt had
his own class (Roosevelt was from a very wealthy family).
began writing letters saying things like this one from a man in California -
""you are multi-millionaires, what do you care for the masses of the people?""
- the Governor of Louisiana, known as The Kingfish, launched the Share our Wealth campaign in which personal fortunes of more than $3 million would be redistributed to ordinary citizens.
- a Canadian priest - broadcast popular sermons on the CBS network, promising to nationalise the banks.
planned to boost the economy by raising pensions for the over 60s - in return, they would spend $200 a month to increase demand for consumer goods.
Cartoon titled 'The Illegal Act' - caption reads: 'I'm sorry, but the Supreme Court says I must chuck you back again'
Does Source A criticise or support the New Deal?
At first glance, the cartoon could be mistaken for criticising Roosevelt and the New Deal. It looks like Roosevelt is rescuing another person from the sea of Depression and pulling him into his National Recovery boat. Many New Deal critics were opposed to the cost of the New Deal to the American taxpayer.
However, the cartoon is actually criticising the US Supreme Court - the caption gives it away - Roosevelt is saying: ""I'm sorry but the Supreme Court says I must chuck you back again"", and he is shown to be pushing the man's head down. This is because the Supreme Court did not agree with many of Roosevelt's New Deal proposals and, therefore, did not pass them.
This cartoon sympathises with Roosevelt as it shows him unwillingly pushing away the man who needs saving.
If you are given an image source to study in your exam, make sure that you read the captions and look at the details very closely. As demonstrated with Source A, it is very easy to misinterpret a source at initial glance.

7295,"""an attractive chap about thirty, rather too manly to be a dandy but very much the easy well-bred man-about-town.""
- the son of Lord and Lady Croft. We realise that they are not over-impressed by Gerald's engagement to Sheila because they declined the invitation to the dinner.
He is not as willing as Sheila to admit his part in the girl's death to the Inspector and initially pretends that he never knew her. Is he a bit like Mr Birling, wanting to protect his own interests?
He did have some genuine feeling for Daisy Renton, however: he is very moved when he hears of her death. He tells Inspector Goole that he arranged for her to live in his friend's flat
""She was young and pretty and warm-hearted - and intensely grateful.""
Despite this, in Act 3 he tries to come up with as much evidence as possible to prove that the Inspector is a fake - because that would get him off the hook. It is Gerald who confirms that the local force has no officer by the name of Goole, he who realises it may not have been the same girl and he who finds out from the infirmary that there has not been a suicide case in months. He seems to throw his energies into
At the end of the play, he has not changed. He has not gained a new sense of social responsibility, which is why Sheila (who has) is unsure whether to take back the engagement ring.

3680,"What to include in your preparation studies
This is an example of a GCSE journal page, but it could be on a loose sheet of paper. It simply doesn't matter, as long as a visual development, or journey, is shown.
You can see more student preparation work, as well as their final pieces, in the
Make each page of your preparation studies follow on from the last - tell the story of your journey in each unit - with lots of wrong turnings, if you like. Wrong turnings show you have really explored and experimented well.
Work your way through your work journal - explore ideas with sketches, colour samples, photos.
Write short notes as you go - two words will sometimes do!
Connect with other designers or artists - show examples of their work.
Everything in your journal should be created and completed by you alone.
If you copy someone else's work, explain what you have learnt from this.
Show how you can develop from other people's work to produce something original.

5639,"To put Much Ado About Nothing into perspective, you will need to know a little bit about William Shakespeare and why the play is still so popular over 400 years after it was first performed.
William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564. His father sold gloves and became an important person in the town. William, one of eight children, was the eldest son, and probably educated at the local grammar school. He married when he was only 18 and his wife, Anne Hathaway, was eight years older than him. They had two girls and a boy (who died aged 11).
Nobody knows how Shakespeare began to write, or when he entered the theatre. But we know he became a leading member of the theatre troupe known as 'The Lord Chamberlain's Men'. The company proved very popular, and later, when King James I granted it the right to perform at his court, became known as 'The King's Men'.
Shakespeare wrote more than 30 plays for 'The King's Men', making it the most important theatre company in the country. He often wrote parts for particular actors, too.
He was very successful and wealthy in his time, and his work has remained very popular ever since.

160,"Coniferous or boreal forests occur in cold northern regions characterised by long cold winters and short summers. Although there is a lot of
Precipitation is the term given to moisture that falls from the air to the ground. In the UK, the most common form of precipitation is rain, but snow, hail, sleet, drizzle, fog, and mist are also precipitation.
, most of it falls as snow.
This biome is found between 50 and 60 degrees north of the equator and is characterised by evergreen coniferous trees with needles instead of leaves. It is also known as Taiga.
Typical trees include spruce, pine and fir. Animals commonly found in the region are reindeer, voles and hares.
At the most northern extent, summer temperatures rarely rise above 10C. As you move further north, trees are shorter and less dense because of the shorter growing season. Winter temperatures can fall as low as minus 30C. At its southern margins, the trees become taller and denser and merge with deciduous trees (those that lose their leaves). Temperatures here can rise as high as 20 degrees in the summer can fall to minus 15 degrees in winter. Precipitation is 300  900mm, and most falls as snow in winter.
Coniferous trees have thick bark to protect against the cold. They are cone shaped, with flexible branches which help them to cope with heavy snow fall.
Pine cones protect the seeds during the harsh winter.
The thin waxy needles reduce water loss.
Their evergreen nature means that the needles can photosynthesize whenever there is sufficient sunlight.
The dense forest creates warmth during the harsh winter.
Soils are shallow due to lack of decomposition and weathering caused by the cold. They are acidic due to leaching from rainfall and they are also poor in nutrients.
The litter layer is thick with needles due to slow decomposition.
There are clear boundaries between the layers in the soil as there are few worms to mix it in the cold conditions.
The typical soil is a podsol, which has a distinctive ash grey layer (or horizon) above a red layer, which is rich in iron.

Quand j'tais petit, mon grand-pre m'offrait toujours un peu de vin  table, dilu avec de l'eau. Il disait que c'tait pour m'habituer au got, et que si j'aimais a, j'tais vraiment un homme. Pour faire comme les grands, je buvais ce qu'on me donnait, mais je n'aimais pas vraiment a. Maintenant que j'ai quinze ans, les choses ont bien chang. Quand mes parents boivent l'apritif entre amis, ils sont gns parce que je finis toujours mon verre le premier. Mon pre dit qu'il devrait fermer le placard  cl, parce que quand j'invite des copains, a nous arrive de vider plusieurs bouteilles sans s'en rendre compte.
Je croyais que mon pre ne savait pas qu'il y avait de la vieille liqueur de menthe au fond du placard, mais l'autre jour il a remarqu et je me suis fait disputer. En plus, ma mre tait verte car un de mes copains a t malade aprs, et il y avait une grosse tache sur la moquette. Mes parents croient que je bois comme a tout le temps, mais quand on sort, a cote beaucoup plus cher et dans beaucoup d'endroits ils refusent de nous servir  moins d'avoir une pice d'identit.
Pour moi, mes problmes d'accoutumance ont commenc ds l'enfance. Je ne pouvais jamais m'arrter de manger des bonbons si je commenais le paquet, et plus je mangeais de sucre, plus je sentais que j'en avais besoin. J'avais toujours de l'nergie  revendre, et mes parents disaient que j'tais trs pnible. Maintenant que je suis plus ge, ma personnalit n'a pas chang, et si je sais que je peux prendre quelque chose, mme si je sais que ce n'est pas bien, je ne peux pas m'empcher de le faire. Il y a deux ans, un copain m'a offert de l'ecstasy en bote, et j'ai tellement aim la sensation que maintenant,  chaque fois que je sors, il faut que j'en achte.
Certaines de mes copines me disent que a peut-tre dangereux, et qu'il ne faut pas se dshydrater. Je connais les risques, mais c'est plus fort que moi. Je sais que je vais me sentir tellement bien si j'en prends que je ne peux pas me faire une raison. Dans un sens, je suis accro  cette drogue, mais je me dis que a passera  l'ge adulte, quand je serai plus srieuse. Mes parents ne se doutent de rien, ils croient juste que de danser me donne la pche, mais le lendemain, je ne me sens pas toujours bien.

6816,"The ""Golden Age of Farming"" or ""High Farming"" took place in Great Britain between 1840 and 1870. The reason this period is given these two names is because farmers began to use more advanced and scientific techniques on their land for the very first time. These new techniques allowed them to produce higher crop yields, which led to lower food prices.
High Farming was able to take place in Britain for four main reasons:
- from 1801 onwards there was a dramatic rise in the size of the British population and by 1851 there were approximately twice as many people living in Britain as there had been in 1801. These people needed to be fed and many were unable to grow their own food.
- by the mid-1850s most of the population lived in new towns and worked in new factories, so did not have the time or space to grow their own food. Factory owners gave their workers higher wages to spend on food and this made farmers richer.
- the middle of the 19th century also saw an improvement in British transport. For example, there were now 5,000 miles of new railway tracks in Britain, which allowed fresh vegetables, milk and cheese to be moved more quickly around the country. Towns had access to fresh produce for the first time and this encouraged farming.
- British farming benefited from new colleges and institutions being set up to educate a new generation of farmers about new techniques that would give greater yields and more profits. The two most famous educational facilities were the Rothamsted Agricultural Research Station set up in 1842 and the Royal College for Agriculture in 1846.

CHANGED A title to the letter would be helpful, so readers know what to expect and what information to look for.
) Visit to Newtown Outdoor Pursuits Centre
We are planning to take all Year 11 students on a visit to Newtown Outdoor Pursuits Centre on Thursday 10 December (
The information given is too vague, eg parents need to know the exact times and places of departure and arrival.
). We shall leave school immediately after registration in the morning, and we intend to be back at the main school entrance by 7 o'clock in the evening. We shall be travelling by Brown's Executive Coaches, which are fitted with seat belts and speed limiters. If our return is delayed for any reason, you may contact the company for information on 01234-567890. (
It's also helpful to state the day as well as the date of the trip, and to give more details of special arrangements, eg about safety, what will happen if the return is delayed, etc.
Six teachers and several parent volunteers will accompany the students, who will be in groups of no more than ten throughout the day, always with at least one adult. (
The description of what takes place at the Centre is too brief, eg there is no information about supervision of the students, or what specific clothing is needed for the activities.
If your son/daughter comes on the trip, s/he will need to bring a packed lunch, and sufficient drinks for an energetic day! No spending money is necessary, as there are no shops at the Centre. (
The description of what takes place at the Centre is too brief, eg there is no information about supervision of the students, or what specific clothing is needed for the activities.
School uniform should not be worn for this trip; students should wear comfortable old clothes that will not be damaged by water or mud; any specialist equipment will be provided by the Centre. (
The description of what takes place at the Centre is too brief, eg there is no information about supervision of the students, or what specific clothing is needed for the activities.
Newtown Outdoor Pursuits Centre offers a range of adventurous activities such as rock-climbing, abseiling, orienteering and canoeing. They are all supervised by fully-trained centre staff, and excellent first-aid facilities are available should any minor accidents occur. (
The description of what takes place at the Centre is too brief, eg there is no information about supervision of the students, or what specific clothing is needed for the activities.
We have arranged this visit as part of our students' personal and social education programme, to help them develop skills of teamwork and of supporting each other in challenging situations. (
The explanation of why the trip is taking place is vague, and is also mixed up with information about the cost.
We hope that you will agree to your son/daughter taking part in this day. If so, will you please sign and return the slip at the bottom of this letter with a donation of 10 (cash, or cheques made payable to 'Newtown High School Fund') to cover the cost of travel and use of facilities at the Centre. We regret that we may have to cancel the trip if insufficient donations are received. (
Information about paying is vague, eg who should the money be sent to? Should it be cash or cheque?
There is no explanation about what will be done with students who don't go on the trip, or what will happen if not enough want to go.
Parents are not given information about how to find out more about the trip.
Please contact me at the school if you wish to know any more about this visit. (
The language is too simple, eg 'child'. Although the letter is polite, it should be more detailed and informative.

silver chloride, silver bromide, silver iodide, lead chloride, lead bromide, lead iodide
Notice that nitrates and most chlorides are soluble. This is why many of the chemicals you use in the laboratory are nitrates or chlorides. If we want to make an insoluble salt, we can react together two soluble salts in a precipitation reaction.
Silver chloride is insoluble - you can see this from the table. We need a soluble silver salt and a soluble chloride salt to make it. Silver nitrate and sodium chloride are both soluble. When we mix their solutions together, we make insoluble silver chloride and soluble sodium nitrate.
The silver chloride appears as tiny particles suspended in the reaction mixture: it forms a precipitate. The precipitate can be filtered, washed with water on the filter paper and then dried in an oven.
Here are the word and balanced formulae equations for the reaction:
silver nitrate (soluble) + sodium chloride (soluble)
silver chloride (insoluble) + sodium nitrate (soluble)

6396,"When there is a chemical reaction, air pollutants are produced. You can understand how these pollutants are formed by looking at what happens to atoms during these chemical reactions.
A compound is a substance formed by the chemical union (involving bond formation) of two or more elements.
tells you how many atoms of each element the molecule contains. The table below shows the formulae of some compounds, together with the number of atoms of each element in each molecule and a diagram of each molecule.
The table shows the formulae of some compounds, with the number of atoms of each element in the molecule.
A small (subscript) number after a symbol tells you how many atoms of that particular element are in the molecule. If there is only one atom of an element in a molecule, we do not write the number 1 after the symbol. For example, the water molecule H
O has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
In a chemical reaction, the substances that react together are called the
, while the substances that are formed are called the
The products have different properties from the reactants.
All elements are made of atoms. An atom consists of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons.
in the reactants are rearranged to make the products. No atoms are added or taken away. This is called the
Carbon reacting with oxygen to form carbon monoxide
Carbon reacting with oxygen to form carbon dioxide
Sulfur reacting with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide
Nitrogen reacting with oxygen to form nitrogen monoxide
Nitrogen reacting with oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide

6804,"The table below shows some properties of a number of materials. Consider which materials would be suitable to make a pair of shoes.
Suitable materials for making the uppers of shoes are
. They are flexible, tough, light and attractive. Rubber is unsuitable as it is unattractive and wood is too heavy and inflexible.
are both good materials for making the soles of shoes because they are flexible and durable ie hard-wearing. Cotton and polythene are flexible but not durable enough, and wood is durable but not flexible enough.
Shoes with leather uppers and rubber soles
How well a product does the job it was designed for depends on the effectiveness and durability of the materials that were used to make it. Consider again the materials you would use to make a pair of shoes, but think about the materials that would be most durable and effective.
A pair of shoes made with leather uppers and a rubber sole would be most effective and durable:
is waterproof and flexible; it can also be dyed in a range of colours, and can be given a shiny, polished surface.
is also waterproof and flexible; it is very hard-wearing, and will not slip easily when in contact with flooring materials.
The properties of these materials make them

5354,"in the water are not removed by the treatment processes. For example, nitrate fertilisers applied to farm land in larger quantities than the plants can absorb may be washed by the rain into rivers and lakes. Nitrates can be poisonous particularly for young people or if they're in high concentrations so care has to be taken to limit nitrates getting into water sources.

1857,"Reflections [y = -f(x) and y = f(-x)]
When you draw the graphs of y = x
+ 5 and y = - ( x
+ 5), you will see that the second graph is a reflection of the first in the x axis.
In general, if we start with y = f(x), then
y = -f(x) is a reflection of y = f(x) in the x axis.
If you compare the graphs of y = x
+ 5, you will see that the second graph is a reflection of the first in the y axis.
In general, if we start with y = f(x), then
y = f(-x) is a reflection of y = f(x) in the y axis.
See if you can do it better than Einstein!

2562,"Metamorphic rocks have been subjected to tremendous heat and / or pressure, which have caused them to change into another type of rock. They are usually resistant to weathering and erosion and are therefore very hard wearing.
Examples of metamorphic rocks include marble - which originates from limestone, slate - which originates from clay, and schists formed from sandstone or shale (sedimentary rocks).

3717,"who earns his living by charging interest on money he loans (like modern banks). He often speaks prose in the play, which marks him out as an outsider.
""suff'rance is the badge of all our tribe.""
He is verbally abused and bullied by most characters in the play and is called cruel names including
""villain with a smiling cheek, cut-throat dog, bloody creditor, damned inexecrable dog""
He is very astute and is aware of other people's concerns - he knows all about Antonio's business ventures.
""I hate him for he is a Christian; / But more, for that in low simplicity / He lends out money gratis.""
So, why does he make such a strange agreement with Antonio, asking for a pound of Antonio's flesh instead of interest if the loan is not repaid within the arranged time? Does he genuinely want to be friends with Antonio when he says
""I would be friends with you, and have your love?""
His daughter hates him and calls him a
We see him being impatient with her and ordering her around. When she runs away, he seems as upset about the loss of his money as her:
""My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter! ... My ducats and my daughter!""
It would seem that Shylock cares for money more than anything else. Yet in an often forgotten moment When Shylock finds out his daughter traded his wife's ring for monkey he cares only for its sentimental value.
""Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my turquoise; / I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor: / I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.""
Perhaps it is the loss of Jessica as well as all the harsh treatment he has suffered from Antonio - and others - over the years that makes him bitter enough to ask for Antonio's pound of flesh.
He cleverly argues in Act III, scene 1 that he is as much a man as a Christian is and so will follow the example the Christians set by seeking revenge.
""The villainy you teach me I will execute.""
He is thrilled to hear that another of Antonio's ships is lost, making Antonio more vulnerable.
""I thank God, I thank God. Is it true, is it true?""
that he will win, telling Antonio while he is in prison,
""Thou call'dst me dog ... But since I am a dog, beware my fangs.""
He knows that the Venetian justice system will have to support him and so relishes beating Antonio at his own game.
refuses to listen to all the pleas for mercy
during the trial scene (from the Duke, Bassanio and Balthazar), insisting all the time on justice and his pound of flesh. Do you think this is this a sign of strength or foolishness? He could have pardoned Antonio and shown himself to be morally superior - but would this have done him any good in the long run?
Caught out by Portia, by the end of the trial he has lost all his money and has to suffer the humiliation of being forced to become a Christian. Shakespeare doesn't give Shylock any lines to tell us how he feels. How should he react? We never find out what happens to him.
Weighing up all you know about Shylock, do you consider him to be more a

Systems for manufacturing graphics products require planning; system flowcharts are useful for this. They also need to be controlled, and these system controls can be visual, mechanical or electronic devices. Production systems also need to be checked for quality - a procedure called
, depending on the scale of production. Computer-aided manufacture (CAM) is widespread in all kinds of graphics production.
A system is a set of components arranged to carry out a particular function. Systems may include mechanical, electrical or electronic components. The block diagram below represents a system for producing a batch of leaflets.

is the shaping and forming of the materials, or the exchange of information needed to effect the output. In a music system it is the amplifier that does the processing.
is what comes out of the system - the finished product. In a music system, the speakers take care of the output.
Most systems have a fourth element -
- which is simply a way of changing the input or process as a result of what happens at the output. In a music system, feedback is a human response to the output from the speakers: if the music is too loud, or the radio tuned to the wrong station, the user will reduce the volume or retune the radio. In a system diagram feedback is shown like this:
An example of feedback in a production system is checking that the product meets the specification, and adjusting the process to make sure it does. Many systems have an automatic type of feedback, where feedback from one part of the system switches another part of the system on or off. This sort of system is called a
When planning a production system you need to work out how the different elements of the system fit together, with each part in the right order. A flow chart is a good way of doing this. The one below shows how to organise the production of a school newsletter.
Any large-scale production system of the kind you would find in manufacturing is likely to include the following processes:
of raw materials, bought-in components, sub-assemblies and part finished products.
of bought-in components to make sure they are of the required quality; Inspection of part-finished products to ensure they meet specifications; artwork. Inspection has to be done at all the crucial points in the production process.
of raw materials, part-finished products and complete products.

Systems need to be controlled if they are to continue functioning the way they were designed to do.
Controls can be simple visual aids for the designer. Two examples are
correct aligning of colour blocks in a printed product
are used to make sure that colour printing lines up, because the various colours must line up with each other. Registration marks are usually shown in a cross shape. Sometimes work that is to be printed has
, where the artwork for each colour is on a separate sheet.
are standard bars of colour with blocks of each colour printed. This is done to show the strength and evenness of the ink used and that the registration of the colours is correct.
The table lists mechanical or electronic equipment used for control and feedback in graphic production.
Speed of movement of cutting blade; cutting fence can be set to required distance, which allows repetition
Paper cut is ragged: blade may need sharpening/replacing; cut fewer sheets Wrong size: reset fence
Number of copies; paper type; quality of printout Repetition through repeat copies
Number of copies wrong: reset on computer Quality of print poor: change paper or ink cartridge
Size of copy/enlarge/reduce; number of copies made; type of paper or other materials; quality of printout; copy too dark/light
Size is wrong: reset size Number of copies wrong: reset number required Quality of print poor: change paper or toner cartridge Contrast wrong: adjust contrast control
Speed/depth of cut; pressure on cutter; order of cutting Repetition though repeating process
Cutting incorrect: adjust speed/depth and/or pressure through software or hardware controls Order wrong: reset though software controls

Quality control is a specialised type of system control designed to check that a product meets the design specification and is of the prescribed quality. Before making a product, the designer should decide what quality checks need to be done, and at what stage in the making process they should be carried out.
do what it is supposed to do
check against the specification: does the product meet all aspects of the specification?
is the text accurate, spelt correctly, with correct grammar and layout?
have the correct shades of colours been used?
are the registration marks correct and do they line up?
have correct desktop publishing (DTP) layout templates been used?
check measurements: are they within the tolerances specified?
for products such as pop-up books, check the cut and fit of different parts: do they fit accurately and neatly without gaps?
for products such as pop-up books and cards, check to see if the product works properly and as intended: do parts move as required?
There are four main types of production system used in manufacturing graphic products, each one suitable for a different scale of production.
is when only one of the product is made. It is labour-intensive, because every product is different. One-off graphic products might include a presentation book as a souvenir of a special event, or a model of a theatre set.
is when a set quantity of the product is made. It may also use a lot of labour, but jigs and templates are used to aid production. Often the machines can be easily changed to produce a batch of a different product. Batch-produced graphic products include programmes for a play or concert, or posters to advertise a play or concert.
is when a very large number of the product is made, usually on a production line - but the process cannot be continuous because the product regularly changes. Examples of mass-produced graphic products are newspapers and magazines.
production is when many thousands of products are made. The difference between this and mass production is that the production line is kept running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to eliminate the expense of stopping and restarting the production process. The process is often automated and few workers are required. Continuous-flow production is used for graphics products which sell very large numbers throughout the year, and do not need to be frequently changed - such as cereal packaging.
Information and communications technology is widely used in manufacturing graphics products. Its benefits are that:
it makes it easy to produce accurate, complex, standardised drawings
It allows complex shapes to be made with ease and precision
it enables changes to be made quickly and easily, and
it greatly simplifies batch or mass production
CAM machines are good for batch or mass production, and they are also useful for one-off products that are complicated to make. There are two types of CAM machine:
Plotter/cutters can be used either for cutting of card and vinyl, or (by replacing the blade with a pen) to produce drawings and lettering prior to cutting. Cutter/printers are more complex CAM machines which allow full-colour printing before cutting is done.
These are mainly used for cutting plastics, hard wax, soft metals and wood-based materials such as MDF. They are particularly useful for making prototype models and moulds for vacuum-forming. Some of these machines can have a scanner head fitted in place of the cutting tool, allowing 3D scanning to be done.

6328,"After he has left, and the family has begun to consider the consequences of what has been revealed, they gradually begin to wonder about the Inspector. Was he real? When Gerald returns from his walk he explains that he also had suspicions about the Inspector and had found out that there is no Inspector Goole on the force, which Birling confirms with a phone call.
They gradually realise that perhaps the Inspector conned them - he could have showed each person a different photograph - and when they telephone the infirmary, they realise that there hasn't been a suicide case for months. Birling is delighted, assuming they are now all off the hook, while Sheila and Eric maintain that nothing has changed - each of them still committed the acts that the Inspector had accused them of, even if they did turn out to be against five different girls.

1161,"Suburban houses are usually larger than inner city terraces and most have a garden. Typically, they are detached or semi detached and the roads around them are arranged in cul de sacs and wide avenues. Land prices are generally cheaper than in the CBD and inner city, although the desirability of housing can make some areas expensive.
Many suburbs were built in the UK in the 1930s and have a distinctive style of housing, as shown in the picture to the right. More modern housing estates were built in the late 20th century as towns and cities have continued to grow.
Facilities such as schools, places of worship and parks are often present, and many are served by a local supermarket.
Suburban areas are often home to commuters who need access to the CBD along main roads and railways, and they are also within easy reach of the countryside.

5540,"Decay is an essential life process, which helps to digest food and recycle materials. Bacteria and fungi are the main groups of decomposer. They release enzymes to break down compounds, so that they can absorb the nutrients. We can preserve our food, for example by freezing or canning, to remove the conditions needed for decay to occur.

to our survival  it helps to digest food, and to recycle materials in our environment. Sometimes it can cause problems too, such as food spoilage (food going off).
. Bacteria are single-celled microscopic organisms. Fungi are often larger organisms that include moulds and mushrooms. They both cause decay by releasing
which break down compounds in their food so it can be absorbed by their cells. Organisms that feed on
High temperatures prevent decay, low temperatures slow decay
High temperatures destroy enzymes and proteins, killing the organisms responsible for decay. Low temperatures slow the rate of reaction of enzymes and will prevent growth and reproduction.
Lack of oxygen will slow or prevent most forms of decay
Oxygen is needed for respiration by organisms. Some bacteria can survive without oxygen, such as those used in biogas generators.
Lack of water will slow or prevent decay
Water is needed for transport and to support reactions inside organisms. Decay organisms need water to digest their food.
Decomposers such as bacteria and fungi cause decay at
level. Other larger organisms help speed up decay by feeding on dead matter and breaking it down into smaller pieces, so increasing the surface area for the bacteria and fungi.
that help break down dead leaves, woodlice that break down wood and maggots that feed on animal tissue. These larger organisms are

It is often better to display data in a table. This section will look at different ways to organise data, and revise the following terms:
are the groups the data is organised into.
are the boundaries between one class and the next.
is the difference between the upper class boundary and lower class boundary.
of the class is the mean of the upper and lower class boundaries.
The table shows the number of people on 12 different buses. Discrete data is normally grouped in the following way:
From the table we can see that there were 7 buses with 7-9 people on them. But we have no way of telling
how many people were on each bus.
Now look at the class widths: they are all 3.
The midpoints of the classes are 5, 8, 11 and 14, as shown in red.
There are many ways to represent continuous data in a table.
This table showd the heights (h) of 25 people. The class widths are all 10.
The class boundaries are 120, 130, 140, 150 and 160.
The midpoints of the classes are 125, 135, 145 and 155, shown in red.
The class boundaries are 109.5, 129.5, 149.5, 169.5 and 189.5.
The midpoints of the classes are 119.5, 139.5, 159.5 and 179.5.
The class boundaries are 1.5, 4.5, 7.5, 10.5 and 14.5.
The class widths are all 3, except the last one whcih is 4.
The midpoints of the classes are 3, 6, 9 and 12.5.
This table looks very similar to the table in example 2, and you might assume that the class boundaries are 20.5, 30.5 etc - but they are not! Remember that if you are 16 now, you will be 16 right up until your 17
Therefore, the class boundaries are 21, 31, 41, 51 and 61.
The midpoints of the classes are 26, 36, 46 and 56.
The chances of you trying this activity are high!

The sequence of events in a narrative; a story
is a book about growing up. The reader meets Pip when he is seven, and follows his life until he meets Estella again (after 11 years apart) at the age of 35.
The proper term for this kind of story is the German word
A type of novel that tells about the the early moral, psychological, and intellectual development of the main character. The Harry Potter books are a modern day example.
The fact that Pip is also the narrator of the story makes it more instructive, because he is able to interpret the meaning of what is happening, as well as see it through a child's eyes.
The reader lives Pip's life with him, and we see:
the way contact with rich people makes him dissatisfied.
how coming into money makes him shallow and selfish, and unhappy.
how trying to find love with a beautiful, yet cruel, girl makes him unhappy - the plain, good girl would have been better.
how disappointments change his character for the better.
how Pip is happier when he settles down to a decent living through hard work - this is one of the main messages of the novel.

2980,"You are not planning just for the sake of planning. The whole idea is that planning helps you manage your work, and allows you to work more efficiently. Try to show this in the evidence you produce.
In your work, show the development of each product. Refer back to your original plans, comment on the things that went well and the things you had to do differently.
In your overall plan, include a section for each task, explaining the difference between what you planned and what you actually did. Describe how you used your plan.

Ask your teacher to check your presentation for you before you learn it, or send it in to SOS Teacher.
As you learn it, keep breaking it down into separate headings or pictures, until you have gone from a page of A4 to a small piece of paper with a maximum of 5 headings.
If you are talking about different subjects, draw them, and try talking around the pictures. The more picture associations you can find, the easier it will be to remember your presentation on the day.
Practise your talk with another person, or record it on to a minidisc or cassette, or onto your computer, and play it back. If you haven't been through the whole thing a few times, you won't know if you can remember all the points you want to make.

> Astronomy and space science - Satellites
are built by people and launched by rockets into space, where they orbit around the Earth. These are some of the things that artificial satellites are used for:
communications, including broadcasting television programmes and relaying telephone calls
Global Positioning System (GPS) and Galileo satellites for navigation
collecting information to help with weather forecasts
Hubble Space Telescope - image courtesy of NASA
Some satellites are used to collect information about the planets and stars. The
can see further into space than telescopes based on the ground. Its view is not blocked by clouds and it doesn't have to wait for night-time. However, it is difficult and expensive to launch and maintain. If anything goes wrong, only astronauts can fix it.
orbit the Earth. Instead, they travel to other planets to collect scientific information. Some space probes go into orbit around other planets, some land on them, and some even journey out of the solar system.
People have flown to the Moon and landed on it. But so far that is the furthest people have travelled from Earth. It takes years to travel to other planets, like Mars, and people have not done this yet.

375,"> Preparing, planning and checking - Spelling
It's important that you check the accuracy of your spelling in your written work. Here are some common errors to watch out for:
Not dropping the final ""e"" before adding ""-ing"".
Errors in forming plurals in words that end in ""-y"".
Homophones (words that sound the same but are spelt differently and have different meanings), like ""to"", ""two"" and ""too"".
Problems with two vowels in the middle of words, such as ea, ou and ie
Problems with words that we sometimes shorten when we say them, like ""probly"" for ""probably"".
Certain words could also cause trouble, so look for any ways of remembering them. Sometimes the oddest ideas are the easiest to remember, like Big Elephants Can Always Understand Small Elephants, which gives us 'because'. Here are a few more to help you:
Separate - there is a rat in separate.
Receive - i before e except after c.
Here and there are all about place.
You'll need 2 walking sticks if you fall off a wall.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The wedding night
Juliet can't wait for her wedding night. But when the Nurse tells her what happened to Tybalt, Juliet doesn't know whether to love or hate Romeo. She can't believe that he is being sent away and threatens to kill herself, so the Nurse promises to find Romeo and bring him to Juliet's bedroom.
Friar Lawrence is hiding Romeo. When he tells Romeo what Prince Escalus has decided, Romeo says that he would rather die than be sent away. The Nurse arrives. Romeo tries to stab himself, but the Nurse and the Friar stop him. The Friar gives Romeo a good telling off for being so ungrateful and for behaving like a girl! He and the Nurse arrange for Romeo to spend his last night in Verona with Juliet as long as he promises to leave for Mantua first thing in the morning.
The Capulets are grieving for Tybalt. Paris comes to see Juliet but she won't come down from her bedroom. Capulet tells Paris that he will sort things out between them because he is sure his daughter will do what he tells her to do. He suggests that Paris marries her on ThursdayIt is now Monday.
Romeo and Juliet have spent the night together. Juliet hears a lark (larks sing at dawn), but tries to persuade Romeo that it was a nightingale (nightingales sing at night) because she doesn't want the night to end. When Romeo says that he will stay and face death for her, Juliet changes her mind and makes him hurry to get up and leave. Juliet has a premonition of him dead in a grave.

192,"The beginning of a text is crucial to its success. If the start is weak, there is a risk that the reader will lose interest and stop reading it.
Here is the opening paragraph of a text about boxing:
Boxing, amongst other hand-to-hand fighting, has been with us for thousands of years. Originally it was nothing more than bare fist fighting between two willing, and sometimes unwilling, competitors for the entertainment of others. Some people argue that it is a relatively safe, disciplined, highly skilled and technical sport that brings enjoyment and employment to a great many people. Others claim that it is a dangerous and barbaric spectacle that has no place in the civilised world. This article will explore each side's claim in more detail.
Why is this an effective opening for the text?
It is totally in keeping with the title.
It uses a formal, impersonal tone, which is appropriate for an argument text.
It gives a summary of both sides of the argument.
Let's consider some alternative beginnings and see if they are suitable. Decide what you think of each one and then read our comments below.
This article will talk about the damage that can be inflicted when two men stand face-to-face with the sole intention of knocking each other out with their fists. It will go on to argue that boxing, or legitimate assault, has no place in the twenty first century.
This extract certainly gets straight to the point. Although this beginning is quite formal, it is certainly not impersonal as the writer lets the reader know exactly what they think about boxing. The reader can be sure about what the answer to the question in the title will be from the first sentence.
The bell goes and the two warriors approach each other. They are quick. They are strong. They are hard. They are ready to hurt and be hurt.
A left fist launches and connects with a nose. The crowd are on their feet. Cheering. Wanting more. Wanting blood.
This is prose rather than a non-fictional argument. It uses descriptive and figurative language. It could be the opening of a short story or a novel.

Approximation - Rounding to the nearest whole number
It is not always necessary to give the exact number. For example, if there were 54 785 inhabitants in a town, you could say that its population was approximately 55 000.
By doing this we have rounded 54 785 to the nearest thousand to give 55 000.
What is 1484.5 to the nearest 1000?
It is between 1000 and 2000, but it is closer to 1000, so round down.
1484.5 rounded to the nearest thousand is 1000.
What is 1484.5 to the nearest 100?
1484.5 is between 1400 and 1500, but it is closer to 1500, so round up.
1484.5 rounded to the nearest hundred is 1500.
1484.5 lies between 1480 and 1490, but it is closer to 1480, so round down.
1484.5 rounded to the nearest ten is 1480.
1484.5 lies between 1484 and 1485 and it is exactly halfway between them. In this situation round up.
1484.5 rounded to the nearest whole number is 1485.

291,"Muscles work by getting shorter. We say that they
, and the process is called contraction.
Muscles are attached to bones by strong
. When a muscle contracts, it pulls on the bone, and the bone can move if it is part of a joint.
Muscles can only pull and cannot push. This would be a problem if a joint was controlled by just one muscle. As soon as the muscle had contracted and pulled on a bone, that would be it, with no way to move the bone back again. The problem is solved by having muscles in pairs, called
The elbow joint lets our forearm move up or down. It is controlled by two muscles, the
on the front of the upper arm, and the
on the back of the upper arm. The biceps and the triceps are
when the biceps muscle contracts, the forearm moves up
when the triceps muscle contracts, the forearm moves down.
This solves the problem. To lift the forearm, the biceps contracts and the triceps relaxes. To lower the forearm again, the triceps contracts and the biceps relaxes.

56,"> More on formulas - Multiplying expressions
Algebraic expressions can be multiplied in the same way as numbers.
Remember that 2a is not the same as a
= a  a  a, so:
= a  a  a  a  a = a
Remember that x is the same as x
2  3a means 2  3  a which is 6a
4a  5a means 4  a  5  a which is 4  5  a  a = 20a
= 2  p  3  p  p
= 2  3  p  p  p

555,"Sometimes your teacher will 'hot seat' a student at a crucial moment in the book or play that the class is reading. That person has to pretend they are the character in the story at that very moment. They have to speak, think and feel as though they are that character.
If you've read any of the books and plays below, you could practise the art of 'hot seating'. Focus on the emotions (eg surprise, excitement, terror, anger, happiness, sadness, confusion) that your character is feeling at that moment.
Harry Potter after his first kiss in The Order of the Phoenix.
Lyra as she watches Lord Asriel kissing Marisa Coulter in Northern Lights.
Ferdinand in The Tempest when Ariel sings the song that makes him think that his dad is dead.
Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, when she discovers that Tybalt has been killed.
Hot seating helps actors get into character. If you can think, feel and speak like that character, an audience is more likely to believe you are that character.

Atoms and elements - The periodic table
All the different elements are arranged in a chart called the
Elements in the same group are similar to each other.
The metals are on the left and the non-metals are on the right.
One non-metal, hydrogen, is often put in the middle.
The main groups are numbered from 1 to 7 going from left to right, and the last group on the right is group 0.
The zig-zag line in this diagram separates the
, on the right. Hydrogen is a non-metal but it is often put in the middle.
Notice that most elements are metals, rather than non-metals.
Each element has its own chemical symbol, made from letters. Remember that you will only find elements in the periodic table and never compounds. So don't try to look for substances like water and copper sulfate in the periodic table, because they are not there.

616,"> The Tempest Summary - The ending
This is the scene where Prospero forgives Alonso, and also tells Sebastian and Antonio he will keep their plan to kill Alonso secret, forgiving them both too. Later he even forgives Trinculo and Stephano.
Prospero tells Alonso that he has lost his daughter, just as Alonso (who still thinks Ferdinand is drowned) has lost his son - but he means in marriage. He draws back a curtain to show the two young lovers playing chess.
The ship's captain brings news that the ship is safe, and all prepare for the return to Naples for the wedding of Ferdinand and Miranda.
All except for Ariel, who is given his freedom, and Caliban, who will stay on the island.

Magnets and electric current - Magnetic fields
Before we look at electromagnets let's recap
They fill the space around a magnet where the magnetic forces work, where they can attract or repel magnetic materials.
Although we cannot see magnetic fields, we can detect them using
. The tiny pieces of iron line up in a magnetic field.
It would be difficult to draw the results from the sort of experiment seen in the photograph, so we draw simple magnetic field lines instead.
the field lines have arrows on them
the field lines come out of N and go into S
the field lines are more concentrated at the poles.
The magnetic field is strongest at the poles, where the field lines are most concentrated.

629,"> Polygons - Angle of a regular polygon
Polygons - Angle of a regular polygon
We have already seen that the sum of the exterior angles is 360 and that the interior and the exterior angles add up to 180. Use this information to find the exterior and interior angles of regular polygons.
Find the exterior and interior angle of a regular pentagon.
A pentagon has 5 sides and 5 exterior angles, and the exterior angles add up to 360
one exterior angle = 360  5 = 72
interior angle = 180 - exterior angle = 180 - 72 = 108

538,"> Romeo and Juliet Summary - The plan
Romeo and Juliet Summary - The plan
Juliet's mother tells her to cheer up because her father has arranged for her to marry Paris. Juliet loses her temper and refuses. Her father comes in and can't believe how ungrateful she is being. He threatens to throw her out and disown her. He says he wants to hit her. She asks her mother to stand up for her, but she refuses.
The Nurse tells Juliet to forget Romeo and marry Paris
When Juliet's mother and father have left, Juliet asks the Nurse what she should do. The Nurse says to forget Romeo and just marry Paris without owning up. In those days, that would have been a sin, and to marry two people at once would mean that she would be sent to hell. Juliet says that she will do what the Nurse suggests, but when she leaves the room, Juliet says to herself that the Nurse is two-faced. She decides to see if Friar Lawrence will help her. If not, she thinks she will have to commit suicide.
Paris goes to visit Friar Lawrence to arrange his wedding to Juliet. The Friar tries to stall for more time. When Juliet arrives, she gives Paris 'the cold shoulder' until he leaves. She begs the Friar to help her, threatening to kill herself. The Friar has a plan if Juliet has the guts to carry it through. He knows of a drug that will make her seem as though she is dead for forty-two hours. This will mean that she will be put in the family tomb along with Tybalt. Then the Friar will let Romeo know the truth, so that he can come and take her away when she wakes up and they can go off together to Mantua. Juliet isn't scared. She takes the drug home with her.
Everyone is busy with wedding preparations at the Capulets' house. Capulet is in a good mood. Juliet tells her father that she has been to see the Friar to confess her sins and asks for her dad's forgiveness. Even the Nurse believes her.
Juliet says good night to her mum then starts to panic about what she is about to do. She might die. She might go mad when she wakes up in a tomb full of dead people. There might be ghosts. She imagines that she sees Tybalt's ghost. She takes the poison and falls unconscious on her bed.
The Nurse finds Juliet and thinks she is dead. She is beside herself with grief. The family comes running and her mother and father can't believe it. Friar Lawrence arrives pretending that he has come to take Juliet to church to marry Paris. Paris comes and is shocked at the news.

Atmosphere and setting - Identify implicit meaning
Now's your chance to see if you can spot implicit meaning. Read the following extract from a short story by HG Wells.
what sort of atmosphere Wells was trying to create
the way he used figurative language to do this

The long, draughty, subterranean [which means underground] passage was chilly and dusty, and my candle flared and
. The echoes rang up and down the spiral staircase, and
a shadow came sweeping up after me
into the darkness overhead. I came along the landing and stopped there for a moment, listening to a rustling sound that I fancied I heard; then, satisfied of the absolute silence, I pushed open the baize-covered door and stood in the corridor.
What sort of atmosphere is Wells trying to create and how does he use figurative language to do this?
The writer is trying to create an atmosphere of fear and tension in the extract. He describes the passage as being ""draughty"" and mentions that it is underground. This makes it seem creepy and ghostly. The fact that the character only has a candle to light his way makes the story seem old-fashioned, and also creates drama because we know that the draught could blow it out! The way the echoes ""rang up and down"" and the fact that the man stops because he thinks he hears a sound, adds to the ghostly effects.
The shadows also help to create a sinister atmosphere as they flicker around and make it even harder for the man to see what's ahead. The writer uses figurative language such as personification to describe them. He says that they ""cower and quiver"", come ""sweeping up"" and that they ""fled"". All of this makes them sound alive, or perhaps like ghosts. The words used are all linked with fear, so that even the shadows seem to be afraid of what's in the corridor. This is very eerie and helps to create a very tense atmosphere.

378,"The environment, the Earth and the universe
Animals and plants can wear away rocks. This is called
weathering. For example, burrowing animals such as rabbits can burrow into a crack in a rock, making it bigger and splitting the rock.
You may have seen weeds growing through cracks in the pavement. If you have gone for a walk in the countryside, you may even have seen bushes or trees growing from cracks in rocks or disused buildings. This is because
can grow in cracks. As they grow bigger, the roots push open the cracks and make them wider and deeper. Eventually pieces of rock may fall away.
People can even cause biological weathering just by walking. Over time, paths in the countryside become damaged because of all the boots and shoes wearing them away.

470,"> Negative numbers - Adding and subtracting
To add and subtract numbers always begin counting from zero.
When dealing with positive numbers count to the right.
When dealing with negative numbers count to the left.
Imagine moving up and down a number line to get to the answer.
Starting from zero, count up to 4. Then subtract 5. Then subtract 3. The answer is -4.
Calculate: - 2 + 9 - 10 + 6
If you wrote the answer 3 or +3, then well done!
When adding or subtracting negative numbers, remember that when two signs appear next to each other and are different, then you subtract. When two signs are next to each other and they are the same, you add:
a) 10 + - 7 = 10 - 7 = 3
b) 4 - -3 = 4 + 3 = 7

The Tempest second key extract - Performance
There are a lot of different ways to perform a particular scene. How is the drama created in the two Key Extracts?
From the table below, you will see there are elements of the two Key Extracts that are quite similar. But whereas there is a lot of conflict in the first extract, the second one is full of romance. This needs to be brought out in the performance.
Prospero is in control of the action. He even slows the pace down at one point to suit his own ends. He could be compared to Shakespeare, moving the plot forward and molding events.
Prospero watches from a distance and comments occasionally but does not interfere. It is as though he is part of the audience.
Is a more gentle and humorous end to what has been a very tense and action-packed scene.
A moving and romantic extract that contrasts with the scene before it which is full of Mercutio's rude jokes.
Ariel is present at the beginning. Prospero uses magic to prevent Ferdinand from using his sword. Ferdinand seems to submit very quickly at the end of this extract, as though magic may have had some part to play.
There is no sign of magic in this extract. The setting is very ordinary as Ferdinand carries logs to Prospero's cave. Any ""magic"" that exists is in the form of the power of love.
Both Ferdinand and Miranda seem bewildered by their feelings.
Ferdinand and Miranda are bursting to reveal their true feelings to each other.
The tone changes quickly within this scene that contains violence and anger.
The tone remains calm. This is a very moving scene.
Once you understand how the audience should feel, you can decide how you might direct particular parts of the play.
Answer the question you have, not the question you would like.

Romeo and Juliet first key extract - Performance
When you write about performance, mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:
haracters and how you respond to them
anguage used - the detail about love, for example
ssues and ideas - like time, love and hate
Once you understand how the audience should feel, you can decide how you might direct a particular scene. Remember, there are lots of different ways to perform the same scene. A good answer depends on how well you explain yourself.
Here is an example of an answer to a question about performance. Think about how you might answer the same question.
How should an actor playing Benvolio behave?
Benvolio's replies to Romeo could either show that he is a good listener who wants to understand his friend's problems, or that he is amused by what Romeo has to say because he knows that his friend is not serious about this girl.
When Benvolio speaks to Montague, the mood is serious. When Romeo arrives, he has to ask lots of questions because Romeo is evasive. Some of Benvolio's comments could be said in a sarcastic or sympathetic way. The jokes that the two characters share show that they are good friends. Benvolio gives advice at the end of the scene that shows that he doesn't believe Romeo's love for Rosaline is serious.
The way Benvolio behaves towards Romeo shapes the way the audience perceives Romeo. This is important because Romeo is the main character. The audience has to like him and worry about him for the tragedy to work. If the actor playing Benvolio speaks his lines in a patient and sympathetic way, it makes Romeo seem like a young man who finds the world confusing. If Benvolio's lines are spoken humorously, the comedy in Romeo's speeches will be brought to life.

> Changes in the environment - Pollution
Living things produce waste materials, such as urine and faeces. Humans produce these, too, but they also produce other waste materials. These materials can pollute the environment. They include:
Rubbish is taken to a landfill site
Rubbish does not vanish when it is thrown away. A lot of it is buried in
sites. These may be disused quarries or rough ground that cannot be used for farming or housing. When landfill sites are full of rubbish, they are covered in soil and planted with trees and bushes.
rubbish is important because fewer landfill sites are needed, and the materials in the rubbish are re-used.
Fertilisers are chemicals used by farmers to help their crops grow well. Rain can wash fertilizers off the fields and into rivers. This causes water plants to overgrow and block out the light. Other plants die as a result. They use up oxygen as they rot away, and fish and other animals suffocate. This process is called eutrophication.
Smoke from burning fuels makes buildings turn black. With other waste chemicals in the air, it can form smog. This makes the air hazy, especially over large towns and cities. The polluted air can make it difficult to breathe.
are produced when fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas burn. Sulfur dioxide dissolves in the clouds and causes acid rain. This damages buildings, trees and harms life in rivers and lakes. It also causes chemical weathering of rocks to happen much faster than normal.

In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
Before this scene, Prospero and his slave, Caliban have exchanged cross words.
The First Key Extract begins with Ferdinand hearing Ariel's song.
Ariel's song calms the stormy waters. In 'The Tempest', music is linked closely to magic and illusion.
He wonders where the sounds are coming from.
Illusion - Ferdinand does not know where the sound is coming from. He assumes that it is magic and tells us that the music not only calmed the storm, but also made him feel better.
He follows the sound, and when the song begins again, it suggests to Ferdinand that his father has drowned.
When Miranda sees Ferdinand approaching, she can't believe her eyes. She doesn't think that Ferdinand is real.
Illusion - Ferdinand is a living human being, but Miranda is convinced that he is a magical creature. In 'The Tempest', things are never quite as they at first seem.
Prospero explains that he is a man, not a spirit and that he is looking for other survivors of the shipwreck. Prospero feels excited that Miranda and Ferdinand seem to like each other: it was his plan all along
Power - Prospero claims that he has used magic to make Miranda and Ferdinand fall in love. Prospero likes to control and manipulate people through his magic.
, and he promises to reward Ariel with his freedom for helping to get them together.
Ferdinand asks Miranda if she is an ordinary girl or a goddess.
Miranda can't believe that Ferdinand is an ordinary mortal. She thinks he's a 'spirit'. She calls him 'divine' and 'noble'. Ferdinand refers to her as a 'goddess'. The language they use suggests that they worship one another.
He is shocked when she speaks his language. When he hints that he is the King of Naples, Prospero challenges him.
Prospero likes to be in control. As soon as Ferdinand suggests that he has any sort of power, Prospero tries to undermine him. Prospero's questions are sarcastic and mocking in his attempt to show Ferdinand who is boss.
Ferdinand sadly explains that he believes that his father, the King of Naples, has drowned in the shipwreck along with the Duke of Milan and his son. Prospero watches Ferdinand and thinks to himself that he will be able to manipulate him easily now that Ferdinand is in love with his daughter.
Think carefully about what kind of man Prospero is. Is he a caring father who will do anything to get the best for his daughter? Is he manipulative and controlling? Love is a powerful emotion. Should people use love to control others?
Miranda can't understand why her father is being so abrupt with Ferdinand. She has fallen in love at first sight with Ferdinand.
Love - Miranda admits that she has feelings for Ferdinand. It is the first time she has ever felt this way. Do you think that she would have fallen in love with Ferdinand even without Prospero's magic?
She wishes that her father could see things from her point of view.
When Ferdinand offers to make Miranda his queen, Prospero steps in. He is worried that his plan won't work if Ferdinand wins Miranda's heart too easily.
Prospero says: 'But this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning/Make the prize light'. He means that he can't let Ferdinand think that it was too easy to get Miranda to be his girlfriend, because he might not treat her well if it's really easy to make her love him.
He says that Ferdinand is lying about being a king and accuses him of being a spy.
Power/ Illusion - Prospero wants to manipulate Ferdinand. He will make him suffer and work hard for Miranda's love. When Ferdinand claims to have some power of his own as the heir to the throne, Prospero takes this power away by accusing him of being a spy and taking him prisoner. Prospero knows that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne. 'The Tempest' is all about the confusion between what is true and real, and what is illusion.
Miranda tries to speak up for him
You might think that Miranda is brave to speak up for Ferdinand. Apart from being a powerful magician, Prospero has quite a temper! Her speech also shows us how innocent she is. She can't believe that anyone who looks so lovely on the outside can be anything other than lovely on the inside. In 'The Tempest', Shakespeare shows us that things are not always as they first seem.
but Prospero tells her off and threatens to imprison Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Ferdinand a 'traitor'. He threatens to 'manacle' his neck and give him sea water to drink and acorn shells to eat. Prospero doesn't mean any of these threats, but in making them he shows that he has power over Ferdinand and could make him a slave just as he made Caliban his slave. Throughout the extract, Prospero uses words like 'usurp', 'traitor' and 'impostor' which all seem a bit strong when referring to Ferdinand. When Antonio took Prospero's place as Duke of Milan, he did 'usurp' him, and in doing so, he was a 'traitor' and in calling himself the Duke of Milan, Antonio is an 'imposter'.
When Ferdinand draws his sword, Prospero uses magic to make it impossible for Ferdinand to move.
Miranda tries desperately to stop her father but he won't listen. Ferdinand comes to the conclusion that all his problems - his father's death, the shipwreck, Prospero's threats - mean nothing, as long as he can see Miranda once a day, even if he is in prison.
Love/ Illusion - Ferdinand suddenly doesn't mind being Prospero's prisoner, as long as he has Miranda to love. He says it's all like a 'dream'. Does love have that kind of dream-like power to overcome difficulties? Or is it another one of Prospero's spells?
Prospero is pleased that his plan to make Ferdinand fall in love with Miranda has worked. He praises Ariel
Love/ Illusion - When Prospero tells Ariel that he has done well, this suggests that Miranda and Ferdinand's attraction towards one another is not true love, but a magic trick, an illusion, that Ariel has conjured.
Prospero promises Ariel that he will be free
Freedom and Slavery - Just as Prospero has made Caliban a slave and threatened to imprison Ferdinand, he has the power to set Ariel free. When Prospero arrived on the island, Ariel was trapped in a pine tree and Prospero set him free, so he has a debt of gratitude towards him. Also, Ariel is gentle whereas Prospero has a temper. It could be that Ariel is a little afraid of his master.
if he carries out all of his commands. Ariel agrees. Prospero orders Ferdinand to follow him and tells Miranda not to try and speak up for him.
Ariel's song calms the stormy waters. In 'The Tempest', music is linked closely to magic and illusion.
Illusion - Ferdinand does not know where the sound is coming from. He assumes that it is magic and tells us that the music not only calmed the storm, but also made him feel better.
Illusion - Ferdinand is a living human being, but Miranda is convinced that he is a magical creature. In 'The Tempest', things are never quite as they at first seem.
Power - Prospero claims that he has used magic to make Miranda and Ferdinand fall in love. Prospero likes to control and manipulate people through his magic.
Miranda can't believe that Ferdinand is an ordinary mortal. She thinks he's a 'spirit'. She calls him 'divine' and 'noble'. Ferdinand refers to her as a 'goddess'. The language they use suggests that they worship one another.
Prospero likes to be in control. As soon as Ferdinand suggests that he has any sort of power, Prospero tries to undermine him. Prospero's questions are sarcastic and mocking in his attempt to show Ferdinand who is boss.
Think carefully about what kind of man Prospero is. Is he a caring father who will do anything to get the best for his daughter? Is he manipulative and controlling? Love is a powerful emotion. Should people use love to control others?
Love - Miranda admits that she has feelings for Ferdinand. It is the first time she has ever felt this way. Do you think that she would have fallen in love with Ferdinand even without Prospero's magic?
Prospero says: 'But this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning/Make the prize light'. He means that he can't let Ferdinand think that it was too easy to get Miranda to be his girlfriend, because he might not treat her well if it's really easy to make her love him.
Power/ Illusion - Prospero wants to manipulate Ferdinand. He will make him suffer and work hard for Miranda's love. When Ferdinand claims to have some power of his own as the heir to the throne, Prospero takes this power away by accusing him of being a spy and taking him prisoner. Prospero knows that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne. 'The Tempest' is all about the confusion between what is true and real, and what is illusion.
You might think that Miranda is brave to speak up for Ferdinand. Apart from being a powerful magician, Prospero has quite a temper! Her speech also shows us how innocent she is. She can't believe that anyone who looks so lovely on the outside can be anything other than lovely on the inside. In 'The Tempest', Shakespeare shows us that things are not always as they first seem.
Prospero calls Ferdinand a 'traitor'. He threatens to 'manacle' his neck and give him sea water to drink and acorn shells to eat. Prospero doesn't mean any of these threats, but in making them he shows that he has power over Ferdinand and could make him a slave just as he made Caliban his slave. Throughout the extract, Prospero uses words like 'usurp', 'traitor' and 'impostor' which all seem a bit strong when referring to Ferdinand. When Antonio took Prospero's place as Duke of Milan, he did 'usurp' him, and in doing so, he was a 'traitor' and in calling himself the Duke of Milan, Antonio is an 'imposter'.
Love/ Illusion - Ferdinand suddenly doesn't mind being Prospero's prisoner, as long as he has Miranda to love. He says it's all like a 'dream'. Does love have that kind of dream-like power to overcome difficulties? Or is it another one of Prospero's spells?
Love/ Illusion - When Prospero tells Ariel that he has done well, this suggests that Miranda and Ferdinand's attraction towards one another is not true love, but a magic trick, an illusion, that Ariel has conjured.
Freedom and Slavery - Just as Prospero has made Caliban a slave and threatened to imprison Ferdinand, he has the power to set Ariel free. When Prospero arrived on the island, Ariel was trapped in a pine tree and Prospero set him free, so he has a debt of gratitude towards him. Also, Ariel is gentle whereas Prospero has a temper. It could be that Ariel is a little afraid of his master.

367,"The extract below is about zombies. Note down your answers to the questions that follow and then check them against ours.
""The eyes were the worst. It was not my imagination. They were in truth like the eyes of a dead man, not blind, but staring, unfocused, unseeing. The whole face, for that matter, was bad enough. It was vacant, as if there was nothing behind it. It seemed not only expressionless, but incapable of expression. I had seen so much previously in Haiti that was outside the ordinary normal experience that for the flash of a second I had a sickening, almost panicky lapse in which I thought, or rather felt, ""Great God, maybe this stuff really is true..."".
This is how William Seabrook described his encounter with one of the most horrifying creatures ever to step from the realms of the supernatural. For Seabrook was face-to-face with a zombie - a walking corpse. And in that moment he was prepared to believe all that he had heard about zombies since he first arrived on the island of Haiti.
The zombie's fate is even worse than that of a vampire or werewolf. The vampire returns to his loved ones. He may be recognised and laid to rest. The werewolf may be wounded and regain human form. But the zombie is a mindless automaton (robot), doomed to live out a twilight existence of brutish toil (animal-like labour). A zombie can eat, move, hear, even speak, but he has no memory of his past or knowledge of his present condition. He may pass by his own home or gaze into the eyes of his loved ones without a glimmer of recognition.
Neither ghost nor person, the zombie is said to be trapped, possibly forever, in that ""misty zone that divides life from death"". For while the vampire is the living dead, the zombie is merely the walking dead - a body without soul or mind raised from the grave and given a semblance (appearance) of life through sorcery. He is the creature of the sorcerer, who uses him as a slave or hires him out - usually to walk on the land.
From 'The Book of Great Mysteries' edited by Colin Wilson and Christopher Evans.

Diet, drugs and health - Smoking and health
Most people start smoking before they are adults
Smoking is very harmful to health. It causes around 80 per cent of deaths from
in the UK, and almost a fifth of UK deaths from
Tobacco smoke contains many harmful substances. These include:
A normal lung and a lung from a smoker:
of the lungs, mouth and throat. It coats the surface of the breathing tubes and the alveoli. This causes coughing and damages the alveoli, making it more difficult for gas exchange to happen.
Cells in the lining of the breathing tubes produce sticky mucus to trap dirt and microbes. Cells with tiny hair-like parts, called
, normally move the mucus out of the lungs.
Hot smoke and tar from smoking damages the cilia. So smokers cough to move the mucus and are more likely to get
- it causes a smoker to want more cigarettes. Nicotine also increases the heart rate and blood pressure, and makes blood vessels narrower than normal. This can lead to heart disease.
Carbon monoxide is a gas that takes the place of oxygen in red blood cells. This reduces the amount of oxygen that the blood can carry. This means that the circulatory system has to work harder, causing heart disease.

420,"Standard English is the style of English grammar, spelling and vocabulary that is widely accepted in spoken and written English. In formal speaking and listening situations, you will need to communicate using Standard English, eg when writing or giving a speech.
The key to presenting the perfect speech is preparation and practice. World leaders don't just stand up and make up a speech on the spot - they carefully prepare beforehand. They even employ people to write their speeches, although remember, this is not an option at school!

527,"Every December, certain beaches and islands along the West Coast of the United States and Mexico fill with the sights and sounds of elephant seals. Visitors can't miss the huge animals, which make as much noise as a pack of motorcycles.
To learn about elephant seals, go to
Until recently, however, those beaches were quieter because elephant seals were almost extinct. But in the last few years, the seals have made one of the most amazing comebacks of any animal.
Nearly a century ago, only 100 elephant seals were left in the wild. Hunters had killed the animals for their
, or fat, which was used to make lamp oil to light people's homes. In addition, their skins were often used for clothing.
In 1972, the U.S. government passed a law protecting elephant seals. Now, because of that law, more than 150,000 of the seals live in the wild.
Elephant seals spend much of the year swimming in the Pacific Ocean, far from shore. The seals are looking for food, such as fish and squid. They can swim about 35 miles from shore and dive as deep as 5,000 feet below the ocean surface to search for food. (That's about as deep as a whale can dive!)
By December, elephant seals head for beaches in California and Mexico. They hit the beaches to mate and raise their young. When male elephant seals, called
, haul themselves out of the water, they can weigh as much as 4,500 pounds, or two small cars.
Ao Nuevo is Spanish for ""New Year.""
The world's largest colony of elephant seals spends the winter at the Ao Nuevo State Reserve in California. As many as 5,000 elephant seals spend the winter there. Visitors to the reserve can see the giant seals. One visitor said the animals are ""a cross between a beanbag and a Volkswagen bug.""
However, visitors have to watch out for the giant animals. Seals may look fat and slow, but they anger quickly and can move 20 feet in two seconds.
Some visitors are scientists who want to figure out ways to help seals survive.
One way scientists have learned about elephant seals is by attaching radios to the backs of the animals. The radios send out signals. The radios have helped scientists learn how far and how deep elephant seals swim.

396,"Recently, Vice President Al Gore invited two
kid reporters to interview him. Fifth grader Daniel Calderone and sixth grader Kimberly Hernandez caught up with the vice president at the Elizabeth Avenue Learning Center in Cudahy, California.
""I was very excited and kind of nervous when I learned that I was going to interview the vice president of the United States,"" said Calderone.
The two reporters asked the vice president questions that kids from around the United States sent to
Who is your hero or role model? Why?
My father and mother were heroes and role models for me, because I really respected the way they lived their lives and tried to make our country a better place.
What do you plan to do about kid safety and keeping guns out of schools?
I'm for common sense restrictions on guns. I think that we should have tougher laws against guns falling into the hands of the wrong people. I think that we should have mandatory child-safety trigger locks. I think that we should have a photo license ID requirement for the purchase of a new handgun. I think that we should have a limit on the number of handguns per month that could be bought--a limit of one. And I think these kinds of common sense gun safety measures would help to save a lot of lives.
Yes, I'm an environmentalist, and I want to protect the environment--the air, the water, the land, and the Earth itself.
What will you do about pollution and global warming?
I've worked on the problem of global warming for more than 20 years. I believe that we need to build new kinds of cars and trucks that make much less pollution. And I think that we can create a lot of good jobs by building and selling the new kinds of technologies that the rest of the world is trying to buy.
Some people say we have an immigration problem. What will you do about immigrants?
I would end discrimination against immigrants, because we are a nation of immigrants. I would enact a hate crimes law and enforce the civil rights law. And I would focus especially on the Hispanic dropout problem and have an intensive program to increase the high school graduation rate and the college attendance rate.

211,"The Hubble Space Telescope recently snapped a photo of the lair of the Red Spider. The Red Spider is actually a huge cloud of gas in space, called a
, that some scientists think looks like a giant spider. It is helping scientists learn more about how stars die.
The Red Spider Nebula surrounds one of the hottest stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Earth is located in the Milky Way.
The star has a surface temperature of at least 900,000 degrees Fahrenheit (F). In comparison, our sun has a surface temperature of only 10,000 degrees F.
The Red Spider Nebula formed when the star began to run out of fuel and exploded, pushing gases in its atmosphere away from the star. The remaining star collapsed to form a white dwarf star. White dwarfs are very small and very hot.
The tremendous heat from the star warms the nebula, causing it to glow red. The gases in the nebula reach temperatures of 18,000 degrees F.

follows a clownfish that is scooped up from the Great Barrier Reef.
In real life, clownfish are among the thousands of colorful sea creatures that call the Great Barrier Reef home.
Stretching 1,250 miles along Australia's northeastern coast, the Great Barrier Reef is the longest coral reef in the world. A
But these days, the Great Barrier Reef has found itself in trouble. Over fishing, pollution, and high temperatures are harming its health. That's why the government in Australia is trying to help rescue the reef.
While coral may look like a plant, it is actually made up of tiny sea animals. Those sea animals are called
As polyps die, they leave hard shells behind. Other polyps grow on top of the shells. Over thousands of years, they form a coral reef in warm water that is not very deep.
In many ways, the Great Barrier Reef resembles an underwater garden. Coral can be hard or soft. It forms in different colors and in strange shapes. Some coral looks like hardened brains. Other coral looks like fans and lettuces. The reef bursts with schools of tropical fish, darting among gaps in the coral.
The reef supplies food and shelter to creatures living in and around the coral. Turtles, sharks, sea horses, and crabs are among its many inhabitants. The reef also acts as a barrier to keep waves from slamming against the shore.
While the reef is important to ocean life, it helps humans, too. People rely on the reef for both food and jobs. It also provides medicine used to treat disease. Each year, the Great Barrier Reef contributes about $975 million to the economy through tourism and fishing.
Is it surprising, then, that the Great Barrier Reef is under too much stress? Fishing nets and ships break off sections and damage the reef. Air and water pollution are also doing harm. At the same time, warmer sea temperatures have caused
on half of the reef. The high temperatures cause the coral to turn white, often killing it.
In an effort to help save the reef, the government has limited fishing to two-thirds of it. That plan increases the number of ""green zones."" Those are areas that are off-limits to fishermen and boats. However, tourists and researchers can still visit them. Many fishermen are upset about the plan because they rely on the reef for jobs.
The Australian government says that its plan will help keep the reef safe from some threats. ""It is very important that we give the reef proper protection for the future,"" said one government official. ""The reef is Australia's greatest natural [treasure].""
Ships and fishing nets are destroying the Great Barrier Reef. They sometimes break off large sections of the reef.
The crown of thorns eats living coral. It has destroyed large areas of the Great Barrier Reef.
These soft, yellow coral polyps are shaped like tubes. They use their tentacles to catch food. Coral polyps are related to jellyfish.
This coral has been damaged. Do you see the white areas where the coral has been bleached?
Why do you think scientists sometimes refer to coral reefs as ""rain forests of the sea""?

33,"In some parts of the world, people have to learn how to deal with natural disasters. In Los Angeles, California, people cope with earthquakes. In Hawaii, people deal with volcanoes. And in southeastern France, people fear herds of wild pigs.
. The animals are a cross between a wild boar
. The pigs are eating everything they can find.
""The other night I was woken up by a strange noise,"" said Christian Deschamps, who lives in France. ""I went outside, taking my dog with me as a precaution, and found a
[a female pig] and her piglets eating my lawn.""
Marcel Laugier, a local wildlife officer, said, ""They're everywhere. It's like a plague. They come into areas and dig through bins and dig up lawns and drink out of swimming pools. I get a constant stream of calls from people complaining about them.""
To solve the problem, officials in France are now trying to control the pig population through hunting. Officials hope that fewer pigs will cause fewer problems for the people of France.

Students at Sky Oaks Elementary School in Burnsville, Minnesota, learn chess as part of the curriculum. ""It's fun to play,"" said Alex Powell, a fourth-grade student at Sky Oaks.
Chess is a game of skill between two players. It likely began during the 7th century in India. The object of the game is to
, or trap, the other person's king.
Studies show that playing chess sharpens critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. ""It helps kids with their schoolwork,"" said Alex's teacher, Ray Nyberg. ""They have to think and be analytical.""
Principal Patrick Flinn says that Sky Oaks has been teaching chess sessions to students for more than 15 years.

116,"Scientists are balancing animal populations out West.
Rocky Mountain moose are on the moveand they're flying firstclass. Wildlife workers are using helicopters to send Utah's moose to Colorado. In exchange, wildlife officials in Colorado are capturing bighorn sheep to send to Utah. The animal swap is part of a plan to keep the moose and sheep populations in both states healthy.
Rocky Mountain moose are on the move.
One of the largest moose hauls took place in January, when a single helicopter team captured 24 of the animals in a day. The moose are now roaming free in the Grand Mesa National Forest in Colorado, where the appearance of calves indicates that the moose population is growing. Colorado workers planned to hold up their end of the bargain by capturing 20 bighorn sheep to send to Utah in February.
""This year was a major group move,"" Stephanie Duckett, a biologist with the Colorado Division of Wildlife, told
Biologists are scientists who study living things. Duckett works at Grand Mesa, which didn't have any moose two years ago. ""So far we have moved 90 moose to the mesa,"" she says. Most of those animals came from Weber County, Utah, where the moose population is in trouble.
The moose in northern Utah are threatened by
That means there are too many animals for the environment to feed and support. Overpopulation can lead to animal starvation and disease. ""It's bad for the population and bad for the environment,"" says Duckett.
Wildlife officials often try to prevent overpopulation by issuing permits that allow hunters to kill more animals during hunting season. That wasn't an option with Utah's moose; many of them live on private land where hunting is
or not allowed. Instead, wildlife officials decided to make a trade.
""Here in northern Utah, we have too many moose, and we've lost a lot of our bighorn sheep population,"" Utah wildlife manager Justin Dolling told
Colorado had a healthy supply of bighorn sheep to send to Utah, and Colorado had plenty of room for Utah's extra moose.
Once they had a plan, wildlife officials had to find a way to safely catch the wild mooseone of the largest animal species in North America. They turned to animalcapture expert James Innes and his experienced team of helicopter ""moose muggers."" A moose mugger is an animal worker trained to capture a moose without harming it. ""We have zero tolerance for
Innes's helicopter chases a moose into a clearing by flying over the forest before dropping a net to catch the animal. Once the moose is down, a moose mugger jumps out of the hovering helicopter and secures the animal's legs. ""You have to use every trick in the book to tie them up,"" says Innes.
Once the moose is secured, it is placed in a canvas bag that hangs from the helicopter and then flown to a base camp. There, a veterinarian, or an animal doctor, gives the moose a checkup before it is placed on a truck and taken to its final destinationGrand Mesa.
Wildlife managers tackled the moose overpopulation problem in Utah by sending moose to areas where they would have enough food. The map shows how moose and bighorn sheep were swapped this year to keep both groups of animals healthy.

males up to 15 years, females up to 20 years
Adult moose are too large to be hunted by other animals. Human hunters are their only predator. Half of all moose scalves are killed by wolves, grizzly bears, or black bears.
How might other animals living in the same environment be hurt by moose overpopulation? How does the animal swap help solve that problem?

437,"Calling all couch potatoes: How much television do you watch each week? If you're like most American kids, you probably watch about three hours of television each day, says the TV-Turnoff Network.
From April 19 to 25, millions of Americans will break free from their TVs. That week marks the tenth anniversary of TV-Turnoff Week.
What is the goal of the week? ""It's not about giving up TV altogether,"" Frank Vespe, the head of TV-Turnoff Network told
. ""The week is about learning to be more conscious of how we spend our time. When kids turn off the TV, they open doors to a whole world of activities and experiences.""
Health experts caution that too much television time can contribute to poor school performance, cut into family time, and make people less active. Not getting enough exercise can lead to
So think about it. If you traded in your TV time, what would you like to do instead?
Number of hours each year a child watches TV: 1,023
Number of hours each year a child spends at school: 900
Number of TV commercials a child watches each year: 20,000
kid reporter Alex landed a slam-dunk interview with Shaquille O'Neal at the NBA All-Star Game in Los Angeles on February 15. The fourth grader edged out hundreds of reporters from around the world for a one-on-one with the basketball superstar, better known as Shaq.
An unexpected guest greeted a crew aboard a barge on the Thames River in London. A passing sea gull dropped a dangerous
(pih-RAHN-ah) onto the boat's deck. The fish had died just before it made its crash landing.
With razor-sharp teeth, piranhas are the most ferocious fish in the world. Officials were quick to assure Londoners that the Thames is safe. They believe that the 4-inch-long red-bellied piranha's owner probably released it into the river, where a sea gull picked it up.
Experts say that the temperature of the Thames is too cold for piranhas to survive. These warm-water fish are found mainly in South America.
Piranhas have a reputation that is worse than their bite, say some experts. ""Piranhas are generally nervous and are not the ferocious killers people think they are,"" said Paul Hale, the head of the London Aquarium. ""They prey on weak and injured animals, including fish, birds, and mammals.""

383,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is starring in a new scene, but this one isn't in a movie.
The actor recently announced that he is running for governor of California in the state's
election on October 7. The recall is a special election allowed by California law. People will vote whether to remove the current governor, Gray Davis, from office.
Some people in California are unhappy with the job that Davis is doing. They blame him for the state's money problems.
Schwarzenegger, the star of movies such as
and Kindergarten Cop, is one of many people running to replace Davis. The actor is getting a lot of attention because of his movie-star status.
Schwarzenegger is no stranger to politics. From 1990 to 1993, he headed the Council on Physical Fitness under President George H. W. Bush. In 2002, he helped raise millions of dollars for school programs in California.
Schwarzenegger isn't the first actor to try to make the move from Hollywood star to governor. Movie star Ronald Reagan was elected governor of California in 1966. He then served as U.S. president from 1981 to 1989.
Even if he is elected, Schwarzenegger won't be following Reagan's path to the White House. He was not born in the United States, which is a requirement for being president.

Mattie suffers from a rare form of
. That is a disease that weakens the muscles. Mattie is the 2003 National Goodwill Ambassador for the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
Poetry helps Mattie cope with his disease.
(WR) talked to Mattie for National Poetry Month, which is celebrated in April. Here's what he had to say:
: Why do you like writing poetry?
: I love writing poetry because it helps me say what's in my heart. [It also lets me] celebrate all the beautiful things in the world.
: About how many poems have you written?
: When did you begin to write poetry?
e: I started writing poetry when I was 3 years old. I'd say how I felt about something, and my mom would write it down. When I got a little older, I wrote it down myself.
: What are some common themes that run through your poetry?
: I like to write about seeing the hopeful side of things. I call my poems
because they're born in my heart and if I sit very still and listen, I can hear them.
: Where do you get the ideas for your poetry?
: The ideas for my poems come from everywhere-playing with a friend, or visiting the Vietnam War Memorial [in Washington, D.C.], or going to the hospital-just anything that happens.
: Can you tell us about your latest book of poetry,
has more than 60 poems, and they're about love-love of friends and nature and love of peace.
: What advice do you have for kids who might find writing poetry hard?
: I'd tell them... just think about something you care about and listen to your heart, and some words will come to you. Just say your feelings in your own words.
What are some things that might inspire you to write poetry?

224,"One of the world's biggest oil rigs sank into the Atlantic Ocean last month. The rig, called P-36, sank in the waters about 75 miles off the coast of Brazil, South America, after a series of explosions damaged a pillar supporting it.
The explosions killed ten workers and injured others. Workers struggled for days to save the rig, only to see it slowly topple over and sink into the ocean.
Officials from the Brazilian oil company Petrobras, which owns the rig, were concerned after some of the 400,000 gallons of diesel fuel and crude oil on the rig leaked out. But the spill turned out to be smaller than expected.
The problem now facing Brazil is the loss of oil production. The P-36 rig provided a large portion of the oil Brazil uses to make fuel. Now the country will have to import more oil from other countries to meet demands.

425,"You know the planets in our solar system. Name them quickly--Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. But how about JL55 and ION1999? Those are the names of two of nine planets scientists say they recently discovered outside our solar system.
Scientists working in Switzerland spotted six of the newly discovered planets. American scientists discovered the other three planets.
So far, the scientists have not seen the planets. Instead, they have seen nine distant stars wobble. Scientists know that as a planet orbits a star, it causes the star to wobble.
The discoveries bring the number of known planets outside our solar system to 50. Scientists say the discoveries increase the chances that life might exist elsewhere in the universe. They say some of those planets might be similar to Earth.

700,"Some people in southern France have been driving through the clouds. They have been traveling across the world's tallest bridge, located in the French city of Millau.
The president of France, Jacques Chirac, joined the celebration to open the bridge in December. He called the
a ""marvel of art and architecture."" A viaduct is a bridge that carries a road or a railroad track over dry land and that is supported on columns.
The Millau Viaduct is 50 feet taller than the Eiffel Tower!
The Millau Viaduct stretches 1.6 miles across the Tarn River valley. ""The bridge is just on the clouds,"" the mayor of Millau told reporters.
Soaring 1,125 feet high to the top of its tallest column, the bridge is more than 50 feet taller than the Eiffel Tower. That structure is located in Paris, the capital of France.
British architect Norman Foster designed the steel-and-concrete bridge. He describes its design as having ""the delicacy of a butterfly.""
The bridge was built to prevent traffic jams between Paris and the southern coast of France in the summer. Many people head to beaches on the Mediterranean Sea at that time of year.

30,"America must close the gap of hope between communities of prosperity and communities of poverty
Governor Bush says he wants to help people who live in poverty by lowering or eliminating their taxes. Bush would allow the 6 million poorest families in the United States to pay no taxes.

Vice President Gore wants to lower taxes for the neediest families. He wants to help end poverty by improving schools. Gore says he wants to hold all schools accountable for improving education.

709,"Shrek the sheep lives in New Zealand.
A sheep named Shrek got the wool pulled over his eyes. Last April, the 10-year-old male woolly sheep from New Zealand finally got a haircut after six years. Sheep are abundant on the islands of New Zealand, which are located southeast of Australia in the Pacific Ocean.
After years of roaming in the wild, Shrek was caught. Sixty pounds of Shrek's wool was
, or cut, with scissors before a crowd on television. That was enough wool to make 20 suits!
Shearers left a thin layer of wool on Shrek and gave him a special coat to keep him warm. Shrek's owner donated the wool to a charity for children.
When students at the Tarras School in New Zealand learned of Shrek, they created a children's book called Shrek:
. Their book tells the story of Shrek through the eyes of children who have followed his life from long hair to no hair.
Students sold the book at a school fundraiser. The book was such a huge hit that the first 8,000 copies sold in no time and the publisher had to print more!

What Should You Do to Avoid the Flu?
There have been a lot of empty desks in schools across the United States this winter. Many kids have stayed home while sick with the flu bug that is raging across the country.
Chances are if the flu hasn't made you sick yet, it has infected someone you know. Experts say the flu season struck more than a month earlier than its normal start. It began in October and spread quickly. Flu season typically runs from December through April.
""Most of us are convinced this was a hard flu season on children,"" said one flu expert. Hospitals and doctors' offices have been jammed with sick patients, especially kids. Some schools even closed because the flu outbreak was so severe.
, which is short for influenza (in-floo-EN-zah), is an infection caused by a
. Viruses are tiny organisms that invade cells in the body and multiply. A virus is so small that you would need a really strong microscope to see it.
Unlike a cold, the flu usually strikes suddenly and without warning. Some
, or signs, of the flu include fever, muscle aches, and a cough.
Someone who has the flu virus can easily infect other people. The flu is highly
. That means it can be passed from person to person.
The flu virus spreads through the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Other people can catch the flu by breathing in the airborne germs.
You can also get the flu by coming in contact with places where germs hang out-such as computer keyboards and door handles-and then touching your mouth or nose.
Although there is no cure for the flu, health experts say that getting a
(VAK-seen) can help protect people from becoming sick. A vaccine is a substance that fights the flu virus.
This season, many people lined up to get the vaccine in the form of flu shots. Each year, the flu virus changes. Scientists develop a vaccine to protect people from the type of virus that is spreading.
Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that ""there's still plenty of flu out there,"" this organization has some good news. It reports that the number of flu cases appears to be on the decline.
At press time, health officials say only five states report that the flu is widespread. That number is down from 45 at the flu's
, or highest point, in December. Now, that's something to feel better about!
What Should You Do If the Flu Sneaks Up on You?
Kids often get the flu because they are in close contact with one another at school. ""If you get the flu, don't panic,"" advises Dr. Carol Baker, of Houston, Texas. ""Most kids will recover just fine."" To help you get better, follow these tips that
Have your parent or another adult give you medicine to lower your fever.
What Should You Do to Avoid the Flu?
To keep flu germs from spreading, practice these healthful habits:
Wash your hands often with soap and water.
Cover your nose or mouth with a tissue when you sneeze or cough. Remember to throw away the tissue!
Avoid touching your nose, eyes, or mouth. Germs can easily enter your body there.
How can eating healthful foods and getting enough sleep help protect you from getting the flu?

730,"A healthful breakfast is an important start to your day.
Do you skip breakfast most mornings? If you're like most kids, you probably do!
A new school year can be a good time to get into the habit of eating a healthful breakfast, say experts. Recent studies show that eating breakfast boosts both your health and your brainpower.
""Breakfast supplies children with the nutrients they need and fuels them for a day of learning,"" nutrition expert Virginia Campbell told
are substances found in food that help your body stay strong and healthy. Eating a healthful
and a balanced diet during the day will help your body get the nutrients it needs.
The old saying is true-you are what you eat! That's because your health depends on what you put into your body. Here are some nutrients you might find in breakfast foods:
Complex carbohydrates found in foods such as cereal provide your body with energy. Your body stores up the energy and uses it when you need it!
Protein also supplies your body with energy and helps fight infection. Eggs and cheese are good sources of protein.
Vitamins and minerals help the body grow. Milk and other dairy products provide your body with vitamin D and calcium, a mineral that helps build strong teeth and bones. Fruits and vegetables are good sources of vitamins and minerals. You should eat at least five servings of them a day.
means ""break the fast""? While you're asleep at night, you're
, or not eating. You ""break the fast"" when you eat a morning meal.
, or restores, the energy that is lost after a night's sleep. That is why it is often called the most important meal of the day.
Studies show that kids who eat a healthful breakfast learn better, pay more attention in class, and are less likely to miss school. Experts also say that kids who eat breakfast are less likely to overeat later in the day.
That is good news. Along with regular exercise, eating breakfast can lower the risk of becoming
About 9 million kids in the United States are obese. Being overweight can lead to health problems, such as heart disease, later in life.
No time for waffles or pancakes in the morning? Don't worry! We have some quick and easy tips for a healthful breakfast:
Grab that slice of leftover veggie pizza. Eat it cold or warm it up.
Make a breakfast sundae. Top a bowl of yogurt with fresh fruit and granola.
Toast cheese on whole-grain bread. Wash it down with a glass of cold orange juice.
Got milk? Enjoy a cup with a peanut butter and banana sandwich.
Breakfast eaters also have another reason to smile. Eating breakfast in the morning helps keep tooth decay at bay.
A new study found that kids who do not eat breakfast are more likely to have tooth decay than kids who do. Why? Kids who skip breakfast tend to reach for sugary snacks during the day.
Experts say that if you find yourself crunched for time in the morning, don't rule out breakfast. Being creative with your morning routine can help you make time.
You might try planning your outfit the night before or getting up 10 minutes early. Some families even set the breakfast table before going to bed.
Leaving time for breakfast will give you the brainpower you need in school and will keep you going until the lunch bell rings. ""Breakfast really helps to start your engine!"" says Campbell.

272,"A group of boys stare excitedly at some resting lions. The lions are among the few animals that can be seen at a zoo in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.
The zoo reopened its doors over the summer. It welcomed its first visitors since the war with Iraq began in March. Today, the Baghdad zoo is home to about 80 animals. In addition to the lions, the zoo's animals include brown bears, monkeys, cheetahs, and rare birds.
Before the war began, this zoo in Baghdad was one of the largest in the Middle East. More than 600 animals were housed there.
When fighting began, the zoo was turned into a battleground. At one point, the zoo's population dropped to as few as six animals.
Many animals died and others were stolen, especially many of the birds. The cages of other animals were left open. Animals, such as lions and camels, roamed the streets. Other animals, locked in their cages, were left without food and water.
U.S. soldiers were the first people to come to the animals' rescue. They secured the zoo, found some of the wild creatures, and helped feed them. Since then, wildlife groups have helped nurse many of the sick animals back to health.
To people in Iraq, the reopened zoo is a sign of hope for their country. ""The Iraqi people see it as a small but important step in returning the country to [normal],"" said one wildlife rescue worker.

377,"Josh Kay knows a thing or two about making a joke. The 10-year-old recently went onstage at a comedy club in New York City. He did a short standup routine that had the crowd howling.
The fifth grader was so funny that he won the Bazooka Joe Wisecracking Kid Contest. He beat 11 other finalists and won a year's supply of Bazooka Bubble Gum and a $5,000 savings bond.
Even cooler is that Josh will get his name and one of his jokes printed on a Bazooka Joe comic strip. A cartoonist will also sketch a humorous picture, called a
, of Josh to include on the comic strip.
The contest celebrated the 50th birthday of Bazooka Joe. He's that eye patch-wearing kid whose jokes come wrapped around pieces of bubble gum.
""I don't really do jokes; I do impressions,"" Josh told
. Josh did a good impression of Darth Vader from
Although Josh won the contest, a 9-year-old contestant from Florida cracked up the audience with this joke:

165,"Could lions, cheetahs, and elephants one day roam the Great Plains?
Forget about traveling to Africa to go on a safari. If some scientists have their way, people may be able to spot lions, cheetahs, and elephants roaming the
of North America. The Great Plains lies in the center of North America. The region extends from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains and from Canada to Texas.
A team of scientists recently proposed the bold plan to save endangered animals from extinction in Africa.
A team of scientists wants to introduce African animals such as lions, elephants, and cheetahs to the United States. The goal of their bold plan is to help save endangered animals from extinction in Africa. Many animal
there are disappearing. A habitat is the place where a plant or an animal lives.
The African animals they want to relocate to the Great Plains are the closest living relatives of animals that lived in the United States long ago. Some of those ancient animals include saber-toothed cats and
A mastodon was an elephant-like creature with long tusks. Those animals lived until the last
ended, about 10,000 years ago. An ice age is a period of time when large sheets of ice covered Earth.
People who oppose the plan argue that releasing species into new environments could cause destruction. Cattle and sheep ranchers are also concerned that the wild animals will devour their herds.
Many scientists say that relocating African animals is a bad idea because there are already many species that need protection in North America.

384,"Visitors can walk past the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. They can tour the White House in Washington, D.C. But the Statue of Liberty, which stands tall on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, is off-limits.
The Statue of Liberty is the only major national landmark that has not reopened since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Although the grounds are open, officials say the 305-foot-tall monument is closed because of security and safety concerns.
The group that cares for the statue is raising $7 million to make safety improvements so it can reopen. However, there is a possibility that only the
, or base, of the statue will open again.
People may never be able to climb the narrow spiral staircase to the crown again. Safety experts say that evacuating people from the crown of the statue in an emergency might be too difficult.
The Statue of Liberty is one of the world's most powerful symbols of freedom. Millions of
have passed by it on their way to the United States. Immigrants are people who move to a new country from another country.
France gave the Statue of Liberty to the United States. It was a gift to celebrate the friendship between the two countries during the American Revolution (1775-1783). During the Revolutionary War, France helped the United States gain independence from Great Britain.
Since 8-year-old Nina Wade moved to New York City from California almost two years ago, the statue has been closed. She hopes to be able to someday walk its steps. ""I would be disappointed if it didn't reopen,"" she told
, ""but it makes me feel good to know that [officials] are taking safety measures.""

804,"A photo of Saturn taken by Cassini on July 19, 2004.
spacecraft has spent nearly seven years on a journey into the far reaches of space. During that time, it has covered more than 2 billion miles. In July, the spacecraft finally reached its destination--the ringed planet of Saturn.
You could not stand on Saturn. Unlike Earth, Saturn does not have a solid surface. Saturn is made mostly of gases.
Saturn is light because it is a ball of gas. If you built a HUGE swimming pool, Saturn would float in it. In fact, it is the only planet in the solar system that is less dense than water.
Saturn is windy. The fastest winds on Saturn can reach about 1,100 miles per hour! In comparison, the fastest winds on Earth can reach about 250 miles per hour.
Three other giant planets in the solar system have rings-Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. Saturns rings are the only ones that can be seen from Earth with a small telescope.
""The trip has sort of been like a long car drive, and we cant wait to get out there and explore the sites,"" said NASA scientist Jeremy Jones about the mission. ""In a sense, the tour is just beginning.""
Over the next four years, that tour will include studying Saturn, its rings, and its 33 known moons. Scientists say that Saturn holds clues to how the solar system formed. They think that Saturn and its moons are like a miniature version of our solar system.
After darting through a gap in Saturns shimmering rings,
, or flying a course around, the planet.
, which is named after an early astronomer, weighs about 6 tons with fuel and is more than 22 feet long. That is about the size of a small school bus.
is the most advanced spacecraft ever launched in history. The unmanned spacecraft is packed with equipment to collect information about Saturn. It holds two cameras, which are sending photos back to Earth.
Saturn, the sixth planet from the sun, lies between Jupiter and Uranus. Of the nine planets in the solar system, Saturn is the second largest, after Jupiter. In fact, more than nine Earths would fit across Saturn.
The planets rings are not solid. They are made up of particles of rock, ice, and dust. Some of the particles are as tiny as grains of sand. Others are as large as skyscrapers. Although the rings are wide, they are also very thin. The planets rings are only about half a mile thick.
In addition to learning about the rings, scientists are studying Saturns moons. The scientists primary focus is Saturns largest moon, Titan. Titan is larger than the planets Mercury and Pluto.
(HOY-ginz). The probe will parachute through the murky atmosphere of Titan and land on its surface. That will be the most far-reaching landing that a spacecraft has ever made from our planet.
Scientists are interested in Titan because they think it might teach them about Earth. Experts used to think that Titan resembled Earth as it was billions of years ago. They are starting to question that idea.
What do scientists expect to find? ""In many ways, the most exciting part of the journey is about to begin because we dont know what lies ahead,"" said NASA scientist Julie Webster.
Earth and the other planets in our solar system travel around the sun. Saturn is so far from the sun that it receives less sunlight than we get on Earth. The sun also looks much smaller from Saturn.
Do you think it is important for scientists to explore space? Why or why not?

381,"When you think of a museum, what comes to mind? You may think of science and art, but what about PEZ? That's right, PEZ, the bite-size candies that fit neatly inside colorful dispensers.
A new PEZ museum recently opened in Easton, Pennsylvania. It's the third PEZ museum in the country to display the famous candy dispensers.
If you're looking for a popular character, chances are you'll find it here! The museum is home to 1,500 PEZ dispensers, from SpongeBob SquarePants and Charlie Brown to Garfield and Santa Claus.
In addition, Disney-themed PEZ dispensers are displayed in a 10-foot-high castle. Visitors can even play a ""Where in the World Is Waldo?"" game on a wall display of more than 500 dispensers.
The museum also has some rare PEZ dispensers that are very valuable. A baseball bat, ball, and glove PEZ dispenser from the 1960s sells for about $400!
Many children and adults get excited over the plastic PEZ dispensers. ""For me it combines the two favorite elements of childhood... toys and candy,"" said Jill Cohen, an adult PEZ collector.
According to the Connecticut company that makes PEZ, Americans consume a lot of the tiny candy. More than 3 billion PEZ candies are eaten each year in the United States!
The candy traces its roots back to 1927. It was invented in the European country of Austria as a mint to help people quit smoking. So how exactly did the candy get its name? PEZ is derived from the word

252,"The Southeast: Exploring the 'Land of the Flowers'
Long before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, Spaniards had explored and settled large parts of what is now the United States.
One of the regions the Spanish explored first was the Southeast. Hernando de Soto and 600 followers were the first European explorers to journey through the Southeast. For nearly four years, de Soto and his followers wandered through the region.
After sailing from Cuba in 1539, de Soto landed in Florida. An earlier Spanish explorer, Juan Ponce de Len, had named the land
, after a Spanish word meaning ""flowery"".
La Florida was much larger then present-day Florida. It covered most of the area in what are now the southeastern states. One of de Soto's men described the animals the explorers found. ""There are many lions and bears in Florida, wolves, deer, jackals, cats and rabbits (also live there),"" he wrote.
Many different groups of Native Americans lived in La Florida. They grew corn, beans and squash. They also fished and hunted.
Because the native groups did not trust de Soto, they often left their villages before the Spaniards arrived. The Native Americans had good reason to fear de Soto. He captured and enslaved some of them.
De Soto and his men were mainly looking for gold. The search for gold led them out of present-day Florida north to what is now Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
After reaching North Carolina without finding gold, the explorers turned west and crossed the Appalachian Mountains. Upon hearing rumors of gold, de Soto led his men into Tennessee and south to Alabama.
In southern Alabama, the Choctaw Indians attacked the explorers. They killed many of de Soto's men, and some of his supplies were taken.
De Soto's expedition then turned northwest through Alabama and into present-day Mississippi. In May 1541, de Soto reached the Mississippi River, near what is now Memphis, Tennessee. Then they crossed into Arkansas, where in May 1542, De Soto died.
The explorers then retreated to the Mississippi River, where they built boats, which sailed down the river to the Gulf of Mexico. Only about half of the people who had landed with de Soto in Florida survived the trek across the Southeast.

119,"Doctors are always on guard against germs. They frequently wash their hands. Now, however, doctors are being told not to wash their hands with soap and water.
Instead of using soap and water, the doctors use a special gel. The gel kills germs and saves time. Doctors often take more than a minute to wash their hands with soap and water. The gel speeds things up.
What's more, constant washing and drying with soap and water dries out hands. The gel causes fewer problems, so doctors who use it are less likely to skip a cleaning.
Killing hospital germs is important. About 2 million hospital patients are infected by viruses each year. About 90,000 die from viruses they got in the hospital.
If you're not working in a hospital, using soap and water is good enough. All of us need to keep hands clean to keep germs away. Washing hands is important, especially before eating and before leaving a bathroom, where many germs live. It is important to keep your hands clean at school, too!

728,"George W. Bush and Richard Cheney are the Republican team.
The final countdown to Election Day has begun. On November 2, millions of Americans will head to the polls to vote for the next president of the United States.
The race to the White House is long and hard, but the finish line is in sight for President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry. As Election Day draws close, the candidates are busy
Each of the candidates for president belongs to a
. That isn't a party with cake and balloons--although each candidate hopes to be celebrating with a victory on Election Day.
A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about how to run the country. There are two main political parties in the United States: the
Sometimes, candidates run for president without the support of the two main parties. They are called
Bush, the 43rd president, is the Republican candidate who wants to be reelected. His running mate is Vice President Richard Cheney.
John Kerry, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, is the Democratic candidate running against Bush. His running mate for vice president is John Edwards, a U.S. senator from North Carolina.
John Kerry and John Edwards are the Democratic team.
With Election Day just weeks away, the presidential candidates are crisscrossing the country on the campaign trail to get their messages out. They are meeting voters, giving speeches, and telling people why they think they are best qualified to lead the country.
The candidates are also speaking out about important
, or problems, that our country faces. Some of those issues include rebuilding Iraq, protecting the environment, and improving schools.
Political polls predict that the 2004 presidential election will be a close race. The candidates know that every vote will count.
""I want to be your president for four more years,"" Bush said in a speech on the campaign trail. ""From creating jobs to improving our schools, from fighting terror to spreading the peace, we made much progress, and there is more to do.""
Those issues are important to Kerry too. ""You meet incredible people, and you want to make their lives better,"" said Kerry. ""They tell you about their lives--their schools, the cost of health care, or their sons and daughters serving in Iraq. It's a huge sense of responsibility and a daily reminder of why elections are so important.""
Who will be the best person for the job? The American people will decide on Election Day.
Winning the presidential election tops the list of George W. Bush and John Kerry these days, but that wasn't always the case. Both candidates dreamed of being sports stars as kids.
President Bush was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on July 6, 1946. His family moved to Texas not long after he was born.
As a child, Bush dreamed of becoming a baseball player. One of his hobbies was collecting baseball cards. When he was 10 years old, Bush used to mail cards to famous baseball players to have them autographed and returned to him.
Before being elected president in 2000, Bush was a part owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He also served as governor of Texas for six years.
Senator Kerry was born in Denver, Colorado, on December 11, 1943. His family moved to Massachusetts a few months after he was born.
As a child, Kerry wanted to become a hockey player and even thought about becoming a football player. His interest in sports continued through the years. He played hockey, soccer, and lacrosse in college.
As he grew up, Kerry began to think about public service. Before serving as a Massachusetts senator for the past 20 years, Kerry was the lieutenant governor of that state for two years.
Did you know that animals represent the two main political groups in the United States? Thomas Nast, a political cartoonist, first used the animals as symbols in the late 1800s.
The elephant is the symbol for the Republican Party. The donkey is the symbol for the Democratic Party.
If you had five minutes to talk to each of the presidential candidates, what would you want to tell them?

117,"A hole in Earth has scientists baffled. On March 2, a team of 12 British scientists set sail aboard the RRS
to find out why a large chunk of Earth's
or outer layer, is missing 3 miles below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. In its place is a large exposed stretch of
The crew departed from the Canary Islands, which are located off the northwestern coast of Africa. The hole is situated about 2,300 miles southwest of the Canaries. Scientists suspect the hole is 30 miles long and 30 miles wide. Using a robotic device called Toby, the team will film the site and take samples to study. ""It is like a window into the interior of Earth,"" says scientist Bramley Murton from aboard the research ship.
Earth is made up of four layers, which get hotter and hotter, from the surface to the center.
The crust is the surface of Earth. The thin layer is made of solid rock.
The mantle is divided into two parts: the upper mantle and the lower mantle. Most of the mantle is solid rock, but the lower mantle rock is softer.
The hot outer core is made of liquid iron and nickel.
The inner core is the center of Earth. It is made up of scorching-hot iron and nickel, which stay solid due to intense pressure.

7,"Astronomers create a task force to keep an eye on asteroids.
About 65 million years ago, a giant space rock slammed into Earth, according to most scientists. The
threw dust into the sky and blocked out sunlight for more than a year. Many plants and animals, including the dinosaurs, died out in this darkness. Could a huge rock crash into Earth today?
or scientists who study space, arent taking any chances. The International Astronomical Union has set up a special task force. The task force will closely watch objects zooming through space toward Earth. ""The goal is to discover these killer asteroids before they discover us,"" astronomer Nick Kaiser told reporters.
and asteroids inside our solar system, according to experts. A comet is a space object made of ice and dust.
The task force will create computer models to figure out whether and when one of these flying objects might hit Earth. Its path would then be plotted on a map. Although there are no asteroid busters right now, scientists hope that soon rockets could be sent to knock asteroids off course.
Close encounters may be scary, but they help to give astronomers opportunities to better understand the beginnings of our solar system. Many scientists believe that asteroids and comets are leftovers from the formation of the sun and planets about 4.6 billion years ago.
""Its through collisions that planets are born,"" Giovanni Valsecchi, an astronomer from Italy, told reporters. ""And its through collisions that planets die.""
There are more than 1 million asteroids circling the sun between Mars and Jupiter.
Some asteroids are smaller than a car. Others are hundreds of miles across.
The first known asteroid was discovered in 1801. Today, asteroids are found regularly.
The largest asteroid is named Ceres. It is about the size of Maine. Ceres was recently classified as a dwarf planet, along with Pluto.

639,"Celestial Celebration: The Hubble Space Telescope Turns Ten
Ten years ago, a space shuttle roared into space on a special mission. The astronauts' mission was to put the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit 380 miles above Earth, where it can take better photos of planets, stars, and galaxies than telescopes on Earth can.
During the last decade, Hubble has taken thousands of photos. Many of them have helped scientists learn more about the universe we live in.
The photo shows the Eagle Nebula, a huge cloud of gas in the constellation Serpens. The bright reddish stars that recently formed out of the material that makes up the nebula.
Last December, astronauts worked on the Hubble Space Telescope to repair it and make it even better. Scientists hope the telescope will help them make more amazing discoveries.
The Hubble Space Telescope weighs 12 tons.
The Hubble Space Telescope orbits Earth once every 97 minutes.

750,"Look at the coins in your pocket. Most likely, the coins have something in common: a U.S. president pictured on one side. Most U.S coins have depicted presidents since 1909.
Some coin collectors say U.S. coins should have a greater variety of pictures. For instance, they want to take the image of Abraham Lincoln off the penny. They want to remove the drawing of Thomas Jefferson from the nickel.
""After almost 100 years, even Lincoln himself would probably say enough is enough,"" said coin collector Fred Weinberg.
Weinberg and others say the presidential portraits are boring. Instead of presidents, the critics want to see patriotic scenes.
""I'm not putting down dead dignitaries, but the public wants to see something new to stimulate pride and interest, not just in coins, but in history,"" Weinberg said.
Officials at the U.S. Mint, which makes coins, say they are looking into the possibility of change. The mint could have a new nickel in 2003, a new dime in 2004, a new half dollar in 2005, and a new penny in 2006.
U.S. coins have honored presidents for almost a century. In 1909, President Abraham Lincoln became the first president to be pictured on a coin.
Later, other presidents were pictured on coins. George Washington's image was added to the quarter in 1932. Thomas Jefferson's picture replaced that of a Native American on the nickel in 1938. Franklin Roosevelt's image appeared on the dime beginning in 1946. John F. Kennedy was pictured on the half dollar beginning in 1964.
Not everyone agrees that a change in change is good. Some people want to keep their loose change exactly the way it is.
""We're open to change in color and general design... but we certainly would not be open to just replacing President Lincoln's image with a flower or something else,"" said a fan of the Lincoln penny.
A slippery $20 gold coin recently sold for almost $8 million!
In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had ordered all but two $20 gold coins destroyed. Those two coins were given to the Smithsonian Institution.
Shortly before the rest of the coins were destroyed, ten were stolen. All but one of the stolen coins were later found and destroyed.
The missing coin was found in Egypt in 1954. Before U.S. officials could claim it, the coin disappeared again. The coin turned up in London in the 1990s. U.S. officials brought it back to the United States. This year, it went to auction.

114,"Cecil may be only 7 years old, but he has already sung in a theater in New York City. The funny thing is, Cecil is a dog. He recently beat out 300 other pets to win the Search for North America's Best Singing Pet contest, held by Advantage, a company that makes flea control products.
To win, Cecil and owner Bill Hagemann performed a duet. The two sang a song called ""Mr. Moon."" After being announced as the winner, Cecil sang an encore, ""Give My Regards to Broadway.""
Hagemann said that his son discovered Cecil's singing talent shortly after the family adopted the dog from an animal shelter.

265,"You've probably never heard those words in an elevator before, but according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), someday you might!
NASA recently announced that building an elevator to space could be possible in as little as 50 years. The elevator could be used to move people and cargo into space more cheaply than in a fueled spaceship.

The redesigned currency is safer, smarter and more secure.
The $20 bill is getting a colorful new look this fall. The new $20 bill will have touches of light green, peach, and blue added to it.
The picture of Andrew Jackson, who was the seventh president of the United States, will stay on the bill. However, the oval around him will no longer appear on the bill.
Government officials say the new design features were added to help stop illegal
, or fake, money. Within the United States, there are more fake copies of the $20 bill than of any other bill.
About $650 billion worth of U.S. currency is in circulation around the world at any one time.
The $50 bill and $100 bill will be changed in the near future. Officials are discussing possible changes to the $5 bill and $10 bill. As of now, there are no plans to change the $1 bill, because it is rarely copied.

44,"What a difference a year can make. Last winter, monarch butterflies died off in record numbers. This year, researchers are reporting that these delicate creatures have made an impressive comeback. The overall monarch butterfly population is recovering.
The healthy number of monarchs has many scientists puzzled. ""It's amazing that they recovered so well,"" said butterfly expert Bill Calvert.
In January 2002, a severe storm killed millions of monarchs that were spending the winter in Mexico. ""The data this winter indicates that the monarchs are moving back toward their average population size,"" said Lincoln Brower, another butterfly expert.
The data collected this winter shows that monarch
, or groups, covered about 20 acres of forests in Mexico. That is close to the average number of 24 acres from 1993 to 2001. After last year's unusual winter storm, the colonies covered only about 5 acres.
, or move, south from the United States and Canada to their winter homes in the mountains of Mexico. The orange-and- black monarch butterflies return to the United States and Canada in the spring.
Butterfly experts and the Mexican government are concerned that illegal logging is destroying the monarchs'
, or home. They are worried because one of the top layers of the forest, called the
, acts as an umbrella to protect monarchs.

56,"The countdown to Turin begins. Who are the athletes to watch?
U.S. skater Michelle Kwan brought home an
Olympic silver medal in 1998 and an Olympic bronze medal in 2002. Will she strike gold this year? The 25-year-old sure hopes so.
Kwan isnt the only U.S. athlete with her eye on the prize. Two-time silver medal winner Bode Miller hopes to fly past the competition in alpine skiing. Also shooting for Olympic glory are snowboarders Shaun White and Hannah Teter.
They are among 215 U.S. athletes dreaming of Olympic gold. In just two weeks, the 2006 Winter Olympics will take place in Turin, Italy. From February 10-26, Turin will host 2,500 athletes, representing 85 countries. They will compete for 252 medals and a place in Olympic history. ""The opening ceremony for Turin 2006 is now only a moment away,"" says Olympic official Jean-Claude Killy.
Winning athletes in the ancient Olympics were crowned with a wreath of olive leaves, but todays athletes receive medals for first, second, and third place. This year, the Olympic medals have a new look. They are doughnut-shaped, with a hole in the middle. The design
or stands for, the open space of a city square in Italy, called a piazza.
The Olympics began in ancient Greece more than 2,700 years ago. The first-known Olympic competition included just one eventa footrace. The events grew to include boxing, wrestling, and chariot racing.
The United States has been competing in the Olympics since the first modern games were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896. Speed skating and skiing were featured at the first Winter Olympics, in 1924. Over the years, more sports were added, including snowboarding in 1998.
Turin is busy preparing for the arrival of 1.5 million
or people who watch the events. U.S. medal hopefuls are gearing up as well. Freestyle skier Hannah Kearney plans to use some of her favorite moves, such as backflips, to grab a medal. ""I want to bring home gold for my country,"" she told
Skeleton sledder Noelle Pikus-Pace is recovering from a leg injury. She hopes to join her team and represent the United States in one of the fastest sports. In skeleton sledding, competitors race down a twisting tube of solid ice about as fast as a car travels on the highway.
As one of the top U.S. women athletes, Pikus-Pace is focused on her dream. ""It would be just awesome to get to the Olympics. ... That would be the biggest joy. I couldnt explain it.""

355,"Past presidents will appear on $1 coin.
Just in time for Presidents' Day on February 19, the U.S. Mint is releasing new $1 coins honoring former U.S. presidents. Beginning February 15, the mint will circulate the first coin, which depicts George Washingtonand that's only the start.
The series will honor four different presidents per year in the order in which they served in office. On the reverse side of the coin will be the Statue of Liberty. The next three coins released this year will feature John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. They will
""I believe this program is a great opportunity for educating both children and adults about the history of our country,"" says lawmaker Michael Castle from Delaware. He helped pass the new coin
With the exception of Grover Cleveland, each president will appear on only one coin. Cleveland was the only president to serve two terms that weren't
or back-to-back. To be depicted on a coin, a president must have been dead for at least two years.
Past presidents aren't the first people to be depicted on $1 coins. Female leaders Susan B. Anthony and Sacagawea have appeared on the coins. Anthony dedicated her life to fighting for women's rights in the 1800s. Native American guide Sacagawea led explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on their westward journey to find a route to the Pacific Ocean.
The idea of rotating coin designs comes from the 50 State Quarters Program. Those quarters began circulating in 1999. The state quarters program has been very popular, introducing millions of people to coin collecting. The U.S. Mint hopes the presidential coins will be as successful.

66,"An ancient mystery lurks beneath the coffin of King Tutankhamen (too-tahng-KAH-men). Researchers are trying to determine whether a horrible crime thousands of years ago led to the young Egyptian king's death. Did someone murder a boy called King Tut?
In an attempt to solve the mystery, scientists are X-raying the mummy of the
A pharaoh refers to an ancient Egyptian king.
""The question of whether [King Tut] was murdered or not will be completely answered,"" said Egypt's top archaeologist.
King Tut lived in Egypt more than 3,300 years ago. Despite suffering from a spine disease that made it difficult for him to turn his head, Tut probably spent his childhood swimming in the Nile River, hunting ducks, and learning how to read and write.
After his father died, the young boy was thrown into the royal spotlight. Tut was crowned king at about the age of 10! His reign, however, did not last very long. By 18 years old, he was dead.
Howard Carter, a British archaeologist, discovered King Tut's tomb in 1922.
The mystery of how King Tut died has fascinated people since Howard Carter, a British archaeologist, found his secret
in 1922. A tomb is a burial place.
Ancient Egyptians buried King Tut in an area of hidden caves called the Valley of the Kings. It is located near the Nile River. Tut's mummy was discovered with an elaborate gold mask covering its head and shoulders.
The tomb was filled with royal treasures, including jewelry, statues, furniture, and even some of Tut's childhood toys. Ancient Egyptians believed in life after death. They buried their dead with favorite items they believed could be used in the afterlife.
murdered, crime experts believe the culprit was likely someone close to him. Scientists have narrowed the list to four suspects: his wife, his treasurer, his prime minister, and his military chief.
They suspect those four people because they would have known about Tut's spine disease. His weak condition would have made him an easy target. They also might have had
, or reasons, to murder Tut. (See ""
Why do scientists think Tut was killed? They say the tomb's small size and its rushed state hint that he might have died unexpectedly.
At the time of the tomb's discovery in 1922, experts had ruled out foul play. Yet X-rays taken in 1968 revealed a different story. They showed a hole in Tut's skull, suggesting he might have suffered a severe blow to the head.
Tut's mummy was flown to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo for new X-rays. X-ray technology today is more sophisticated than it was in 1968. Thanks to modern
, or crime-solving techniques, scientists hope the question of whether Tut was murdered will soon be answered.
Was a crime committed? Clues point to four main suspects.
Although paintings in Tut's tomb depict a loving wife, experts say she could still have had a motive. Shortly after Tut died, his wife wrote a letter to the leader of another nation. She requested help in finding a new husband. In ancient Egypt, it was possible for women to become pharaohs. Did she murder her husband to become pharaoh herself?
Tut's treasurer, Maya, had easy access to him during his reign. Evidence, however, shows that Maya liked the boy king. He rebuilt Tut's burial chamber after it was robbed. A gift in Tut's tomb also bears Maya's name. Although Maya was the least likely to ascend to the throne after Tut's death, could the treasurer have been so jealous of the boy king that he murdered him?
Ay was Tut's adviser and grandfather. He became pharaoh upon Tut's death. After Tut died, Ay pressured Tut's wife to marry him. Marrying her made him king of Egypt. Shortly after their wedding, the new bride mysteriously disappeared. Some people think a painting of a hunting scene in Ay's tomb proves his crime. The painting was an odd choice for a royal tomb. Was Ay confessing his crime through the killing in the painting?
War threatened Egypt during Tut's rule. His military chief might have thought the boy king was too young to protect Egypt from its enemies. Because the chief drove Tut's chariot, some experts suspect that he pushed the young pharaoh to his death. After the prime minister's death, the military chief became king of Egypt. At that time, he attempted to erase records of Tut's life. Could that have been to cover up a crime?

106,"Christian Atayde Stoinev was just 3 years old when he began performing in his family's circus in Mexico. Today, at 13, Christian performs in about 350 shows a year for the Big Apple Circus.
The Big Apple Circus is based in New York City but visits 10 other cities each year. ""I was born into the circus,"" Christian told
He's not kidding. His father is an acrobat from Bulgaria, a country in Europe. His mother is a trapeze artist from Mexico, where her family owns that country's largest circus. Both parents now work behind the scenes at the Big Apple Circus.
A talented gymnast and an acrobat, Christian can do flips on and off a trampoline. He can balance on one hand, ride a unicycle, and dance. He is also working on a routine with his 18-month-old dog--a Chihuahua named Scooby.
The eighth grader attends school three hours each morning at the One-Ring School House run by the circus. Christian lives on the circus grounds and shares a large trailer with his parents, his younger brother, and Scooby.

595,"Weekly Reader editor Beth Rogers made three new friends in July--Naku, Kela, and Inuk. Her friends are about 14 feet long and weigh more than 1,000 pounds each! They are beluga whales that live at the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut.
Beth met her new friends through a new program at the aquarium. The program gives visitors a chance to wade into the water with the whales and touch them.
Visitors wear thick rubber overalls to stay warm in the cold water. They can stroke the whales and touch the animals' tongues. According to their trainers, the belugas love to have their tongues rubbed.
Beluga whales eat about 50 pounds of fish each day. They make noises such as clicks, squeaks, whistles, and moos. Belugas use their sounds to send messages to one another and to help them find their prey.

230,"Imagine that you could convert all the fake bills in a Monopoly game into real money. For Matt McNally, that dream came true. The California man won $15,140-the amount of money found in the bank of the Monopoly game.
To win the prize, McNally competed against 47 other contestants in the 2003 National Monopoly Championship.
The tournament was held aboard a train hired especially for the event. Called the ""Reading Railroad,"" the train was named after a railroad property on the game board.
Although the tournament has taken place every four years since 1973, this year's event was the first to be held on a moving train. Players boarded in Chicago and began rolling the dice.
In 1934, Charles B. Darrow of Pennsylvania invented Monopoly. The Parker Brothers company bought the game in 1935 and has since sold more than 200 million copies worldwide.
From there, the train completed a three-day journey to Atlantic City, New Jersey-the city on which the game is based and where the final round was held. Along the way, the train made stops in Pittsburgh, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia.
In addition to his prize money, McNally looks forward to representing the United States in the 2004 World Monopoly Championship in China. ""I can't wait,"" McNally told CNN.

530,"An escaped python is back in class.
A sneaky snake has slithered out of hiding. Students and teachers at Hauppauge Middle School on Long Island, New York, are happy once again. Slim, their 2-foot-long ball python, is back in his tank in a science classroom.
""We were so used to seeing Slim every day that it seemed strange when he wasnt there,"" sixth grader Brian Pattison told
Earlier in the school year, teachers were putting Slim and Otis, another ball python, into their tank. Then the teachers became distracted by a disturbance in the hall, and the snakes escaped.
The teachers quickly recaptured Otis. Slim, however, raced out into the hallway and disappeared. A search of the school began.
""Slim has been part of our school family for six years, so you can imagine how worried we were when he went missing,"" says school principal Maryann Fletcher.
Ball pythons like heat, so school officials set up portable heaters. They also tried to lure the hungry snake out of hiding by providing boxes of tempting crickets.
No one worried that Slim might hurt a person. Ball pythons are gentle snakes from western Africa. Four weeks after the escape, a night custodian found Slim.
""I am happy to say Slim the Snake has returned,"" wrote Fletcher in a note to parents. The principal joked, ""I received a note as follows: Vacation was great!  The food was nothing to talk about.  Feels good to be home!""

Many animals use camouflage to blend into their surroundings. Some butterflies, for example, have patterns that let them hide among leaves and twigs. Most animals, however, can remain unseen only while they stay very still. Thats why this new dragonfly finding has many scientists puzzled.
The dragonfly uses motion camouflage to fool its prey into thinking that its not moving and not a threat. The dragonflys prey include other insects it feeds on, such as mosquitoes and moths.
Researchers say that the dragonfly carefully changes position again and again as it closes in on its target. The dragonfly appears, to the eye of its prey, to remain in the same place--but in fact its moving. What a clever eye trick!

197,"space station plunged to Earth in a controlled fall. As
fell, it broke into some 1,500 pieces that splashed into the Pacific Ocean.
into Earth orbit in 1986. Over the years, astronauts from many countries traveled to
to study space and the impact space has on the human body.
In recent years, the aging space station was plagued by serious problems.
survived an onboard fire, several life-threatening oxygen leaks, and a collision with a Russian cargo spaceship. The station also had computer failures and power outages. In the end, the Russians could not raise enough money to repair and modernize
Because of those and other problems, the Russian government feared that
would crash to Earth accidentally. So Russia decided to bring
into a remote area of the Pacific near Australia. They wanted to make sure that no one would be hurt by the fiery fragments of the space station, which burned as it streaked through Earth's atmosphere.
While the Russians assured the world that no one would be harmed by the falling debris, Taco Bell placed a target in the Pacific Ocean. The fast-food chain promised to give everyone in the United States a free taco if
smashed into the target. The falling station missed the target.

312,"Judge Samuel Alito has been nominated to fill Justice OConnors position on the Supreme Court.
The caption under Samuel Alitos college yearbook photo reads: ""Sam intends to go to law school and eventually to warm a seat on the Supreme Court."" His dream may soon come true. Alito, 55, is President George W. Bushs latest pick for a position on the countrys highest court.
The president chose Alito to replace Justice Sandra Day OConnor, who announced her retirement in July. In 1981, OConnor became the first woman in history to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.
Bush had first nominated Harriet Miers, a White House lawyer, to take OConnors place. However, Miers withdrew her nomination after coming under fire partly for a lack of experience. Miers had never been a judge. OConnor is serving on the Supreme Court until a replacement is confirmed.
Alito grew up in New Jersey in a family that valued learning. Both of his parents were teachers. He has argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court, losing just two.
As a federal judge, Alito has also served on a lower court for the past 15 years in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. With 29 years of legal experience, Bush says, Alito ""has more prior judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in more than 70 years.""
To become a Supreme Court justice, a nominee must be approved by the Senate. A series of Senate confirmation hearings, where Alito will answer questions about his views on laws, are set to begin on January 9, 2006. Senate leaders hope to have a final confirmation vote on January 20.

241,"The sounds of ivory-billed woodpeckers convince scientists that the birds are no longer extinct
Knock, Knock? Who's there? The ivory-billed woodpecker, that's who!
For more than 50 years, scientists thought the ivory-billed woodpecker was extinct in the United States. Now bird lovers are flying high. Scientists recently announced that they have evidence the bird still exists in eastern Arkansas. The scientists caught the black-and-white birds in flight on a blurry videotape.
The ivory-billed woodpecker was seen again at Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in Eastern Arkansas.
The rare woodpeckers began to disappear between 1880 and the 1940s when loggers cut down the forests where they lived. The last sighting was in 1944.
The ivorybill is the largest woodpecker in the country. The red-crested bird's body is shiny blue-black. It has white markings on its neck and on both edges of its huge wings. The woodpecker's wingspan extends almost 3 feet. The bird also has a straight bill, short legs, and feet with curved claws.
, or one-of-a-kind, sound. They produce a double knock when their strong beaks strike trees. In addition, they make a call that sounds like the toot of a toy horn.
For people who doubted the videotape of the woodpeckers, the scientists collected more proof. They recorded the bird's double knock.
The recording made believers out of the doubters. ""Hearing [the recording] was very exciting!"" Richard Prum, a scientist from Yale University who studies birds, told
. ""[It is] convincing evidence that the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct.""
What are people doing to help the number of ivory-billed woodpeckers bounce back? Nature lovers are cutting down some trees in a select area of Arkansas. Sound strange? The woodpeckers feed on young beetles that thrive under the bark of fallen trees. With more food for the woodpeckers, bird lovers hope that the ivorybill's double knock will become a common sound again.

729,"Can you believe the baby animal pictured above is a giant panda? It is one of five baby pandas that were born at a nature center in China in late August.
The babies are receiving constant care at the nature center. They are covered with white hair and weigh 4 to 6 ounces. That's about the size of a hot dog.
As the pandas grow, they will develop black hair on their ears and around their eyes. Black hair will also grow across their shoulders and on their legs.
The infants offer hope to scientists concerned about pandas, which are endangered. The nature center is home to more than 60 pandas. There are fewer than 1,100 giant pandas left in the wild.
Pandas in the wild live in bamboo forests in the mountains of China. The panda's diet consists mainly of bamboo shoots, stems, and leaves. Pandas lose their homes and have less food to eat when people cut down bamboo forests for wood and farmland. In an effort to protect pandas, the government of China has made it illegal to cut down bamboo in certain areas.

206,"Scientists discover 27 new creatures in California's caves.
Stalagmites rise from the ground. Stalactites resemble icicles and hang from a caves ceiling.
Californias newly discovered cave creatures hold clues to monitoring changes in the environment.
caves of two national parks in central California, scientists made an amazing discovery. They found 27 previously unknown species of spiders, centipedes, millipedes, and scorpion-like creatures. The scientists explored 34 of 238 known caves in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks over three years and recently released their findings.
or animals without backbones. The discoveries included a tiny pill bug that is
or almost clear. Its internal organs are visibleeven its bright-yellow liver! There was also a daddy longlegs with a jaw larger than its body, as well as a little, bright-orange spider. Some creatures were so tiny that scientists had to use the fine hairs of a paintbrush to collect them.
""We thought we might find a handful of new species,"" says Joel Despain, a cave expert for the parks. ""It was amazing to find 27.""
Why had the cave creatures gone undetected? Though it is rare to find unknown animal species on Earths surface, the same is not true for caves. Like the deep sea, caves are difficult to reach and havent been explored as thoroughly as the surface.
Discovering so many unknown species was thrilling for Jean Krejca. She is a scientist with Zara Environmental, the Texas-based group that led the project. ""You get the feeling that youre Lewis and Clark, charting undiscovered territory,"" says Krejca. ""Caves are one of the last frontiers.""
This millipede is one of the less strange creatures scientists find in caves. Creatures are often blind and have no pigment.
The creatures are unique not only because they are found just in caves but also because some are found in only a single cave or a specific part of a cave. ""There are usually more creatures at the caves entrance because there is more food there,"" scientist Rob Myers of Zara Environmental told
""The farther back in a cave, the more you find creatures have adapted to cave life. What you find is more and more strange. The creatures are often blind and have no pigment.""
A creature such as the pill bug, for example, doesnt need pigment in its skin because it doesnt have to protect itself from the sun. And the daddy longlegs probably developed such big jaws to quickly grab prey, which is scarce inside caves.
The next task is to name the new species. Specialists called
are working to classify and name the creatures.
Scientists will also study the new species to determine whether their populations are healthy. Cave animals can teach scientists a lot about the environment because the creatures are sensitive to changes in the
An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that interacts with the environment. If cave creatures decline, it could signal problems or changes in the environment.
The recent discoveries have led park officials to plan to protect the caves and the newfound species. ""Now that we know the species are there, we can use them to learn more about cave ecosystems and life on this planet,"" says Myers.
Think Critically Why, do you think, is more food found at the entrance to a cave?
What do you call someone who explores and studies caves? A
""Caves are absolutely dark,"" Rob Myers of Zara Environmental told
""They are darker than your bedroom gets at night. There is zero light in a cave, so you cant see a hand in front of your face.""
When a spelunker heads into a cave, he or she wears a helmet with a headlamp and carries an extra flashlight. The cave explorer also wears elbow pads and kneepads to crawl along the rocky floor. Many caves are underground, so the explorer slides down on ropes connected to special harnesses.
While there, a spelunker might see the magnificent cone-shaped formations of
(stuh-LAK-tights). They form when water with calcium drips, and the mineral hardens and builds up over time.
Stalagmites rise from the ground. Stalactites resemble icicles and hang from a caves ceiling. When they meet, they form a column. What is an easy way to remember the difference between the words?

231,"A Hurricane Hunter flies the plane into the eye of a hurricane.
One flight crew took Hurricane Isabel by storm. Called
, they actually flew a plane into the center of Isabel in mid-September.
Isabel packed winds of up to 100 miles per hour by the time it hit land. The storm walloped the coasts of North Carolina and Virginia and then moved inland.
The hurricane caused massive flooding and damage. More than 4.5 million people lost electricity. At least 40 deaths were blamed on the storm.
Despite the devastation, Isabel could have been worse. Thanks to the work of Hurricane Hunters, weather forecasters accurately predicted the storms path. Many people received warning and fled, or
Hurricane Hunters are a special part of the Air Force. They found out how dangerous Isabel was before it battered the coast. The experienced fliers and scientists gathered information about the size, strength, and path of Isabel.
They sent that information to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Florida. The information led officials to evacuate shoreline areas in North Carolina and Virginia. The federal government in Washington, D.C., also shut down.
""Were just doing our part,"" said one Hurricane Hunter. ""We help protect our coast from national disaster.""
The Hurricane Hunters fly WC-130s into the strong winds of hurricanes.
Hurricanes are powerful, whirling storms that form over warm oceans and cause torrential rains and heavy winds. The eye of a hurricane is the calm center of the storm. The
has little wind and few clouds. Swirling around the eye are heavy winds.
Hurricane Hunters fly directly into the eye of a hurricane--not above it. The reason is that a hurricane can extend more than 50,000 feet high, and these planes can fly only as high as 30,000 feet.
of Isabel, crew members experienced a rocky ride. The eye wall is a solid ring of thunderstorms around the eye. The strongest winds and heaviest rains are located here.
The plane contains equipment that records weather. In the eye of the storm, Hurricane Hunters released small tubes attached to parachutes. Each tube was about the size of a can of tennis balls. The tubes sent information about wind speed, power, and moisture back to the crew.
As part of their job, Hurricane Hunters help forecasters rate storms. Hurricanes are rated on a scale of 1 to 5.
A storms rating is based on wind speed and potential for damage. Before hitting land, Isabel was a Category-5 storm. That is the most powerful type.
Satellites in space and other weather instruments are used to measure hurricanes. However, forecasters say that Hurricane Hunters provide the most accurate prediction of the path and strength of a hurricane.
Hurricanes are rated on a scale of 1 to 5. The ratings are based on the storms wind and potential for destruction.

805,"The Flordia panther is a protected species.
Do Florida panthers have nine lives? Scientists sure hope so! The wild cats are on the brink of
During the early 1900s, hundreds of the large, light-brown cats roamed the southeastern United States. Today, panthers can be found only in southern Florida. Wildlife officials estimate that only between 80 and 100 panthers are left in the Sunshine State.
What is causing the sharp decline in the panther population? Hunting and habitat loss are mainly to blame. During the mid- to late 1900s, millions of people flocked to Florida for its warm climate and inexpensive land. As people built homes and roads, panthers were squeezed out of their habitat.
In 1967, Florida panthers were placed on the endangered species list in the United States. The list was created to protect animals that are on the edge of extinction.
Today, wildlife officials are working to keep the wild cats out of
, or danger. Workers have installed fencing along 40 miles of public roads in south-western Florida to prevent panthers from colliding with cars and other vehicles.
Officials are also making efforts to save the land where panthers live from further development. ""We have to protect what's left of their habitat,"" panther expert Bob DeGross told
A panther is about 10 times as large as a house cat. Adult males can weigh up to 150 pounds; females typically weigh about 70 pounds.
Panthers are skilled hunters. They mainly prey on white-tailed deer and wild hogs but will also eat armadillos, raccoons, and even alligators.
Panthers became Florida's official state animal in 1982.
Baby panthers stay with their mothers for about two years, learning to hunt and survive.

574,"New York City schools are removing the junk food from their vending machines.
Change is on the way for vending machines in New York City schools. Beginning in September, candy, soda pop, and other sweet snacks will no longer be offered in school vending machines.
It's not just vending machines that are getting a makeover. In a move to make cafeteria food more healthful, New York City schools will also cut the amount of sugar, fat, and salt in school lunches. That means beef ravioli, potato salad, ice cream, and macaroni and cheese might disappear from lunch trays.
New York City is the largest school system in the country, serving 800,000 lunches daily.
Its lunch menus will eventually contain more healthful, low-fat versions of foods such as chicken nuggets and cheese pizza. Starting this fall, vegetables will be offered five days a week.
New York City is removing the junk food from its 2,400 school vending machines. Take a peek at what can now be found inside.
fruit drinks with less than 100% fruit juice
School officials in New York City hope the changes will help students make more healthful choices. Other school districts around the country are also making similar changes. Some schools are even removing their vending machines.
Many schools use the money from vending machines to pay for sports and other programs. However, health officials say that schools don't need to remove vending machines if they offer more nutritious items in them.
Poor diets and lack of exercise have led to an increase in extremely overweight, or
, kids across the country. Experts say that 15 out of every 100 kids aged 6 to 11 are overweight in the United States.
Another study shows that about 20 out of every 100 third graders and 21 out of every 100 sixth graders in New York City are obese. Being overweight can lead to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.
""We firmly believe that good nutrition plays an essential role in health and development and helps young people to do well in school,"" said the head of New York City's school food service.

552,"For more than 12 years, violent conflict has plagued Azerbaijan (a-zuhr-bigh-JAHN), a country in southwest Asia between Iran and Russia. For much of that time, Azerbaijan has been fighting with neighboring Armenia.
Now Farid Dadashev, age 11, is doing something to stop the fighting.
A few years ago, Farid said, ""I don't want to be a soldier when I grow up. I want to be a teacher."" Because of that desire for a peaceful life, Farid started the Child Peace Network. He sent out a petition to kids calling for peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia. So far, 10,000 kids from three countries have signed that petition.
In January, Farid traveled to the United Nations (U.N.) in New York City to talk about how the kids in his country are suffering from the war.
Azerbaijan and Armenia have been fighting over a region called Nagorno-Karabakh. Both countries claim the region belongs to them. Most of the people who live in that region are Armenian, and in 1988, the people of Nagorno-Karabakh began asking for independence or to join Armenia.
In 1991, that request turned into a bloody conflict between the two countries. The fighting lasted until 1994, when a cease-fire was declared. Although the cease-fire continues, the two sides have not settled their differences, and fighting still breaks out.
""The war affects everyone in Azerbaijan,"" Elmira Suleymanova, Farid's grandmother, told
from her home in Baku, Azerbaijan. ""No one can feel safe. One night, an entire community was burned to the ground.""
According to the U.N., the years of fighting have left 1 million people homeless. About 30 percent of those refugees are kids under age 15, said Farid.
No one knows if Farid's petition has had an impact on the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But last month, the leaders of the two countries met to discuss peace.

702,"Most schoolchildren in the United States can say the words to the Pledge of Allegiance by heart. But the pledge is now in the middle of a debate. At the center of the debate is whether it is right for students to say the pledge in public schools.
Last summer, a federal court in California ruled that the pledge is
in public school classrooms. A law is considered unconstitutional if a court decides that it goes against the U.S. Constitution. The court ruled that the pledge is unconstitutional because it includes the phrase ""under God.""
The court says that the phrase suggests that the government
, or supports, religion. That would violate the First Amendment to the Constitution. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech and prevents the government from establishing an official religion for the nation.
The recent court ruling has angered many people across the country. They see the pledge as a way to express their
, or loyalty, to the United States.
Nine western states are part of the court's ruling. Students in those states were ordered to stop saying the pledge. Those states are Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Nevada, and Washington.
However, the ruling has been temporarily put on hold. The Elk Grove School District in California, where the case began, has asked the Supreme Court of the United States to review and overturn the lower court's ruling.
Do you think saying the pledge violates the First Amendment? Discuss in class. Then let us know in the Write On section of
Elk Grove Superintendent Dave Gordon said, ""We feel strongly that the words 'under God' do not push religion on children, but reflect this country's history.""

594,"Karissa Ekwall, 10, is giving the mail her stamp of approval. The fifth grader turned a drawing that she made in art class into a postage stamp. ""I drew a picture of me scoring a goal,"" the soccer player told
Karissa made her stamp through a program called ArtStamps. The program provides schools with a creative way to raise money. Karissas schoolFarmington Academy, in Farmington, Connecticuthas raised more than $1,800 to benefit its reading program. It is one of about 40 schools and school districts across the country using ArtStamps.
How does it work? ArtStamps transforms student artwork into sheets of real U.S. postage stamps that people can buy for school fund-raisers. Schools earn money for the stamps that are sold.
""With the ArtStamps project, I had the students choose [to draw] anything about themselves,"" Farmington Academy art teacher Beth Reynalds told WR News. ""They had a wonderful time creating their pieces of art.""

434,"Lakshmi is a 10-year-old girl who lives in India, a country in Asia. Each morning, she gets up and leaves her home by 7 o'clock. But she doesn't go to school; she goes to work.
Beldine Nakaisa is a 9-year-old girl who lives in Kenya, a country in Africa. Each day, she wakes up at 5 a.m. to make breakfast for the family she works for and lives with. She then spends the rest of the day doing dishes, cleaning the family's house, and caring for the family's children.
Beldine and Lakshmi are among the 250 million kids worldwide who have to work, according to the United Nations. Those kids work in people's houses, on farms, or in factories. They make all kinds of products, including carpets, shoes, soccer balls, clothing, bricks, and
Some children are forced to work because their families don't have enough money to feed themselves.
, or about $17, from a man who owns a bidi factory. Lakshmi will work in the bidi factory until her family pays off the loan. But 300 rupees is more money than her parents will ever have. Her brother explained, ""We don't have 300 rupees. We will never have 300 rupees.""
Beldine's family gave her to another family so they wouldn't have to feed her. Beldine's family is very poor. They cannot feed all their children.
According to the United Nations, many of the kids who are forced to work live in Africa, southern parts of Asia, and South America and the Caribbean. About 61 percent of all child workers live in Asia, 32 percent in Africa, and 7 percent in South America and the Caribbean. (See map.)
Many world leaders are trying to stop child labor. In 1998, the president of South Africa said his country would try to ""prevent a new generation of children from becoming victims [of child labor]."" The president of Brazil said he would ""use all [Brazil's] resources to remove children from work."" And last year, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a treaty banning child labor worldwide.
Lee Muthoga, who works to stop child labor, said many poor countries should make new laws to end child labor. ""Lawmakers, the police, religious leaders, and adults have to come together to protect the rights of children,"" he said.

8,"Most people stay indoors during a snowstorm, but Kenneth Libbrecht is not most people. When flurries start drifting down from the sky, the scientist heads out into the cold. He takes his camera with him.
Outside, Libbrecht waits for snowflakes that are just right. Finally, he spots the glittery ice crystals hes been waiting for. As the snowflakes fall, Libbrecht catches them. Then he points his camera and shoots.
Libbrecht caught these cool crystals on camera.
The scientists shiny snapshots recently earned him an award. The award is given to top science photographers around the world.
Libbrecht takes pictures of snowflakes to learn more about their shapes. The crystals form when
or steam, in a cloud freezes. Every snowflake grows into a
That is a six-sided shape. However, no two snowflakes look the same. Experts are not sure why.
To solve the mystery, Libbrecht has traveled to snowy places around the world. He has taken pictures of snowflakes in Canada, Alaska, and Vermont. He takes his research back to his science lab. That is in California.
or pictures. He will spend most of this winter studying them. The scientists outdoor adventures are far from over, though. Libbrecht plans to one day journey to other snowy places to take more photos.
I really enjoy ... watching the snow fall and trying to see what I can find, he told
Its a bit of a treasure hunt.
Read to learn about scientist Kenneth Libbrechts snowy side.
: How do you take pictures of snowflakes?
When I find a good one, Ill [catch it] using a little paintbrush. I then stick it under my microscope and take a picture.
: What advice do you have for kids who want to study snowflakes?
You dont need a lot of fancy equipment. With a simple magnifying glass on a snowy day, you can really see quite a bit if you just stop and look.
In what other ways can cameras help scientists learn more about nature? Why?

moved at an average speed of 15 miles per hour (mph). Some pro football players can run that fast!
The scientists studied the dinosaur's weight, height, and bones. That information helped them figure out how the creature moved. They also used information from dinosaur fossils. Fossils are the remains of plants or animals.
The study included other dinosaurs too. A small two-legged creature was the fastest dinosaur. It moved at about 40 mph.
In the end, researchers summed it up this way: ""When you get down to the science of how animals move ... big things don't move fast,"" says scientist John Hutchinson.

703,"Scientists recently made an unusual discovery in China. They found fossils of a 128-million-year-old dinosaur that had four wings!
You might guess that this creature could fly. But scientists don't believe that to be true. Instead, they think the dinosaur used its feathered wings to glide from tree to tree.

458,"The Obamas become the new first family.
The White House is getting a new first family! Barack Obama, the next president; his wife, Michelle; and their daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, are moving in on January 20.
. At that event, he will become the 44th president of the United States. He will also become the countrys first African American president. Obama will make an
, or promise, to protect the U.S. Constitution.
Afterward, there will be a big parade in Washington, D.C. Up to 5 million people are expected to attend.
For Malia and Sasha, January will be a fun-filled month. The girls will start at their new school. Once the Obamas are settled in the White House, they will also get a puppy.
Obama, however, will be too busy for playtime. He has been working hard since he won the election on November 4. Obama has been choosing his
, or helpers. The Cabinet helps the president make important decisions.
The Cabinet includes Joe Biden, the vice president. Obama picked Rahm Emanuel to be the White House chief of staff. He will be Obamas closest aide.
Obama and members of his Cabinet face many challenges. Some U.S. companies are struggling. Many Americans cannot pay for food or their homes. Obama must also decide how to handle the war in Iraq. That is a country in the Middle East.
The challenges we face as a nation are now more ... difficult, Obama says. But I have no doubt that we can meet them.
Every president makes the same promise at the inaugurationto protect the Constitution. Some presidents still make their celebrations stand out. Heres how.
was the first president to hold an inaugural ball. He and his wife, Dolley, didnt dance, though. They watched the 1809 ball from a platform.
first speech in 1841 was the longest ever8,445 words! He did not wear a coat that day. Harrison got sick and died 31 days later.
went where no president had gone beforethe Internet! His inauguration was the first one shown live online.
In what ways might the country change when Barack Obama becomes president?

96,"Andy is all grown up, but that doesnt mean the adventures end for his toys! In
, Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the gang get dumped at a day care when Andy leaves for college. Lee Unkrich directs the film, which will
or be shown for the first time, on June 18.
student reporter Troy Stephens recently caught up with the filmmaker.
How did you become a movie director?
When I was growing up, I loved watching movies. When it was time to go to college, I decided to study how to make movies.
How does this film compare to the other Toy Story movies?
Hopefully people will like it as much as they liked the first two. We worked really hard to tell ... the most funny, entertaining story we possibly could.

470,"Grizzly bears are protected by the Endangered Species Act.
Grizzly bears are huge, powerful animals. Thousands once lived in the western United States. In recent years, however, the number of bears has been very low.
loss caused many bears to die off.
A habitat is a place in nature where an animal lives. The bears' habitat became smaller as people cut down trees to build homes and roads.
Many people thought they would never again see a grizzly in the West. Now wildlife officials say the bears are making a comeback.
Grizzly bears live in Yellowstone National Park and the surrounding forests. That area covers parts of the western states of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. Today, more than 550 grizzlies live there. That is almost double the number that lived there in the 1980s!
The bears living in the Yellowstone area have been protected by the Endangered Species Act since 1975. Wildlife officials say those bears may be taken off the endangered species list within the next year.
""That does not mean the bears will no longer be protected,"" grizzly bear expert Chris Servheen told
. ""We will continue to monitor them to make sure they are healthy. A lot of people are interested in making sure grizzlies survive.""
Is it important to set aside areas of land where people can't build roads and homes? Why or why not?

59,"Four astronauts recently launched a new mission. However, this mission did not take place in space. It took place 60 feet below the surface of the ocean.
The astronauts spent 10 days living in a place called
. It is a research lab on the seafloor off the coast of Florida. The lab prepares astronauts for future missions to space.
During their stay, the astronauts slept, cooked, and played under the surface of the sea. They also worked on research projects. The projects help scientists understand how to better travel and work in space.
""It's very similar to living in space,"" said one astronaut. ""The fact that stuff doesn't float is the only difference.""

645,"A new study shows fastfood advertising to kids is on the rise.

Those experts say too much fast food is
kids health. To harm is to hurt. They say the foods have too many
A calorie is a unit of energy in food.
more burgers and French fries than ever. To consume is to eat. That is according to a new report. Experts recently spent a year studying what kids eat at fastfood restaurants.
They found that onethird of U.S. kids eat fast food every day. Also, about 84 percent of parents take their kids to a fastfood restaurant every week.
One reason young people may like to eat at the restaurants is advertising. The report shows that 6 to 11yearolds see more than three fastfood ads each day.
Many restaurants say their ads show healthy foods. We [mostly] advertise our ... Happy Meal, Neil Golden told
He is a spokesperson for McDonalds. [It comes with] Apple Dippers ... and lowfat milk.
Still, many ads continue to show unhealthy choices, Jennifer Harris told
She helped write the report. Harris says she hopes parents read the report.
[Restaurants will] listen to their customers if they [ask for] better food and [fewer ads], Harris says.
Fastfood restaurants offer a lot of choices, so its easy to eat healthy on the go. How would you mix and match the foods below to create a healthy fastfood meal?

297,"One small step for a woman, one giant leap for womankind! Astronaut Sally Ride became the first American woman to
, or travel, to space. She made the journey 25 years ago on June 18, 1983.
student reporter Leah Meador talked with Ride about her starring role in NASAs history.
Sally Ride checks in with NASA from the space shuttle in 1983.
How did you feel when you were going into space?
I was unbelievably excited. There is no amusement park ride even close to the experience of flying into space.
What inspired you to become an astronaut?
I was always interested in science from the time that I was in second or third grade. Science was always my favorite subject.
What did it mean to you to be the first U.S. woman to go into space?
It meant a lot to me to be [a] role model ... for young girls who wanted to be astronauts.
Who is the person that supported you the most while you were trying to become an astronaut?
My high school science teacher. She was a good teacher, but what was really important to me is that she helped me build my confidence ... She helped me believe in myself.

110,", or burial places, may be too popular for their own good. Egypt is a country in Africa.
Thousands of people visit the tombs every day. Some of Egypts most important rulers from long ago are buried in them. The tomb tours, however, may be hurting the burial sites.
Visitors breath and the heat from their bodies are wearing down the tombs walls, says Zahi Hawass. He is an expert on Egypts past. If things dont change, the tombs could be history. [They] could disappear between 150 and 500 years, Hawass says.
Visitors crowd into a tomb in Egypt.
To protect the treasures, officials are setting up new air systems in the tombs. They are also limiting the number of people who may visit. Some of the burial places will be closed for good. That includes the tomb of the famous boy king Tutankhamen (too-tan-KAH-muhn).

86,"All ice-skaters should thank Finland. That is a country in Europe. Scientists recently discovered that people who lived in Finland in
or long-ago, times were the first to create and use ice skates. They made the first ice skates about 5,000 years ago. Instead of metal blades, they used animal bones, including horse bones.
Finland has many lakes that freeze during the winter. Scientists say those lakes form the highest
, or collection, of ice in the world. People in ancient times used the skates as a way to cross the frozen lakes. That cut down their travel time.
""Wherever people needed to travel, they would find at least one lake on their route,"" Federico Formenti, study coauthor, told

361,"Schools are cracking down on flu germs.
You may have new homework this year: washing your hands!
Schools are trying to get rid of germsand for good reason. A new type of flu is spreading around the world. Doctors believe about 1 million Americans may have gotten the H1N1
A virus is a type of germ that makes people sick. The H1N1 virus is also called swine flu. It causes
such as fever, cough, and sore throat. Symptoms are signs of a problem.
The virus usually lasts for only a few days. But it spreads very quickly. Since the virus was found last April, it has affected people in more than 150 countries.
School officials dont want the virus to harm students. Some schools will ask ill students to stay home for seven days to make sure they dont get other children sick.
. That is medicine that helps the body fight off germs. Doctors plan to give out the vaccine in the fall.
Until then, you can stay healthy by washing your hands with soap often. It will make a difference, says Cornelia Dekker, a California doctor. Its really going to help a lot if we can keep the virus from spreading.
How does the flu go from me to you to your best friend, Sue? Lets find out.
 When a sick person coughs, tiny drops of virus spray out of his mouth. The drops land on his hands.
 Before washing up, the sick person touches his pals hand. The virus moves to her hand.
 After coming in contact with the germs, she touches her eyes, nose, or mouth. The virus enters her body.
 Flu-like symptoms appear one to four days later. She can leave germs on items she touches, including doors.
In what other ways can schools avoid the H1N1 virus?

536,"A map of Antarctica shows the route Arnesen and Bancroft plan to take on their record-setting trek.
Ever since they were little girls, Liv Arnesen and Ann Bancroft have dreamed of adventure. Now the two women want to set a world's record by skiing across Antarctica.
Imagine skiing across 2,400 miles of ice and snow. The freezing winds blow at 100 mile per hour as you pull a 250-pound supply sled.
In November, former teachers Liv Arnesen and Ann Bancroft will try to become the first women to ski across Antarctica. The
or long journey, would set a world's record for the longest distance ever skied by women. But for Arnesen, age 46, and Bancroft, age 44, their Antarctic trek is also about following their childhood dreams.
The message the polar explorers want people to know is that there are no barriers. ""The world is for all of us, and it is at our fingertips. Go get it,"" Bancroft said recently.
Arnesen and Bancroft's trek will last from November to February. They will be crossing during Antarctica's summer months, when the average temperature is 30 degrees below zero!
To complete the trip in 100 days, the women will attach themselves to sails, using the wind to help them ski faster.
In 1994, Arnesen was the first woman to ski to the South Pole. In 1993, Bancroft became the only woman to reach both the North and South poles.

George Washington/painted by Gilbert Stuart; engraved by H.S. Sadd
Did you know that George Washington wore false teeth? People once thought they were made of wood. Early last year, scientists discovered that the rumor was
His teeth were actually made of gold, ivory, lead, and animal teeth.
The discovery is helping historians show the true Washington. In many portraits, the first U.S. president is shown as a serious old man. Historians are now building three life-size models to show the more exciting side ofWashington. They are based on real items from his life, including his teeth. The figures will show Washington in three stages of his lifeat the ages of 19, 45, and 57.
The figures will be on display in October at a new museum at Mount Vernon. Mount Vernon was Washingtons Virginia home.

718,"At only 11, Abigail Breslin works with famous people and has earned an Academy Award
! A nomination is a recommendation for an award.
student reporter Christiana Dillard recently interviewed the actor about her new movie,
. Abigail plays Nim, a girl who has to protect her island home.
When did you know that the character of Nim was right for you?
I guess I kind of thought that when I read it. I really liked that she could take care of her island on her own.
. It's about a ... family who lives in St. Louis right during the time of the St. Louis World's Fair. They find out that they are going to move ... before the fair.
What would you like to be if you weren't an actor?

502,"The Great Lakes are in hot water! Pollution and unwelcome sea creatures are harming the bodies of water.
Now, the U.S. government is diving into a plan to help save the lakes. Part of the plan is to clean the Great Lakes. Companies have dumped wastewater and chemicals into the waters over the years. That is dangerous because the lakes provide drinking water to more than 40 million people.
Those are plants or animals that get moved to a new place and harm the life there. Some invasive species kill fish that live in the Great Lakes.

370,"Each African elephant has a one-of-a-kind voice, say scientists.
Why are scientists tuning in to elephant chats?
Many people have heard the loud trumpet sounds that elephants make. But did you know that elephants make a lot of other noises that humans can't hear?
Scientists have recently learned that each elephant has a unique voice.
means ""one of a kind."" Scientist Anne Savage told
, ""Each person's voice is different. It's the same for elephants.""
The scientists listened to the secret language of African elephants at Disney's Animal Kingdom in Florida. To hear the elephants, they used special equipment. Each elephant wore a radio collar fitted with a microphone. Then the sound was recorded and studied using a computer.
, or at risk of dying out. In the past, people have hunted the elephants for their ivory tusks. Today that practice is not allowed in most African countries. However, some people ignore the laws and still hunt elephants. The huge animals are also endangered because people build homes and farms in areas where elephants live.
African elephants are the largest living land animals. The average male weighs more than four cars!
An African elephant never sweats. Heat escapes through its large ears to keep the animal cool.
African elephants like to take baths every day. Then, they cover themselves in dirt to keep insects away.
The work scientists are doing at Animal Kingdom may help African elephants in the wild. ""If we can tell individual voices apart, we can keep track of each elephant over time,"" says Savage. ""We can tell when elephants are feeling nervous by the voices they are using. In the wild, that would help us know if they are in danger, so we can help them.""

558,"Teasing and name-calling are forms of bullying.
Kids who tease and threaten others are bullies. Now there are new laws to stop them.
Drew Landry, 12, from Maine knows what it's like to be bullied. Last year, when Drew was in sixth grade, he was bullied by an eighth grader. ""It was hard to get through,"" Drew told
. With the help of his parents and school officials, the bullying has stopped.
Drew is not alone. Many kids are victims of bullying. That is why states across the country have enacted anti-bullying laws.
means ""to sign into law."" Some schools already have rules to stop bullying. However, many lawmakers felt those rules were not tough enough.
Maine is now the 18th state to enact such a law. The law requires schools to create a plan to prevent and deal with bullying. All adults who work with students must be trained to handle bullying problems.
If you are being bullied, you can do something about it! Here are three tips from the National Center for School Safety.
If you are being bullied, tell the bully in a firm voice that you do not like what he or she is doing.
Find an adult right away, and tell the adult what happened.
A bully picks on another person again and again. Many kids think of bullying as hitting or pushing, but it is more than that. It often takes the form of name-calling, teasing, and threatening.
Drew wants to make sure no other kids are bullied. He spoke in front of lawmakers to support Maine's new law. ""I helped change the law to help other kids feel better about themselves,"" says Drew. ""The new law also makes me feel safer.""
Why might someone try to bully another person? What would you do if a friend was being bullied?

73,"What is it like to fly into the middle of a hurricane?
. In fact, he flies straight into them! Hurricanes are strong storms that form over oceans. Their winds can blow more than 155 miles per hour.
Chad Gibson collects data during a hurricane.
Gibson is part of the Hurricane Hunters. Their job is to fly airplanes into storms. Hurricane Hunters are part of the U.S. Air Force Reserve. They help scientists
, or guess, where the storms are headed.
This year, the fliers have zipped through several spinners, including Hurricane Jimena (hee-MAY-nuh). That storm hit Mexico in September. Scientists predict that even more storms are on their way. Hurricane season lasts from June 1 to November 30.
Flying through a storm is almost like being surrounded by a giant wall of clouds, Gibson says. There are times when ... you really cant see anything else.
Hurricane Hunters fly through storms for more than just the view. They use tools to study the hurricanes temperature and wind speed. Those details can help determine how big a storm is and whether it will become stronger.
Gibson and his team send the data to
on land. Those are scientists who study weather. They figure out how the storms will affect the United States.
The data we collect [help save] thousands of lives, Gibson told
. And that isnt the only plus, he says. Going into the center of the storm is just incredible.
Mother Nature knows how to whip up a perfect storm. It takes just the right amount of warm water and wind. Heres how a hurricane happens.

157,"Scientists digging in Guatemala recently got a king-size surprise. They found a royal
, or resting place. Guatemala is a country in Central America.
This bowl was buried with a king.
Researchers found the 1,600-year-old tomb under layers of stone and mud. It might have belonged to a Mayan king. The Mayas were Native Americans. They lived more than 1,000 years ago in what is now Mexico and Central America.
The king might have led a city called El Zotz. The tomb was buried under a pyramid there. Drawings on the tomb walls suggest the rulers name meant red turtle or great turtle.
Researcher Stephen Houston helped make the discovery. He is excited to study the items that were buried with the ruler. The tomb has many things we have not seen before, he told

47,"The 2005 nickel will have a larger image of Thomas Jefferson.
Thomas Jefferson is getting a makeover--on the nickel. The coin will have a larger image of the third U.S. president. This is the first time his image has been updated since being put on the coin in 1938.
The other side of the coin will also get a new look. The image of Jefferson's home in Virginia will be removed. In its place will be one of two new designs--a picture of a buffalo or a view of the ocean.
The coins are part of the Westward Journey Nickel Series. ""The 2005 nickel designs follow Thomas Jefferson's vision to explore the Great West,"" said the director of the U.S. Mint.

401,"Animal experts say that we should give overweight pets less food.
Fluffy and Fido may need your help. Many cats and dogs in the United States are too fat, scientists report. Like people, overweight pets are at risk for health problems.
How did all those cats and dogs get so pudgy? Their owners are feeding them too much food!
""If you can feel the ribs under your pets skin but not see them, your pet is a perfect weight,"" animal expert Karen Volkerts told
What should you do if your cat or dog is too heavy? Give your pet less food, say animal experts. Pudgy pets can be given smaller meals or diet pet food. Regular exercise also keeps pets from becoming couch potatoes.
Owners often share their food with their pets. ""Dogs and cats have their own special food for a reason. They dont digest human food well,"" said Volkerts. ""The best way to spoil pets is to play with them.""

331,"Most gym teachers wear sneakers. The coaches at the New England Aquarium, however, have flippers instead!
The aquarium is in Boston, Massachusetts. Five seals at the aquarium have splashed up a new way to get kids excited about exercise. Together, the kids and seals dance and stretch. The moves
the animals normal behavior. To mimic is to copy.
The seals are part of a program at the aquarium that helps kids in Massachusetts be healthy. About one-third of children in the state are overweight, studies show.
As kids work out with the seals, trainers explain how the moves can keep them fit. Jackson Petrella, 9, learned that while exercising with a seal named Ursula. He gave the workout his seal of approval.
I never thought of animals as athletes, he told

593,"Did you forget to wear a watch today? People in Saudi Arabia dont need one! The biggest clock in the world recently started ticking at the top of a skyscraper there. Saudi Arabia is a country in Asia.
This new clock will tower above the rest!
When it is finished, the clock tower will have four clock faces. Each face will have a
of 141 feet. A diameter is the distance across the middle of an object. Only one face is done so far. Each face will be lit by 2 million lights, so people up to 16 miles away can see the time, officials say.
The structure ticks past the competition. The next biggest clock is in Europe. That timekeeper is about 20 feet smaller in diameter than the clock in Saudi Arabia.

719,"Historians have found an old well in Virginia. The well was used as a dump after it went dry. Recently, the historians found an old piece of armor in the well.
The old armor came from the earliest English settlers. The historians hope that the armor will help them learn more about the settlers' lives.
The old well is located where the Jamestown fort used to be. On April 26, 1607, a group of settlers from England landed in Virginia. After exploring the area, they built a fort. They called the fort Jamestown. Jamestown was the first permanent English town in North America.
The historians hope that the well at Jamestown contains other things that the settlers threw away. The objects, or

178,"Have you heard the well-known tale about George Washington and the cherry tree?
According to legend, Washington chopped the tree down when he was a boy and told the truth about it. Experts dont think that really happened, but they do know where the chopping would have taken place!
Washington was the first president of the United States. Scientists recently found and dug up parts of his childhood home. The house is near Fredericksburg, Va. That is about 50 miles south of Washington, D.C.
The scientists found the houses base and cellars. Inside the building, they discovered thousands of
. Those are old objects. The artifacts include tea sets, wig curlers, and toothbrush handles made of bone.
When we found the house, we knew it provided a new way to look at [Washingtons] surroundings, David Muraca told
. He is a scientist with the George Washington Foundation, which owns the land.

Deep in the jungle of southeastern Mexico, researchers stumbled upon a surprise. They found an
or very old, pyramid. The pyramid was buried underground. It is covered in colorful
A mural is a painting on a wall. Those murals are helping scientists unlock a mystery about people from long ago.
The murals are about 1,350 years old. Thats more than five times older than the United States. Experts say the paintings belonged to the
That is a group of Native American people. They lived many years ago in what is now Mexico and Central America.
The paintings show scenes from everyday Mayan life. One mural shows a man drinking from a bowl. Another is of a woman selling food to a crowd of people.
Scientists are excited about the discovery because they dont know much about the Mayas daily lives, explains Michael Coe. He is an expert on the Mayas. The paintings show how the Mayas worked, shopped, and dined.
Mostly you get the murals ... that show gods and kings, never anything about daily life, Coe told
This is like walking into a Maya supermarket.
So far, scientists have found more than 30 murals on the pyramid. They are not sure why the Mayas created them. The experts hope to learn more as they continue their search.
We never had anything like this before, says Coe. These are really [special] murals.
The Mayas were known for more than just painting. Keep reading to learn some fun facts about the Mayan way of life.
The Mayas lived in what is now Central and North America. Today the area includes parts of Mexico, Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.

The Mayas invented a type of math. They also created a type of writing that uses
or pictures (above). Mayas made books using tree bark.
The Mayas often chowed on corn and used it to make other foods, such as tortillas. They grew many crops, including avocados, beans, chili peppers, and sweet potatoes.
Mayan men wrapped themselves in strips of cloth, while women wore long, loose dresses.

27,"Are you tired of looking at the same old coins? Some coin collectors say the penny, nickel, dime, and half dollar need a new look. They want the U.S. Mint to change the images on those coins. ""It would be great to have change in our pocket change. It is long overdue,"" said coin expert Donn Pearlman.
Coin experts suggest using images such as heroes or animals on coins. It would not be the first time coins have been changed. For example, since 1999, quarters have been updated with new images. Those images honor the history of the 50 states. Officials at the U.S. Mint say that people really like the new quarters.
""Money is history you can hold in your hand,"" said coin collector Steve Bobbitt. If some people get their way, coins may soon tell a different history.

238,"A new kind of pet is becoming popular-the mini cow. ""They're almost like a dog, but they don't jump on you,"" said Dustin Pillard. He raises miniature cows on his farm in Iowa.
Normal-sized cows can be 6 feet tall and weigh about 1,500 pounds. Mini cows are only about 3 feet tall and weigh a lot less than normal-sized cows. You would not be able to carry a mini cow in your arms though. ""They weigh about 500 pounds, so they aren't lap animals,"" said cattle rancher Robert Kehoe.
Some people say mini cows make good pets. That does not mean they will be replacing dogs or cats. Would you want a 500-pound cow lying at the foot of your bed?

148,"Skateboarding is rolling into gym class! ""Skateboards get kids moving,"" physical education (PE) teacher Richard Cendali told
Cendali teaches at Douglass Elementary School in Boulder, Colorado. He is the first PE teacher in the country to teach the sport.
During the past 10 years, team sports have become less popular. Sports such as skateboarding, yoga, and rock climbing are on the rise. They are known as ""the new PE."" These sports help keep kids from becoming
or very overweight. Being obese can lead to health problems.
Not every kid likes to play team sports. Learning individual sports gives them a way to stay fit. ""Skate class is more fun than regular PE, and [it is] a better workout,"" says Joyce Mason, an eighth grader at West Middle School in Aurora, Colorado.

440,"American scientists have reason to cheer. This year, for the first time since 1983, Americans have won all of the Nobel Prizes in science. Five U.S. scientists will be presented with their prizes on December 10 in Sweden. Sweden is a country in Europe.
One winner, Roger Kornberg, is the son of a previous Nobel Prize winner. His father, Arthur, won in 1959. This is the eighth time since 1915 that a parent and child have each won a Nobel award.

344,"Martin Luther King Jr. is famous for his I Have a Dream speech of 1963. Builders in Washington, D.C., have a dream of their ownto build a monument in Kings honor.
Their dream is starting to come true. Construction recently began on the Washington, D.C. Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial. The project will be finished in 2010.
People want to celebrate King because of the good work he did. King (19291968) grew up in the southern United States. At that time, the South was
, or separated, by race. Under the law, black people could not attend the same schools as white people. They also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains.
King worked to change the laws. He gave speeches and led peaceful marches. Thanks to King and other leaders, Congress passed
. Those laws make sure that Americans have equal rights.

182,"The world brings aid to earthquake survivors.
People in Haiti need your help! On January 12, a powerful earthquake shook the country. The quake had such force that many homes and schools were destroyed. Even parts of the presidents palace crumbled.
This boys town was destroyed by the earthquake.
Haiti is in Latin America. It is about 700 miles southeast of Florida. About 200,000 people died in the earthquake. It also caused millions of dollars worth of
or harm. Officials estimate that 2 million Haitians were left homeless.
Many of those people now live outdoors. Families sleep in tents in Port-au-Prince. That is the capital of Haiti. People there need
or immediate, aid. I cant continue sleeping outside with the children, says Rose-Marie Dedieu, a mother in Haiti.
A member of the U.S. military carries an injured Haitian girl.
The United States and other countries are helping Haitians. The United States has
or promised, $100 million in aid for Haiti. Former U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton are leading the efforts. Americans are giving food, supplies, and millions of dollars to Haiti. Even kids are getting in on the act. Many students have been holding fund-raisers at their schools to collect money.
Winnie Romeril flew to Haiti a few days after the earthquake. She is a volunteer with the American Red Cross. Romeril and other workers are giving the people in Haiti blankets, water, and other basic items.
She says theyre making small changes every day. And were going to keep making things get better ... until people are really back on their feet again, Romeril told
10,714 square miles (Haiti is about the same size as Massachusetts.)
French and Creole, a mix of languages
Haiti is the second-oldest country in the Americas, after the United States. It won its independence from France in 1804.
Why might the United States want to help Haiti?

219,"A drawing shows how a Mayan palace found in Cancuen might have looked.
Scientists have discovered a lost city, hidden under a thick curtain of jungle trees, plants, and vines. American Indians known as the Maya, who lived in Mexico and Central America, built the city in Guatemala. Scientists believe the city is more than 2,000 years old.

traveled very far--more than 2 billion miles! ""The trip has sort of been like a long car drive, and we can't wait to get out there and explore the sites,"" said scientist Jeremy Jones.
Saturn. That means it is flying in a path around the planet.

will be busy. It will study Saturn and its rings. It will also study the 33 known moons that orbit Saturn.
Enceladus (left) and Iapetus (right) are two of Saturn's moons.
Scientists say Saturn holds clues to how the solar system began. They say that Saturn and its moons are almost like a tiny version of our solar system.
What do scientists expect to find? No one knows for sure. ""In many ways, the most exciting part of the journey is about to begin, because we don't know what lies ahead,"" said scientist Julie Webster.
Earth and the other planets in our solar system travel around the sun. Saturn is the second-largest planet in the solar system. (Jupiter is the largest planet.) More than nine Earths could line up across Saturn!

561,"Is it a Dollar or a Quarter?
A few of the Sacagawea (sa-kuh-juh-WEE-uh) dollar coins have been misprinted. One side of the new gold-colored coin shows the face of George Washington. That is usually found on a quarter. The other side shows the back of a Sacagawea dollar coin.
So far, only four misprinted coins have been reported. Coin collectors call these very rare coins

347,"Peggy Whitson's job is out of this world. She is an astronaut. In October 2007, she became the first woman to lead the International Space Station. That is a giant lab in space. The station is being built as it moves around, or
, Earth. Astronauts live and work at the station.
How does Whitson feel about commanding the space station?
""I think it's special that I get the opportunity to play that role,"" she says. Most NASA astronauts are men. NASA is the U.S. space agency. Whitson thinks it is important for women to be a part of the space program.
When Whitson returns home in April, she will set another record. She will have spent more time in space than any other woman.
First woman to pilot a space shuttle

95,"You might think penguins walk in a funny way. But there's a good reason that they waddle. Waddling helps penguins save energy. It could also be helpful to humans.
Scientists studied how penguins move. Because they have short legs and big feet, penguins would get worn out quickly if they walked. When they waddle, penguins rock back and forth. The motion moves them forward easily.
The scientists say that waddling could help some people who have trouble walking. Scientists may design new walking devices that move as penguins do.

417,"The presidential inauguration will happen on Saturday, January 20. On that day, our new president will be welcomed with a special ceremony. Many people will watch the new president promise to lead and protect our country.
At noon on January 20, the presidential
will begin. The inauguration is a ceremony that marks the beginning of the presidency. The ceremony takes place outside the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.
The most important event in the inauguration is the president's
. An oath is a promise. The president promises that he or she will work hard to lead and protect our country.
I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of the President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States
President Bill Clinton will leave the White House on January 20. Recently, the president answered some questions from
What were the most important things you did during your presidency?
I'm proud of all that we have done to help bring peace to the world. I'm proud of a new program we created in 1993 called AmeriCorps, which gives young people a chance to serve their communities while earning money for college.
What advice would you give the next president?
I'd give the new president the same advice I'd give your readers: Get up each morning ready to do the best you can.
Why should kids be proud to be Americans?
We should all be proud to be Americans because this truly is a land of opportunity. [No matter what your background is], you can work hard and [reach] your dreams.
After being president for eight years, what will you do now?
I'll continue to work hard on some of the issues that are very important to me [such as helping poor people and the environment]. I'm sure I'll be very busy, but I also hope to spend more time with my family and friends and to simply relax after what has been eight of the most incredible years of my life.

337,"Naoko Takahashi buzzed past other runners in the Olympic
last year. (A marathon is a 26-mile footrace.) The runner says that hornets helped her win the gold medal for Japan, a country in Asia. The insects didn't lend Naoko their wings, however.
Before and during the race, Takahashi drank the stomach juice of giant hornets! Japanese scientists say that the drink helps people move faster and prevents muscles from tiring. A Japanese company plans to make a sports drink out of hornet juice soon.

108,"spoke with Mary Ann Hoberman to learn more about her. Here are her answers to our questions.
I always knew I was going to be a writer, even before I knew how to write. When I was 4 or 5 years old, I was already making up rhymes, songs, and stories. I used to recite them to my little brother.
What do you like most about poetry?
I love playing with language. I love rhyme, rhythm, and repetition. It is something that is really a great joy.
What are your favorite topics to write about?
Animals, families, nature, games, and then just kinds of things where I play with words. I love to play with words, and words that have different meanings.
What advice would you give kids about writing poetry?

429,"is a large body of salt water. It can be divided into three layers called
The deeper the water, the colder it gets. Read a about each zone to learn more.
The ocean is different from top to bottom.
The top layer of the ocean is called the sunlit zone. It gets enough sunlight for plants to grow. All ocean plants and most ocean animals live here. Whales and dolphins live in this zone. They need to swim to the surface to breathe air.
The porcupine fish lives here too. It puffs up and raises its spines to scare off
A predator is an animal that eats another animal for food.
Twilight Zone (650 feet to 3,300 feet)
The ocean is colder in the twilight zone. Only dim light reaches this area. Plants cannot grow in this zone. Fewer animals live here than in the sunlit zone. Jelly fish and octopuses are often found here.
Many jellyfish have stinging tentacles. Jellyfish use their tentacles to capture
. Prey are animal that are eaten by predators. Octopuses have suction cups on their tentacles. That helps them hold on to prey.
Midnight Zone (3,300 feet to 19,800 feet)
The midnight zone is dark. It is also very cold. Plants do not grow in this zone. Animals here often have sharp teeth and big jaws. Many animals, such as the ratfish, have large eyes. That helps them see in the dark.
Some animals, such as the deep sea hatchetfish, give off light. Their light blends in with the small amount of sunlight from above. That helps them hide from predators below.
Why might it be useful to know more about the different layers of the ocean?

433,"Summer is just around the corner. It is a time when many kids swim and play outdoors. Follow these simple steps to stay safe and have fun this summer.
Pools, lakes, and oceans are great places to beat the summer heat. While you swim and play, make sure to follow water-safety rules.
Always swim with a buddy, never alone.
Be sure an adult is watching you while you swim.
Being outside in warm, fresh air is fun during the summer. Although the sun feels nice, it can be harmful. Sun can burn your skin even in a short time.
Always use sunscreen. Remember to rub it in evenly.
Wear a hat or sunglasses to protect your eyes.
Always wear a helmet when you ride.
In-line skating, biking, and riding a scooter are good ways to stay fit. It is important to follow road rules and be wheel-safe.
Always wear a helmet when you ride and skate.
Use wrist guards, knee pads, and elbow pads while in-line skating.
Drink plenty of water while playing outdoors.
Play only in safe places, away from streets.
Stay away from hot grills and open fires.
Use bug spray to prevent insect bites.

407,"February is Black History Month. During this time, we remember important African Americans. Read about four people who made history.
In 1947, Jackie Robinson changed history. He became the first African American to play majorleague baseball. He played for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Until then, African Americans were not allowed to play in the major leagues.
Rosa Parks spent her life fighting for equal rights. Those rights make sure all people are treated fairly. In 1955, Parks was arrested in Alabama for not giving up her bus seat to a white person. Her brave act helped change unfair laws.
George Washington Carver was an inventor. He was born on a farm in Missouri. He found more than 300 new uses for peanuts. Those uses include making soap, glue, and paint. Carver also taught people better ways to farm.
Marian Anderson was a famous singer. In 1955, she became the first African American to sing a leading role at the Metropolitan Opera. That is an opera house in New York City. She was also the first African American to sing at the White House.

513,"Many eggs recently hatched at SeaWorld in San Diego, California. The park is now home to 81 baby green sea turtles! Each turtle was about 3 inches long when it hatched. The baby turtles are fed krill, squid, and shrimps.
SeaWorld has 32 adult green sea turtles. They are about 40 or 50 years old. Green sea turtles can live to be more than 100 years old.

237,"African penguins are in trouble. Their numbers are getting smaller. The penguins were recently listed as
That means they are at risk of dying out.
The penguins are not able to find enough fish to eat. In 1956, about 120,000 African penguin pairs were counted. In 2009, only 26,000 pairs were counted.
Scientists are trying to save the penguins. The scientists are working to close fishing areas near where the penguins live. They hope that will help the penguins find more fish.

401,"The Story of Martin Luther King Jr.
King was a leader who dreamed of a better world.
Martin Luther King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia. Each January, Americans honor him with a holiday. This year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is January 19.
King gives his I Have a Dream speech to a large crowd in Washington, D.C.
When King was growing up, the laws in some places were unfair. Those laws treated African American people differently from white people. African Americans were not allowed to go to the same schools as white students. Many were also forced to sit in the back of buses.
House: James Randklev/Corbis; Young Martin Luther King: Martin Luther King Family
Kings birth home is in Atlanta, Georgia. Here he is at age 6.
In the 1950s and 1960s, King worked to change unfair laws. He led peaceful marches and gave many speeches. In 1963, King gave his famous I Have a Dream speech. He said, I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
As a result of Kings hard work, equal rights laws were passed. Those laws make sure that all Americans are treated fairly and equally.

316,"March Is National Nutrition Month. You can celebrate this special month by learning how to eat healthfully.
Good health is the main goal of the American Dietetic Association. This organization gives people tips on how to live well. They say that being healthy is as easy as learning your ABCs.
Being healthy means getting exercise. Take time each day to play games or sports that get your body moving.
Use the food pyramid to help you decide what to eat during the day. The right mixture of foods will give you the energy you need to work and play.
Choose healthful foods. Try not to eat foods that contain lots of sugar. That will keep your body healthy.
The American Dietetic Association offers these tips for living well:
You'll think better at school with a full stomach.
Wash your hands often to stop germs from spreading.

568,"The ocean is filled with many different kinds of animals. This sea turtle lives in the upper zone of the water.
Killer whales breach, or jump out of the water.
is a large body of salt water. It can be divided into three
or layers. The deeper the water, the colder it gets. Why? Sunlight reaches only the water near the ocean's surface. Take a look in each zone to see some of the animals that live there.
The top layer of the ocean is called the sunlit zone. It is lit by enough sunlight for plants to grow. All plants and most marine animals live in this zone. Whales live here because they need to swim to the surface to breathe air.
Some fish here have special shapes to protect them from
A predator is an animal that eats another animal for food. The porcupine fish puffs up and raises its spines when danger is near.
Twilight Zone (650 feet to 3,300 feet)
The ocean is colder in the twilight zone. Only dim light reaches this area. There is not enough light for plants to grow. Fewer sea creatures are found here than in the sunlit zone. Jellyfish and octopuses are often found here.
Many jellyfish have stinging tentacles that they use to defend themselves and to capture
Prey is an animal that is caught and eaten by a predator. Octopuses use the suction cups on their tentacles to hold on to prey.
Midnight Zone (3,300 feet to 19,800 feet)
It is pitch-dark and very cold in the midnight zone. No plants grow here. Many of the animals have sharp teeth and big jaws. Other creatures, such as the ratfish, have large eyes to see in the dark. Ratfish swim along the bottom of the ocean and eat smaller sea animals, such as shrimp and sea stars.

193,"Happy Presidents Day! The holiday honors two great presidentsGeorge Washington and Abraham Lincoln. They were both born in February.
Washington was the first president of the United States. He is known as the Father of Our Country. Lincoln was the 16th president. He fought to end slavery. Here are some ways our country honors those great leaders.
Our countrys capital city is Washington, D.C. It is named after our first president. A
to honor President Washington is there. A memorial is something that keeps a memory alive. It is called the Washington Monument. It is more than 555 feet tall.
The capital also has a memorial to honor Lincoln. The Lincoln Memorial is a building. A large statue of Lincoln is inside. It is 19 feet tall.
Mount Rushmore shows the faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln.
Mount Rushmore is a famous memorial in South Dakota. The heads of Washington and Lincoln are carved into Mount Rushmore. Each head is as tall as a six-story building! The heads of two other U.S. presidents are also carved there.
Where do we see the faces of Washington and Lincoln every day? On our money! Washingtons face appears on the quarter and $1 bill. Lincolns image is on the penny and $5 bill.
Why might people want to visit memorials?

618,"Robins are birds found in the United States. The robin is one of the first birds to show up in the spring. Some people say that seeing a robin is a sign that winter will soon be over!
Robins build nests to lay thier eggs. A robin's nest is made of grass and mud. The mud helps the pieces of grass stick together. The nest is in the shape of a bowl. Robins usually build their nests in trees and shrubs.
A mother robin lays her eggs in the nest. Three to five eggs are laid at one time. The robin eggs are light blue. The mother sits on top of the eggs to keep them safe and warm. Baby robins hatch in about two weeks.
When a robin hatches from its egg, it has no feathers and it is blind. Its parents need to take care of it. The parents bring worms, spiders, and insects for the babies to eat. Baby robins grow up fast. After about two weeks, baby robins will leave their nest.
Why might a mother robin build her nest in a tree or shrub?

103,"Follow the tips below to have a super summer.
Grab your beach towel, sunglasses, and sunscreen! Summer is just around the corner. It starts on June 21. For most kids, that means more time to play outside and have fun.
Experts say that more injuries occur during the summer months. Follow these tips to make sure you stay safe while enjoying the season.
Apply sunscreen every two hours, say experts.
Many kids will spend hours playing outside in the summer sun. Be careful, though. The suns harmful rays can cause damage to your skin and eyes.
If you are out in the sun, be sure to wear sunscreen. It should have a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher, say experts. Make sure you rub it in everywhere your skin is showing.
You should also wear a hat and sunglasses that protect against the suns harmful rays. Better yet, play in the shade!
You can beat the heat by splashing in a pool. Just make sure you follow water-safety rules. Always swim with a grown-up watching you. You should also swim with a buddy. If you dont know how to swim, you can take lessons.
Biking and in-line skating are good ways to exercise. To stay wheel safe, always wear a helmet. It protects your head and brain if you fall. If you are in-line skating, also wear wrist guards, elbow pads, and kneepads.

A team of scientists went on a butterfly hunt in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The park is located in Tennessee and North Carolina. Scientists found more than 700 kinds of moths and butterflies.

Get ready to rock! It's a special year for the Grand Canyon. It was named a
100 years ago. A national monument is a place that is protected by the United States government.
is a long, narrow valley with high cliffs on each side. Canyons are often carved by fast-moving rivers. The Grand Canyon is in Arizona. It was carved by the Colorado River. The river still flows through the Grand Canyon and wears away the rock.
Each year, about 5 million people visit the Grand Canyon. Scientists are working to protect the area. They do that by studying changes in the canyon. They want to make sure the natural wonder is around for hundreds of years.
Expert Andy Pearce teaches kids about the canyon. ""It is a
landscape,"" he says. ""There is really nothing else like it in the world.""
The Grand Canyon is 6,000 feet deep at its deepest point.
Many animals live in the canyon. Some of them are rattlesnakes, bighorn sheep, mountain lions, wild turkeys, and mule deer.
Some rocks in the Grand Canyon are close to 2 billion years old.

134,"Nobody likes being bullied. Learn more about the problem and how you can help stop it.
Bullying is not a one-time problem. It is hurting someone over and over again. It can include teasing and threats. It can take the form of hitting and pushing. Kids who are bullied often feel scared or hurt.
If the answer is yes, think about why you acted that way. It is not right to make others feel bad. Say you are sorry to the person you bullied. Talk to an adult if you need help to stop bullying others.
What should you do if you are being bullied?
If you are being bullied, speak up. Tell the bully to stop. Then walk away. You should also talk to an adult.
What are schools doing to stop bullying?
Kids, parents, and teachers are working together to stop bullying. Some schools have programs that teach kids to talk about and solve their problems. Many states also have laws against bullying.
What might you do to help someone who is being bullied?

576,"Scientists recently found a meteorite in a wheat field in Kansas. A meteorite is a chunk of metal or stone that has fallen from space. The meteorite fell to Earth about 10,000 years ago. Scientists found it 4 feet underground. It weighs 154 pounds and is bigger than most other meteorites.

Our country had only 13 states when the Constitution was written. It has 50 states today.
Benjamin Franklin was the oldest person to sign the Constitution. At the time, he was 81.
A letter from George Washington was found recently. A 10-year-old girl had saved it in a scrapbook in 1826. The letter was sent to her grandfather, Jacob Morris. The girl lived in New Jersey. Her name was Julia Kean.
Washington wrote the letter in 1787. At that time, he was meeting with other leaders to create the U.S. Constitution. In the letter, Washington wrote that the country's happiness depended on what the leaders decided. Two years later, he became our country's first president.

478,"Scientists are keeping track of monarch butterflies. Over the years, the number of monarchs has been getting smaller. Why? People in Mexico are cutting down trees where the butterflies live.
A scientist studies monarchs spending the winter on trees in Mexico.
Now, the latest numbers are up. Twice as many monarchs made the trip to Mexico last year as did the year before!

161,"Astronauts and scientists were recently on a mission, but they were not in space. They were in the Arizona desert. Why? The team was preparing for future space missions. Arizonas dry, dusty desert is similar to the surfaces of the moon and Mars.
A space exploration vehicle travels through the Arizona desert.
For 14 days, the astronauts and scientists tested space exploration vehicles. They also ate and slept in them. Each vehicle is about the size of a small van. Its wheels can move sideways. That helps it move across rough
Terrain is the surface of an area of land.
We do the testing to make sure everything works properly. If you are on another planet, you cant just go down to the local hardware store to get parts, says mission manager Joe Kosmo. He works at

Moray eels are ocean fish that have long, slim, snakelike bodies. They hide in tiny holes throughout coral reefs. Moray eels eat small fish and octopuses.
Hammerhead sharks have wide, flat heads. They grow to more than 10 feet long. Hammerheads have triangle-shaped teeth with sharp bumps for chewing food.
Regal angelfish live near safe caves of coral reefs. They are brightly striped fish. Angelfish usually swim in pairs. They eat sea sponges or tiny coral reef animals.

259,"? Its hard to imagine. An invention is a new thing or idea. It can change the way people live. Some inventions solve problems and make life easier. Other inventions make life more fun (or tastier!). Read about some great inventions.
The next time you stick on a Band-Aid, you can thank Earle Dickson. He invented the ready-made bandage in 1920. He wanted to help his wife who often cut her fingers while cooking.
At the time, people had to cut pieces of gauze and tape to make bandages. They were hard to use. Dicksons simple idea was a big success. Today, ready-made bandages come in many shapes, sizes, and colors.
Did you know that chocolate chip cookies were a mistake? Ruth Graves Wakefield created them in the 1930s. She was mixing a batch of chocolate cookies and was out of baking chocolate. She decided to chop up a bar of semisweet chocolate instead. When the cookies were done, the pieces of chocolate had not melted! They had kept their chip form in each cookie.
Before the 1920s, people often got into traffic accidents. One day, Garrett Morgan saw a bad accident between a car and a horse-drawn carriage. He decided to solve the problem by inventing a traffic signal. It was a pole with signs saying when to stop and go. Todays red, yellow, and green traffic lights are based on Morgans idea.
