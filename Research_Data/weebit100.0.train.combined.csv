0,367,"This year, Memorial Day will be celebrated on May 28. On this holiday, we honor the American men and women who have served in past wars. A special animal cemetery in New York honors dogs that helped soldiers in wars.
Dogs helped locate people injured in wars. When specially trained dogs brought a soldier's helmet to rescue workers, they knew the soldier needed help. Dogs also carried messages and supplies during wars.
The Hartsdale Pet Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York, built a memorial to war dogs in 1923. Since then, the cemetery has held a special ceremony each Memorial Day to honor the dogs.

6,439,"Last November, doctors operated on a clouded leopard named Joe. Joe had not been eating and had trouble walking. A disease was causing fluid to press on Joe's brain. This disease can also happen to cats, dogs, and humans. A two-hour operation saved Joe's life.
Joe is special because he is an endangered species. He is one of only a few hundred clouded leopards in the world.
Joe lives in Texas at the Fort Worth Zoo. He is often taken out of the zoo to visit people at schools and churches. A
, or animal doctor, at the zoo said Joe is ""part of the family.""

7,27,"Fire Prevention Week is from October 3 to 9. That is a time for kids and their families to learn about fire safety. Here are some tips to stay safe:
Have working smoke alarms in your home. Test them once a month.
Stay away from matches, lighters, and stoves.
Practice a fire escape plan with your family. Choose a place outside where you will meet if your house were to catch fire.
If a fire starts, get out and stay out.
Stop, drop, and roll if your clothes catch fire.

12,386,"In Harlem, a section of New York City, playing hockey and doing well in school go hand in hand.
A program called Ice Hockey in Harlem teachers kids how to play hockey. They learn the rules of the game and about hockey equipment. Then, one night per week, kids practice hockey at a local skating rink.
To play hockey, the kids have to go to tutoring sessions. The sessions use hockey information as learning tools. For example, the kids practice math skills by comparing hockey teams' scores. If the kids keep their grades up, they can play on hockey teams. Some travel across the country playing other teams.

time! A harvest is the gathering of food. Many fruits and vegetables are
in the fall. They are fully grown. They are ready to be picked and eaten.
Miller Farms is busy with its fall harvest. The farm is in Platteville, Colorado. It grows many vegetables. Carrots, beets, and onions are just a few of them. David Patterson works on the farm. He told
Kids can visit the farm and pick their own vegetables.
 We pick the vegetables by hand each day. Carrots are kind of tough to pick. You have to loosen them with a shovel first.
 We bring the food in from the field with trucks. We put the food into crates.
 The crates get loaded onto a truck. We take the food to farmers markets to sell it. Its all fresh and good.
Why might fruits and vegetables need to be picked when they are ripe?

A memorial for Martin Luther King Jr. is being built in our nation's capital.
Martin Luther King Jr. was a leader. He lived from 1929 to 1968. Americans honor him in January with a national holiday. This year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is January 21.
King grew up in the southern part of the United States. At that time, laws treated African American people differently from white people. African Americans were forced to sit in the back of buses. They also had to use separate bathrooms and water fountains.
When King was older, he worked to change those laws. As a result, equal rights laws were passed. Those laws provide the same rights to all Americans.
King will soon be honored with a
. A memorial is a statue or a place that honors a person or an event. The King memorial is being built on the National Mall. That is a park in Washington, D.C., our nation's capital. Memorials for some U.S. presidents are also on the Mall.
The King memorial is scheduled to be finished this year. It will have a 30-foot statue of King. Sentences from some of his speeches will be carved into a stone wall.
The cost of the memorial is $100 million. Most of that money has been raised. A concert was held in September in New York City to raise the rest of the money. Many famous singers performed. The singers included Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, and Garth Brooks.

32,356,"Winter is a baby bottlenose dolphin who lost her tail in an accident. Scientists want to help her by giving her a
(prahs-THEE-suss). That is a human-made part to replace a missing body part.
In spite of her injury, Winter behaves like a can-do dolphin. She has learned to swim without her tail, by moving from side to side. If the new tail works, she will be able to move up and down in the water, the way other dolphins swim.
""Theres never been a dolphin like her,"" says Dana Zucker, an officer of the Clearwater Aquarium in Florida, where Winter lives.

Many animals travel long distances each fall. Meet some amazing migrating animals.
Monarch butterflies migrate to stay away from freezing weather. They start their journey in the United States and Canada. Most fly south to Mexico. Some fly west to California. Monarchs travel farther than any other butterfly.
Gray whales migrate south to have their babies. Many travel from northern waters to the warm oceans near Mexico. Gray whales migrate farther than any other whales in the world.
Caribou migrate to find food. Most of these land animals migrate between Alaska and Canada. That is farther than any other land animals travel! Caribou migrate together in large groups called
Arctic Tern migrate when the weather gets colder. They fly from the North Pole to the South Pole. That is farther than any other bird! Arctic terns rarely stop to rest during their trip.
The map below shows the path that monarchs travel when they migrate in the fall. It also shows the path monarchs take when they return in the spring.
Many monarch butterflies rest on trees after they arrive in Mexico. They huddle close together to keep warm and stay safe.

37,82,"Whiskers's class went to the museum for a field trip. But, oops, the story of their trip is in the wrong order. Use the clues to put the story in order.
Fourth, Whiskers and his class went to see the train display. They saw an old locomotive--a train's engine. The first locomotives used steam to move. This steam locomotive could pull many train cars, or parts of a train.
First, the students went to see the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs lived long ago. Dinosaurs are now extinct, or all gone. Scientists use dinosaur fossils, old bones or marks made by body parts or plants, to learn about dinosaurs.
Fifth, Whiskers saw real moon rocks and pictures of astronauts, the people trained to visit space. Astronaut Neil Armstrong was the first man to step onto the moon. He put an American flag up on the moon. He brought moon rocks back to Earth.
Second, Whiskers's class went to see an Egyptian mummy, or a dead body that has been kept in a special way. Egyptians buried their pharaohs, or kings, as mummies. The bodies were wrapped and put in fancy boxes. The boxes were decorated with paintings and writing.
Sixth, Whiskers's class met by the main door. They looked at a statue,or form of something or somebody. The statue is a copy of one called The Thinker. Whiskers was thinking, too. He was thinking about his day. He was glad he had visited the museum!

60,623,"How do bugs exchange thoughts and ideas?
If insects could talk, what might they say? I found food. Are you a relative? Watch out for danger! Of course, insects dont talk the way people do, but they do
with one another. That means they exchange information.
A bee does the waggle dance. It walks in a figure eight and shakes its body. The farther away the food, the longer the bee shakes. The direction in which it walks tells other bees the way to the food.
Honeybees get food from flowers. When a honeybee finds a field of flowers, it flies back to the hive. The bee tells the other bees where to find the food. How? It dances! The round dance shows that food is nearby. If the food is far away, the bee performs the waggle dance. That dance shows the location of the food.
Fireflies have a chemical inside their bodies. It makes light. Fireflies flash lights at one another. Each
or kind, of firefly has a different flash pattern. That helps the insects find members of their own species. The flash pattern also helps male and female fireflies find one another
Grasshoppers send messages by chirping. They often rub a back leg against a wing. That causes a vibration and makes sound. Mostly male grasshoppers make sounds. They chirp to attract females. Each species of grasshopper has its own call. Some grasshoppers make sounds to warn other males to go away.
A leaf-cutter ant carries a piece of a leaf back to its nest.
Ants give off scents to pass along messages. If an ant finds food, it goes back to its nest. The ant leaves a scent trail along the way. Other ants follow the trail to find the food. They walk with their antennae to the ground. Why? Ants smell with their antennae. Ants can also leave a special scent to warn about danger.
What are some ways that people communicate besides talking?

Did you know that Popsicles were once called Epsicles? They were named after Frank Epperson. He invented them by accident in 1905 at the age of 11. One night, he left a drink outside in the cold. The drink had a stirring stick in it. The next day, he saw that the drink had frozen around the stick. Epperson began selling his Epsicles in 1923. At that time, they came in seven flavors.
 What name did Frank Epperson give his invention?
 What happened when he left his drink outside?
 When did he start selling his frozen treats?

66,615,"Constitution Day is September 17. That is the day our Constitution was signed. On that day, Americans will celebrate in different ways.
Students will learn about the Constitution at school. In some places, kids and adults will hear people read it aloud. Some kids will sign a copy of the Constitution. How will you celebrate this important day?

67,63,"Mount Rushmore is a mountain in South Dakota. The faces of four U.S. presidents are carved on it. Now a special model is being made of Mount Rushmore.
What will make the model so special? It will be shown on a computer in 3-D! That makes pictures look more like the real object, instead of looking flat.
People are making the 3-D model for an important reason. If Mount Rushmore is ever damaged, it will need to be fixed. The 3-D model will show people what the carving looked like.
Mount Rushmore shows the faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Each face is as tall as a six-story building!
A landmark is a building or place that is special to an area. Americans want to make sure that Mount Rushmore will be here for a long time.

72,69,"How can you be ready in case of a fire at home? Learn safety tips and practice! Here are four safety tips you should know.
Smoke alarms save lives. Have an alarm inside and outside each bedroom. You should also have a smoke alarm on every level of the home. Push the test button at least once a month. That will let you know whether the alarm is working.
Fire can spread quickly. Every family needs to be prepared. How? Have a home fire escape plan. Draw the plan and talk about it. The drawing should show two ways out of each room. Those may be doors or windows. Then practice the plan twice a year. Practice during the day and at night.
Choose a safe place outside where everyone will meet. Get out and stay out! Never go back inside a burning building.
Once you are outside, dial 9-1-1 or the number for your fire department.
Why is it important to have a home fire escape plan? How might practicing it help you?

They are active at night. They sleep during the day.
Many owls, bats, and snakes are nocturnal. They have special ways to find
in the dark. Prey is an animal that is hunted by another animal for food.
Owls can see well at night. They also have great hearing. The feathers on the edge of their wings are soft. That lets owls fly quietly. They can sneak up on their prey. Owls hunt mice and other small animals.
Bat: Delpho M/Photolibrary; Moth: Michael Durham/Minden Pictures
Most bats eat insects. Bats have a special way of finding food. They make high-pitched sounds. The sounds bounce off insects and return to the bats. That lets the bats know where to find the insects.
Pit vipers are snakes. They sense the heat of other animals. Their heat sensors are inside holes on their faces. The holes are called pits. They help the snakes find their prey in the dark. Pit vipers eat frogs and other small animals.
How might being nocturnal help animals survive?

National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research
Brush your teeth twice a day. Brush all parts of your mouth and even your tongue. Brush with short, back-and-forth motions. Don't forget to be gentle!
Floss your teeth once a day. Dental floss cleans between your teeth. Use it to remove food you missed with a toothbrush.
Visit the dentist twice a year. Your dentist will check and clean your teeth, take X-rays, and put
on your teeth. Fluoride helps keep your teeth strong.

81,256,"Do you have a fire escape plan?
That is the theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week. It lasts from October 7 to 13. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) plans the week to teach kids and their families about fire safety.
The NFPA wants to sound the alarm about the need for a home fire escape plan. They want people across the country to practice their fire escape plans this month. The group is calling the project the Great American Fire Drill.
Only one out of four Americans has planned and practiced a fire escape plan, says the NFPA. ""It's important for everyone in your family to know how to escape in case of a fire,"" says NFPA spokesperson Judy Comoletti.

82,408,"April 22 is Earth Day. That day reminds everyone to take care of Earth, our home. Many of Earth's animals are in danger of losing their homes. The pika (PEE-kah) is an animal whose habitat is in danger. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal or a plant lives.
Earth's temperature is rising, and people are using land where animals live.
are related to rabbits. Some kinds of pikas live on the rocky slopes of mountains. These animals prefer cool weather. As Earth heats up, they must move to cooler places higher in the mountains.
make their nests in the holes of rain forest trees. People are cutting down those trees and using the land for farms. Macaws are running out of trees in which to make their nests.
live in the Arctic. They live on large pieces of sea ice. As Earth's temperature rises, the large pieces of sea ice begin to melt. If the ice keeps melting, polar bears will have nowhere to live.
live in the grasslands of Asia. Their habitat is shrinking because people are building towns in places that used to belong to the tigers. Now these big cats have fewer grassland areas to call home.
Tigers are among the animals losing places to live.
Scientists say Earth is getting warmer because of pollution in the air. They are working to protect animal habitats.
Take short showers to save water and energy.
Dispose of trash properly. Recycle plastic, glass, paper, and metal.
Turn off electrical appliances when you are not using them.

83,376,"Every penny counts at Frankton Elementary School in Frankton, Indiana. Next month, students will take part in a contest called Jar Wars. Kids will drop money into jars. The grade that raises the most money will win a pizza party.
All the money will be donated to help save tropical rain forests. Why? People are cutting down rain forest trees to make room for farms and roads. Many plants and animals are in danger of dying out.
Last year, the school raised $891. This year, the goal is to raise even more.
Teacher Ken Kakasuleff came up with the idea for Jar Wars 16 years ago. He says, Earth is our home. We feel proud to protect it.

86,620,"The United States government recently said it will clean up the Everglades. The Everglades are
in southern Florida. A wetland is an area of wet and spongy soil. Both pollution and construction have hurt the Everglades. A new law will now clean up and protect the Everglades. Over the next 36 years, the government will spend $8 billion to clean up pollution in the Everglades.
 The Everglades take up about 2,344 square miles. That's about the size of Delaware.
 The Everglades are the only place in the world where both crocodiles and alligators live.
 Other animals that live in the Everglades are snakes, turtles, birds, fish, deer, and the rare Florida panther.

That is the name they gave to a new group of small objects in space. ""These dwarf planets are popping up everywhere,"" says astronomer Alan Stern.
In January 2006, a spacecraft blasted off to explore Pluto. At that time, Pluto was the last unvisited planet. Now it may become the first visited dwarf planet. The spacecraft is scheduled to arrive in 2015. What might the scientists discover about Pluto?

88,79,"School has changed in some ways over time. Lets learn about those ways.
Schools did not always have computers. How is school today different from school many years ago?
Then: Many schoolhouses had only one classroom. Students of all ages learned together.
Now: Most school buildings have many classrooms. Students in each class are about the same age.
Students listened carefully to a phonograph. That is a machine that plays recordings.
Students use computers during lessons. They wear headphones to listen and learn.
Then: Students raised their hands to answer questions. The teacher called on students to respond.
Now: Students still raise their hands to answer questions. That is one way school has not changed.

89,555,"How do bees and other insects fly so well? Scientists in England may have found the answer. Their research is part of a plan to build tiny aircraft.
The scientists learned that bees' wings are stiff at the front and
(able to bend easily) at the back. That allows the insects to lift off the ground and move in the air.
""Our work will make the goal of tiny aircraft, perhaps eventually the size of bees, a step closer,"" says one of the scientists.

95,475,"Fourteen chubby hedgehogs in Scotland were recently put on a diet. Workers at a wildlife center had rescued the animals during a bad winter last year. The hedgehogs ate a lot of food at the center.
What happens when hedgehogs get too fat? They cannot roll into a ball to protect themselves.
When a hedgehog rolls into a ball, its spines stick out in all directions. That keeps
away. A predator is an animal that eats another animal.

99,452,"Scientists in California recently explored a large inactive, underwater volcano. They were looking for ways to protect this special sea mountain that is home to many animals. Bright yellow sea sponges and 10-foot-tall pink coral live there. It is located deep below the surface of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. Its name is Davidson Seamount. The rocks there make good homes for deep-sea animals.
Scientists used a remote control vehicle to help them explore the volcano. It took photos and collected bits of rock and coral. Scientists say that we must find ways to protect this place or we will lose these sea creatures forever.

The Heimlich maneuver is a special move that can help save the life of a person who is choking. If someone is choking, he or she can't speak, cough, or breathe.
Brenna is a safety captain at Hoover Elementary School. She learned the Heimlich maneuver at safety camp last summer.
 Stand behind the choking person and wrap your arms around his or her waist.
 Make a fist with the thumb side against the person's stomach, between the belly and the rib cage. Grab your fist with your other hand.
 Press your hands in with a quick upward thrust. Repeat until the person stops choking.

101,504,"You are playing outside when it begins to rain. The rain gets heavier. You run for cover. Thunder roars overhead. Giant streaks of lightning flash across the sky.
When people think of lightning, they generally picture it as a single bolt. However, scientists have recently reported that one flash of lightning often strikes in more than one place. It is common for lightning to fork, or split, and strike in two or more places, scientists say.
Lightning is a flow of electricity. A flash of lightning can heat the air around it to up to 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun!
When lightning heats the air around it, the air expands and makes a loud crashing sound-thunder. If you hear thunder, you are within striking distance of lightning. ""Anytime you hear thunder, you should immediately move to a safe area,"" said scientist E. Philip Krider. Safe places include a school, house, or car.
While it is unusual for people to be struck by lightning, it does happen. According to the National Weather Service, lightning causes nearly 300 injuries and 100 deaths in the United States each year.
Watching a lightning storm may be exciting, but it can also be dangerous. Just keep in mind the power of nature and watch from a safe place indoors.
Whether you are outdoors or indoors during a thunderstorm, it is important to stay safe.
Try to find shelter in a car or building.
Avoid water, high places, and open spaces.
Do not use a corded telephone. Lightning can strike phone lines.
Avoid using the sink or shower. Lightning can travel through water pipes.

102,225,"Everyone onboard the boat waited patiently. Suddenly, one person broke the silence. ""Manatee! Nobody move a muscle,"" whispered scientist Caryn Self Sullivan.
Looking into the shallow water, we spotted a baby manatee. To our surprise, the young manatee was alone. ""I've never seen one this small on its own!"" said Sullivan. We wondered,
That is exactly the kind of question we hoped to answer.
Along with other volunteers, I was helping scientists study manatees off the coast of Belize (beh-LEEZ). Belize is a country in Central America. We observed manatees and their
, an area where an animal lives. We were trying to find out how manatees spend their time.
Manatees are large marine mammals with wrinkled, grayish brown skin. They can grow to 13 feet long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds.
Scientists think that many manatees are living in the warm waters off the coast of Belize. Manatees have been protected by Belize law for about 70 years.
, or plant eaters. They eat more than 100 pounds of plants each day. That is about the same as 200 heads of lettuce!
Many people think manatees look like walruses, but they are actually related to elephants.
Manatees are very curious. They often swim up to boats or snorkelers to check them out.
, or in danger of dying out. Sometimes they are hunted for food. Many are killed when they get tangled in fishing gear or are hit by boats.
Sullivan's team is trying to find better ways of protecting manatees. I hope that with help from volunteers like me, Sullivan will be able to help these gentle giants survive.

103,292,"Have you ever listened to the sounds that paper makes? To composer Tan Dun, paper is music. He invented instruments made of paper and wrote music to play on them.
This October, a group of fifth graders were among the first to hear musicians perform Dun's piece. The big event was held at the newly opened Walt Disney Concert Hall in California.
Dun wrote the musical piece to celebrate the art of making paper. About 2,000 years ago, the world's first fine paper was invented in China. China is the country in Asia where Dun was born.
""Using your imagination, you can find music around you, even in paper! Music is everywhere if you just look for it,"" Dun told

106,145,"Do you ever have trouble deciding what to wear to school? Students at Lakeside Elementary School in Ohio don't have that problem. This year, the school has a dress code. Students must wear shirts with a collar and tan, navy, or black pants. Girls can also wear jumpers or skirts.
The students at Lakeside are not alone. Many students in public schools across the country are wearing uniforms for the first time.
Some people think dress codes are a good idea. A lot of parents say they don't have to worry about buying designer clothing for their kids. They say that buying school uniforms is less expensive.
School officials say dress codes also help students concentrate more on learning. ""[Clothes] should not be the focus,"" said one principal in Connecticut. ""Math and writing should be the focus.""
These students wear a uniform to school.
These students can wear their own clothes to school.
Not everyone agrees that uniforms should be worn in public schools. Making students wear uniforms ""takes away some of my rights as a parent,"" said a father in Nevada.
Some people say school uniforms also go against kids' freedom to express themselves. That right is promised in the
It is a document that states the laws of our country and Americans' rights.
""In a public school, I don't feel children should be told they all have to wear the same outfit,"" said one Connecticut mother.
spoke to some third graders at Lakeside Elementary School. We asked them: Do you like having a school uniform?
""I like the uniforms. No one judges you, because you are wearing the same thing they are.""
""I don't like wearing the uniform, because I'm not used to it.""
Should public schools have dress codes? Why?
""I like them because I don't have to pick out anything. I don't like them, because the outfits are all the same.""

Erik Uebelacker has caught the writing bug! It all began in the second grade. Thats when the student from Bel Air, Maryland, learned a fun fact about butterflies.
They taste with their feet, Erik told
I was surprised when I heard that, so I decided to [write about it].
Write he did. Today, Erik, 10, is the author of a book. The book is called
The fifth grader has sold more than 700 copies of his book. Erik has donated the $3,100 in
he made to a wildlife group that protects endangered animals. Profits are earnings.
Because of his efforts, Erik was recently chosen as one of the top kid volunteers in the country. He was picked by an awards program. It is called the Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes.
Erik became interested in butterflies funny feet in science class. He learned that the fliers have taste
in their feet. An organ is a body part. When the butterflies stand on leaves, their feet taste them. If the leaves taste good, the critters will lay their eggs on them.
In Eriks book, butterflies that wear shoes taste only shoes. Everything might taste like dirty socks to them, he explains.
or print, another book. If he does, the young writer says, he will continue to give away his earnings. My favorite part about writing is donating the money ... to a good cause, Erik says. I just feel inspired.
What cool tricks do butterflies have up their wings? Read to learn more about the critters.
Butterflies can see green, red, and yellow. They can also spot things humans cant, such as patterns on flowers.
Butterflies may look colorful, but parts of their wings are clear. The wings are covered in scales.
Some butterfly species can fly to heights of 10,000 feet. Most species fly about 12 miles per hour.
Why might some people want to donate money instead of keeping it for themselves?

108,411,"Nine giant panda cubs are born in China.
Giant pandas feast on bamboo at the Beijing Zoo in China. These animals, including the newborn panda (inset), live in captivity.
China is hosting a panda party! Nine giant panda bears were recently born in the Asian country. Most of them are pairs of twins. The cubs were born in
. That means they live in places controlled by humans rather than in the wild. These pandas live in special centers where animal experts care for them.
[The centers] provide a safe place for animals to ... raise their young, scientist Sarah Bexell told
Thats a good thing, because giant pandas need all the help they can get. The animals are
, or at risk of dying out completely. Only about 1,600 giant pandas live in the wild.
Pandas favorite food is bamboo, but they have trouble finding enough of it to eat. Almost all of the bamboo in their habitat, or home, has died off. The bamboo has died in part because people have built cities where pandas live.
People created the panda centers to help keep the giant pandas safe. One of the most famous centers is the Wolong Nature Reserve. It is in southwest China. More than 100 giant pandas have been born there since it opened in 1980.
The goal is for the young pandas to be able to live safely in the wild one day. Until then, some of the animals will continue to live in captivity. Scientists in China hope to raise more giant pandas within the next few years.
The future of captive giant pandas is [very] bright, Bexell says.
Chinas giant panda cubs arent the only baby animals making the news. Read to learn about other
Seven white lion cubs were recently born in Germany at a safari park. All of the white lions in the world live in captivity.
Hadiah is a type of hairless pig. She was born at the Houston Zoo in Texas. Little Hadiah weighed about 1 pound at birth.
More than 120 shortsnouted sea horses were recently born at an England aquarium. They will grow up to look like this one.
Why might people want to protect giant pandas?

109,174,"Pluto has recently been dropped as a planet from displays at the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York City. Why? Because the museum's scientists had studied Pluto and decided it isn't a planet, for these reasons:
Pluto's orbit is unlike any other planet's in our solar system.
Pluto is small, even smaller than Earth's moon.
Many other scientists disagree and say Pluto should still be considered a planet.

110,449,"In 1914, a group of explorers, led by Sir Ernest Shackleton, wanted to cross Antarctica. However, after two months of sailing, they never even made it to Antarctica's shore.
Their ship became trapped in floating ice blocks for nine months. Later, when their ship,
was crushed by the closing ice, Shackleton and 28 men were forced to camp on the ice.
After camping on the ice for five months, Shackleton and five men sailed 800 miles in a tiny lifeboat to get help. The remaining crew was later rescued. Amazingly, all 29 men on the
survived being stranded for 17 months on Antarctica's ice.

111,661,"Yuck! A health and safety group recently tested school surfaces for germs and found millions! Drinking fountains had the most germs. A cafeteria tray had more germs than a toilet seat! The testers also found germs lurking on desks and computer keyboards.
Health experts say drinking fountains would have fewer germs if they were cleaned more often.
Kids miss 22 million days of school each year because of colds caught from germs. That number would be much lower if kids would just wash their hands, say health experts.
Not all germs are harmful, but some can make kids sick. ""When you share things in a classroom, you increase the chance that you might get sick,"" the health and safety groups spokesperson, Jerry Bowman, told
""Since we are right in the middle of cold and flu season, we have to be extra careful to wash our hands and cover up [our] coughs.""

112,557,"A rocket, with the orbiter on top, was launched in August from Cape Canaveral, Florida.
A spacecraft speeds toward the Red Planet. Scientists hope the trip will lead to answers.
In many books and movies, little green aliens from Mars invade Earth. In real life, Mars is the planet being invadedby strange-looking machines from Earth.
In August, NASA, the U.S. space agency, launched a spacecraft to Mars. It is called an orbiter because it will
, or circle, the fourth planet from the sun. Right now, the orbiter is speeding toward Mars. Scientists expect it to reach the Red Planet in March.
The orbiter will join two robots, called rovers, that are already there. They have been rolling around on the surface of the planet for more than two years. They are searching for signs of water.
Mars is cold and dry. Scientists think the planet was once a warmer and wetter place. Evidence of water can mean that life once existed on Mars.
The orbiter will look for signs of water. It is expected to spend at least two years studying Mars. It will scan Mars with the largest telescope camera ever sent to a planet. The orbiter's radar will look for water beneath the planet's surface. It will also search for landing spots to prepare for future human missions to Mars.
This is an artists depiction of the spacecraft as it nears Mars.
""This orbiter is going to look much farther and with more detail than what the rovers could do,"" NASA's Ramon DePaula told
. ""We are going to bring back more data than all other missions to Mars combined.""
Mars is called the Red Planet because its soil is a reddish color.
Like Earth, Mars has mountains and valleys.
The largest volcano in the solar system, called Olympus Mons, is on Mars.
Even in the summer, the temperature on the planet's surface is below zero.
Why is water needed for life to exist?

113,11,"A purple octopus is making a splash! It is one of 11
or types, of sea creatures scientists recently found near Canada. That is a country north of the United States. Experts say the animals may be new to science.
Researchers discovered the creatures in the Atlantic Ocean. In addition to the purple octopus, scientists found a sea star and many types of coral and sea sponges.
We found all kinds of beautiful creatures, Ellen Kenchington told
She is one of the scientists who helped find the animals.
Researchers didnt explore the ocean alone, however. An underwater robot gave them a hand. The robot can search areas of the sea that are too deep for people to visit, explains Kenchington.

116,625,"NASA shuttles have blasted spacecraft to far-off planets. They have even helped build a floating space lab. Now, the shuttles are ready for a new mission: their final countdown.
Officials at the U.S. space agency are ending the shuttle program this summer. The shuttle
will shoot for the stars one more time this month. Then
will make its last flight in June.
The program took off in 1981 when NASA sent
to space. NASA built five shuttles in all. The others were
. Each spacecraft could carry up to 10 astronauts. The shuttles could spend about two weeks in space at a time.
One of the shuttles most important jobs has been helping astronauts build the International Space Station. That is a lab that
Earth. To orbit is to circle. The shuttles
astronauts to the lab. To ferry is to carry. Scientists from many nations run tests at the lab.
The missions arent cheap, though. One trip to space costs about $450 million. To save money, the U.S. government will now send astronauts to the lab on shuttles owned by private companies.
The new plan will allow NASA to focus on a mission thats really out of this world. Space officials want to send astronauts to Mars. Scientists have used
, or robotic spacecraft, to explore the Red Planet, but humans have never set foot there.
Officials hope that changes soon. Were looking to send human missions to Mars, Allard Beutel told
He is a NASA spokesperson. These [changes] are the early steps ... to get us there.
These astronauts accomplishments launched them into history books.

Why might scientists want to study Mars?

119,779,"Each year, 17 million people try to stop smoking. However, only 1 million quit. That's why the American Cancer Society has organized The Great American Smokeout and SmokeScream.
Mark next Thursday, November 16, on your calendars and get ready to scream. That is the day of the SmokeScream. It is a day when kids across the country can scream about the dangers of smoking.
November 16 is also the day of the Great American Smokeout. The goal of the Smokeout is to get people to stop smoking for the day--and maybe forever.
The SmokeScream and the Great American Smokeout is run by the American Cancer Society. The group helps fight
by teaching people about the illness and raising money for medical research. Cancer is an illness that can cause death. Doctors say that smoking can cause cancer and other illnesses that can kill.
The lungs are parts of the body that allow a person to breathe. There is no cure for lung cancer.
About 430,000 people die each year from illnesses caused by smoking. That is more than the total number of deaths each year resulting from AIDS, drug abuse, car accidents, murders, and fires.

Experts on the bunny trail recently uncovered the
of the largest known rabbit. A fossil is the remains of a plant or an animal that lived long ago. The creatures name is
The bunny weighed more than 26 pounds. Thats about six times the size of todays cottontails.
Researchers found the rabbits fossil on Minorca. That is an island that belongs to Spain. Spain is a country in Europe. The animal lived about 3 million to 5 million years ago.
The rabbit may have roamed the island, but it probably didnt hop!
had a short, stiff backbone. That would have made jumping difficult, explains scientist Josep Quintana. He helped find the fossil.
The giant discovery reminds Quintana of another wacky wabbit. He told
was similar to Bugs Bunny [because] he was so big and so different compared with other rabbits.

121,45,"Scientists used the satellite to count different types of animals at the Bronx Zoo.
As the tallest animals in the world, giraffes have a great view of the zoo. Scientists recently had an even better view--from 280 miles above Earth! Animals at the Bronx Zoo in New York City were tracked from outer space with a
. A satellite is a spacecraft that orbits a planet or moon.
of zoo animals and sent the images back to Earth. A species is a group of plants or animals that are alike in certain ways. Scientists studied the images to see how well the satellite could spot different species.
The Bronx Zoo is located in New York City.
So far, scientists are pleased with the results. They hope to use the satellite to track
animals in faraway places in the wild. Endangered animals are at risk of becoming
, or dying out completely. Currently, people track animals either by foot or by airplane. Scientists think that using a satellite to track animals will be both easier and cheaper.
""Taking a count is the first step in finding out if a species is in danger of extinction,"" scientist Scott Bergen told
Along with counting endangered animals, scientists want to learn where they
. When animals migrate, they move from one place to another.
Why do scientists want to learn where animals migrate? ""[We want to know where to] create national parks and other protected areas for endangered animals,"" said Bergen.
Would you want to be a scientist who studies endangered animals? Explain your answer.

122,455,"U.S. President Barack Obama wants to bring our country up to speed.
That is technology that allows computers to link to the Internet without using wires. About two-thirds of U.S. homes have wireless Internet. The president hopes to bring the technology to the rest of Americans.
Having wireless Internet could change how schools and businesses run, Obama says. The technology could help kids finish their schoolwork from home, he recently explained. Also, firefighters could quickly download information on their way to burning buildings.
The plan will go to Congress for approval. If it passes, Obama will work to bring wireless Internet to towns that dont have it. He will also build a special wireless network for police and other emergency workers.

123,304,"One of the worlds oldest birds may not be a bird after all!
A new dinosaur discovery is making scientists take a closer look at
(ahr-kee-AHP-teh-rikss). That creature lived about 150 million years ago. Researchers thought it was one of the first birds on Earth.

He is a dinosaur expert. Both animals had long arms and feathers.

The boat is the second one found near the Great Pyramid. Archaeologists dug up the first boat in 1954. It is on display in a museum near the Pyramids.

127,670,"Secrets about the past lie deep below the surface of the sea. In January, explorers reported their discovery of an ancient Greek ship on the bottom of the Black Sea. The Black Sea is located between Europe and Asia. Scientists say the ship is about 2,400 years old!
""The Greeks went into the Black Sea for fish and gold,"" said Robert Ballard, the explorer whose team found the wreck. Ballard is the same explorer who discovered the
Ballard said the ship in the Black Sea was used for trade. The ship was filled with jars. At one time, the jars held items such as fish, olive oil, and honey.
This summer Ballard's team plans to dig up the shipwreck. They are hoping to learn more secrets about the ancient world.

128,165,"Astronauts are adding rooms to a lab in space.
Life in space is about to get a little spacier! The
is getting a makeover. The station is a lab in space where astronauts live and work.
Astronauts are adding two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a mini kitchen. The new parts were delivered by the space shuttle
. Before this, the space station had only three bedrooms and one bathroom. Astronauts have been building the space station since 1998.
delivered new parts to the International Space Station.
The new rooms will allow more astronauts to live at the space station at the same time. Having more astronauts in space could help scientists gather new information about space more quickly.
, or right now, only three astronauts can stay on the space station. Officials hope six astronauts will be able to live there at the same time by May or June.
also brought technology to the space station. A new system will turn the astronauts urine into drinking water. That might sound gross, but
, or reusing, the liquid will make sure the space station has water. Right now, water is rocketed to the space station from Earth.
Astronaut Christopher Ferguson says the same technology could be used on Earth one day. Were going to need to have these technologies in place, and this is a great way to get started.
Why do astronauts float in space? There is no
. That is a force that pulls your body toward Earth. Heres how astronauts eat, sleep, and exercise on the space station.
Astronauts put their feet in special holders to help them stay seated at the table. Food containers stick to trays with Velcro.
Astronauts can sleep standing up! Their sleeping bags are attached to the space stations walls. They strap themselves in for naps.
Astronauts stay in shape by exercising for up to two hours every day. They strap themselves to exercise bikes and treadmills.

129,355,"Aw, nuts! The price of peanut butter is on the rise. A jar that cost $3.25 a few months ago could now cost about $4.50.

Americans eat about 1.5 billion pounds of peanuts each year.
peanut crops. To harm is to hurt. Some Southern states had very little rain this past summer.
The peanut butter jam doesnt have to spread, experts say. The high prices could encourage more farmers to plant peanuts next spring. More peanuts could mean cheaper peanut butter. Thats one way to get the peanut gallery cheering!

130,200,"If you are mailing thank-you notes after the holiday season, each note will cost you a penny more. Starting this month, the U.S. Postal Service has increased the price of first-class stamps to 34 cents. The one-penny increase will raise about $2.5 billion (that's eight zeroes!) for the U.S. Postal Service.

131,602,"A new study says chimps want to help.
Everyone knows helping others is a good thing - maybe even chimps! Scientists recently studied from Uganda. That is a country in Africa. The scientists did tests that show that chimps often help people or other chimps, even if they get nothing in return.
In one test, a person dropped a stick near a group of chimps. In most cases, a chimp handed the stick back to the person. Chimps care about other chimps too. In another test, a chimp handed over the stick when another chimp dropped it. The animals did not receive food or praise for their actions in either test.
The results surprised the scientists. They had long thought that humans are the only animals that help others. ""We've never seen this level ... of
in any other animals except humans,"" says chimp scientist Alicia Melis. Cooperation means working together. Scientists say the study suggests that chimps and humans may be born with the ability to be helpful.
So the saying ""Kindness is its own reward"" may not be true just for humans.
Chimpanzees are a type of great ape. Great apes are the largest primates. Primates are a group of animals. Other great apes are gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos.
The gorilla is the largest primate. A male gorilla can weigh as much as 500 pounds and stand up to 6 feet tall. Gorillas live in Africa.
uses tools more than any other animal does - except humans. A chimp might use a stone to crack a nut. Chimps live in Africa.
The orangutan has very long arms. That's because it lives mostly in trees. Orangutans live in Indonesia, a country in Asia.
is the smallest great ape. They can weigh up to 100 pounds. Bonobos are sometimes called ""little chimps."" Bonobos live in Africa.
What does the expression ""Kindness is its own reward"" mean?

132,115,"Got chocolate milk? Students in Berkeley, California, dont! Some schools in that city recently banned the sale of flavored milk.
Other schools around the country are considering re-moo-ving the sweet stuff from their cafeterias too. Some officials say it isnt healthy for kids to drink flavored milk every day. One glass of chocolate milk can have as much sugar as a soft drink, experts say.
Some people are against the ban, though. They say flavored milk has ingredients that are
or good, for kids. Nancy Rice agrees. She is the president of the School Nutrition Association. That group gives schools ideas for healthy student lunches.
Some kids just wont drink white milk, Rice told

135,313,"Finding a bug in your dinner is usually a bad thingunless you like your meals hot!
Scientists in Bolivia recently figured out that bugs help make some chili peppers spicy. Bolivia is a country in South America.
Certain types of bugs can poke holes in a chili peppers skin. That leaves the pepper open to becoming
, or sick. Chili peppers create special chemicals to keep the bugs away. Those chemicals also give peppers their famous spicy flavor.
Ready for some more hot news? Some chili peppers get even spicier as they grow. Peppers increase ... their heat as they ripen, scientist Joshua Tewksbury told reporters. I think a lot of plants would love to come up with this [way to keep bugs away].

137,563,"In 1990, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) launched the Hubble Space Telescope into space. It has taken thousands of photos of planets, stars, and other space objects.
The Hubble Space Telescope takes photos from 380 miles above Earth. Hubble is huge. It is almost the size of a large school bus!
Earlier this year, astronauts went to space to attach a new camera to Hubble. The new camera has helped scientists make many discoveries.
Recently, Hubble took a photo of the Cone Nebula. A nebula is a cloud of gas and dust in space. Nearby hot stars cause the Cone Nebula to glow red.

139,427,"The days of stinky feet are over. Gang Sun, a scientist, has invented a smell-free sock.
The sock's fibers are made with bits of
Chlorine is a chemical used to kill
Bacteria are tiny germs that you can see only with a microscope. Bacteria cause socks to smell. In the new socks, the chlorine kills any odor-causing bacteria.
A cross-country running team tested the socks. ""After running 9 miles, not having socks smell of feet is a real bonus,"" said one runner.
Sun hopes hospitals can use his odor-free fibers. The special fibers can kill bacteria in sheets, towels, and medical gowns.

142,28,"Too much chocolate may be unhealthy for you, but researchers have found a way to make the treat good for the environment.
This veggie vehicle can reach 135 miles per hour!
in England are using chocolate to power the worlds first Earth-friendly race car. An engineer is a person who designs and builds things. England is a country in Europe.
The vehicle is named WorldFirst. Engineers built the car with
parts. Something that is renewable can be used again.
WorldFirst can run on fuel made from chocolate and vegetable oils. The car zooms from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds.
The fuel isnt the only part of the car that can be bought at a grocery store. WorldFirsts steering wheel is partly made from carrots and other vegetables. The cars mirrors are part potato, and the seat is made with soybean oil. Does that sound nutty? You bet! WorldFirsts brakes will be made with cashews.

143,632,"Change is on the way for some school vending machines. Candy bars, sugary drinks, and other sweet snacks are no longer being offered in many schools.
Those foods and drinks are being replaced with more healthful choices. Some of those choices include bottled water, salads, granola bars, and dried fruits and nuts.
School vending machines offering soda and candy may soon be a thing of the past.
New York City has the largest school system in the country. That school system recently decided to
, or not allow, junk food in its vending machines. Schools in Texas, California, and many other states are doing the same.
Do you think schools should ban junk food from vending machines? Why or why not?
Why are vending machines getting a makeover? Poor nutrition habits and a lack of exercise have caused many kids to become overweight. School officials hope the changes to vending machines will help students make better nutrition choices.

147,241,"What did Casey Sokolovic decide to do when she learned that sea turtles were in trouble? A lot!
The student from Winterville, N.C., founded a program called Help Them LAST. That stands for Love a Sea Turtle. Casey, 11, raises money for the ocean swimmers. She does everything from selling turtle-shaped cookies to organizing fund-raising events at her school. So far, Caseys program has raised about $2,500 for a local center that cares for sea turtles.
The reptiles are at risk of losing their
or home. People overcrowd the beaches where sea turtles lay their eggs. Some of the animals are killed or
by boats. To be injured is to be hurt.
Casey is always coming up with new ways to help sea turtles. Recently, she teamed up with a coffee company to raise money for the animals. She also hopes to create a sea turtle Web site.
Its good to do something for the sea turtles, Casey told

U.S. President Barack Obama recently signed a new law. It requires schools to provide more nutritious food. The law is called the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Its purpose is to help kids be healthier.
This act is about doing whats right for our children, Obama said before signing the law.
So, what will the new law serve up? School officials have to remove sugary drinks and junk food from vending machines. They have to make meals healthier, as well. For example, instead of hot dogs, cafeterias might dish out whole-wheat spaghetti with meat sauce. There will also be more fruits and vegetables on the menu.
The law will also help kids get moving. The act requires schools to provide more time for exercise. Now going to school will be good for your mind

151,369,"Why is this rain forest shrinking so quickly?
Bright-colored birds fly through the air. Monkeys leap from tree to tree. Jaguars creep on the ground below. Those are just a few of the thousands of animals that live in the Amazon rain forest.
The Amazon in South America is the largest
in the world. A tropical rain forest is a thick forest in a warm region with heavy rainfall.
People are destroying the Amazon. Each year, farmers and loggers cut down rain forest trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Scientists have recently discovered that the Amazon is shrinking twice as quickly as they once thought.
The Amazon rain forest is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant
or variety. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines people need come from the Amazon.
The Amazon rain forest also helps recycle Earths air. The trees give off oxygen for people to breathe. Trees also clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans.
Stopping people from destroying the rain forest is not an easy task. ""Almost 2 million people make the forest their home,"" scientist Jim Bowyer told
""All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive. Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest.""
April 22 is Earth Day. How can you help protect our planet?
Rain forest trees stay green all year long.
The tallest trees may grow up to 200 feet!
When leaves and branches fall, they break down and release nutrients into the soil.

153,444,"The Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. had a dream. His dream was that all Americans would be treated fairly and equally. King worked to show that people of all backgrounds can live peacefully in the same community. Now a memorial will be built to honor King's dream.
On January 15, people all over the country will celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day. It is a day for people to celebrate his life. It is also a day for people to remember how Martin Luther King Jr. worked to make sure laws protect the rights of all Americans.
is going to be built in Washington, D.C., to honor King. A memorial is a special statue or place that honors a person or an event. King's memorial will sit on 4 acres of land. That's about the same size as three football fields.
This is a map of a section of Washington, D.C. Located in this area are several sites honoring important Americans.
Workers will probably start building the memorial this year. It will be built between the memorials to President Abraham Lincoln and President Thomas Jefferson. They plan to finish the memorial by 2003.
'I Have a Dream . . .'
A special event in American history took place near where the new memorial will be built. On August 28, 1963, King gave a speech before about 250,000 people. King and the people were in Washington, D.C., to speak out for freedom and better laws to protect all Americans. That speech is known as the ""I Have a Dream"" speech.
In the speech, King spoke about his dream of the United States becoming a country where people of all races could ""walk together as sisters and brothers.""
Martin Luther King Jr. is remembered for being a powerful speaker and a leader for peace. He taught others that problems can be solved peacefully, rather than through fighting and violence.

154,79,"Floodwater recently exploded from Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona. The water gushed down the Colorado River and into the Grand Canyon. A
is a long, narrow valley with high cliffs on each side.
Scientists released water from the dam to move 1 million tons of
down the Colorado River. Sediment is sand and soil carried by water. Scientists hope the sediment will collect on beaches and
to save endangered fish and plants. Sandbars are ridges of sand formed by moving water.
Glen Canyon Dam is a wall that people built across the Colorado River. It was made to store water and generate electricity. When it began operating in 1963, it stopped the flow of river water and most of the sediment.
Glen Canyon Dam is located in Arizona.
Without new sediment, beaches and sandbars started washing away. Plants growing along the beaches began to die off. Many young fish that depend on sandbars to survive started to die off too.
During the next two years, scientists will study the effects of the flooding. ""The Grand Canyon is one of the unique natural areas in the world,"" scientist Denny Fenn told
. ""It deserves protection. Anything we can do to save it, the better off we'll be.""

155,362,"Do you ever wonder what cars will be like in the future? You can bet that they will be much different from the cars of today. They will also be better for the Earth.
President Bush is excited about cars of the future. In a recent speech, he told Americans he wants our country to lead the world in building cars that do not pollute the environment.
Auto companies are currently designing cars that will not run on gasoline. They will use other fuel sources that do not pollute the environment. Those cars may be on the road by the time you are old enough to drive.

student reporters Donta Brown and Anika Djukic caught up with the actors.
Donta Brown: In the movie, Harry goes on a journey to protect his family and friends. Would you do the same in real life?
I think I would go on that adventure. Although I think it would be hard to be as brave as Harry was.
DB: What is your favorite scene in the movie?
One of them is when Im going into the forest, and I see the ghosts of my parents.
Anika Djukic: What does being on the run do to Harry, Hermione, and Rons friendship?

161,747,"The map shows where the body was found
About 5,300 years ago, a man walked along a mountain path. He stopped to rest and set down his copper ax. The man died there. In time, his body froze in the mountain's ice and snow. Now, scientists are trying to solve the mysteries this frozen man left behind.
In 1991, two climbers discovered a frozen body in the tztal (OETS-tahl) Mountains in Italy. Italy is a country in Europe. Scientists learned that the body was of a man who lived about 5,300 years ago. The ice had preserved his body, making it a
or warmed, the body so they could study the man's remains.
Scientists have nicknamed the mummy tzi, after the mountains where he was found. They have studied tzi's hair, teeth, skin, and clothes. So far, scientists have learned that tzi was probably a shepherd. He was wearing a grass cape, goatskin leggings, a bearskin cap, and fur-lined shoes. A
or guess, is that tzi was leading his herd of animals over the mountains when he died.
When he is not being studied, tzi is kept in a special freezer in a museum in Italy. His body is kept frozen so it does not
or rot. tzi's remains are helping scientists learn how much the world has changed in 5,300 years.

162,183,"Experts rush to keep historic Venice afloat.
For many, Venice is the jewel of Italy. It is famous for its beautiful buildings, art, and
The canals, or waterways, take the place of roads. People travel through the city on boats. But this city, which attracts millions of tourists each year, is in danger of sinking.
Venice is located on the Adriatic Sea. The city was built on a series of small islands in a
A lagoon is an area of shallow water.
During some high tides, water floods the city. For hundreds of years, people have tried to keep water out of the city. Now a group of scientists has introduced a bold plan to prevent the city from flooding. And it means adding more water!
In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads.
Scientists say Venice is sinking about 1 1/2 inches each year. To save the city, scientists want to pump water into the ground through pipes. The team expects the water to expand the sand under Venice and raise the city.
Scientists behind the plan say the pipes will work. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnt done carefully.
Everyone, however, agrees that saving the city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose a tremendous part of [history],"" says Melissa Conn of Save Venice, a group that is working to save the city.
Venice is known as the City of Canals.
There are about 150 canals in Venice.
About 400 bridges connect the citys 118 islands.

Tornado in Union City, Oklahoma, May 24, 1973
season in the United States. A tornado is a powerful, spinning wind. It travels quickly and can destroy everything in its path. Tornado season, which lasts for several months, is the time these twisters are most common.
The National Weather Service recently said it will change the tornado rating system next year. The strength of a tornado will continue to be rated on a scale from 0 (weakest) to 5 (most powerful). However, the new rating system will be more exact.
Under the old system, tornadoes with wind speed of about 300 miles per hour were given the rating 5. Studies have shown that slower winds can cause as much damage. The new system rates a tornado 5 if wind speed is at least 200 miles per hour.
Adverbs are words that describe verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. They tell where, how, or when. Examples are
Circle two adverbs in the tornado story.

164,207,"The first day of school, in early October, was a fresh start for millions of kids in Iraq. This year, the old rules and lessons have changed. School is no longer a place where every lesson centers around Saddam Hussein. He ruled Iraq from 1979 until May 2003.
When Saddam ruled Iraq, teachers were forced to mention him in every class, from history to music. In gym class, students had to chant, ""We all love Saddam!"" while they exercised.
""Children's minds have shrunk here. They have no imagination. They [were] taught only to memorize,"" said one teacher.
Now students will have the chance to learn new ideas about the world. They will use new textbooks that do not include pictures of the former president of Iraq.
Although students are eager to learn, not all schools are ready to teach. Many schools still need supplies and books.
Americans are helping out. They have donated pencils, crayons, and other school supplies. U.S. soldiers are repainting and rebuilding schools.
What do you value most about your school? Why?

167,173,"Talk about having all the right moves! In
, a tap-dancing penguin named Mumble tries to get his son to enjoy dancing.
Wade Robson lent his fancy footwork to the film, which hits theaters November 18. A choreographer creates the steps in a dance.
student reporter Bella Fletcher recently spoke with the man behind Mumbles moves.
Bella Fletcher: How do you create dances for animated characters?
You actually get to work with human dancers. ... The movements that the humans are doing are [used to create the movements of] the animated characters.
BF: What was the hardest part of making the dances?
There are always hundreds and hundreds of penguins [in a scene], but we only have 15 dancers. ... So I would have to imagine how a scene [would] look with hundreds and hundreds of penguins, but just create it with 15 [people].
[I like] Atticus, whos ... a chubby little rapper penguin. ... I actually played Atticus in the [first dance scene].

168,387,"A military dog missing in Afghanistan returns to her troops.
Sabi is one smart pup. The dog knows how to sniff for bombs and protect soldiers. Recently, the black Labrador learned another skill: how to live on her own in Afghanistan for more than a year.
Afghanistan is a country in the Middle East. U.S. troops are at war in Afghanistan. They are fighting people who supported the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
About 70,000 U.S. troops are currently fighting in the war in Afghanistan. President Barack Obama recently announced that hes sending 30,000
The United States is not the only country fighting. Soldiers from more than 40 other countries are involved in the war. Sabi is part of a
of soldiers from Australia. A unit is a group. The military dog helps troops by
, or finding, bombs with her nose.
In September 2008, Sabis unit was fighting in Afghanistan. During the battle, she became separated from the soldiers. For months, Sabis unit searched for her without any luck.
Finally, a U.S. soldier spotted Sabi in November 2009. With the soldiers help, Sabi was
with her Australian unit. To reunite is to bring back together.
The troops will probably never know what their furry friend was up to all that time on her own. Theyre just glad to have found her. Says Australian leader Kevin Rudd, Sabi is back home in one piece.
The dog probably wouldnt mind lending another helping handor pawif soldiers need it.
251,827 square miles (slightly smaller than Texas)
28.4 million; about half are kids younger than 15
mostly mountains and deserts; only about 12 percent of the land can be farmed
What are some other ways dogs might help troops serving overseas?

169,335,"Asian elephants are running out of space and time. Their
or the place where they usually live, has been shrinking. Scientists warn that Asian elephants could disappear if nothing is done to help them.
In Asia, humans and elephants are fighting over land. The forests where many elephants live are being cut down by loggers. The land that elephants live on is also being turned into farms. Many elephants have been killed when they cross into farms looking for food.
Scientists say the fight for land between elephants and humans is hurting both sides. Elephants kill around 300 people each year in India. In the last ten years, the elephant population in Vietnam has dropped from about 2,000 to fewer than 100.
Scientists for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) say there are about 35,000 to 50,000 Asian elephants left in the wild. That is a
or drop, from the 100,000 Asian elephants that were in the wild in 1900.
The map shows Asian countries. Elephants in these countries, scientists warn, are in danger of becoming extinct, or dying out.
11 feet tall at the shoulder (male)
9 to 10 feet tall at the shoulder (male)
9 feet tall at the shoulder (female)
8 feet tall at the shoulder (female)
Most males have tusks. If present, female tusks are small.
The WWF is an organization that works to save endangered animals. According to a recent WWF report, many Asian elephants are being killed for their meat, skin, and ivory tusks.
Elizabeth Kemf, a WWF scientist, says that world governments should set aside land for Asian elephants. Efforts to save the Asian elephants are important, she says, because the elephants belong ""not only to Asia, but all the world's people.""
More people live in Asia than on any other continent. How might that affect the Asian elephant population?

170,641,"Workers clean the Gulf of Mexico after an oil spill.
At a busy aquarium in New Orleans, Louisiana, a sea turtle splashes about in clean, clear water. Its hard to imagine that just weeks ago the animal was covered in greasy oil.
Experts wash a bird rescued from the oily water.
the sea turtle from an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. That body of water is south of the United States. To rescue something is to save it.
Until recently, oil had been spilling into the gulf for months. The oil
miles of sea and beaches. To damage something is to harm it. Thousands of animals were trapped in the sticky stuff.
The spill began in April. Workers were drilling from on top of an
in the gulf. That is a building in the sea. It is used to collect oil. Suddenly, the oil rig exploded. The accident caused an oil well at the bottom of the gulf to leak.
Since then, experts have been trying to stop the oil from spreading. They recently plugged the well with cement. Workers are also cleaning the water. The cleanup could take years, experts say.
The work is starting to make a difference, though. Officials recently reopened part of the gulf to fishing. That is good news for people who live near the gulf.
We love the land, Alma Robichaux told
She lives in Louisiana. We cant go anywhere else.
The oil spill isnt the first big trouble for the Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina hit the area in August 2005. The huge storm killed more than 1,300 people in five states.
New Orleans, Louisiana, was one of the worst-hit areas. Even today, parts of the city look as if the hurricane just happened. Many peoples homes are still damaged from the storm.
A group of kids works to repair houses. To repair is to fix. The group is called Beacon of Hope.
Student Emma Ridenhour recently lent a hand. After five years, theres still a lot of work to be done, she told
It means a lot that I could ... help.
How might the oil spill affect people in other parts of the country? Why?

172,788,"Trained rats may soon be used to find survivors who are trapped after disasters.
Meet the soon-to-be members of rescue teams--rats! Scientists are training the rodents to help find people who are buried in buildings after earthquakes and other disasters.
Rats have a strong sense of smell, which can help them sniff out people. The rodents are also tiny enough to crawl just about anywhere. They can get into places that are too small for people and other animals, such as dogs.
Scientists trained the rats to search for the scent of people. They attached tiny electronic devices to the brain of each rat. Signals from the rat's brain are sent to a radio that is strapped to the animal's back. Rescue teams will be able to track the signals and follow the rat's path.

175,166,"The results are in! At the beginning of the school year, we asked kids: How much weight are you carrying in your backpack? More than 2,000 kids responded to our online poll.
Carrying packs that are too heavy may cause injury. Doctors say most third graders' packs should weigh no more than 8 pounds. The good news is that most of you are following that advice. More than 1,300 kids replied that they carry 8 pounds or less.
Still, some kids are very overloaded. Of the kids polled, 465 told us they lugged around more than 12 pounds! If that is true for you, it may be time to clean out your backpack and lighten up!

176,340,"New NASA projects get ready to take flight.
Get ready for a birthday party thats out of this world. NASA turns 50 on October 1! The U.S. space agency has a lot to celebrate. NASA was
, or started, in 1958. Since then, the agency has
, or sent, more than 250 astronauts into space. The agency has also created robot spacecraft to explore
, or faraway, planets. There are even U.S. astronauts living and working in space on the International Space Station.
NASA officials have big plans for the next 50 years too. They plan to send humans back to the moon by 2020. U.S. astronauts first visited the moon in 1969. They stayed less than a day. This time, astronauts will live on the moon for up to six months.
NASA is designing a new spacecraft to carry the astronauts to the moon. Scientists are also redesigning the space suit. They say astronauts will need lighter suits for exploring.
Scientists hope that the moon mission will lead to an even bigger trip. NASA wants to send astronauts to Mars! The space agency has sent robot spacecraft called
to explore the Red Planet. NASA will send a new rover to Mars next fall.
Scientists want to determine whether Mars could have supported life at one time. They hope astronauts will one day be able to answer that question themselves.
Were trying to [go to Mars] as early as 2035, Jeff Hanley of NASA told
. Maybe someday in the far, far future [humans will reach] the stars.
NASAs history is a blast from the past! Read the time line to learn some important firsts in U.S. space travel and exploration.
U.S. astronaut Alan Shepard is the first American in space.
Americans become the first people to walk on the moon.
The International Space Station is under construction. It should be finished by 2010.

177,735,"Coins were available for buying and selling at the World's Fair of Money.
The sound of money was heard loud and clear this August at the World's Fair of Money. It was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
One billion dollars' worth of coins were at the fair. The money was available for buying and selling. Some coins cost less than a dollar. Other coins were worth millions.
Eight-year-old Sam Zurenski and his grandfather were among the visitors. Sam's grandfather collected coins when he was a boy. Now he is helping Sam build his own collection.
For many people, it's the story behind the coin that has them collecting. ""Every piece of money has a story to tell,"" said one coin expert. ""Money... is history you can hold in your hand.""

178,253,"You might think twice the next time you spot a fly on the wall! The U.S. Air Force plans to design flying robots that look like insects. The buggy robots could spy on enemies in other countries. They could also take part in missions that are too dangerous for humans.
The U.S. military will use bug robots to watch bad guys.
The flying machines could be as small as bumblebees, say military experts. They would also have wings that move up and down, just like real winged bugs. The bug-like robots may be able to fly
into buildings. Something that is undetected is not noticed.
If we know theres a possibility of bad guys in a certain building, how do we find out? asks project researcher Greg Parker. We think this would [help us figure that out].
The robots could also help U.S. soldiers by taking photographs and recording enemies voices. They could even fire tiny weapons! Builders hope the robots take flight by 2030.

185,610,"We live in a jam-packed world. In fact, more people live here than ever before. The population recently hit a whopping 6.5 billion! The big news was reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.
The number of people on the planet has doubled since 1960. And that number continues to grow. As you can see from the graph, experts estimate that six years from now, Earth will be home to about 7 billion people. That is not surprising when you consider that 261 people are born each minute.
A fact is a true statement. An opinion is an idea or a belief. Underline two facts and circle two opinions in this issue.

188,416,"Nine-year-old Aubrie LeClair of Connecticut is often busy at her computer. Like a lot of kids today, she uses the computer to type her schoolwork and learn new things.
By third grade, many kids know how to type on a keyboard. That has some handwriting experts worried. They are afraid that computers will replace cursive writing in the future.
""[The kids have] good handwriting now, and they love cursive,"" said one teacher from California. ""But it wouldn't surprise me if they just walked around with their little keyboards and typed everything a few years from now.""
Third grade is the year when most kids learn how to write in cursive. However, many kids like Aubrie say they would rather type than write in cursive. ""Computers are better. [They don't] make my hand cramp up as much,"" said Aubrie.
No one knows what will become of cursive writing. In the meantime, keep practicing. For the time being, it seems that cursive is sticking around.

189,682,"Attention, Barbie and Elmo: It's time to muscle up! The U.S. Congress is considering a bill to strengthen toy safety laws. Millions of toys were
last year in the United States. To recall is to ask people to return something they already bought.
Sixty-one different types of toys were recalled last year. Some toys were made with poisonous lead paint. Others had breakable parts that could be swallowed accidentally. The toys were
, or made, in China for U.S. companies. China is a country in Asia.
The new laws would reduce the amount of lead allowed in toys. There would also be more safety tests for toys.
""We're taking [steps] to make sure this ... never happens again,"" Peter Sandel, of the Toy Industry Association, told reporters.

190,318,"Rosa Parks is arrested and fingerprinted again in February 1956 for breaking segregation laws.
Fifty years ago, the courageous act of Rosa Parks changed history.
For years, Rosa Parks stood up to unfair laws against black people. Then on December 1, 1955, she changed the history of the United States forever. Rosa Parks was riding a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and was told to give up her seat to a white passenger. When she refused, she was arrested and taken to jail.
At that time, states in the South were
by law. The law kept black people from having the same rights as white people. Black people were forced to sit in the back of city buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, water fountains, and other public facilities.
After Parks was arrested, thousands of people refused to ride the city buses in Montgomery. The
was led by Martin Luther King Jr. and lasted for more than a year. It was a success. In 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the bus segregation law was illegal.
December 1 marks the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest for not giving up her seat. On that day, people across the United States will honor this important time in history.
Special events will take place in Montgomery, where the equal rights movement began. As part of the day's events, hundreds of kids will march to remember the bus boycott.
""Never again should we foster hate or distrust based on one's skin color,"" says event spokesperson Kenneth Mullinax. The children will march ""as a pledge to treat everyone with equal love,"" he told
""Rosa Parks's not giving up her seat on the bus shows how important it is to stand up for what we believe in,"" says Mullinax.
Today, people can step aboard the bus that Rosa Parks made famous. It is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan. The bus has been restored to look as it did in 1955.

193,376,"Hair, beware! Youre sitting at your desk, when suddenly your head feels itchy. Its under attack from tiny insects that cause big troublehead lice!
Each year, 6 million to 12 million Americans get lice. In fact, that is the number-one reason that kids miss school. Now the National Parent Teacher Association is fighting back against the little pests. The group has started a national program called Keeping Our Kids Lice Free.
Lice can spread very quickly from one person to another. The bugs cant jump or fly, but they can crawl. Follow these tips from health experts to keep lice from bugging you:
Avoid touching your head to someone elses head.
Dont share personal items such as hats, combs, and headphones.
Use your own sleeping bag and pillow on sleepovers.
Normally, sharing with your friends is nicebut not if you are sharing lice!

194,523,"The third-grade class at Mulberry School has gone to the birds! A dark gray parrot regularly visits the Los Gatos, Calif., classroom to sit in on students reading lessons.
, or sits, on a chair and listens to the students read aloud. During the stories, Starbuck bobs his head, ruffles his feathers, and makes sounds. He responds in so many ways, teacher Judy Quigley told
Sharing a book with Starbuck helps students feel comfortable reading aloud because they dont worry about making mistakes. When you read to people, sometimes they dont really listen, but he always listens, Anna Averfa-Goodman, 9, told
Students keep Starbucks attention by changing their reading styles during stories. I say it kind of louder so he can hear it, explains Justine Hoover, 9. If that doesnt work, the third graders have another trick. They read the parrot a book about worms!

How high can you count? U.S. officials are about to count to more than 300 million!
is ready to go. A census is an official count of every person who lives in a country. The United States polls its population every 10 years.
or running, a census isnt as easy as 1-2-3. In a few weeks, every household will receive a survey. The survey asks about peoples ages, races, and living situations. People must mail the form back to the government by April 1. Thousands of census workers will go door-to-door to make sure everyone takes part.
Once the forms are in, workers will crunch the numbers. Adding up the results will take monthseven with special machines that can sort thousands of surveys an hour. The data has to be finished by December 31. On that day, census workers will
the results to U.S. President Barack Obama. To deliver is to bring.
Workers pass out census information in Minnesota.
The numbers could add up to big changes. They could affect the U.S. House of Representatives. A states representation in the House is based on population. If a states population has changed, the number of representatives that state has may change too. The data could also affect how much money states, towns, and schools get from the government.
Thats why officials want to count all U.S. residents, says Robert Groves. He is in charge of the census. The most important thing is [to] fill it out and mail it back because that makes the census a great success, he told
So check the mail. The census surveys will be on their way soonyou can count on it!
In 1790, Congress made a new lawthe U.S. population had to be counted, and fast! Workers visited every house in the country. They counted about 3.9 million people. That number didnt wow President George Washington. He expected more people!
Washington would probably be happier with todays totals. Heres a look at the first and most recent censuses.
Is it important to know how many people live in the United States? Why?

This October, U.S. soldiers from the Fort Lewis army base in Washington state had a chance to be kids for a day. They headed to nearby Boze Elementary School. There they spent the day with some second and third graders.
for the rest of the school year. Pen pals are friends who keep in touch by writing letters.
A few days after meeting their new pen pals, the soldiers left for Iraq. That is a country in a part of Asia called the Middle East.

200,711,"Nearly a year ago, a volcano erupted more than 8,000 feet underwater. Today, researchers 500 miles off the coast of Mexico are getting a close look at the aftermath. The eruption covered 9 square miles of the ocean floor with hot liquid rock called

The eruption took place along the mid-ocean ridge, the most active volcanic region on Earth.
The crew made an amazing discovery! Chemicals from the vents attracted tiny organisms called bacteria.
Over time, scientists think that the bacteria will help tube worms grow in the area.
Later, crabs will come to feed on organisms, such as the tube worms, near the vents.
The dark zone of the ocean floor has no sunlight. The temperature there is almost freezing. Yet even after the eruption, living creatures are moving to this place to form a

, or problems facing the country. This week's issue is the
President Bush went to war in Iraq because, he said, the country's dictator, Saddam Hussein, had harmful, illegal weapons. Bush claimed that Iraq and its weapons threatened the United States and other nations. Bush says that the world is safer now that Saddam has been removed from power. His goal is to rebuild Iraq with its own government and establish peace there.
Senator Kerry supported a law that allowed the United States to go to war in Iraq. Since then, he has criticized Bush's handling of the war. Kerry said that Bush misled the nation by claiming that Iraq had harmful, illegal weapons. To date, none have been found. Kerry wants to persuade other countries to help rebuild Iraq and ""win the peace.""

If you have access to a computer, you can log on to the Internet to find information and go to places without ever leaving home.
The Net also has some sites that aren't so nice. Many stories in the news lately have been about kids who have gotten into trouble because they weren't careful about using the Net.
The number of kids who use the Net has exploded in the past few years. According to studies by eMarketer, an Internet company that studies who uses the Net, the number of U.S. kids between ages 5 and 13 going online at home will grow from 11 million in 1999 to 22 million in 2003.
Not all kids are surfing the Internet safely. Many kids are giving out information that they shouldn't reveal on the Net, such as their real last names, addresses, and phone numbers. Some kids have online conversations with people who mean them harm or could get them into trouble.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), you can have fun on the Net without putting yourself at risk if you stick to the following rules. The FBI says:
meet someone or have him or her visit you without your parents' permission.

207,771,"A new study shows that the amount of time you sleep affects how well you do in school.
tell when you stay up late? Think again.
During a recent sleep study, teachers noticed that kids had more difficulty learning when they stayed up an hour or two past their bedtime. ""Getting [to sleep] on time is as important as getting [to school] on time,"" says Gahan Fallone, who helped conduct the research.
Scientists followed 74 students ages 6 to 12 from Rhode Island and Massachusetts for the three-week study. During that time, the researchers tracked the sleeping habits of students. Teachers, who werent told how long the kids slept or which week they stayed up late, rated the students performance in school.
The teachers could tell when students didnt get enough sleep. Students who slept eight hours or less a night were more forgetful, had more trouble paying attention, and had difficulty learning new lessons.
How much sleep do kids need? Health experts from the National Sleep Foundation recommend that students ages 7 to 10 get at least 10 hours of sleep a night.
Teachers and principals have long been aware that students who get enough sleep generally perform better in school, which leads to better grades. At Potter- Burns Elementary in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, school officials send notes home to parents asking them to make sure kids get enough shut-eye before the yearlyachievement tests. ""Definitely there is impact on students performances if they come to school tired,"" says the schools principal, John Haidemenos.

208,375,"Meet a robot that has been busy tooting its own horn. A trumpet-playing robot made its debut at a hotel in Japan in March.
The robot played the song ""When You Wish Upon a Star."" After its performance, the 4-foot-tall droid bowed its head and waved its arms in response to the audience's applause.
Although the musical droid doesn't have a name yet, it is the latest in a string of
that scientists have built in the past few years. Humanoid robots are high-tech machines that act lifelike and are programmed to do jobs that people typically do.
Japanese companies lead the way in creating humanoid robots. Japan is thought to be the leader in
Other humanoid robots created by Japanese companies have been getting plenty of attention even without playing the trumpet.
Japanese scientists introduced ASIMO (ah-SEE-moh), the world's first stair-climbing robot, in 2000. The 4-foot, 115-pound ASIMO's many talents include walking, holding objects, speaking Japanese, and recognizing faces. ASIMO recently finished a world tour. The tour included several stops in U.S. cities so kids and adults could learn more about it.
Like ASIMO, QRIO (KYOOR-ee-oh), can talk and recognize faces. QRIO, which was unveiled in Japan in December 2003, can also run, jump, throw a ball, dance, and even belt out a tune.
In March, QRIO conducted Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in Japan. Before the rehearsal in front of a live audience, the robot grumbled, ""I'm feeling nervous.""
Today, robots come in all shapes and sizes. Many robots are used in factories. They help build cars, inspect computer parts, and package food. Robots speed up production on assembly lines and help save companies both time and money.
Robots also perform tasks that are difficult or dangerous for humans. Robots have explored the far reaches of space and traveled into active volcanoes.
that when robots were first introduced in the 1960s, they performed only jobs that were ""dirty, difficult, and dangerous."" That, however, is starting to change. Today's engineers hope that the new breed of humanoid robots will improve people's lives.
Many people are excited that humanoid robots may one day be able to lift people confined to beds or wheelchairs. The robots may also be able to help elderly people with chores such as vacuuming and taking out the garbage. Some people, however, worry that robots may take away jobs that are now performed by humans.
Although the humanoid robots have been busy making public appearances, they aren't for sale yet. If you really want a robot that will clean your room and help out with chores, you still have to wait a bit longer.
1. QRIO shows off some dancing skills. QRIO stands for ""quest for curiosity."" Why do you think the robot was given that name?
2. ASIMO (which is short for Advanced Step in Innovative MObility) walks down a flight of stairs.
3. In March, this latest humanoid robot-still unnamed-plays the trumpet at its first public appearance in Japan.
Robots are used for a variety of purposes from helping out in offices to performing surgery.
2. Sico the robot helps children paint pictures at an Arkansas hospital.
3. There is a two wheeled robot that can guide blind people.
How does technology help improve people's lives?

209,571,"Egyptians used papyrus, a tall plant, for paper.
the first paper was made in China.
Muslims in the Middle East learned the Chinese art of papermaking.
the first paper mill in Europe was built in Spain.
the first paper mill in the United States was built in Pennsylvania.
What shakes, pops, cracks, crumbles, tears, puckers, slaps, whistles, and sings? Give up? Those are just some of the many sounds that people can make with paper.
In mid-October, fifth graders watched as rolls of paper were released from the ceiling at the new Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Waving the paper, tapping on it, or blowing on it were some of the many ways musicians made sounds.
The paper instruments were part of a special performance called
. Chinese composer Tan Dun wrote the piece. He also invented and made the paper instruments used in the performance.
Dun's piece honors the art of papermaking and pays tribute to his Chinese heritage. Paper as we know it today was invented about 2,000 years ago in China.
The paper instruments allowed schoolchildren to hear how the shape of the concert hall affects sound. One 10-year-old girl from Los Angeles said that the concert hall sounded ""like a giant stereo.""
Dun says that the performance shows children that music can come from everyday objects. ""Using your imagination, you can find music around you, even in paper,"" Dun told
. ""Music is everywhere if you just look for it.""

210,765,"Larry Stevens lives in a remote, quiet area of Hawaii. Recently, that changed when new neighbors moved into the area. The noisy neighbors are two kinds of frogs.
Even though the coqui and greenhouse frogs are each only about the size of a dime, they make a huge racket. Instead of making soft chirping or gentle croaking sounds, the frogs chirp as loudly as a lawnmower. ""You'd never believe so much noise could come from a creature that small,"" Stevens said.
Scientists say the frogs in Stevens's backyard recently arrived in Hawaii. They came from islands in the Caribbean Sea, south of the United States mainland. Scientists think the frogs were accidentally shipped to Hawaii in flowerpots.
Since arriving in Hawaii, the foreign frogs have spread to 150 areas. In some areas, more than 8,000 can be found on a single acre of land. Each one is adding to the noise level.
The frogs are more than a noisy nuisance; they are causing other problems, as well. They eat insects that birds and other frogs used to eat. Each night, each thunderous frog can eat at least six insects.
The number of frogs is increasing because no other animals prey on them. If the foreign frog population keeps growing, other frogs and birds in Hawaii might not have enough insects to eat and might starve.
Some officials worry that the frogs might cause some people to leave Hawaii because of the racket. ""We get a lot of complaints from residents,"" said Fred Kraus, a spokesperson for the state. ""Some [have] threatened to leave the state.""
Residents of Hawaii are trying to capture the shrill frogs, which live in trees. Recently, Stevens and some of his neighbors went out looking for the noisy critters. They used ladders to climb into trees and capture frogs. ""We got them all,"" he said.
However, within a few months of the frog roundup, more frogs moved into Stevens's neighborhood. ""It was hopeless,"" Stevens said. ""There were just too many [frogs to capture]. Now they're out of control.""

211,480,"Most people want their wedding to be a special day. David Leibowitz and Kimberly Miller chose to start their marriage with a voyage to the bottom of the sea.
As part of a contest, Leibowitz won a submarine trip to see the
. The Titanic was a passenger ship that sank on April 15, 1912, after hitting an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean.
On their wedding day, the couple boarded a small sub and traveled to the ocean floor. The sub stopped on the bow of the Titanic. Standing inside the sub, the couple were married.

212,205,"You've probably sat at a desk or on a bench on which someone had carved or scratched a message. Etching, or carving, messages is nothing new, however. People have been carving and painting messages on rock walls for thousands of years.
Scientists recently announced that they had discovered ancient etchings in a cave in France, a country in Europe. The etchings are between 22,000 and 28,000 years old.
The cave etchings show prehistoric people and animals. Drawings of bison, horses, mammoths, and rhinos dot the cave walls and ceiling.
Marc Delluc discovered the cave etchings. Delluc is a cook who spends many of his weekends exploring caves in France. One day, he was exploring a tunnel in one cave when he noticed the etchings. He was the first person in thousands of years to see the amazing carvings. Delluc said the etchings are beautiful to look at. ""I just sat there gazing at the ceiling,"" he said.

213,15,"Car tires have been rolling through the news. The news is that experts believe Firestone tires have a
, or problem, that is causing the tires to burst. Bursting tires may have caused many car accidents.
As a result of the possible defect, 6.5 million Firestone tires are being taken off cars and thrown away. But what happens to old tires?
Each year, Americans throw away 276 million tires. About 70 percent of those tires are
, or made into other things. Many of those tires are shredded and pressed together to make surfaces for playgrounds. Kids could be playing on surfaces made from tires that your family threw away.
Even though most tires are recycled, many are piled up in huge mounds because the tires can't be recycled fast enough. Some experts say between 2 billion and 3 billion tires in the United States are waiting to be recycled.

214,499,"Julie, age 9, looked serious as she described what happened to her recently while riding on the bus to school. ""My mom and I had bought these shoes that I really liked,"" Julie told
. ""But then these kids started teasing me about them. I felt embarrassed. After that, I didn't want to take the bus anymore.""
This graph comes from a survey that asked kids and parents about some of the toughest issues facing kids today.
Scenes like that take place every day at bus stops, on school buses, on school playgrounds, and in other places. A recent survey found that 55 of every 100 kids between ages 8 and 11 said bullying and teasing are a ""big problem"" for kids their age.
The survey results also show that 74 percent of kids between ages 8 and 11 said they have seen bullying in their school. The survey was conducted by Children Now, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and Nickelodeon.
of someone that takes place over a period of time,"" said Ronald Stephens. To
means to constantly pester or threaten someone. Stephens heads the National Center for School Safety, which works to prevent violence in schools.
Bullying can take many forms, such as hitting, name-calling, threatening looks, and spoken threats, Stephens said. ""Bullying can have long-term effects,"" he said, ""including the 'vigilante effect.'"" A
is a person who takes the law into his or her own hands. So if a bullied student feels a school isn't helping, that student may act out against others, he said.
Bullying may be one of the causes behind some of the recent shootings in U.S. schools, according to Stephens. Kids at Santana High School, in Santee, California, said bullying may have a part in a recent shooting there.
Santee student Charles ""Andy"" Williams, age 15, is accused of killing two boys and wounding 13 other people at Santana High School on March 5. According to schoolmates, in addition to having other personal problems, Williams had been bullied and teased.
School safety experts say everyone in a school, as well as parents, must work together to make sure no kids are disrespected or treated cruelly.
To stop bullying, some schools have organized
. A peer mediation group allows students who have problems getting along to work the problems out with the help of peers and teachers.
Other schools have sent students and teachers forms asking questions about such problems as bullying and teasing. The answers from the forms help school leaders and parents become more aware of kids' problems and figure out ways to solve them.
Finally, Stephens suggests that there are steps a student who is bullied can take. ""Make it clear that you don't like being bullied and then walk away and tell an adult,"" Stephens said.
Ronald Stephens, of the National Center for School Safety, gives these three tips to remember if you are ever bullied:
If a person is bullying you, tell the person in a firm, loud voice that you don't like what they are doing. Then...
Find an adult (teacher, parent, coach) and tell that adult what happened.

216,676,"Hours before giant waves pounded coastlines in South Asia, many animals started behaving strangely. In Sri Lanka, elephants trumpeted frantically and fled to higher ground. Bats and flamingos deserted low-lying areas. Many other animals escaped unharmed.
Wildlife experts are amazed that many animals survived the tsunami. The series of huge waves killed thousands of people in South Asia and East Africa about two months ago. Experts say animals might have sensed the approaching waves and moved to higher ground.
""I think animals can sense disaster. They know when things are happening in nature,"" said an official at the national wildlife department in Sri Lanka.
Elephants' sharp senses may have warned them about the tsunami.
Other stories of odd animal behavior before the tsunami have also surfaced. Giant waves flooded low-lying parts of Yala National Park in Sri Lanka, uprooting trees and killing hundreds of people. Wildlife officials reported, however, that few animals died. The park is home to hundreds of animals, including elephants, monkeys, leopards, tigers, deer, and water buffalo.
In Thailand, elephants carrying tourists from Japan bolted for the hills, and other elephants broke free of their chains. In one fishing village, nearly 1,000 locals escaped safely after birds squawked madly.
Although some animals in South Asia successfully fled to higher ground before the tsunami, other animals were not as lucky. Many dogs and other pets lost their owners in the tsunami and are homeless, sick, and without food or water. Cows, goats, and other farm animals are also roaming aimlessly. Many of those animals are drinking polluted water. Rescue groups have been sending animal food and
to the area. Veterinarians are doctors who care for animals.
Why might animals have known trouble was on the way? Forget special powers. Instead, experts say that animals have better senses of hearing, smell, and sight than humans do. Those sharp senses help warn animals when natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes, are about to happen.
""It doesn't surprise me that animals had an early warning of the tsunami,"" animal expert Michael Dee of the Los Angeles Zoo told
. ""The senses of certain species are far stronger than what any human has."" Dee points out that dogs, for example, have a stronger sense of smell than humans and that cats can see better in the dark than people.
Scientists say that animals might have felt the vibrations from the earthquake that set off the tsunami. In addition, many animals, including elephants, pigeons, and dogs, can also pick up
. That is a sound that is too low in pitch for humans to hear.
""Elephants can hear or feel other elephants grumble up to 2 miles away, so they probably felt the earthquake,"" said Dee. ""Their first
would be to move away from the direction of the sound."" An instinct is a natural, untaught behavior or reaction.
Before the tsunami struck, animals may have started to flee because they saw other creatures running. ""Animals take their cues from other animals,"" said Dee.
How animals sense danger has fascinated people for centuries. Most scientists are quick to point out, however, that nothing has ever been proven.
Will animal instincts be used to create a warning system about natural disasters anytime soon? ""I wouldn't count on [it],"" said Dee.
In the meantime, animals are helping out in other ways. For example, elephants are assisting in the cleanup of areas hit by the tsunami.
Scientists say that elephants can pick up vibrations from earthquakes through their broad feet.
Elephants' toenails are in the skin and not attached to the toes.
Elephants' soles have sensitive foot pads that detect vibrations, such as those from an earthquake. That signals elephants to move to more stable ground.
In what other ways might animals' sharp senses be helpful?

Fifth graders at Carolina International School (CIS) have a goal this Earth Dayto throw away as little trash as possible during lunch. To get their message across, students will encourage their peers to recycle. ""I celebrate Earth Day every day,"" Nirvanna Madho, 10, told
. ""I really don't throw anything away.""
Participating in a zero-waste lunch is just one of many ways students at the school in Harrisburg, North Carolina, work to better the environment. Each April, the school organizes an Earth Day event. Students rotate through stations set up across the school's 36-acre campus, which includes forests and
Wetlands are moisture-rich lowland areas such as swamps or marshes. Students take part in hands-on environmental activities from testing water quality to checking out the latest models of battery-operated cars.
This year, Earth Day at CIS kicks off a season of change. The school is preparing to go ""green"" with a major construction project, set to begin early next year. Being green means protecting the world and its resources. The school's Earthfriendly makeover will include outdoor
or sun-powered, lighting and rooftop gardens. A water recycling system and other features to protect natural resources will also be built. The lobby will include a flat-panel touch screen on which students can watch how energy is being
""It's very important to educate children about environmental issues,"" says principal Deanna Duncan. ""If we don't take care of [Earth], there isn't another one.""
CIS is just one of hundreds of schools in the United States that are going green. A
is built with recycled and environmentally friendly materials. Green schools are designed to use less energy than traditional school buildings.
The majority of the energy supply in the United States comes from the burning of
such as oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels were formed from the remains of prehistoric animals and plants. People use fossil fuels when they drive their cars, heat their homes, and power farms, factories, and cities.
Though people depend on fossil fuels, those energy sources have their drawbacks. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air and releases gases that contribute to global warmingthe gradual rise in Earth's average temperature.
Hoover Dam generates clean energy by using water to spin turbines.
Fossil fuels are gradually being used up. To conserve them, scientists are looking to
sources. Renewable energy is power from sources that can't be used up and do not pollute the environment. Water, wind, and solar power are types of renewable energy.
President George W. Bush announced an energy plan that calls on lawmakers to ensure that ecofriendly fuels are developed and made easily available to Americans. Gas is a fossil fuel used in cars, and the price to fill up a gas tank is rising. Gas costs about $3 a gallon in some parts of the United States.
At CIS, students are excited for construction to begin on their new school building. ""I think the school is going to be a lot better,"" Drew Barsody, 10, told
""I'm looking forward to seeing the solar panels.""
These wind turbines convert wind into electricity.
Here are some common environmentally friendly energy alternatives.
Solar Power: Solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat and electricity. California and Arizona are two states that use solar power. One drawback of solar power is that energy can't be collected if the sun isn't shining.
Energy produced from windmills is used to generate electricity. The amount of electricity generated from wind has been growing in recent years, tripling since 1998 in the United States. Electricity is produced from wind in 30 states, including California, Texas, and Iowa.
is one of the oldest sources of energy. Hydropower often comes from dams or waterfalls. Of all renewable energy sources, it is most often used to generate electricity. In 2004, it accounted for 7 percent of all the electricity generated in the United States.
Ethanol is a clean-burning fuel that can power cars. It is created from several sources, such as corn crops. Typically, a small amount of ethanol is combined with gasoline to fuel vehicles. That helps decrease the fuel's cost and harmful emissions.
Turning off the lights when you leave a room is one way to conserve energy. What are some other ways to save energy?

all rooms, doors, windows, and smoke alarms.
at least two ways out of each room. That way you will know how to escape no matter where you are, and no matter where the fire is.
a meeting place outside, away from your home, where all members of your household can gather after they have left the building.
any fire escapes or fire stairs in your building if you live in an apartment or high rise. (Talk to your building manager or local fire department about what you should do if a fire starts in your building.)
the location of a neighbor's house, public phone, or call box to alert the fire department. (Or, assign a family member to bring a portable phone when exiting your home.)
""Develop a home fire escape plan with your family. Practice your home escape plan at least twice a year. Pretend that some escape routes are blocked by smoke and fire so that you can practice using different exits. Close all doors behind you as you exit to keep smoke from spreading through your home.

220,118,"Nine-year-old Hannah Niles loves poetry! The fourth grader especially enjoys reading poetry by Edgar Allan Poe. ""He uses a lot of expression and detail in his poems,"" she told
Hannah belongs to the Basketball Poets. That is a group of 40 fourth and fifth graders at Supply Elementary School in Supply, North Carolina. The students meet once a week in the gym, where they read, write, memorize, and perform poetry. Then they play basketball.
Poetry lets kids express themselves. ""If you're nervous, you write a poem about being nervous. If you're happy, you write a poem about being happy,"" said 10-year-old Douglas Mitchell.
The Basketball Poets also had the opportunity to meet two published poetsKenn Nesbitt and Sharon Creech. Both children's authors visited the school and gave the students advice on writing poetry. ""They were professional, and we're kids, so that's exciting,"" said Hannah.
Who came up with the idea for the Basketball Poets? It was the school's physical education teacher, Marty Mentzer. She sees the club as a way for kids to keep their minds and bodies fit. ""It's cool to be a reader and a writer,"" she said, ""and basketball teaches them teamwork.""

221,570,"Did you know that for a lot of people, their foot is the same length as their forearm? True for you? Let's measure!
A piece of string (a little longer than your height)
First start at the end of your string and mark off seven foot lengths:
Now use the string to measure these body parts. Have a friend help. Be sure to measure from one black mark on the string to the next.

222,209,"Pilots follow monarchs on the move from Canada to Mexico.
Each fall, the skies between eastern Canada and the mountains of central Mexico fill with orange-and-black monarch butterflies. Along their journey, millions of butterflies fight fierce winds and flee predators. Once they reach their destination, monarchs cover trees with their bright, shimmering wings.
This year, the monarchs will not be flying alone. Butterfly lovers are accompanying them on their 3,415-mile journey. They are riding in a light aircraft called an
Their aircraft is painted to resemble the orange, black, and white wings of the monarch.
or move from one place to another. Beginning in early August, the butterflies head south for the winter months.
Most monarchs travel from Canada to Mexico. Others travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north. They are the only insects to make such a long round-trip migration.
Mexican pilot Francisco Gutierrez and a crew of other pilots from Canada and the United States departed from Quebec, Canada, on August 15. The group plans to arrive in Mexico on November 2.
The crew hopes to raise awareness about the monarchs' fragile habitats. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning the forests that protect the butterflies from rain and cold.
No one has ever followed the butterflies in the air for their entire journey. Doing so can teach scientists how the winged insects deal with wind patterns and difficult weather. Gutierrez says, ""It's going to be an adventure.""

224,246,"Explorer Brge Ousland likes challenges. He currently holds four polar records. He set his last record in 1997 when he became the first person to walk across Antarctica without help.
Now Ousland is taking on a new challenge. At the end of February, he was scheduled to begin a 1,100-mile Arctic trek from Siberia to Canada via the North Pole. Siberia is a region of eastern Russia.
If successful, Ousland will be the first person to cross the top of the world alone and without help. Although he was not sure how long the trip would take, the explorer planned to pull a 340-pound sled with food and supplies for 90 days.
""This is the last classic challenge when it comes to expeditions in the polar areas,"" Ousland said. ""I have wanted to do this for a long time.""

225,407,"Admiral Richard Byrd was one of the first people to explore Antarctica. Beginning in 1928, the U.S. explorer led several expeditions across the frozen continent. Sometime between 1939 and 1941, Byrd or one of his group buried a Hershey chocolate bar in the ice near the South Pole. The candy bar remained buried for 60 years.
Then, in January 2001, explorer Douglas Stoup found the candy bar buried in 2.5 feet of ice. Stoup donated it to the Hershey Museum in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
After 60 years, the candy bar, which weighs about 4 ounces, probably doesn't taste very good. In fact, it was never meant to. The U.S. Army had asked Hershey to make special candy bars, called Field Ration Bars, as a test. The bars were made to give soldiers lots of energy and not melt easily. The Army told Hershey the bars should taste ""just a little better than a boiled potato,"" so that soldiers wouldn't eat too many of them.

228,371,"Why is one of America's most historic areas endangered?
One of the most historic regions in the United States is in trouble. The 175-mile-long area of land stretches through Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
The area is home to more American history than any other slice of land in the country, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. George Washington built his estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison also built their homes in that state. The region at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains includes many battlefields from the Civil War (18611865).
As people construct new houses, roads, and buildings, they are destroying acres of history. Officials say the region has lost more than 150,000 acres of farmland in the past 20 years. That is an area slightly smaller than New York City.
To call attention to the problem, the Trust placed this region on the 2005 list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. The trust works to
""This is where the Civil War was fought,"" says Richard Moe, president of the trust. ""This is where our Founding Fathers lived. ... There are African American sites. There are Native American sites. Our whole nation's history is, in one way or the other, [in this area].""
The following places are in the region between Pennsylvania and Virginia that was added to this year's list of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in the United States.
In 1863, the Battle of Gettysburg was fought in and around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The battle was the turning point of the Civil War.
Monticello was the home of Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States.
Dobbin House was used as a ""station"" for hiding runaway slaves on their dangerous journey to freedom along the Underground Railroad.

229,222,"Part of Hawaiis coastline collapses, pouring lava into the Pacific Ocean.
Lava from the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii hits the sea.
Tourists watched in awe as a huge chunk of Hawaiis coastline broke off and fell into the ocean. More than 44 acres of coastline collapsed and sent a glowing swirl of red-hot
bursting from a cliff. Lava is liquid rock that comes from a volcano.
The lava waterfall from the Kilauea volcano spilled into the Pacific Ocean. Steam shot into the air as the lava hit the water.
""The cliff just caved away like a glacier,"" Hawaii Volcanoes National Park spokesperson Jim Gale told reporters. ""It just sheared off that old wall."" Park officials let tourists watch the spectacular scene well away from the danger zone.
Kilauea, the worlds most active volcano, on Hawaiis Big Island has been erupting continuously since 1983. The November collapse was the largest in 23 years. It took about four hours for the cliff to tumble into the ocean. As the lava hardened, it began to form new land. All the Hawaiian Islands formed that way.
The recent collapse didnt surprise scientists. They had issued a warning months earlier because the cliff had formed cracks. Land collapses are not uncommon in the area. In 1996, a 26-acre area collapsed into the ocean, and in 1999, 25 acres of unsteady land fell into the water.
Thin strands of wiry volcanic glass, called Peles hair, were found about 2,000 feet away. Peles hair is a type of
which forms from lava that cools and hardens. According to myth, Pele was the Hawaiian goddess of fire.

230,667,"Can you imagine not having a chance to play tag or hopscotch in the schoolyard after lunch? For many students around the country, their afternoon break is quickly becoming history. Nearly 40 percent of elementary schools have either eliminated or are considering eliminating recess, according to the American Association for the Childs Right to Play.
Why? Some school officials say they want students to have more classroom time to learn. They hope that more time in class will help students perform better on standardized tests.
In addition, many schools are cutting recess because they can no longer afford to offer it. Those schools dont have the money to hire lunch aides or to buy sports equipment for the playground.
Most teachers and parents say that recess has a place in school. Nine of 10 teachers say free time spent with friends is an important part of the school day, according to a recent survey conducted by the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA).
Education experts also stress that the benefits of recess outweigh the lost class time. Recess gives students the opportunity to take a break, exercise, and socialize with their friends.
At recess, many students learn how to
or work together, with other students. Many studies also show that recess helps improve test scores.
The National PTA and Cartoon Network recently launched a program called Rescuing Recess. To kick off the campaign, children across the country are being asked to write letters to let their local and state school officials know that recess is important to them.
""We know many children enjoy recess as a welcome break from the classroom, and parents appreciate the balance that it offers between schoolwork and play,"" says Anna Weselak, National PTA president.
Exercise helps kids stay healthy. No recess? Dont worry! You can get fit on your own time. Kids should exercise for an hour each day, say experts. Here are some ideas to get you moving.
Turn on music and dance in your room.
to express your views about break time and to let local school boards know that recess is important to you.

231,605,"Soaring high above California's coastline stand the magnificent redwood trees. Redwoods are the world's tallest known trees and are also some of the oldest. Some scientists are concerned about a disease that is threatening the ancient giants. It is called sudden oak death.
The disease has scientists alarmed. First identified in 1995, sudden oak death has spread along hundreds of miles of California's coastline and jumped into southern Oregon. In addition to attacking oak trees, it has spread to redwoods, Douglas firs, and other types of trees and shrubs. One of the worst outbreaks of the disease has occurred at California's Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park.
Scientists recently discovered the organism responsible for the disease. It is a fungus that causes oozing red blobs to grow on diseased oak trees. On younger redwoods, it dries up leaves and kills sprouts. According to scientists, redwoods are hosts for the disease. A host is an organism on or in which another organism lives.
The disease first showed up in rhododendron plants in the Netherlands in 1993. Scientists are concerned because the spread of the disease could pose a threat to the redwoods' ecosystem, an environment where plants and animals coexist. Scientist David Rizzo said that anytime you have a strange organism, there is cause for concern.
Coastal redwoods can grow upwards of 360 feet. Some are taller than the Statue of Liberty, which stands about 300 feet.
The diameter of redwoods can measure about 20 feet.
Named California's state tree, the redwood can live more than 2,000 years.
In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Muir Woods a national monument dedicated to protecting and preserving the mighty redwoods.
In 1904, a fungus from Asia began killing chestnut trees in New York. Over the next 50 years, the disease killed about 3.5 billion trees and almost wiped out an entire species. Scientists want to prevent this from happening in California or elsewhere in the United States.
Studies show this disease spreads rapidly during the wet months of spring. The coming months could be vital in tracking the disease. Current weather forecasts predict that this spring will be rainier than the last two springs. ""We have to get familiar with the symptoms and the treatments,"" said another scientist, ""because we don't know how much farther it will spread.""

232,172,"Joseph DAngeli lives with vampiresvampire bats, that is. He feeds bats and studies their habits. DAngeli is a
(kigh-rop-TAH-luh-jist), or a scientist who studies bats.
This man is not a superhero, but he knows a lot about bats.
The weekend before Halloween, DAngeli is bringing his bats to the Chiller Theatre Toy, Model, and Film Expo in Secaucus, New Jersey. Its the countrys largest horror and science-fiction convention.
""The convention gives me a chance to talk to true bat lovers and people who havent experienced bats up close,"" DAngeli told
""Where else can you see a bat with a 3- to 4-foot wingspan in front of your face?""
A reputation refers to the way people think of something. But DAngeli says there is a lot to like about the
(active at night) animals. Bats, for example, help the environment. ""Many valuable bat species eat cropdamaging insects,"" he says.
DAngeli has been studying bats since he was a teenager. Whats his advice for students interested in studying the winged creatures? ""Get some rest. Youre going to be up late if you want to study bats.""
There are more than 900 known species of bats.
A brown bat can eat as many as 1,000 mosquitoes in an hour.
Contrary to popular belief, bats are not blind. To navigate in the dark, some bats use echolocation. That is a process in which sound waves bounce off objects and return to the bats ears.

233,162,"Mystery has surrounded King Tutankhamen's death for more than 80 years. Since his tomb was
, or dug up, in 1922, scientists have been left wondering: Was the ancient Egyptian king murdered?
Scientists recently performed a computerized X-ray called a
on King Tut's 3,300-year-old mummy. The results of the tests indicated that Tut wasn't violently murdered but might have suffered a badly broken leg shortly before his death. The injury could have led to a dangerous infection.
, or rising to, the throne when he was nearly 8 years old, Tut died mysteriously at age 19. The recent tests confirmed his exact age at the time of his death.
In 1968, X-rays performed on Tut's mummy showed that he might have suffered a blow to the heada sign that he could have been violently murdered. Now scientists say that is not the case. ""In answer to theories that [Tut] was murdered, the team found no evidence for a blow to the back of the head, and no other indication of foul play,"" an Egyptian spokesperson reported.
Despite the finding, some experts say the tests haven't solved the mysteryand haven't ruled out murder. One idea is that Tut was poisoned.
Although the cause of death is not clear, Zahi Hawass, the Egyptian scientist who led the investigation, says it's finally time to close the case.
""I believe these results will close the case of Tutankhamen, and the king will not need to be examined again.""

234,345,"Benjamin Franklin once said, ""A penny saved is a penny earned."" For the people of Boston and Philadelphia, Franklin's pennies have come to mean a lot.
When Franklin died in 1790, he left money to both cities. Franklin chose those two cities because he was born in Boston and lived most of his life in Philadelphia.
Franklin left the money to help people who need it. ""I wish to be useful even after my death,"" Franklin wrote. He knew that his money would grow in value over time if it was invested right.
Before he died, Franklin made sure that the money would not be wasted. He left specific instructions on how the money should be used.
For the first 100 years, the money was used for loans to young people who wanted to learn technical skills. After the first 100 years, the money was used for education and public works. After 200 years, most of the money was given to the state governments that support each city.
Today, the money Franklin left in his will is worth millions of dollars. It has helped pay for education, equipment for fire departments, and the building of a museum.

235,243,"A new study shows that kids who have a TV in their bedrooms get less sleep than other kids. Sleep experts at Brown University say about 30 percent of kids have a TV in their bedrooms.
According to sleep experts, kids who have TVs in their bedrooms go to bed later, have problems going to sleep, and are more likely to wake up during the night than kids who don't have TVs in their rooms.

236,69,"Winter is upon us, and that means snow in many parts of the country. Snow forms when water droplets in clouds freeze into ice crystals. Take a look at the five cities in the continental United States that average the most snowfall each year. Alaskas cities are not included because they would take over most of the list.Valdez, Alaska, tops the list as the snowiest city, with an average snowfall of 326 inches a year!
About how many more inches of snow a year do people in Marquette shovel than people in Syracuse?

237,668,"The planet's famous rings have changed in the past 25 years.
Cassini is studying Saturn and capturing pictures of its rings.
Scientists have uncovered some of Saturn's secrets. Researchers recently learned that the planet's famous rings have changed during the past 25 years. The information has been collected from tools aboard the
, or circling, the ringed planet last year.
is studying Saturn and capturing pictures of its rings. Its ring bands are named with the letters
. The rings, however, are not in alphabetical order. They were assigned a letter in the order in which they were discovered.
One of the most surprising finds is that parts of Saturn's innermost ringthe D ringhave grown dimmer since 1981. In addition, the D ring has moved 125 miles closer to Saturn.
What do these new discoveries mean? Scientists aren't sure, but hope the discoveries will reveal clues about the age of the rings around the sixth planet from the sun. ""I don't think Saturn's rings will disappear anytime soon, but this tells us how the rings are [changing] and how long they might last,"" says Linda Spilker, a scientist with the U.S. space agency, NASA.
Although Saturn's rings appear solid, they are actually made up of pieces of rock, ice, and dust. Those pieces vary from the size of tiny dust particles to the size of large mountains.
Scientists are also studying the shimmering rings to learn more about how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. They say that Saturn's rings are a model of the gas and dust that once surrounded the sunthe center of the solar system.
The image of Enceladus was taken by the
spacecraft. Enceladus is one of Saturn's 47 known moons. The red areas appear to be craters and ridges on the icy moon's surface.
Other images revealed water vapor escaping from cracks on the moon. Water vapor indicates that Saturn has an
, a layer of air that surrounds a planet.
Tiny Enceladus now joins Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa as places in the solar system that may have liquid water beneath their surfaces. Water is necessary for life to exist.

238,633,"How long would it take you to build the world's tallest Lego tower? In just five days, park guests at Legoland in Carlsbad, California, set the Guinness World Record for the tallest Lego tower. The tower stands 92 feet 6 inches tall and is constructed out of a half million bricks. The previous record was set in Estonia, a country in northeastern Europe, in 1998. That tower reached a height of 82 feet.

239,519,"On September 11, the foundations of some of America's most famous landmarks were reduced to rubble by terrorist attacks. But the foundations of the United States are not as fragile as those buildings. To prove that point, millions of Americans have come together to help one another.
President George W. Bush recently recognized the heroic efforts Americans have made in the wake of this tragedy. In a speech on September 18, Bush said: ""Out of our tears and sadness, we saw the best of America. We saw a great country rise up to help. Tens of millions of dollars and thousands of hours and tons of food and clothing have all been donated to help rebuild shattered lives.""
By flying flags and holding vigils, millions of Americans shared the president's sentiments. ""As Americans, there is a bond between us, no matter how far away we are from one another,"" said Karen Bogart of Pasadena, California.
In the aftermath of the attacks, thousands of heroes offered to help. Those heroes were the volunteers, firefighters, police officers, and emergency crews at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Many of those heroes traveled thousands of miles to help out at ""ground zero,"" the site of the World Trade Center collapse, in New York City. ""We've had fire departments from Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and so many other places help us,"" said New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In addition to their usual jobs, rescue workers looked for pets trapped in deserted apartments or injured in the attacks. Many people who live near the World Trade Center in New York City had to leave their apartments quickly and were not allowed to return--even for their pets.
""Sometimes the owners feel so guilty that they abandoned their pets,"" said Jennifer Olsen of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ""But it is so gratifying to see them when they reunite with their pets after all this time.""
The rescued animals included cats, dogs, birds, and even a
, a kind of lizard. To get to the gecko, named Little Dude, rescue workers had to climb stairs to the 39th floor of a building. Despite that obstacle, Little Dude was reunited with its owner.
Whether rescue workers cleared rubble, looked for and helped survivors, or retrieved lost pets, their heroic efforts made all Americans proud to be Americans. Recently, President Bush also spoke of national pride. ""As president of this great land, nothing made me more proud.""

Mammoth fossils have been found in different parts of the world. However, this discovery marks only the second time that mammoth remains have been unearthed in England.

. That was a period of time when blankets of ice covered the Earth. It began about 2 million years ago and ended about 11,500 years ago.
A mammoth's thick, shaggy coat kept it warm during the Ice Age. Scientists believe that hunting and a rise in Earth's temperature caused woolly mammoths to die out, or become
How did scientists find this particular mammoth's skull? They began digging after one scientist spotted a bone sticking out of the ground. After seven hours, they finally unearthed the 220-pound skull.
Scientists believe that the mammoth was a female between 30 and 40 years old. They even found pieces of grass, believed to be the mammoth's last meal, between its teeth. The scientists hope to learn more about woolly mammoths and the time during which they lived by studying the fossil.
""We didn't expect to find anything like this,"" said one of the scientists. ""It is quite amazing.""

241,426,"Scientists make a splash with the discovery of new marine species.
Scientists in Indonesia think they have found hidden treasure52 new types of marine animals! The researchers believe that the 24 types of fish, 20 types of corals, and 8 types of shrimp are new to science.
The researchers spotted the new species off the coast of Papua, a province on one of the more than 13,500 islands that make up Indonesia. The area, Birds Head Seascape, is one of the worlds most diverse marine regions.
""These Papuan reefs are literally species factories,"" says Mark Erdmann of Conservation International, who led the expedition. Many of the species are believed to be
to the area, meaning they are not found anywhere else.
Birds Head Seascape is part of Asias ""Coral Triangle."" The Triangle covers about 70,000 square miles in the Indian Ocean. It is home to more than 1,200 species of fish and almost 600 kinds of reef-building corals.
But the marine marvels off Papuas coast may be in danger. The Indonesian government is considering a plan to increase commercial fishing in the east, near Papua, because Indonesias western seas are overfished.
Wildlife groups are against the plan. They say it is
or absolutely necessary, to protect Birds Head Seascape. ""Its extremely important because this area is the center of coral reef
,"" Sherry Flumerfelt of the Coral Reef Alliance told
refers to the variety of species in a particular environment. We need to ""make sure these species are protected,"" says Flumerfelt.
Here are a few of the standout species that scientists recently spied in Indonesia.
A bottom-dwelling epaulette shark uses its fins to ""walk"" across the ocean floor in search of shrimp, crabs, snails, and small fish.
When its time to attract a mate, a male flasher wrasse ditches its drab brown hue for some brighter colors.
There are three times more fish in the Birds Head Seascape than in the Hawaiian Islands, including this newly discovered one.
Only a fraction of all marine species have been found. Why might it be difficult to find new ocean creatures?

242,123,"Students from Camden's Promise Charter School in New Jersey recently finished both a canned-food drive and a clothing drive. And they are currently helping a local literacy agency reach its goal of collecting 20,000 books.
Jesse Coltrane, a 15-year-old student at Camden's Promise, says that kids can help people in need through school and community projects. Like Jesse, thousands of students will be working in their schools and communities to make the world a better place during National Volunteer Week (April 27 through May 3).
This year will mark the 30th anniversary of National Volunteer Week. The theme of this year's week is ""Celebrate Volunteers-The Spirit of America."" As part of this year's week, kids across the United States will be taking part in service projects. Many kids will also participate in community events to honor volunteers.
""When you volunteer, you help America become strong. You become an instant champion!""
""Volunteers learn important skills like teamwork and responsibility,"" said Melissa Helmbrecht, founder of the volunteer organization Champions of Hope.
Champions of Hope is made up of more than 650,000 kids across the country and includes Jesse Coltrane and other students at Camden's Promise. Champions of Hope participants across the country are volunteering to collect food for the hungry, clean parks, and raise money for firefighters.
Champions of Hope started a United Day of Service on September 11, 2002, one year after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. On that day,
star Sean Astin spoke to youths gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., about the importance of civic action. Astin plays hobbit Sam Gamgee in the movie. Astin told
, ""It is our responsibility to keep making the world a better place. We can do that by helping others.""
Sixth-grade student Matthew Malon from Illinois attended the September 11, 2002, rally and has collected food for homeless shelters. Astin's speech on volunteering moved him.
Some students from Camden's Promise also attended the rally. Students Damian Johnson, Keith Bennett, and Tashay Moody agree that it's important for kids to volunteer.As 16-year-old Damian Johnson puts it: ""[Volunteering] makes me feel like I have made an impact on people who don't have as much as I have.""
""How can I make a difference in the world if I'm just an ordinary kid?"" Thirteen-year-old author Sondra Clark answers that question in her fourth book,
!, which hit bookstores in March. She shows kids that small actions, such as donating videos to a children's hospital, can make a big difference.
Clark was motivated to write her book after reading an article on volunteerism in
. She has traveled to Africa to help children. Currently, she is traveling across the United States with her parents to share her experiences.
The action doesn't stop for actor Sean Astin when the cameras stop rolling. Astin, one of the stars of The Lord of the Rings movies and the father of two young children, is inspiring kids to make the world a better place.
In January, Astin was appointed to the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation. President George W. Bush created the council to encourage volunteerism. He has urged Americans to make a lifetime commitment to volunteering.
Astin tells kids that it's easy to make a difference. As a teenager in Santa Monica, California, he volunteered his time helping preschool students cross the street. He told Weekly Reader, ""I remember feeling that because I was helping someone, I had an incredible responsibility, and it felt great. It made me a better person.""

243,72,"A group of students discovered more than 85 ancient canoes last April in a dry lake bed in Florida. Scientists later dug up the canoes to study them. They recently reported that the canoes were built between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago.
The students found the canoes in a lake near Gainesville, Florida. The Seminole people used to live near the lake. Seminole Chief James Billie said his ancestors called the lake
, which means ""place of the long boats.""
The sunken wooden canoes were exposed when the lake's water level dropped last spring. The mud at the bottom of the lake had preserved the canoes.
The scientists who studied the canoes say they are 22 feet long. After studying the canoes, the scientists returned them to the lake bed. They explained that leaving the ancient canoes exposed to the air would have caused them to crumble in a few days or weeks.

246,475,"Thousands of students put their art skills to the test. They entered the annual greeting card contest sponsored by UNICEF, Pier 1, and Weekly Reader. Six-year-old Adam Carr from Florida and 12-year-old Anna Hall from Colorado took top honors. The two grand-prize winners won a trip to New York City, where they will tour the United Nations.
Adams and Annas drawings will be made into greeting cards. Money from profits will be donated to help children in need overseas.

247,201,"Saying you're sorry or apologizing when you hurt someone is always the right thing to do. In fact, scientists say that even some fish apologize when they accidentally hurt other fish.
Cleaner fish are fish that clean tiny plants and animals off other fish. Every so often, a cleaner fish accidentally nibbles on the fish it is cleaning. According to scientist Redouan Bshary and Manuela Wuerth, to apologize for biting the fish, the cleaner fish rubs the other fish's fins.

248,568,"Ten-year-old Hunter York might have a fear of snakes, but that didn't stop him from picking up the two-headed creature that he found in his father's backyard.
The Kentucky boy used a stick to pick up the two-headed black king snake.
The snake ""kind of freaked me out a bit,"" he said.
Hunter ran into the house to tell his father about the 8 1 / 2-inch reptile.
, like this snake, are cold-blooded animals that either crawl around on the ground or, like turtles and lizards, creep on short legs.
Hunter's dad left the reptile with a snake expert because they couldn't get it to eat.
""We couldn't force-feed it because we don't know which head eats,"" said his dad.

249,692,"Four hundred years after its founding, Jamestown is a historical hot spot.
Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on armor and talk to tour guides. This year, more than 2.4 million people from across the country are expected to attend Jamestown events.
Stepping into Jamestown Settlement museum in Virginia is like stepping into the past. And that's just what thousands of people are planning to do this spring. May marks the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America. Organizers are expecting nearly 90,000 visitors on the weekend of May 11 to 13, when many major events are planned.
Jamestown is a tourist destination for people who want a frontrow seat to American history. ""The whole idea is to give people an idea of Jamestown and the world in 1607,"" historian Tom Davidson told
Davidson helped put together exhibits at the Jamestown museum for the anniversary.
Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on English armor and watch experts demonstrate how to fire muskets. Tourists can also go aboard and explore
or models, of the three ships that brought the first settlers to present-day Virginia.
The story of Jamestown began on May 14, 1607, when about 100 English men and boys arrived in present-day Virginia. They came seeking gold and other treasures. The settlers, called
built a fort on the bank of a river and named their colony Jamestown, after King James I of England.
or businesspeople, of the Virginia Company to make money in North America. But the settlers faced many problems, including disease, starvation, and conflict with the area's Powhatan people (see ""
At first, settlers stayed close together for protection. ""There were hundreds of people living inside a wooden-walled fort,"" explains Davidson. Living in the fort helped the settlers defend themselves from attack, but it also made hunting for food or growing crops difficult.
Captain John Smith was one of Jamestown's original leaders. He took command of the colony in 1608. When the colony was in danger of running out of food, Smith gave an order: ""He who does not work, will not eat.""
spent five months crossing the Atlantic. The original Godspeed carried 39 passengers from England to Virginia, making two stops along the way. The new Godspeed traveled from Maine to Virginia, stopping along the way to let visitors see the ship.
By 1613, Jamestown had expanded into a successful colony. At about that time, the settlers began to grow tobacco. Tobacco was a
meaning that it could be sold in large amounts to England. In the following years, the settlers pushed the Powhatan off the land and built tobacco
or large farms. Later, the Jamestown colonists bought slaves from Africa to work on the plantations.
Over time, Jamestown grew to become the colony of Virginia. Virginia was one of the 13 colonies that joined in 1776 to rebel against England, starting the American Revolution (17751783).
Much is known about Jamestown, yet more details are being discovered. For more than a hundred years, experts thought the site of the original settlement had been destroyed by the James River. In 1994, archaeologists, or scientists who study the remains left behind by past cultures, discovered what may be Jamestown's original location.
""Visitors can see things being excavated that haven't seen the light of day in 400 years,"" Jamestown spokesperson Mike Litterst told
Scientists are currently looking for the foundation of the first church that the Jamestown settlers built. If found, it will be the oldest English church ever discovered in the United States.
The skeletons of two settlers have already been uncovered at the site. They are on display beneath a glass case, exactly as they were found. Historians believe that one of the skeletons is that of Captain Bartholomew Gosnoll, a member of Jamestown's original ruling council. Gosnoll and Jamestown Settlement will have a lot of visitors in the coming weeks for the 400th anniversary. ""It's the biggest event we've had since 1957, when the [Jamestown] museum first opened,"" says Litterst.
When the English colonists first settled in what is now Virginia, a powerful Native American group had lived on the land for hundreds of years. ""There were about 20,000 Powhatan people there when the English arrived in Jamestown,"" Virginia Indian culture expert Karenne Wood told
She hopes that the 400th anniversary of Jamestown will help shed light on the Powhatan's story.
When Jamestown began, the English and the Powhatan tried to trade with each other peacefully, but soon fighting broke out over land and resources. Beginning in 1614, the fighting stopped for eight years when Pocahontas, a daughter of the Powhatan chief, married Englishman John Rolfe. However, the fighting quickly resumed as Jamestown expanded.
Over time, the Powhatan people lost their land to the English settlers. However, Virginia is home to many Native American descendants today. ""We have changed a lot,"" says Wood, ""but we are still here.""
Organizers at Jamestown are not calling the 400th anniversary a celebration. Why might that be?

250,532,"In the days following last month's deadly attacks, most Americans put aside their differences to show there is unity in the United States.
But some Americans acted differently. Instead of helping others, they attacked innocent Arab and Muslim Americans.
Some individuals vandalized mosques (the buildings where Muslims practice Islam, their religion). Others attacked anyone they thought looked to be from the Middle East.
Dr. Abdullah Khoui, of the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C., condemned the attacks while defending his religion.
""What took place, no sound mind would approve of it, and no religion at all in the world would accept it,"" Khoui said. ""Islam does not approve of what took place.""
Arshad Majid, of the Islamic Center of Long Island, N.Y., said that Islam promotes peace.
""We're concerned that the actions of a small number of extremists is likely to paint with a very broad brush the large population of God-fearing, peace-loving Muslims in America,"" Majid said after the attacks.
President George W. Bush agreed with the Islamic leaders. While visiting a mosque, President Bush commented on the attacks on Muslim and Arab Americans. ""That's not the America I know,"" he said. ""That should not and that will not stand in America.""
Muslims practice the religion of Islam. Islam was first preached by the prophet Muhammad about 1,400 years ago.
In the 600s, Muhammad had a dream in which Allah, the Arabic name for God, called him to be a prophet. Islam means ""submission, commitment, and peace"".
Islam teaches that human diversity, or difference, is a sign of the richness of Allah's mercy. In other words, according to religious experts, Islam promotes peace.
Those experts add that the September 11 attacks do not represent Muslim beliefs. The majority of the 1.2 billion Muslims worldwide practice peace and tolerance toward others.

251,281,"An American classic turns 50 this year--the Wiffle ball! In air, the round, hollow ball dips and curves, making it hard to hit.
The Wiffle ball's design, which has not changed since 1953, includes eight holes on one side. The idea was the brainchild of a Connecticut man who watched his 12-year-old son and a friend struggle to throw curve balls to each other.
""He decided he wanted to make a ball that would make it easier for us to pitch,"" the creator's son told
Early versions of the Wiffle ball included square holes and diamond-shaped holes. Neither of them worked.
That's how the Wiffle ball was born. Several years later, the plastic bat joined the ball.
How did the ball get its name? When you swing that plastic yellow bat and strike out, you whiff, said the creator's son.

252,661,"Take a time trip with tomorrows talking robots, dolphinlike boats, and more!
Thousands of kids recently had a sneak peek at the world of tomorrow. They experienced talking robots, underwater vehicles, and lifesize video games. These inventions were among the 150 creations at this years NextFest fair. The four-day festival was held in New York City, New York.
NextFest gave inventors a chance to unveil their latest creations. Many were right out of the lab. Others were still being developed. Here are a few of the high-tech gadgets that captured our attention.
Actroid is a robot designed to look and talk like a human.
Dont let this photo fool you! Actroid may look real, but she is actually a
or humanlike, robot. She was designed to greet and entertain people. When Actroid talks, she moves her hands and makes eye contact. Other versions of this robot are programmed to reply to hundreds of questions, such as ""What time is it?"" and ""Are you a real person?""
What is it like to live like a sea creature? The Bionic Dolphin gives people the chance to find out. The vehicle can cruise across the water at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour (mph) and then dive at least 10 feet. Its inventor, Thomas Rowe, designed the vehicle with wings to enable it to ""fly"" underwater as fast as 40 mph. ""The majority of my research was on dolphins, but where I got the most help was penguins and diving birds,"" Rowe told
The Bionic Dolphin was first designed for
or play. However, it may be used in the future to save whales entangled in nets. A larger version of the vehicle has been designed to rescue people lost at sea. ""It swallows them,"" says Rowe.
What combines music, rock climbing, and video games? Its a musical climbing wall called DigiWall. This climbing wall has interactive games based on speed, cooperation, and creativity. ""We wanted to do some kind of computer game where you are very physical,"" project leader Mats Liljedahl told
""We removed the computer screen, and instead we are using the lights and the grips."" The grips light up when they are touched.
Robonaut may help astronauts in future space missions. The robot is being designed by NASA, the U.S. space agency. The robot will ""perform tasks that up until now only astronauts could do,"" NASA engineer Roger Rovekamp told
Robonaut can operate on its own or be controlled by a human operator from Earth or in space. The operator would wear a special headset that displays live video from the cameras on the robots head. By wearing a glove with sensors, that person can control the actions of Robonauts fingers, which can hold tools as small as tweezers.
""I got to see some awesome exhibits,"" says
kid reporter Michaela Ritz. The 11-year-old was on the scene at NextFest. Along with checking out the latest gadgets, Michaela caught up with some inventors to learn more about their unique designs.
What was her favorite invention? Brainball! In this game, players wear headbands that monitor their stress levels by measuring brain waves. A computer directs a ball away from the player who is calmer.
""You needed to relax in order to get the ball into the opponents circle,"" says Michaela. ""It is a good game for relieving stress.""

253,421,"Shaquille O'Neal is happy, and it's not because he made a free throw. The basketball star is thrilled that the National Basketball Association (NBA) brought back the leather ball on January 1.
The NBA has brought back its old ball after trying out a new ball covered in synthetic material.
For the past few months, players had to use a ball covered with a synthetic, or human-made, material. Many players, including O'Neal, complained the plasticcoated basketball was a bad decision. They said the new ball didn't bounce as well as the leather ball. The new ball also cut their hands. ""The new ball is terrible,"" O'Neal, the Miami Heat center, says.
Scientists at the University of Texas at Arlington ran experiments comparing the synthetic and leather balls. The biggest difference they found was in the way the new ball absorbs moisture.
The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture than the leather ball does. That means the synthetic ball doesn't become heavier when it comes in contact with players' sweat. It also means the synthetic ball can become slippery because moisture stays on its surface, scientist Kaushik De, who helped conduct the study, told
The return of the leather ball has many NBA players jumping for joy. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us.""

254,350,"Where the Wild Things Are!: A Numbers Puzzle
Counting giant pandas in the wild is no easy task. Just ask a team of scientists who recently put their detective skills to the test.
The scientists trekked through dense forests in central China to search for clues of giant pandas. China, a country in Asia, is the only place where giant pandas live in the wild.
After spending four years in the country's mountainous region, scientists completed the largest
of giant pandas ever done. A census is a population count.
The results of the census surprised scientists! They counted about 1,600 giant pandas living in the wild in China. That is double the number originally thought to live there. ""We found giant pandas living in areas we didn't know had any,"" scientist Colby Loucks told
Although the news is hopeful, Loucks and other scientists are quick to point out that giant pandas still need protection. They are among the most
animals. That means there are very few left in the wild.
Human activity is the main reason the pandas are threatened. Their
, or home, is being destroyed as people cut down trees to get wood and to make farmland.
Giant pandas must eat a lot of bamboo to get the nutrients they need. Pandas spend up to 14 hours a day eating bamboo, because it is not very nutritious.
, or go into a long sleep, in the winter, because they can't store up enough fat on a bamboo diet.
A newborn panda weighs between 3 and 5 ounces and is about the size of a stick of butter.
Each front paw on a panda has an extra wrist bone that acts like a thumb to help the panda grasp bamboo shoots.
Scientists needed to collect clues to count pandas because the shy creatures are hard to spot in their natural environment. ""Giant pandas are very hard to see in the wild,"" said Loucks. ""They hide in the thick
Bamboo provides giant pandas with their main source of food. Each animal consumes about 80 pounds of this plant's stems and leaves a day.
In fact, the giant pandas' survival is linked to eating bamboo. If bamboo disappears in an area, giant pandas there risk starvation.
To collect clues, scientists combined the latest technology with old-fashioned tracking skills. Each time they spotted a clue, such as a panda paw print in the mud or fur on the bark of a tree, they entered their finding into a computer. Computer mapping helped them pinpoint the locations of the giant pandas.
How will the census results help protect pandas? Scientists hope their findings will lead to the creation of more
for giant pandas. Nature reserves are areas of forest that are protected from development. Currently, China has 40 nature reserves.
""Pandas live in the same place as other animals,"" said Loucks. ""If we conserve the panda habitat, we conserve [the habitat of other animals] too.""
Why is it important for scientists to track endangered animals?

255,710,"Alhaji Babah Sawane was only 10 years old when a rebel group kidnapped him in his African country of Sierra Leone. Taken from his family, he was forced to learn how to fire a rifle. He fought in an army for the next two and a half years.
Peacekeepers from the United Nations (U.N.) helped to free Alhaji. In 2001, he addressed the U.N., asking that organization to help children around the world who are forced to fight in war zones.
""We ask this body on behalf of Sierra Leone to do all they can to bring our sad story to an end,"" he said. ""We want to be able to move about freely in all parts of the country.""
Sierra Leone is just one of an estimated 41 countries around the world that use child soldiers. While the most offenses occur in Africa and Asia, the problem also exists in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East.
Most children who become soldiers come from very poor countries. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers estimates that 300,000 children are fighting as soldiers. In some countries, boys and girls as young as 8 years old are being recruited, or called upon, to fight.
Protecting children in war and conflict zones has become a top job for the United Nations. And the U.N. has made significant progress. In a report issued in December 2002, the U.N. named 28 governments and armed groups that use children to fight their battles.
International law prohibits countries from using children who are younger than 15 years old in combat. However, several U.N. conventions condemn, or do not approve of, having anyone under 18 serve as a soldier. If a country recruits child soldiers, it is violating, or breaking the rule of, international agreements.
Why us it important for governments around the world to protect children?
The U.N. wants to save children like Alhaji Babah Sawane from suffering. The report sends a strong message to governments everywhere: They will be held accountable for their actions.

256,635,"The Sequel of Tut and His Treasures
Hollywood is used to rolling out the red carpet for celebrities. Now it has laid out the carpet once again for its latest starKing Tutankhamun (too-tahn-KAHmun). The famous Egyptian king's treasures are traveling the country in a new exhibit, now open in Los Angeles. The tour will make stops in three other U.S. cities before returning to Egypt in 2007. ""
King Tut and his treasures first visited the United States in the 1970s. That display attracted a whopping 8 million visitors. The new exhibit looks at what life was like for Tut and other
who ruled ancient Egypt more than 3,500 years ago. A pharaoh is an ancient Egyptian ruler.
After the death of his father, King Tut became pharaoh at just 9 years old. Tut reigned for about nine years before he died mysteriously. He was buried in a hidden tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, an area near the Nile River.
Tut's tomb remained locked away until 1922, when British
Howard Carter made one of history's greatest finds. An archaeologist is a person who digs up ancient ruins and studies the past. The long-lost tomb contained Tut's
, or preserved body. The mummy was buried inside three gold coffins within a
, or stone coffin. A mask of solid gold rested over the mummy's face.
Glistening riches filled King Tut's tomb. They included statues, jewelry, weapons, the king's golden throne and other furniture, and even childhood games. The ancient Egyptians believed in the
. They buried their dead with many items they believed could be used in life after death.
Although Tut's mask and mummy are too fragile to be removed from Egypt, some of Carter's other fascinating finds are on display in the latest exhibit. ""
"". One of the treasures, a wooden figure of the boy king, is the first object that visitors see when they enter the exhibit. In the darkened room, a light shines on the wooden figure. The figure is depicted without Tut's famous gold or jewels.
""Not only does [the figure] show Tut's majesty, but it also shows his human side,"" Egyptian expert David Silverman told
""You can see a young boy behind those eyes.""
The exhibit also includes the boy king's crown and gold dagger. The dagger was found strapped to the mummy's thigh. Scientists believe that Tut's subjects buried their king with the dagger to fight villains on his journey to the afterlife. Objects that belonged to Tut's family members and other Egyptian royalty are also featured at the exhibit.
, or follow-up, exhibit different from the one that visited the United States in the 1970s? ""The first exhibit was about the discovery of the tomb,"" Silverman told
""This exhibition is about the life of the young kinghis family, his history, his responsibilities.""
The wealth of objects discovered in the young king's tomb leads scientists to wonder what might have been contained in the tombs of other pharaohs. Those tombs, unlike Tut's, were
, or robbed, long ago. As Silverman says, ""Egypt continues to fascinate.""
King Tut's showstopping exhibit includes more than 130
. An artifact is a human-made object. Only 13 of those artifacts were included in the last Tut tour in the 1970s. Most have never before left Egypt.
as a crown. The crown depicts a vulture and a cobra, for protection in the afterlife.

in the shape of an ankh, an Egyptian symbol of life, was buried with Tut.
held Tut's liver, which Egyptians believed would be needed in the afterlife. Canopic jars are special containers used to hold the preserved organs of the dead. A peek inside shows rows of ancient Egyptian writing.
Why might King Tut's tomb have been the only royal burial chamber not damaged by thieves?

to thank. The rovers--each the size of a golf cart--successfully touched down on opposite sides of the Red Planet in January.
Now NASA scientists have even more reason to celebrate. They recently announced that
found hard evidence that Mars' dry surface was once ""soaking wet.""
""We have concluded the rocks here were once soaked in liquid water,"" said NASA scientist Steve Squyres. The finding is important to scientists because clues of water could mean that life once existed on Mars.
Both rovers are equipped with instruments to help scientists study the rocks. Each rover has a robotic arm that drills into the rocks and cameras that snap photographs.
detected minerals called sulfates in the rocks. Sulfates form in the presence of water. The rover also found ""blueberries"" scattered throughout the rock.
Blueberries are what NASA calls small balls of mineral that can form in water or be created by a volcano. Because Mars' blueberries are mixed in the rock instead of sprinkled on top, scientists believe that the blueberries were formed by water, not volcanoes.
Now that scientists have received postcards from the Red Planet, when will the care package arrive? NASA has tentatively planned an unmanned mission to Mars about ten years from now that will bring back rocks for scientists to study.

258,188,"When I stepped inside the old Mission Control room at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, I felt like a kid again. Even though the computers had long been shut off, I knew I was experiencing a piece of history.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) used this control room when the United States first sent humans to the moon. The room also served as the center for dozens of other space missions.
""This room was used from the Gemini missions all the way through to the space shuttle in the early 1990s,"" said NASA's Gary Kitmacher, my guide.
The Gemini missions took place in the mid-1960s. Their goal was to prepare humans to land on the moon.
My tour brought back many memories. I remember watching Neil Armstrong take ""one giant leap for mankind"" on my parent's television. In 1969, Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon.
A year later, I was glued to the television again. This time, scientists in this very room were trying to figure out how to get the astronauts of Apollo 13 back home when an oxygen tank exploded aboard their craft.
In the same building as the old Mission Control room is the new Mission Control room. Here, scientists keep tabs on the International Space Station (ISS) that orbits above Earth.
When I was a kid, I dreamed of walking on the moon. Walk-ing through Johnson Space Center--some 30 years later--is the next best thing.
The Saturn V rocket used to launch astronauts to the moon is located outside Johnson Space Center in Houston.
In 1965, the Gemini 7 spacecraft makes its historic mission.
Sixteen countries, including the United States, are building the International Space Station.

259,485,"Photography did not exist in George Washington's lifetime. So how do we know what he looked like? Recently, a team of experts led by scientist Jeffrey Schwartz used historical
or clues, to build a statue of Washington at age 45. Here's how the team did it.
 The team began by scanning this mold of Washington's face into a computer. A sculptor had made the mold of the 53-year-old Washington's face in 1785. Washington's
or false teeth, showed the shape of his mouth.
 Once the team had an idea of what Washington's face looked like at age 53, sculptors re-created the face to show what it would have looked like at age 45. The nose and ears continue to grow during adulthood, so those features were sculpted smaller.
 Painters added color to the statue based on historical documents that depict Washington with pale skin and grayish blue eyes.
 The statue was placed in an exhibit that shows Washington leading his troops during the long winter at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in 1777.
If you could join a team of scientists in re-creating a historical figure, which person would you choose? Why?

260,494,". If you think those words are spoken only by adults who wear suits and work on Wall Street, think again. Some of today's investors wear baggy pants and T-shirts and ride skateboards. In other words, they're kids! About 5 million U.S. kids ages 12 to 17 don't just stash their money in piggy banks or savings accounts. They invest in the stock market.
A stock market is a place to buy and sell
of stock in all kinds of companies. Owning a share of stock means you own a small piece of a company. The more shares you own, the more of a company you own.
, or use their money to buy stocks, in the stock market are called
. If a company makes money, it may pay investors
, or some of the company's profits. Another way investors make money is by selling their shares of stock at a price higher than the price they paid when they bought shares of the company's stock.
Making money in the stock market may seem easy, but it's risky. Investors can lose money when a stock's price drops.
That's why financial experts say kids should learn about a company before investing in it. One expert suggests that kids start by investing in companies that make products they use.
Eric Olson, age 17, has been investing since he was 13 years old. He says kids should ""read everything on investing--books, magazine articles, the business pages of [the] newspaper."" As kids read, investing will be easier to understand, Eric said.

261,245,"First built more than 2,000 years ago, the Great Wall of China is one of the greatest wonders of the world. Recently, Chinese officials announced that the Great Wall is greater than ever.
Officials had believed that the Great Wall was 4,160 miles long. But they recently discovered another 310-mile section of the wall at its western end. The wall now measures 4,470 miles long. That's equal to the distance from Miami, Florida, to the North Pole!
Most of the wall is made of brick. The newly discovered section, however, is made of sandstone and branches.
The Great Wall was originally built to protect China from invaders. It was built in sections and rebuilt many times. As many as three million people worked on the first section of the wall.

262,679,"This will be a very different school year for Rand Amir. The fifth grader is among millions of schoolchildren who went back to school in Iraq in early October.
On the first day of school, Rand said, her classmates ripped out pictures of Saddam Hussein from their textbooks. Saddam is the former president of Iraq. The students tossed the pages out the window, yelling ""Bye, bye, Saddam.""
That was not an unusual sight at some schools throughout this war-torn country. Saddam's government was toppled in April. At that time, U.S.-led forces took control of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.
During Saddam's rule, teachers were forced to mention him in every lesson, from history to music to gym class. Students even learned math by adding 4 + 28. That's because April 28 is Saddam's birthday. Now schools are erasing Saddam's image and teachings from their lessons.
Iraqi officials are rewriting the country's textbooks. That will give students the opportunity to learn new ideas about the world.
The new textbooks, which will arrive this month, don't include any references praising Saddam. Pictures of Saddam have been removed from classrooms. Students are no longer forced to chant ""Long live our leader, Saddam"" during their classes.
Despite the changes, U.S. soldiers report that many of Iraq's schools are in various states of
, or poor condition. Although many schools were failing before the war began, many more schools were destroyed or seriously damaged during the fighting.
Some schools have broken windows and doors and are still without electricity or running water. Some lack chalkboards, desks, and other much-needed furniture and supplies.
The good news is that help is on the way for teachers and students. U.S. soldiers and aid groups are helping rebuild many of the run-down schools, restoring water and electricity.
They are also providing children with school supplies that Americans have donated. One 9-year-old Iraqi student was all smiles as soldiers unloaded boxes of new crayons, markers, book bags, and other donated supplies.
Despite the challenges, the new school year offers a fresh start for many teachers and children. ""Memories of the war are still fresh, but we shall go past that,"" said one teacher in Iraq. ""[The students] will be safer now.""
A fourth-grade class in Maine is reaching out to schoolchildren in Iraq. The students are collecting notebooks, colored pencils, rulers, and other supplies to send to Iraq.
that he hopes the care packages will improve the lives of schoolchildren in Iraq. His classmate Maddie Brochu feels the same way. ""They don't have very much at their schools,"" she said.
The project is close to their teacher's heart. Barbara Winslow's two sons serve in the U.S. military in Baghdad. Winslow told
that donating the supplies helps her students make a personal connection with children in another culture.
Why is it important to be able to think and learn freely?
The class also made a picture book and wrote a message of friendship. The message was translated into Arabic and included in each box. Arabic is the official language of Iraq. ""We hope we can reach out in friendship and make a difference,"" said Winslow.

264,31,"visits India and finds hope after tragedy
A year after the devastating tsunami that hit southern Asia, rebuilding efforts continue in full force.
Each day, 10-year-old Sarjm walks through the hot sand and past
the rubble where homes used to stand. He can see and even taste the ocean. The ocean used to make him happy. It provided fishermen like his father a way of making a living.
But on December 26, 2004, the ocean turned black and changed his village. It left behind destruction and fear. A memorial outside his school is a constant reminder of the 49 schoolchildren who lost their lives in the tsunami that struck on that date.
Debris of beach resorts washed away in the December 26 Indian Ocean tsunami at Khao Lak, Thailand, seen December 30.
The young boy talks about how his older brother and younger sister were both ""taken by the black wave."" Clapping his hands together, he told
Sadly, it is a story shared by thousands of other children. Sarjm lives in Kottapalli, a fishing village located at the southernmost tip of India. India was one of 12 countries devastated by last years tsunamione of the worst natural disasters in history. The series of gigantic waves, which resulted from an undersea earthquake, flattened coastlines and reduced fishing villages to rubble. More than 280,000 people died.
Now, one year later, many people are still homeless. But slowly, smiles are returning, and laughter once again rings through some of the fishing villages. Relief agencies have been working to help rebuild homes, schools, and lives with donations from people around the world.
Some of those donations came from American students who
or came together, to raise money to help people affected by the tsunami. From schools in small towns to those in big cities, students held bake-a-thons, participated in read-a-thons, and even sold their own belongings at garage sales. The pennies, quarters, and dollars are helping rebuild homes and bringing hope to children whose hearts and lives were shattered.
Nine-year-old Selso, who lives in a fishing village near Sarjms village, was one of those children. Before the tsunami destroyed his home, Selso, his sister, and his three brothers had never had a toilet or electricity in their house. Their house had only two rooms, and at night they all slept together on the dirt floor. ""We knew people who died, but my family was lucky,"" Selso told Weekly Reader. ""We only lost our home.""
Selsos mother used to worry about scorpions and snakes getting inside, but now all that has changed. Volunteers from Habitat for Humanity worked with Selsos family to construct a new home with electricity and plumbing. Habitat for Humanity volunteers build homes with families who have suffered. The organization plans to build 10,000 homes in the area during the next two years. ""This is the happiest day for my family,"" says Selsos dad, Michel. ""My children now have a safe, dry home where they can do their homework.""
With the help of relief agencies, some schools have also opened. Many are housed in temporary locations under thatched roofs. Classrooms are also beginning to receive textbooks and other much-needed supplies.
""When a school opens in a disaster zone, everyone feels a sense of hope,"" said Carol Bellamy, the executive director of the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), after the disaster. The U.S. Agency for International Development is another organization that has helped build playgrounds where children can enjoy new equipment.
As rebuilding efforts continue, many children remain terrified of the ocean. Volunteers have worked with Sarjm and other kids to talk about what happened. ""I was afraid to go back to the ocean,"" Sarjm says, ""but we were taught that the tsunami was very rare and would not happen again. I am not afraid to look at the water anymore.""
Why is it important to feel safe? What makes you feel safe at home? at school?
After the tsunami, countries in southern Asia began to put together a plan for a warning system in the Indian Ocean. Earlier this year, the U.S. government also announced a plan to improve the U.S. warning system by 2007. Under the plan, the number of devices that monitor waves from a tsunami will be increased. The warning system would provide an alert for U.S. coasts ""within minutes, and in some cases, within seconds of a tsunamis formation,"" according to scientist John Marburger.

265,387,"recently told you about some problems manatees face. A poll found that most Florida voters want more done to protect manatees. The poll found that at least 65 percent of Florida's voters favor new steps that would help protect the endangered manatees. Some of those steps include lowering the speed limit for boats in manatee zones, increasing fines for people who speed in manatee zones, limiting the amount of building along waterways where manatees are found, and creating additional protected areas for manatees.
""We are struck by [how far] Florida voters are willing to go to protect manatees,"" said Kate Stewart, who conducted the poll. She said the results also showed that ""boaters and non-boaters alike not just support but strongly support increased protection measures.""
Florida manatees live in the state's warm coastal and inland waters. The Save the Manatee Club says that the Florida manatee population has been shrinking since 1974, when scientists started keeping track.
Collisions with boats cause many manatee deaths. Since manatees swim slowly, they cannot get out of the way of a fast-moving boat. According to the Save the Manatee Club, 78 manatees were killed in collisions with boats in Florida waters last year. So far this year, at least 23 manatees have been killed in collisions.

266,134,"Kim Corbin of California skips everywhere she goes. She skips to work, she skips to the store, and she skips home. As she skips around town, Corbin shouts, ""Skippers, skip on!""
Corbin got hooked on skipping in April 1999 when she began skipping with a friend. As she skipped, she thought, ""This is happiness.""
Since that time, Corbin has founded her own organization dedicated to getting people to skip. So far, 1,000 people in 32 cities have become skipping enthusiasts.
Soon, Corbin will skip into classrooms across the United States. She plans to take her message that skipping is a fun and healthful activity to school-children in 38 states.
Corbin says skipping can be part of an exercise program. She wants to get kids and their parents to skip and do other exercises together. Corbin has lost 25 pounds since she started skipping two years ago.
Corbin says that she makes skipping into a game. ""Just sneak in five steps wherever you are, and no one is even going to notice it,"" she advised.

267,276,"Scientists have given new meaning to the words ""jet speed."" In early March, a NASA jet set a new record for speed.
The unpiloted X-43A jet flew nearly 5,000 miles per hour. That is equal to seven times the speed of sound. The aircraft made a 10-second powered flight and then glided for six minutes before plunging into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.
Before taking off on its own, the jet launched from the wing of a plane in midair.
A rocket, which was later released, helped boost the jet's speed.
""Everything worked according to plan. It's been wonderful,"" said NASA's Leslie Williams. ""We've been waiting a few years.""
NASA attempted to fly a similar unmanned jet three years earlier. However, a failure in the launch system caused the flight to explode.
In 1947, American pilot Chuck Yeager became the first person to fly at

268,254,"When thousands of baseball fans head to ballparks this summer, chances are theyll have trouble reciting the words to our national anthem. Two out of three Americans dont know the words to ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" according to a recent Harris Poll.
As a result, the National Anthem Project, spearheaded by music educators, is dedicated to reteaching people the words to Americas official song. A crosscountry campaign kicked off in January and is currently touring cities in the West from Los Angeles to Seattle.
The tour includes interactive exhibits and a singing contest. In each location, the singer who belts out the best version of the national anthem wins a $1,000 donation to a school music education program of his or her choice. In Richmond, Virginia, an 11-yearold boy took home the top prize.
Why dont people know the words to our countrys most famous tune? ""We see it as a consequence that music education programs are being diminished in schools,"" project spokesperson Elizabeth Lasko told
""[People who do] know the words say they learned them in school.""
or end, in Baltimore, Maryland, at Fort McHenry on September 14. That date and that place are when and where Francis Scott Key penned the poem that later became the national anthem.
According to the National Anthem Project, the song represents our countrys history and culture. Many people sing it at community events.
""We want people to know the words so they sing it together,"" says Lasko. ""If youre taught as a young person to sing it, youll always be able to sing it."" For more information on the National Anthem Project and tour cities, visit
During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote the poem that later became the national anthem.
On September 13, 1814, Key watched British ships bomb Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. The next morning, he spotted the American flag still flying over the fort. The sight inspired him to write the poem. In 1931, Congress made it the national anthem.
Here is the first verse of the four-verse song:
O say, can you see, by the dawns early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilights last
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through
     the perilous fight,
Oer the ramparts we watched, were so
     gallantly streaming?
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting
     in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was
     still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
Oer the land of the free, and the home of the

269,684,"Polar bears reign as the kings of the Arctic. Yet there is trouble underfoot for those snow-colored creatures and other wildlife as their icy habitat slips away.
The Arctic is the icy, cold region located around the North Pole. In November, scientists from eight countries released a report saying that the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of Earth.
In the report, scientists predict that at least half of the summer sea ice in the Arctic will melt by the end of this century. The scientists blame
for the Arctic thaw. That is the gradual rise in Earth's temperature.
Arctic ice is melting at an alarming rate. Winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen between 4 and 7 degrees Fahrenheit. During the past 30 years, polar bears have lost more than 386,000 square miles of ice--an area larger than the states of Texas and Arizona combined.
More than 20,000 polar bears live in the Arctic regions. Disappearing sea ice threatens polar bears and other cold-weather animals. Polar bears use the ice as a bridge to hunt seals, their primary source of food.
As the sea ice disappears, the mighty
, or hunters, catch fewer seals and risk starvation. Seals also depend on the ice to rest and give birth. Scientists fear that polar bears, seals, and other animals that rely on the ice could be wiped out by the end of the century if the warm-up continues.
Some of the 4 million people who live in the Arctic have also found themselves on shaky ground. As the frozen land thaws, buildings and roads have weakened.
Inuits (IH-nyoo-wets), a group of native people in the region, fish and hunt Arctic animals, including polar bears. They depend on those animals as their main source of food. Inuit hunters are also falling through thinning ice.
Rising sea levels have forced some people in the Arctic to move their coastal villages inland. The report warns that melting ice could cause sea levels to continue to rise--up to 3 feet by the end of this century. Towns and cities along coastlines around the world could flood as a result.
The warm-up also affects other parts of the planet. Arctic ice and snow reflect heat from the sun into space. Without the ice and snow, the planet would be much warmer. ""The polar regions are essentially the Earth's air conditioner,"" said scientist Michael McCracken.
Who cranked up the thermostat on the Arctic? Scientists say human activity is to blame for global warming. People use
, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to power cars, heat homes, and create electricity.
Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Burning those fuels gives off gases that trap heat from the sun and add to the overheating of the Earth.
To protect life in the Arctic, scientists say people need to limit their use of fossil fuels. ""Climate change is not just about the future,"" said scientist Pal Prestud, who worked on the report. ""It is happening now.""
The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Those gases collect in a layer and trap heat from the sun. The layer of gases is like the windows in a greenhouse. The process is called the
Too much of those gases in the air causes temperatures to rise. That is known as
What are some ways people can reduce their need for fossil fuels?

271,406,"Imagine having time for a game of chess in between your math and social studies lessons. It's not as surprising as you would think. Chess is catching on in elementary schools across the country. Students at Sky Oaks Elementary School in Burnsville, Minnesota, learn chess as part of the curriculum. ""It's fun to play,"" said Alex Powell, a fourth-grade student at Sky Oaks.
Chess is a game of skill between two players. It likely began during the 7th century in India. The object of the game is to
, or trap, the other person's king.
Studies show that playing chess sharpens critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. ""It helps kids with their schoolwork,"" said Alex's teacher, Ray Nyberg. ""They have to think and be analytical.""
Principal Patrick Flinn says that Sky Oaks has been teaching chess sessions to students for more than 15 years.

272,122,"In October, a colorful object blazed through the sky over several states. Hundreds of people in Colorado, Utah, and Idaho saw the bright light. Many of them called local authorities to report what they saw.
""We've gotten several reports of [a] brilliant white light the size of a basketball with blue flames turning to orange,"" said one police official.
The people had seen an unidentified flying object, or UFO. Many people think that UFOs are spacecraft from other planets. Actually, a
is anything that you see in the sky and cannot identify. Usually, even the most mysterious UFOs are eventually explained.
Experts say the UFO seen in October was most likely a meteor, or space rock streaking through Earth's atmosphere. Other UFO sightings, however, remain a mystery.
For years, the U.S government has been studying UFO sightings. Much of the information that the government has gathered on UFOs is top-secret.
Now a new group wants the government to tell everyone what it knows about UFOs. The group is called the Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFI).
""It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the real nature of this phenomenon,"" said John Podesta. Podesta is a former White House official and a CFI member.
The members of CFI asked the government to release information about specific UFO sightings. One such sighting happened in December 1965.
On that cold night, people in western Pennsylvania saw a bright light streak through the sky. The light looked liked it crashed behind some hills.
The mysterious object might have been a rock from space. A space rock that crashes into Earth is called a meteorite. However, several witnesses claimed that soldiers searched the area where the object ""crashed."" They say the soldiers loaded a car-sized object onto a truck, placed a tarp over the object, and drove it away-never to be seen again.
The members of CFI claim that the U.S. government has never released information about the sighting and the object. ""We can't come up with a reason why this information is being withheld. The government won't even acknowledge that the incident took place, but we know that it did,"" said one CFI member.
For now, the exact nature of some UFOs remains a mystery. CFI members hope that the answer lies in secret government papers. They say they are only searching for the truth and they want everyone to know the truth.

275,203,"The Mayon volcano in the Philippines has roared dangerously to life. A
is an opening in Earths surface through which molten rock, ash, and other materials blast out. Volcanoes erupt because of a buildup of heat and pressure deep within Earth. Volcanoes occur where Earths plates push together or pull apart.
For weeks, Mayon has threatened thousands of people who live near the volcano. Repeated eruptions of hot ash and fiery lava have destroyed crops and forests. Experts warn that more violent eruptions could happen at any time.
Mayon is the most active volcano in the Philippines. Scientists consider a volcano active if it has erupted within the last 10,000 years. A dormant volcano is ""sleeping"" but is expected to erupt in the future. An extinct volcano is not expected to erupt again.

An expedition to the Arctic has uncovered a giant sea reptile.
Scientists have discovered the skeleton of a sea monster near the North Pole. Researchers from Oslo, Norway, recently announced that they have found a complete
skeleton. A plesiosaur is a prehistoric marine reptile about the size of a bus. The recent discovery is believed to be the first complete plesiosaur skeleton ever found.
during an expedition to the Svalbard islands, 300 miles off the coast of Norway, in August. Fossils are the remains of plants or animals from millions of years ago preserved in rock.
The meat-eating reptile lived more than 150 million years ago, during the Jurassic Period. Some scientists call it the
of the sea. ""We think it is [a 26-foot] skeleton from snout to tail,"" team leader Jorn Hurum told
He described the plesiosaurs long teeth as being ""the size of bananas.""
The expedition also uncovered fossils from 27 other marine reptiles on the islands. ""We hope to find lots more in the years to come,"" says Hurum. ""We have just scratched the surface.""

Ready, set, plant! Nearly a million tree lovers
planted more than 500,000 trees on 2,137 miles of highway in the Philippines last month. (
means ""at the same time."") Planters were given 30 minutes to place their trees in the ground.
""This morning, we planted trees all over the
the biggest number of trees planted at one time in the history of the world,"" declared Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who took part in the planting. An archipelago is a group of islands.
The ""Green Philippine Highways"" project aims to improve air quality in the Asian nation. The Philippines has the second most polluted air among eight Southeast Asian countries polled, according to a recent study.
are substances discharged into the air from motor vehicles and factories. Emissions account for 70 percent of air pollution in the Philippines. Experts say it takes at least 10 trees to soak up the emissions from a single vehicle.
The current record for most trees planted at a single time is 300,587, set in 2005 by 16,317 people in India. Arroyo, however, is confident her countrys massive planting is in position to break the record. ""We will probably make it to the Guinness [World] Records,"" she says.

278,34,"Five California condors died last summer in Arizona's arid backcountry.
A condor's wingspan is 9.5 feet across. That's about as wide as two kids lying down head to toe.
Wildlife experts say the condors did not die from the heat. Instead, the experts believe the huge birds died from lead poisoning. They say the condors had swallowed lead shotgun pellets.
, which means they eat the remains of dead animals. The condors probably ate the remains of an animal that had been shot by a hunter. As they ate the dead animal's flesh, the birds ate the deadly pellets.
If swallowed, lead can make an animal sick or cause death. Lead stops the body from making red blood cells. It can also damage an animal's organs, including the brain and liver.
The five poisoned birds were among 35 condors that have been released in Arizona since 1996. The release program has cost millions of dollars.
After the dead condors were found, wildlife experts recaptured and tested the 16 birds left in the Arizona group. All the birds were healthy and were soon released.
Members of the Peregrine Fund have been releasing and watching the condors set free in Arizona. Jeff Cilek, of the Peregrine Fund, told
that saving California condors is important. ""Condors are good for the environment. They [eat] dead animals,"" Cilek said.
California condors are among the world's largest birds. A hundred years ago, the birds were found in many parts of the United States. Today, the condor is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's list of endangered species. That means the number of California condors is so low they all could disappear someday.
Why are scavengers an important part of the food chain?
Peregrine Fund officials say there are 150 California condors left on Earth. Forty-eight of those birds are living in the wild; the rest are in zoos.
Although the loss of five birds is a ""serious setback,"" Cilek said his group is looking to the future. Peregrine Fund officials recently announced plans to release 12 more California condors in Arizona this winter.

279,26,"Gary Gero says he has the best job in the world. As one of Hollywood's top animal trainers, Gero prepares his animal ""talent"" for their onscreen performances.
Recently, Gero completed work for the movie
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
, which opens in theaters June 4. His team, which included six trainers for this movie, worked with dozens of animals. Their lineup for the film included cats, dogs, owls, rats, crows-and even a hippo!

To train the animals, Gero and his team reward them with food and praise when they follow instructions correctly. Owls may get a reputation for being wise, but Gero knows differently. Gero told
that Hedwig learned to fly in front of a fan-a trick that was mastered after six months of training.
""Owls are difficult to train because they're not very clever,"" he said. ""It takes a long time to teach them things.""

280,681,"Iraq's new government prepares for the future.
Women line up to vote in the southern Iraqi city of Basra January 30, in the country's first freely contested elections since 1954.
The government in Iraq has started the process of choosing leaders and drafting a constitution, now that the election is over. On January 30, millions of Iraqis voted, braving violence and threats of attack in the country's first national election in 50 years.
On that historic day, voters elected 275 leaders to the National Assembly, Iraq's lawmaking body. The assembly recently chose a president and two vice presidents. At press time, those leaders were selecting a prime minister, the most powerful position in Iraq.
Bringing peace and lasting democracy to Iraq will be a challenge for the country's temporary government. Different ethnic and religious groups in Iraq want a voice in the government. The assembly is made up of three groups: Shiites (SHEE-ights), Sunnis (SOON-eez), and Kurds.
The majority of Iraqis are Muslims, who practice the religion Islam. The Muslims are divided into two groupsShiites and Sunnis. The two groups have a long history of tension. Most Muslims in Iraq are Shiites, but the Sunnis were in control when the former dictator Saddam Hussein was in power. Many Sunnis did not vote in the recent election as a way to
Shiites hold the most seats in the National Assembly, and a Shiite leader is expected to be named prime minister. A Kurdish leader was elected as the nation's president. Both a Shiite and a Sunni were elected as vice presidents.
Despite the challenges, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the first meeting of the assembly ""an important step"" for Iraq. The assembly's main task is to write a new constitution by August 15. Once that is approved by the Iraqis, a permanent government will be elected.

281,324,"The results are in for the backpack survey. At the beginning of the school year, we asked you how much weight you carry in your backpack. Nearly 3,500 of you responded to our online poll.
Health experts recommend that kids not carry more than 15 percent of their body weight.

282,9,"For years, scientists have known about a group of icy objects, called
, in our solar system. They circle the sun between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus. Scientists thought centaurs were made of ice and were almost completely smooth. But recent photos of one of those objects, named Asbolus 8405, are proving scientists wrong.
Rather than finding a smooth surface, scientists discovered a crater near one end of Asbolus 8405. And centaurs are not made entirely of ice, either. Scientists saw material inside the crater that did not look like frozen water. Some scientists now say centaurs are made of a mixture of water, methane, and ammonia ice.
Asbolus 8405 formed when the solar system first formed, scientists say. They hope that the object will help them learn more about what the solar system was like when it first formed.

283,467,"How will a growing U.S. population affect the countrys future?
The United States is about to reach a huge milestone. The population will hit 300 million sometime in late October, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The estimate is based on a running total of births, deaths, and the number of people moving in and out of the country.
""[The 300 million mark] is like a birthday. Its a number that gives us an opportunity to see where weve been and think about where we want to go,"" scientist Howard Hogan of the U.S. Census Bureau told
Its been almost 40 years since the U.S. population hit the 200 million mark. The country has added about 2.8 million people each year. On average, a baby is born every eight seconds in the United States.

Hispanic Heritage Month is September 15 to October 15.
Hispanic Americans are the fastest-growing minority group in the United States. Nearly 43 million Hispanic Americans live in the country, reports the U.S. Census Bureau. They are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries.
To honor Hispanic traditions and history, Americans celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. It began on September 15. That date marks the anniversary of independence for Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.
During Hispanic Heritage Month, many Americans will take part in festivals and parades. Students across the country will also spend the month learning how people of Hispanic heritage have added to our countrys history.
WR News / U.S. Census Bureau, July 2005
The number of people being born isnt the only thing pushing up the numbers. Immigrantsboth legal and illegalaccount for about 40 percent of the population increase. An
is a person who comes from one country to live in a new country. Many immigrants come to the United States in search of freedom or a better life for themselves and their families.
Illegal immigrants have been a topic of debates throughout the country this past year. Congress is currently working on changing immigration laws to tighten the countrys borders. The laws may also give many illegal immigrants a chance to become citizens. A
is a person who is a member of a country.
With the 300 million milestone getting closer, more people are discussing the issue of illegal immigration, along with other aspects of the countrys future. For some, the population growth means more power.
Others argue that a bigger population means more traffic jams, fewer jobs, and a strain on natural resources. For example, more people could lead to
Deforestation occurs when farmers and loggers cut down trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads.
""Population growth and change brings opportunities and challenges,"" says Hogan. ""At the Census Bureau, we provide information. ... Thats when weve done our job.""
In what ways might population growth affect your community?

284,478,"Snakehead fish and other invasive species threaten the environment.
Scientists were conducting a study of fish at Meadow Lake in New York City. To their horror, they found a fish with a long body, a snakelike head, and razor-sharp teeth. They counted another and another, until there were five in all. At that point, they knew they had a problem.
Snakehead fish can slither over land from one body of water to another and can breathe air. They dine greedily and can clear a pond of all its fish. They are among the hundreds of
that currently threaten environments in the United States.
An invasive species is a plant or an animal that does not belong in the area in which it is living. Many invasive species lack
in their new environments. Predators are animals that hunt other animals. Although invasive species don't damage their own environments, they can cause massive destruction when they invade another area.
Snakehead fish arrived in the United States from China and Korea, most likely as pets. When their owners no longer wanted them, they threw the fish into nearby lakes and streams. Snakehead fish now live in several states, from Maryland to California.
Snakehead fish aren't the only accidental arrivals. In the Great Lakes region, fingernail-sized zebra mussels hitchhiked from Russia in the water tanks of ships. Now the mussels clog pipes that provide drinking water to homes and schools.
In Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, young emerald ash borers have killed more than 6 million trees. These beetles likely arrived from China in wood packing material carried in ships or airplanes.
And in Hawaii, tiny coqui (koh-KEE) frogs are now a huge problem. The frogs hitched a ride to the ""Aloha State"" in a plant shipment from Puerto Rico. The noisy frogs produce a piercing sound that keeps people awake at night.
Scientists in New York are trying to control the snakehead fish population by increasing the salt levels in the lake. Snakeheads can't survive in salty water.
Robert Wiese of the Fort Worth Zoo also advises people not to release unwanted pets into the wild, which is especially a problem with tropical fish that are put into rivers and lakes. Invasive species, like snakehead fish, disrupt
An ecosystem is a group of plants and animals that live together in the same area.
""Our natural ecosystems are the primary source of our food and drinking water,"" scientist Lisa Gould told
. ""Ecosystems help keep our air clean. They give us medicines. Without them, we could not exist for long.""

The young beetles chomp through the inner bark of ash trees, destroying the tunnels inside that move water from the roots to the leaves.
Coqui frogs have an appetite for Hawaii's insects and are leaving nothing for many endangered birds in the area. To hear these ear-piercing frogs, visit
Each year, a female zebra mussel can lay 30,000 to 100,000 eggs. When those eggs hatch, the baby mussels gobble up food and oxygen, leaving nothing for other underwater creatures.

Spot Fetcher Bush, one of the dogs, should feel right at home in the White House. She was born there in 1989. Spot's mother was Millie. Millie belonged to Bush's parents, former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara.
The Bushes' other dog, Barney, also has political connections. Christine Todd Whitman, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, gave Barney to the Bush family.

286,287,"Erin Beth Turner of West Hartford, Connecticut, was among the millions of kids who bought
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
this summer. After buying her copy, the 10-year-old told
, ""I'll read it until I go to bed, and finish it in a few days.""
The four Harry Potter books, by J.K. Rowling, are popular all over the world. More than 35 million copies have been sold. They have also been translated into 30 languages.
Although many kids say they love reading about Harry, some critics say the books aren't good for kids.
Many teachers say that their students don't read enough. So teachers are thrilled that many kids spend their free time reading Harry Potter books. Educators say reading helps kids do better in school. ""I know my kids aren't missing out on their reading,"" said Gillian Williams, an elementary school principal in New York City. ""They're reading Harry Potter.""
The books also teach kids new words. Megan LeMay, 10, of West Hartford, told
that as she reads, ""I write new words down and look them up in a dictionary.""
Although Harry has cast a spell on kids, some people fear it's an evil spell. The school board in Zeeland, Michigan, decided teachers couldn't read the books to students. Not everyone in Zeeland agreed with that decision.
recently talked to people in Zeeland about Harry.
Some Zeeland parents said they worry that Harry teaches kids to question parents and other authority figures. They also said that many of the characters don't have good values. ""The books don't have characters that are easy to respect,"" said parent Mary Elzinga.
Other parents in Zeeland had no problem with the books. Parent Mary Ocherse said kids
question some authority figures. Teacher Mary Dana agreed. ""Some of our greatest American heroes, such as George Washington, questioned authority,"" she said. ""We need to teach kids how and when to question authority figures.""
Dana also said the characters in the books are good role models kids can relate to. ""Harry is an outsider who is honest and is a good friend,"" she said. ""He makes mistakes, but he always tries to do the right thing.""
When asked their opinion, Erin, Megan, and many other kids said they don't understand what the fuss in Zeeland is about. They all said the Harry Potter books are ""just for fun.""

288,401,"The Ancient Pueblo cliff city gets ready for its 100th birthday finale.
Park rangers are bringing history to light. On December 9, they plan to
or light up, an ancient cliff city in southwestern Colorado.
Mesa Verde has been a national park for more than 100 years.
A century ago, the U.S. government set aside Mesa Verde (MAYsuh VER-day) as a national park. The park protects the ancient Native American city known for its multistoried cliff dwellings built into canyon walls on a large
(A plateau is an area of high, flat land.)
(100th anniversary) throughout the year, park officials have organized various festivities. Events include Native American dances, music, and tours of sites never before open to the public. There are also craft demonstrations, such as pottery making and basket weaving.
(fih- NAH-lee), or big ending, park rangers will light up two of the biggest cliff dwellingsCliff Palace and Spruce Tree House. The rangers will use about 100 lanterns. ""Visitors [will] see what it may have looked like 800 years ago,"" Mesa Verde park ranger Dan Puskar told
The centennial celebration honors the Ancient Pueblo (PWEH-bloh) people, formerly known as the Anasazi (ah-nuh-SAH-zee). The word
means ""town"" in Spanish. The Ancient Pueblo, who constructed Mesa Verdes cliff dwellings, are the ancestors of todays Pueblo people of the U.S. Southwest.
The Ancient Pueblo were an agricultural people who
or lived, in the area more than 1,000 years ago. They mainly farmed corn, beans, and squash.
From 600 until the 1100s, the Ancient Pueblo lived primarily on the
top. (A mesa is a plateau with steep sides.) They later moved down to the sides of the cliffs and built homes there. After 1300, they
or traveled, south to New Mexico and Arizona.
Why did the Ancient Pueblo abandon the region? ""We dont know the exact reason,"" says Puskar. Some possibilities are climate change, drought, or overuse of the areas soil and other resources.
In the late 1800s, explorers found the ancient dwellings and removed pottery, baskets, and other
from the site. An artifact is any object made or used by people in the past.
On June 29, 1906, Congress passed a bill to establish Mesa Verde National Park. The bill, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt, protects the cultural treasures at this historic Native American site. It is a federal crime to remove or destroy any historic object or monument on land owned by the U.S. government.
""Its not often that you come across a hundred years of something special,"" Puskar says about the park. ""It was worthwhile to celebrate the past that comes from the Pueblo people as well as our nations past. [The centennial] provides us the chance to look forward to the next 100 years and make sure this place stays preserved and enjoyed by the public.""
is Spanish for ""green table."" Spanish explorers named the region for its high, tree-covered plateaus.
Mesa Verde National Park protects more than 600 cliff dwellings built by the Ancient Pueblo. The two largest dwellings contain about 160 rooms each.
By building their dwellings out of stone, the Ancient Pueblo could construct homes on top of one another. By 1100, their structures were as large as some modern-day apartment buildings.

290,139,"Are you ready to take a ride on
? This new movie is about a boy who boards a magical train to the North Pole.
is based on the classic children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. To make the book into a movie, filmmakers used a new type of technology called performance capture.
spoke to Douglas Chiang about his work on
. Chiang created the artwork for the movie to capture the feeling of the book.
: What does a production designer do?
Douglas Chiang: I get to play with the visual design of the movie. I read the script, come up with ideas, [draw] them on paper, and show the director.
: Do you have advice for kids who want a job like yours?
DC: Study the basics. You need to learn how to draw properly, then worry about techniques.
DC: It's really about believing in yourself and believing that anything is possible.
This latest technology helped filmmakers to get the movie to resemble the beautiful paintings in the children's book. How does performance capture work? Tiny sensors, which look like mini jewels, captured the actors' movements.
Actor Tom Hanks performed with 150 sensors attached to his face. He also wore special body gear with more sensors. Hanks acted on a stage that resembled the inside of a black box.
While Hanks acted inside the black box, special cameras picked up light reflected from the sensors. The cameras then sent the information to computers.
Finally, Hanks's performance was placed into a computerized setting of the book. What the audience will see on the screen is part real and part computer animation.
is the first movie shot this way. It enabled Hanks to play five characters, including the boy and the conductor!

291,689,"Great whites are endangered. They are often hunted for their teeth and fins.
A great white shark cruised across the Indian Ocean in a record-breaking swim. The great white became the first shark known to complete a round-trip journey between two continents.
""This is the first time that an individual fish has been found to go across an entire ocean and come back to the same spot,"" says Ramn Bonfil, one of the scientists who studied the shark. Scientists named the shark Nicole, after Australian actor Nicole Kidman.
Nicole not only set a distance record but also took a bite out of the speed record. The great white clocked more than 12,400 miles on her trip from South Africa to Australia and back. She
or moved between locations, faster than any other marine animal.
The map shows Nicoles route between South Africa and Australia.
Great whites live mainly off the coasts of California, South Africa, and Australia. Nicoles 99-day journey was tracked with an electronic tag placed on her fin.
The tag recorded her movements, including how deep she dove in the water. The results stunned scientists. They discovered that there is more interaction among great white populations in Africa and Australia than had previously been thought.
The new find is helping scientists learn more about how sharks migrate and
(find their way). Why might Nicole have swum so far so fast? Scientists dont know for sure, but they think one of the reasons that she may have made the trip was a search for food. Great white sharks feed mainly on whales, seals, and fish.
And how did Nicole find her way from one continent to another? Although she frequently plunged to depths of more than one-half mile, Nicole spent most of her time swimming on the surface. That led scientists to suspect that great whites might use the sun and the moon to help navigate.
The recent discoveries have excited shark lovers. ""Its clear that we have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg,"" says Bonfil. ""There is still much to learn about great white shark migrations.""
Great whites arent the only big fish in the sea. There are about 370 species, or types, of sharks. Here are some sharks that make a splash.
The whale shark grows up to 40 feet long and weighs about 15 tons. Thats heavier than two elephants!
The dwarf lantern shark is thought to be one of the smallest sharks. It is about 6 inches long.
Although most sharks swim about 1.5 miles per hour (mph), the mako shark is thought to cruise around at 22 mph.
The dusky shark has the most powerful bite. Its jaws clamp together with 132 pounds of force.

292,415,"Thunder provides a wake-up call to head indoors.
""When thunder roars, go indoors,"" says meteroologist Ron Holle.
Scientists say lightning strikes the surface of Earth about 100 times each second. Thunderstorms are most frequent during the spring and summer. During those seasons, experts warn people to be especially aware of the dangers of lightning.
is the flash of light that occurs when electricity moves between clouds or between a cloud and the ground. The huge spark of electricity is like the tiny kind you get when you run a comb through your hair or scuff your feet on a carpetonly much stronger.
A lightning bolt that crackles through the air can reach a temperature of 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun! The intense heat from lightning causes the surrounding air to expand, resulting in the loud sound known as
Thunder is nature's warning to head indoors. As meteorologist Ron Holle from Tucson, Arizona, told
, ""When thunder roars, go indoors."" A
Holle also recommends following the 30-30 rule. If you hear thunder less than 30 seconds after you see lightning, head indoorsthe storm is only about 6 miles away. After the storm ends, wait 30 minutes before going outside. To determine how far away lightning is, count the seconds between the flash and the thunder. Every 10 seconds equals 2 miles.
Lightning strikes the ground in the United States about 25 million times each year! Although getting hit by lightning is unlikely, it is important to stay safe. In the United States, about 60 people are killed each year by lightning.
To stay safe, follow the golden rulehead for cover. ""There is no place outside that is safe from lightning,"" Holle said firmly. ""There are two safe placesinside a [permanent] building or a metal-topped vehicle.""
Lightning expert Ron Holle shared the following tips with
Find shelter in a building or a metal-topped vehicle (not a convertible), and close the windows.
If you're caught outdoors, stay away from open spaces and avoid standing near tall objects, such as trees.
Avoid using electrical equipment, such as computers, TVs, and phones. (Cell phones are safe to use.)
Stay away from sinks and showers. Lightning can travel through water pipes.
Wait 30 minutes after the last sound of thunder or flash of lightning before going outside.

293,95,"On March 16, Michael Yachinich of Chicago Heights, Illinois, heard a smoke alarm go off on the stairs to his upstairs bedroom. Michael, age 7, quickly went into the living room where his mother was sleeping. He woke her up, and the two quickly left the house. They ran to a neighbor's house and called 911. The fire was quickly contained by firefighters.
Michael had recently participated in his school's ""Great Escape"" project for Fire Prevention Week. Michael and his family knew how to exit their home safely during a fire. Firefighter Terrence Campbell of the Glenwood Fire Department said that Michael showed good fire safety behavior. He acted quickly to help his mom leave the house and report the fire, as well as by using a home escape plan to escape danger. ""I feel that his actions from the 1999 ""Great Escape"" project helped Michael know what to do,"" Campbell said.
An escape plan also helped save the lives of the Walker family in Ontario, Canada. Shortly after 3 a.m. on February 18, 1999, a fire began in the ground floor apartment below the Walker apartment. The family awoke to find their apartment filling with smoke.
Everyone reacted immediately. The family put their home fire escape plan into action, and everyone left the building right away and went to their meeting place outside. By the time they got there, flames were racing through the apartment.
Earlier in the school year, 9-year-old twins Ashley and Ryan Walker participated in their school's ""Great Escape"" fire safety program. Mr. Walker says the twins helped the family know what to do when the fire began. ""They pushed the fire procedures,"" he said. ""They learned them at school and had us practice how to get out.""
Although the idea of a fire starting in your home is scary, you can use the prevention skills taught in your school to keep fires from starting in your home. But, if a fire does start, you can prepare your family and yourself by having a ""Great Escape"" plan and practicing it at least twice a year!

At the New Years Eve meal, people remember their favorite relatives and eat traditional foods, such as whole fish, dumplings, and noodles. The last day of the Chinese New Year is called the Lantern Festival. It is celebrated at night, and children carry lanterns in parades.
Each year in the Chinese calendar is symbolized by one of 12 animals. This year is the Year of the Dog.

295,614,"Election Day is only a couple of weeks away, and the presidential candidates are very busy. They are traveling around the United States asking people to vote for them in the presidential election.
George W. Bush agreed to answer questions about himself in writing. Here's what he had to tell the kids of the United States.
: Tell us about someone who is a hero to you and why that person is a hero.
: My parents [are my heroes] because they gave me unconditional love when I was growing up. They were great role models for raising my own daughters.
: What was your favorite subject in school and why?
: American and European history [were my favorites]. I believe that understanding the past helps us better understand and deal with situations happening in today's world.
: What do you think is the biggest change between being a kid when you were growing up and being a kid now?
: I think life was simpler when I was a kid growing up in a small west Texas town called Midland. We were outdoors a lot--riding our bicycles everywhere, playing sports, swapping baseball cards, going to barbecues in each other's backyards. Everyone in the neighborhood looked out for each other, and if you did something wrong, then your friend's mom or dad--even the school football coach--would call you on it.
: Your father, George Bush, was president. What is it like to have a former president as a dad?
: My father is a wonderful role model and a loving dad, and his example has inspired me in many ways. My father taught me to appreciate and learn from history. By studying the careers of talented Americans who entered government, I learned that dedicated public servants can help people.
: Why do you want to be president?
: I want to be president because I want America to be a place where every child is loved and educated and where every one of our citizens is able to achieve his or her greatest potential.

297,683,"Lily Thorpe is showing kids that they really can make a difference in politics even though they may not be old enough to vote yet. The 11-year-old from Grand Junction, Colorado, recently started an organization called Kids Campaign.
""Kids weren't getting enough of a say in politics,"" Lily told
. ""Grown-ups who vote are making the decision for us. Kids can have a voice.""
. Political action committees bring awareness of various causes to elected officials. In Lily's case, Kids Campaign focuses on bringing children's issues to the attention of politicians.
Kids Campaign grew out of a concern that Lily had about her school library. She noticed that many of her school library's books and encyclopedias were outdated. To help schools in Colorado get the education funds and supplies they need, Lily founded Kids Campaign.
In the name of kids everywhere, Lily is making her voice heard and is hoping that politicians are listening. She is busy meeting politicians and speaking with them about kids' causes.
Lily has some advice for grown-ups. She encourages them to talk to kids about their voting choices. That way, she says, it helps make voting ""a family decision.""

298,120,"There's good news for manatees. For some time, manatees have been in danger of dying out. Now some scientists in Florida say the number of manatees has increased and the sea mammals should no longer be considered endangered.
Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.
Is it important to save manatees and other endangered plants and animals? Discuss in class and let us know at

299,404,"It was a clear evening on July 23 as James Mennig stood outside his home in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. As he looked up into the sky, Mennig saw something that caused him to turn and run inside.
Mennig saw a bright object streak through the sky. ""It looked like a plane that was totally engulfed in flames,"" he said.
The flaming object Mennig saw was not a burning plane. It was a meteor burning up in Earth's atmosphere.
A meteor is a piece of rock or metal from space that burns up as it streaks through Earth's atmosphere. Because meteors look like stars falling or streaking across the sky, many people call them shooting stars.
According to officials at the U.S. Department of Defense, the bright meteor, which is called a fireball, entered Earth's atmosphere above Scranton, Pa. People from Canada to Virginia saw the bright fireball.
Scientists said the meteor exploded somewhere near Williamsport, Pa. No one was hurt by the fireball and no homes were damaged. But eyewitnesses later described a layer of gray ash and damaged plants in a cornfield.
According to scientists, meteors streak through Earth's atmosphere every day, but most burn up before hitting the ground. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is now studying ways to prevent large meteors from hitting Earth.
Observers not only saw the fireball, they heard it as well. As the fireball raced through the atmosphere, it produced a loud noise.
""There were two monstrous booms followed by a long rumbling and this great shaking. It knocked pictures off walls,"" said Anna Jean Edkin, a safety official in Anthony Township, Pa.
*Meteors come from pieces of space debris called meteoroids. Meteoroids can be made of rock, metal, or both.
*A meteor is a piece of rock or metal that breaks away from a meteoroid and enters Earth's atmosphere.
*A meteorite is a meteor that falls through Earth's atmosphere and hits the planet.

Inform, explain and describe - Add the senses
Another way to add detail to your descriptions is to use your senses. Think about what you can see, what you can touch, what you can smell, what you can taste and what you can hear. If we go back to your house, you might be able to add sounds, like music from your sister's room, the sound of the neighbour's lawnmower, or a baby crying upstairs.
Here's a typical writing to describe question:
Write a description of your school during a typical break. Include information about the buildings and the people. You might want to write about the classrooms, the hall, the playing fields and the corridors as well as the pupils and the staff.

305,297,"When all the food chains in a habitat are joined up together they form a food web. Here is an example of a food web:
Although it looks complex, it is just several food chains joined together. Here are some of the food chains in this food web:
grass  insect  vole  hawk
grass  insect  frog  fox
grass  insect  vole  fox
Notice that the frogs, voles and insects have more than one predator, but the rabbits and slugs have just one predator.
This leads to some interesting effects if the population of a particular organism in the food web decreases. Some animals can just eat more of another organism if food is in short supply, while others may starve and die. This in turn can affect the populations of other organisms in the food web.

Acids, bases and metals - Reactions of acids with bases
A chemical reaction happens if you mix together an acid and a base. The reaction is called
, and a neutral solution is made if you add just the right amount of acid and base together.
Metal oxides and metal hydroxides are two types of bases. For example copper oxide and sodium hydroxide.
Here are general word equations for what happens in their neutralisation reactions with acids.
are always produced. The mixture usually warms up a little during the reaction, too. The exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used.
Carbonates and hydrogen carbonates are two other types of base. They also make a salt and water when we neutralise them with acid. But this time we get
The reaction fizzes as bubbles of carbon dioxide are given off. This is easy to remember because we see the word 'carbonate' in the chemical names.
These are the general word equations for what happens:
a salt + water + carbon dioxide
a salt + water + carbon dioxide
Farmers use lime (calcium oxide) to neutralise acid soils.
Your stomach contains hydrochloric acid, and too much of this causes indigestion. Antacid tablets contain bases such as magnesium hydroxide and magnesium carbonate to neutralise the extra acid.
Bee stings are acidic. They can be neutralised using baking powder, which contains sodium hydrogen carbonate.

308,145,"Ratios are used in everyday life and can help you work out problems including scale drawings and reading maps.
In a scale drawing, all dimensions have been reduced by the same proportion.
A model boat is made to a scale of 1:20 (1 to 20). This scale can be applied to any units, so 1mm measured on the model is 20mm on the actual boat, 1cm measured on the model is 20cm on the actual boat, and so on.
a) If the 1:20 model boat is 15cm wide, how wide is the actual boat?
b) If the boat has a mast of height 4m, how high is the mast on the model?
The scale is 1:20. This means that every cm on the model is equivalent to 20cm on the boat.
a) 1cm on the model = 20cm on the boat, so:
b) 20cm on the boat = 1cm on the model
so mast height on real boat  20 = mast height on model
400cm (4m) on the boat = 400cm  20 =
Maps scales can be written in ratios and tell you how many units of land, sea etc are equal to one unit on the map.
If you are travelling from Manchester to Newcastle, for example, and need to know how far it is, it would be very difficult to work this out if the map does not have a scale.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. A distance is measured as 3cm on the map.
How many cm, m and km is this equivalent to in real life?
1 cm on the map represents 50 000cm. Therefore, 3cm on the map represents 150 000cm.
To convert from cm to m, divide by 100.
To convert from m to km divide by 1000.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. What distance on the map will represent 5km?
5km = 5000m = 5000  100 cm = 500 000cm
We want to know what distance on the map represents 500 000cm in real life.
The map scale is 1:50 000, so we divide by 50 000
500 000  50 000 = 10

309,79,"The following table shows the times of the buses from Cambridge to Duxford and Whittlesford:
a) I want to go to the Duxford Imperial War Museum. Which bus should I catch from Cambridge?
b) The 0805 from Cambridge is running 6 minutes late. What time does it reach Pampisford?
c) If I arrive in Sawston at 0932, what time do I leave Cambridge?
d) How long does the journey from Great Shelford to Duxford Wheatsheaf take?
a) The only bus which goes to the Imperial War Museum leaves Cambridge at 0835.
b) The 0805 usually arrives in Pampisford at 0838. So if it's running 6 minutes late it will arrive at 0844.
d) The bus leaves Great Shelford at 0722 and arrives at Duxford Wheatsheaf at 0745. So it takes 23 minutes.

311,319,"Something that is implicit is inferred - it is suggested, but not actually said. Implicit meaning can be a little harder to find than explicit meaning. Writers like to draw you into their text and get you involved. It's up to you to make your mind up about a character, just as it is when you meet someone in real life.
The clues you need to make up your mind about a character are all in the text. Look for the following:
Take another look at one of the extracts from 'Holes'. Stanley has just arrived at the prison camp. What can you tell about the character of Mr Sir, the man in the cowboy hat, from reading between the lines? Some important phrases have been put in bold to give you a few clues.
A man was sitting with his feet up on a desk.
He turned his head when Stanley and the guard entered, but otherwise didn't move. Even though he was inside,
he wore sunglasses and a cowboy hat
. He also held a can of cream soda, and the sight of it made Stanley even more aware of his own thirst.
He waited while the bus guard gave the man some papers to sign.
""That's a lot of sunflower seeds,"" the bus guard said.
Stanley noticed a burlap sack filled with sunflower seeds on the floor next to the desk.
,"" said the man in the cowboy hat. He had
a tattoo of a rattlesnake on his arm
, and as he signed his name, the snake's rattle seemed to wiggle. ""I used to smoke a pack a day. Now I eat a sack of these every week.""
On the surface, this extract doesn't tell us much about Mr Sir, but you've probably begun to
about him. If we read between the lines, we can tell that he likes to make an impression and wants to be seen to be in charge. He is sitting ""with his feet up on a desk"" and has made his appearance even more striking by wearing sunglasses and a cowboy hat indoors.
Sometimes people who act like this can like power a bit too much, and can be bullies. Could Mr Sir be a bully?
When we consider the can of cream soda, we can say that the fact that Mr Sir fails to offer either Stanley or the bus driver anything to drink after their nine-hour, cross-desert journey suggests that he is a
man. That he keeps his own drink in full view of Stanley and the bus driver further suggests that he is cruel and likes to see other people's discomfort.
We learn that Mr Sir stopped smoking recently. We could then expect him to be bad- and short-tempered. The tattoo of a rattlesnake, a dangerous reptile that is supposed to have a bad temper, adds to this impression. The sunflower seeds are, we are led to believe, there to help him as an alternative to cigarettes, but we don't get the feeling of optimism that they'll be successful.
So there we have it; Mr Sir is a bad-tempered, selfish bully!
Whack and zap mad professors and aliens!

312,456,"Test your listening skills with this quiz. Note down your answer to the questions and then 'click ideas' below to see what kind of listener you are.
1. Your group is having an informal discussion about an issue in a book. No one can agree and everyone is talking at once. Do you:
a) Shout the loudest to make sure that everyone hears what you have to say.
b) Seize the opportunity for a nap - no one will notice as they're all too busy arguing.
c) Suggest that you all take it in turns to speak whilst someone writes down everyone's ideas.
2. You've been asked to do a group presentation and there's a girl in the group who is really nervous. She starts to speak, but she suddenly goes silent and bright red. She's forgotten what else to say. Do you:
a) Point at her and burst out laughing.
b) Feel glad that everyone is staring at her and not you.
c) Help her by asking her a question about what she's already said.
3. You've prepared an individual talk on your hobby for homework. Someone else in the class has just given their talk on exactly the same subject. Do you:
a) Just read out what you had written in your notes. You weren't listening to the person who was just speaking, anyway.
b) Screw up your notes and lock yourself in the toilet until the bell rings.
c) Refer back to some of the things the other student said as you go along.
4. Your teacher puts you into pairs and asks you to improvise a missing scene from the play you've been reading. Do you:
a) Say as much as you can to fill the two minute slot you've been given. It doesn't matter if it's irrelevant and it doesn't matter if your partner doesn't get a chance to speak.
b) Allow your partner to do all the talking and keep your reactions to a minimum.
c) Swallow your sense of panic, listen carefully to what your partner says and try and react accordingly, taking turns so that the improvisation makes sense and is balanced.
You are confident and outgoing. You might find yourself going out alone though if you don't try to listen to others more often.
You probably are a good listener...but nobody knows it. Try to be brave and ask people questions during discussions. At least it will take the focus away from you, if that's what you want.

313,438,"> Diet, drugs and health - Introduction
A balanced diet contains the different nutrients in the correct amounts to keep us healthy. Certain foods are not necessarily 'bad' for us, but eating too much of them could be. We will look at what food types are needed, how they are digested.
Drugs are substances that affect our bodies. They can be medicines or recreational drugs, legal or illegal. We will look at these in detail.

The extract below is from a leaflet about passive smoking.
. Passive smoking is breathing in other people's tobacco smoke. Other people's tobacco smoke is sometimes called environmental tobacco smoke.
. Only 15% of the smoke from a cigarette is inhaled by the smoker - the rest goes into the surrounding air and other people can breathe it in. Breathing air which contains tobacco smoke can be bad for your health. This is because the tiny particles and gases in tobacco smoke contain over 4000 chemicals, many of which are harmful - at least 60 are known to cause cancer. The gases also contain carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas that comes out of car exhausts.
Q. What is the effect on my health?
. Breathing other people's smoke is uncomfortable and can cause:
nose, throat and chest irritation and breathing difficulties

Q6. Look at the second answer that the writer has given in the leaflet: the one beginning ""Only 15% of the smoke..."". Explain two ways in which the writer has used language to persuade the reader that passive smoking is dangerous.
Q7. Why has the writer phrased each heading as a question?
Q8. Explain two ways in which the writer has used layout to make the text more effective.
A1. Passive smoking is 'breathing in other people's tobacco smoke'.
A2. 15% is inhaled by the smoker.
A3. Coughing. (You could name any of the effects listed in the bullet points.)
A4. The target audience could be teenagers, or a broad audience. It is the reason that you give in the next answer that is more important.
A5. Reasons are: the language used is quite simple; sentences are mainly quite short and simple, many only contain one or two ideas; the information is broken up into short sections; the headings make the information easy to follow. All these would make the text accessible for many readers, including young people.
A6. There are three main ways: the simple statement that it is 'bad for your health'; the fact that tobacco smoke contains 'over 4000 chemicals', many of which are harmful; the mention of carbon monoxide which is 'poisonous'.
A7. The headings are phrased as questions to draw the reader into the text.
A8. Layout has been used in several different ways: the 'Q' and 'A' format is eyecatching; the short paragraphs are easy to follow; the bullet points at the end of the extract make the facts easy to read.

318,353,"The commonly used metric units of length include:
To find a suitable unit to measure something in, you should first estimate how big it is. So, for example, do you think it's better to measure the distance between London and Manchester in metres or kilometres? Or, should an insect be measured in metres or millimetres?
Imagine the length of the objects you are estimating or imagine measuring them in relation to other objects. For example:
Imagine a metre ruler next to a tall man. You would expect him to be taller than 1 ruler, but not as tall as 3 rulers.
Imagine a bag of sugar on some scales. You would expect the needle to move round a little, but not to whizz round to 50kg.
Imagine a 1-litre bottle of cola. You would expect it to hold approximately the same amount as a large flask.
Q1. Which unit of measurement (km, m, cm or mm) would you use for the following?
b) the length of a football pitch
d) the distance from London to Manchester
a) Is the height of a tall man likely to be 90cm, 180cm or 360cm?
b) Is the weight of a bag of sugar about 1kg, 10kg or 50kg?
c) Does a large flask hold roughly 200ml, 1l or 10l of liquid?
Can you match Viral Vinnie's appetite for English, Maths and Science?

> The rock cycle - Sedimentary rocks
There are three main types of rock:
, pieces of broken rock as it flows along. When the river reaches a lake or the sea, its load of transported rocks settles to the bottom. We say that the rocks are
. The deposited rocks build up in layers, called
The weight of the sediments on top squashes the sediments at the bottom. This is called
. The water is squeezed out from between the pieces of rock and crystals of different salts form.
The crystals form a sort of glue that sticks or cements the pieces of rock together. This process is called
These processes eventually make a type of rock called sedimentary rock. It may take millions of years for sedimentary rocks to form.
These are the different processes in order:
The river transports bits of rock, and deposits them on the bottom of the river bed.
Sedimentary rocks contain rounded grains in layers. Examples of sedimentary rock are:
The oldest layers are at the bottom and the youngest layers are at the top. Sedimentary rocks may contain fossils of animals and plants trapped in the sediments as the rock was formed.

Ray, the main character in this extract, has stolen a motorbike and caused an accident that killed someone. He has told nobody, but knows that he can't hide for much longer. He is about to get on a bus, but realises that the one person who can link him to the crime is the conductor of that very bus. Before he can run off, he bumps into Mrs Fitzroy, his best friend's mum.
Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. Write one paragraph for each bullet point.
He hung back, groping wildly for some excuse to prevent him getting on, but the bell rang and the engine increased its impatient rumble and his legs carried him upwards on to the platform, and he felt Mrs Fitzroy clamber on behind. The bus began to move. He turned towards the stairs, but she caught hold of his arm.
""Let's go downstairs. I don't like the smoke."" Again he felt her hand guide him, and he ducked his head and began to walk along the aisle. ""Yeah"".
""This'll do,"" she said, and he turned back and sat beside her - the less fuss he made, the less obvious he was, the better. As he settled, he kept his face bent low, aware of the conductor walking towards them. He brushed past, and, noticing things with a total clarity, Ray saw the dark blue uniform that he was wearing and noted the heaviness and thickness of the material. He heard him clumping up the stairs, and he wondered, absurdly, if he was wearing heavy boots, too.
Mrs Fitzroy was opening the bag which she had on her lap, and Ray felt in his pocket for his fare. If he had the right change, he could just hand it to the conductor without looking up. Yes, he had a ten and two pence piece. He glanced at Mrs Fitzroy and saw to his dismay that she was taking out a pound-note from her purse. That would mean a delay while she got her change - plenty of chance for him to be recognised. Could he offer to pay her fare? It would seem strange, but anything was better than being seen.
What kind of atmosphere does the writer create in this extract and how do they do it?
Ray's thoughts and actions as he gets on the bus
how the writer uses language to create the atmosphere.
In this text, the writer creates an atmosphere of fear and tension. Ray's thoughts and actions at the start of the passage show that he is under a lot of pressure. He tries to think of an excuse to 'prevent him getting on' the bus, but knows that this will just make Mrs Fitzroy suspicious. When he tries to go upstairs, she insists they stay downstairs. Nothing seems to be going his way, and this leads us to believe he may well be spotted by the conductor.
As the conductor approaches, Ray's fears increase which creates more tension. He keeps his face 'bent low' to avoid being recognised, and also notices things 'with a total clarity'. This shows that he is very scared and alert, ready for something to go wrong. When he realises Mrs Fitzroy has no change, he feels 'dismay'. The reader is kept on the edge of their seat waiting for the conductor to come along.
The writer uses language, as well as events, to create tension. The phrase 'groping wildly for some excuse' shows Ray's panic and gives the impression that he feels he has no control over events. The way he notices the 'heaviness' of the conductor's uniform, and wonders if he was 'wearing heavy boots as well' might mean that he is afraid of the man. Ray asks himself 'Could he offer to pay her fare?'. This shows he is tense; he is running through possibilities in his mind. The writer uses Ray's fears to create an atmosphere of tension for the reader.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - The text
SECTION 2 - Act 2, Scene 2, lines 1 to 157
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
, below, sees the light at the window, then realises it is
 But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
Be not her maid, since she is envious:
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
 It is my lady!  O, it is my love!
She speaks  yet she says nothing. What of that?
Her eye discourses. I will answer it.
 I am too bold. Tis not to me she speaks.
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night!
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
O speak again, bright angel!  For thou art
As glorious to this night, being oer my head,
As is a wingd messenger of heaven
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name 
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love
And Ill no longer be a Capulet.
(Aside)Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
Whats Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
Whats in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet.
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name 
And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Call me but love, and Ill be new-baptized.
What man art thou, that thus bescreened in night
I know not how to tell thee who I am.
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of thy tongues uttering, yet I know the sound.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
How camst thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb 
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls,
For stony limits cannot hold love out 
And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet
And I am proof against their enmity.
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
I have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes.
And but thou love me, let them find me here.
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogud, wanting of thy love.
By whose direction foundst thou out this place?
By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot, yet wert thou as far
As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Fain would I dwell on form  fain, fain deny
What I have spoke.  But farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay 
And I will take thy word. Yet if thou swearst
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers perjuries
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
Or if thou think I am too quickly won,
Ill frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo  but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light.
But trust me, gentleman, Ill prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheardst, ere I was ware,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discoverd.
Lady, by yonder blessd moon I vow,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops 
O swear not by the moon, th inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract tonight.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden 
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.
This bud of love, by summers ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Th exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it 
And yet I would it were to give again.
Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
But to be frank and give it thee again:
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
is heard calling from inside the house.
I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
 Anon, good Nurse!  Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little: I will come again.
O blessd, blessd night! I am afeard,
Being in night, all this but a dream,
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow
By one that Ill procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite 
And all my fortunes at thy foot Ill lay,
And follow thee, my lord, throughout the world.
I come! Anon!  But if thou meanst not well,
 To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

324,253,"> Approximation - Rounding to a given number of places
Approximation - Rounding to a given number of places
Decimal places are counted from the decimal point:
So, the number 5.1492 has four decimal places and 4.34 has two decimal places.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places, look at the number in the next decimal place.
If it's less than 5 round down
If it's 5 or more, round up
Q1. Round 7.2648 to 2 decimal places (d.p.)
Q2. Round 8.352 to 1 decimal place
To round to two decimal places, look at the number in the third decimal place. It's a 4, so round down.
To round to one decimal place, look at the number in the second decimal place. It's a 5, so round up.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places then the answer must have that number of decimal places, even if you have to add some zeros.
For example, rounding 3.40021 to two decimal places gives 3.40 (2 d.p.).
You need to write both decimal places, even though the second number is a zero, to show you rounded to two decimal places.
Remember to look at the number after the one you're interested in. If it's less than 5, round down. If it's 5 or more, round up.
Round up, round up and try this activity!
Make sure your maths skills add up.

1. You've just asked if you can go down to the park to meet your friends and have been given the following answer:
""You're not going anywhere near that place. It's full of litter, it's never supervised and the equipment is a total health hazard! You'll have to find somewhere else to hang around.""
Write a letter to Mrs H Devonshire, Parks Department, complaining about the area and requesting that something is done about it.
Below are five ideas for paragraphs that you could include in your letter. They are not in the best order, so drag and drop them to improve the structure. Drag the idea into the best place in the table below:

Diet, drugs and health - Digestion and enzymes
Our teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. Enzymes are needed so that this break-down happens quickly enough to be useful.
Take care - enzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients:
. Carbohydrase enzymes break down starch into sugars.
The saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough, the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet.
. Protease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. Digestion of proteins in the stomach is helped by
, which is strong hydrochloric acid. This also kills harmful micro-organisms that may be in the food.
Lipase enzymes break down fat into fatty acids and glycerol. Digestion of fat in the
, made in the liver. Bile breaks the fat into small droplets that are easier for the lipase enzymes to work on.
are already small enough to be absorbed by the body without being broken down, so they are not digested.
, which is why it cannot be absorbed by the body.

329,487,"It's good to have a variety of sentences. You can have short ones, and then some long ones. But as we have already seen, if they are all simple sentences, then it gets boring and difficult to read. You should also use a mixture of questions and statements.
Imagine giving some advice to a friend who is being bullied. You'd probably think of a few ideas very quickly:
You could improve your work by adding other types of sentences. At the moment, it's just a list of orders. What about adding a question or two? Like this:
Why don't you talk to someone at school about it?
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now?
This pushes your friend to think about something. It also gives them the opportunity to start talking about it.
Then you could add a statement or two, like this:
Bullying is more common than many people think.
The worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone.
If we combine these ideas and sentences, we have an interesting and varied piece of writing. All we need to add are some connectives, like 'and', 'but', 'so' or 'because'. Now we have writing that makes a real impact and which can offer advice as well as persuading people, like this:
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now? Why don't you talk to someone at school about it? Because bullying is far more common than many people think. And it is far more serious than many people imagine. In fact, it is one of the main reasons for pupils missing school. But the worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone. So don't suffer in silence, tell your family about it and do something now.
You write sentences all the time. Find out when and where to use them.

335,154,"> Inform, explain and describe - Describing
When you describe, you need to give lots of detail and make the words interesting for others to read. For example, if you wanted to describe your home, you wouldn't just write lots of facts, like this:
My house was built in 1972 of red brick with a pitched concrete tiled roof. The house was extended in 2003 with a small UPVC conservatory and an adjoining patio area of approximately 8 square metres...
This gives lots of facts, but these are the types of facts that someone buying a house might need. Most people would find a description like this boring. So what should you do?
The first thing is to think about what you want to show other people. Do you want to concentrate on the roof tiles or the types of bricks used? Or do you want to tell them about the fence panel your brother broke when he was chasing you last summer?
You could also write about the time Stephanie threw a tennis ball and it got stuck in the guttering - it's still there - and when it rains really hard the gutter overflows. You might even have a gnome in the front garden, which your grandad bought - it looks stupid, but you won't move it in case you offend him.
Each of these details is far more interesting than roof tiles or measurements. So, when you are describing something, think of drawing a picture or taking a photograph. You focus on a certain point, write a paragraph about it, then move to the next point and the next.

338,191,"Persuasive texts try to persuade you to do something - like buy something or give money to charity. Magazine articles and newspaper reports may try to persuade you to agree with them.
Are you tired of the daily grind? Sick of working all hours of the day for little reward? Tired of never having enough money to really enjoy yourself?
Here's how to spot this type of text:
It tries to convince you to do or agree with something.
It contains a mix of fact and opinion.
It may use repetition, ""soundbites"" and persuasive or emotive language.
It often seems to speak directly to the reader.
Argument texts should be balanced and fair, and give all sides of an argument before coming to a conclusion.
Here's an extract from an argument text:
Foxhunting is a subject that provokes very strong feelings. Many people believe that it is cruel to hunt a fox with dogs, and totally agree with its ban.
Many farmers, and even conservationists, however, have always argued that the fox is a pest, which attacks livestock and must be controlled.
Here are some clues to help you identify an argument text:
It discusses an issue, considering all points of view.
It often uses a formal and impersonal style to seem balanced.
It uses connectives to connect points, for example ""however"", ""but"", ""similarly""

339,271,"> Preparing, planning and checking - Punctuation
The most important thing with punctuation is to make sure your sentences are correctly marked at the start and end:
The starts are easy; they should all have capital letters.
The endings have full stops (or the equivalent, such as question marks). However, endings cannot have commas. Commas are only used inside sentences, never right at the end of one.
One quick way to check is to read your work to yourself (it doesn't have to be aloud). If you 'run out of breath' or need to pause in your reading to add emphasis, ask yourself whether a comma or a full stop is needed. If so, put one in.
Other areas which often cause problems are:
If you have included the actual words that somebody speaks, make sure you put them inside speech marks. Remember to close the speech marks as well as open them!
Always use question marks when writing a question whether it is direct or rhetorical. Look out for rhetorical questions in persuasive texts eg ""How long will it be until all our countryside is destroyed?"". Writers use rhetorical questions to emphasise a point and they do not expect the reader to genuinely answer the question.
Be careful when using exclamation marks as overusing them can spoil a text. They should be used only to show excitement, surprise, shock or humour eg ""Stop the car!"" she yelled.
To show when a letter has been missed out:
Remember: ask your teacher for some advice if you feel unsure about any aspect of punctuation.

and have too few red blood cells. People with

Although we only need small amounts of the different vitamins in our diet, we become ill if we don't get enough. For example,
deficiency causes scurvy, which makes the gums bleed, and
deficiency causes rickets, which makes the legs bow outwards in growing children.
Food is a store of chemical energy. If you look on the side of food packets you will see the food's energy content. This is usually measured in
. If we eat too little food, we will use up our store of fat and become too thin. If we eat too much food, especially foods rich in sugar and fat, we will increase our store of fat and become too fat.
It is important to balance the amount of food we eat with who we are and what we do. The amount of energy we need from our food depends on our age, our height and how much exercise we get.
For example, a one-year old baby needs 3850 kJ each day to continue to grow, whereas an adult Olympic swimmer in training needs 15,600 kJ each day. Someone who sits at a desk all day will need less food than their twin who climbs ladders all day to wash windows.

345,547,"Probability is often based on surveys, because you get a more accurate measure of probability by basing your calculation on a large number of results.
Alex is doing some reporting for his local paper. The subject of his article is 'holidays'.
As part of his report he decides to question 10 of his friends whether they prefer caravanning or camping holidays. Seven out of 10 say that they prefer caravanning, so Alex writes the dramatic headline you see above.
Alex has based his probability on a very small survey. This is equivalent to throwing a die 10 times, throwing a 6 nine times by chance, and stating that the probability of obtaining a 6 is
! To estimate probabilities from the results of surveys, you must gather a large number of results.

346,125,"Here's a brief outline of the different types of sentences (if you want more details, look at
A simple sentence generally has one main verb and communicates one idea. For example:
There can be several words in the verb, so
- has two words in the verb.
- has three words in the verb.
However, in each example there is just one main verb and idea. This is the simplest type of sentence and usually it's very easy to understand.
A compound sentence generally joins two simple sentences together. We typically use words like 'and', 'or' and 'but' to join the ideas. For example:
It was cold but we still went to town.
It was raining and we stayed indoors.
This makes the two ideas equal in the sentence - if we take away one part of it, we are left with a simple sentence again. These are very common when we are speaking and they are not difficult to understand.
A complex sentence communicates more than one idea, so it's like a compound sentence in a way. However, the ideas are not equal. This is because one part is like a simple sentence, so it can stand on its own. The other part can't - it needs something else to support it. For instance, look at this sentence:
You can't persuade me to go to town, no matter how hard you try.
We can take away the first part, but then we are left with:
Now this is not a simple sentence and it doesn't stand on its own - it needs something else to make sense.
We use complex sentences a lot when we speak, but it's important to use them in our writing too. In fact, these are the most difficult sentences to get right.
You write sentences all the time. Find out when and where to use them.

Compounds and mixtures - Metal and non-metals oxides
Remember that metals react with oxygen in the air to produce metal oxides, like magnesium oxide.
Non-metals react with oxygen in the air to produce non-metal oxides. Here are two examples for the non-metals carbon and sulfur.
Carbon burns in air to form carbon dioxide:
Sulfur burns in air to form sulfur dioxide:
Non-metal oxides such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide are responsible for
. They dissolve in the water in the clouds to form acidic solutions. Acid rain damages rocks and buildings, and harms wildlife.
Differences between metal oxides and non-metal oxides
There are some important differences between the physical and chemical properties of metal oxides and non-metal oxides. The table shows some of these differences.

350,326,"> More on equations - Equations when x is negative
More on equations - Equations when x is negative
If the value of x is negative, tackle the equation in the same way - aim to get all xs on one side of the equation.
5x - 2 = 12 - 2x
Your aim is to get all the unknown x terms on one of the equation side only, so start by adding 2x to both sides: 7x - 2 = 12
Next add 2 to both sides: 7x = 14
And finally, divide by 7 to give
As always, you can check your answer in the original equation. So substitute x = 2 back into 5x - 2 = 12 - 2x
(5  2) - 2 = 12 - (2  2)
10 - 2 = 12 - 4
This makes sense, so the value x = 2 is correct.
Add x to both sides to give 5x = 10.
To find x, divide both sides by 5 to get x = 2
Solve the equation 4x + 1 = 2x + 5
Start by subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation to give
Then subtract 1 from each side to give
Divide each side by 2 to give

Q1. Each sentence is good on its own.
Q2. Each sentence has something wrong with it.
Q3. It has too many complex sentences.
Q4. It has too many simple sentences.
A2. No. They are all good sentences on their own.
A3. No. There are no complex sentences here.
A5. Yes, using words like 'meeting' far too often.
A7. Yes, that's the main problem with it.

The meeting, which starts at two, is in the usual room, but the speaker is arriving at half past one. She will need an overhead projector so get one from Sally because ours is broken. John will start the meeting and you will introduce the speaker, who's going to talk for about half an hour. Someone from staffing will do the displays but you need to register any guests and John will organise coffee and biscuits for afterwards.
Don't worry if yours isn't exactly the same. The main point is to join ideas together and make it interesting to read.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The party
Romeo and his friends decide to gate-crash the party. Romeo has a bad feeling about the outcome of this evening, but decides to let fate take its course.
Capulet is having a great time at his party. People are dancing. Romeo and his friends arrive wearing masks. Romeo spots Juliet. He thinks to himself that he didn't really know what true beauty was until he saw her. He doesn't know that she is a Capulet. Tybalt recognises Romeo from his voice and threatens to kill him because he is a Montague, but Capulet stops him. Romeo and Juliet flirt and finally kiss. The Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet and he is dismayed. He leaves with Benvolio. Juliet is distraught when the Nurse tells her who Romeo is.
The Chorus recaps events for us: Romeo has forgotten Rosaline and is now in love with Juliet. Juliet feels the same way.
Romeo runs away from his friends. Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline.
Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom. Juliet doesn't know that he is there at first and, talking to herself, declares her love for him. She is shocked and embarrassed when he replies. They have only met that evening, but they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and what time their wedding will be! They find it difficult to part.
Romeo goes to see Friar Lawrence, the priest, who is worried that he has spent the night with Rosaline. When Romeo says that he wants to marry Juliet, Friar Lawrence tells him off for falling in love so easily, but agrees to the wedding because he thinks that it might be a solution to the rift between the Capulets and the Montagues.

353,276,"Now you've had a chance to practise beginnings, middles, endings and paragraphs, you should have a clearer idea of how to organise your work.
You need to organise and structure your work. It should be in clear, appropriate steps. If it's muddled, it will confuse the reader.
Think about the beginning - will it interest other people? Will it make them sit up and take notice?
TiPToP your paragraphs. That means a new paragraph for a new time, place, topic or person.
The ending is not just when you stop writing - you need to make it memorable and as interesting as the start.
The importance of beginnings, middles and ends.

354,355,"To estimate the size of an angle, first think about which
(quarter) of a complete turn it is in.
To be even more accurate think in terms of 45 angles:
This angle lies somewhere between 90 and 135, but seems slightly closer to 135, so you could estimate that it is 120 (or something similar).
Now to take a different angle on revision with this activity!

Let's look at two examples to see the difference between heat and temperature.
A swimming pool at 30C is at a lower temperature than a cup of tea at 80C. But the swimming pool contains more water, so it stores more thermal energy than the cup of tea.
To boil water we must increase its temperature to 100C. It takes longer to boil a large beaker of water than a small beaker because the large beaker contains more water and needs more thermal energy to reach 100C.

Measures - Converting units for area and volume
The method for converting between units works the same as the one for converting units of area and volume.
When you are converting one sort of unit to another, you need to know how many smaller units are needed to make 1 larger unit (eg 1000m
When converting from a larger unit to a smaller unit (eg m
When converting from a smaller unit to a larger unit (eg cm
= 100cm  100cm = 10 000cm
You are converting from a smaller unit (cm
= 50 000  10 000 = 5m
= 10mm  10mm  10mm = 1000mm
You are converting from a larger unit (cm
= 10  1000 = 10 000mm

Compounds and mixtures - The reactivity series
Magnesium burns very brightly when heated in air
Some metals are very unreactive. That means they do not easily take part in chemical reactions. For example platinum does not react with oxygen in the air, even if it is heated in a Bunsen burner flame.
Some metals are very reactive. They easily take part in chemical reactions to make new substances.
Magnesium is like this. If it is heated in a Bunsen burner, it ignites and burns with a brilliant white flame.
The reactivity series for some common metals
Other metals may be more reactive than magnesium, or in between magnesium and platinum. If we put the metals in order of their reactivity, from most reactive down to least reactive, we get a list called the
If you want to learn the reactivity series, you could try making up a mnemonic or silly sentence to help. Here's one - can you do better?

361,197,"Another way to look at sentences is to think about their purposes. For instance, we can talk about...
Statements, which tell us things. We tend to see these in school text books, in newspapers, or in an encyclopedia. For instance:
This Revision Bite is all about sentences.
Questions, which ask us things or make us think about things. For instance:
When did the First World War end?
Orders, which are also called commands. These tell us what to do, so we find these in instructions, recipes and signs. For instance:
Next, take a small pinch of salt and mix it all together.
Exclamations, which are shouted out. You'd hear these at a football match, in arguments, or if you told a joke. For instance:
You don't have to know the names but you do need to know how and when to use them.
You write sentences all the time. Find out when and where to use them.

> The rock cycle - Igneous rocks
The second type of rock we'll look at is igneous rock.
The inside of the Earth is very hot - hot enough to melt rocks. Molten (liquid) rock forms when rocks melt. The molten rock is called
. When the magma cools and solidifies, a type of rock called igneous rock forms.
Igneous rocks contain randomly arranged interlocking crystals. The size of the crystals depends on how quickly the molten magma solidified. The more
You may have done an experiment at school with a substance called salol. If molten salol cools slowly, you get big crystals. If it cools quickly, you get small crystals.
If the magma cools quickly, small crystals form in the rock. This can happen if the magma erupts from a volcano. Obsidian and basalt are examples of this type of rock. They are called
igneous rocks because they form from eruptions of magma.
If the magma cools slowly, large crystals form in the rock. This can happen if the magma cools deep underground. Granite and gabbro are examples of this type of rock. They are
igneous rocks because they form from magma underground.
Unlike sedimentary rocks, igneous rocks do not contain any fossils. This is because any fossils in the original rock will have melted when the magma formed.

364,401,"> Listening - Showing you are listening
It sounds weird, but you can show that you are a good listener by talking! The trick is to know what to say and when to say it.
Good listeners show that they are listening by:
Making eye contact with the person that is talking to them
Using facial expressions to show that they understand or are reacting to what is said
Allowing the person who is speaking finish before they respond
Repeating, in their own words, what the person has said to show that they understand
Referring back to comments that have already been made
Read this conversation between Abdul, Emily and Matt. Can you find any examples of good listening skills?
In a classroom. General classroom noise in the background.
In a fight, right, who do you think would win -
(Interrupts) Shut up, Abdul! I'm trying to concentrate.
There's four of them. They'd take him down. Knock him cold.
So you're saying that Tinky Winky and Laa-Laa have a violent streak?
No, but if they had to, if they were forced - them against him - the Teletubbies would have it, any day of the week.
Because it would be four against one?
Yeah, the Teletubbies are a team. Bob's a Larry.
We'd better be quiet. We're annoying her.
Choose the statement that is most true:
Emily is the best listener, because she says the least and she's just trying to get on with her work
Matt shows that he is listening because he asks questions to make sure that he understands what Abdul really means, and he is sensitive towards Emily's feelings.

The advert says that the cost of a party is 50 plus 5 per person, so what would be the cost of a party for 10?
50 + 10  5 = 50 + 50 = 100
What would be the cost of a party for 20?
50 + 20  5 = 50 + 100 =
How do you work out the cost if you don't know the number of people who will attend the party?
The cost for 10 people is 50 + 5  10 = 100
The cost for 20 people is 50 + 5  20 = 150
So the cost for n people is 50 + 5  n = (50 + 5n)
With this formula you can work out the cost of a party for any number of people.
Have a go at the next question to see if you can use
Alexa is 12 years old. How old will she be in n years time?
years time her age will have increased by n. So her age will be n more than it is now.
Check your answer. In 1 years time she will be 13. If we put 1 in for the value of
we get 12 +1 = 13. So that is correct.
In ten years she will be 22, and putting n=10 gives us
age = 12 + 10 = 22
Time to formulate a new revision plan!

368,265,"> Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
When you are persuading people, you usually use a different style. You don't need to show both sides - all you have to do is present your ideas. For instance, imagine you had to persuade people to buy a certain toothpaste. You could write about the great taste, or how clean your teeth feel or how white they are. It doesn't really matter what you find to write about as long as you get them to buy it.
But you wouldn't write about other makes of toothpaste. You don't persuade like this, because it sounds like you aren't sure. So the first thing to remember is:
- if you are writing about how great chips are, keep repeating the idea. Convince yourself how good they are - they might even be a healthy option, because lots of doctors are bound to like them and chips wouldn't be so popular if they weren't really great, would they? Once you have convinced yourself, it's much easier to convince others. So next you need to remember to...
- it's always better to hear how good your idea is rather than how bad other people's are. So write about the things that show your ideas in the best light. For instance, aren't chips just great for a quick snack? Why were chips voted the most popular option in our school at lunchtime? And finally don't be frightened to...
- If you don't seem too sure, or if you can't make your ideas stand out, then you aren't really persuading as much as you can. And if that is the case, you need The Persuaders' Toolkit.
- don't worry about saying the same thing again and again - people forget, so repeat yourself and they will remember. Even when you think they might remember, you can always repeat yourself another time.
- using words such as ""we"" or ""I"" always sounds a lot more convincing. We all know that, don't we?
- why would you use questions? Well, they make people think. They also get your readers involved in what you are writing. So will you use them when you persuade? If not, why not?
- words are your ammunition. In seconds, they can make your friends laugh, or your teacher angry, so why not use them properly to persuade your readers?
For instance, don't just write ""the pressure of doing school work"", because there is no real feeling there. Instead, how about: ""the endless trauma, the desperation and the mindless suffering that school work inflicts on students"".

371,624," r  r. Only the 'r' is squared.
Find the area of the following (use
a) r = 6cm, so we calculate A = 3.14  6  6 = 113.04cm
b) The diameter is 10cm, so the radius is 5cm. We calculate A = 3.14  5  5 = 78.5cm
A dartboard has a radius of 20cm. The bullseye in the centre of the board has a radius of 1cm.
By calculating the area of the two circles, find the area of materials required to make the dartboard (use
The area of the materials required is 10990mm
Remember that the area of the large circle is 3.14  20  20 = 1256cm
The area of the small circle is 3.14  1  1 = 3.14cm
Therefore, the area of the materials required is 1256 + 3.14 = 1259.14cm
When calculating the area of a circle, remember to use the radius, not the diameter.

Explore, imagine and entertain - Appealing to the senses
One way of being creative is appealing to the senses.
Let's go back to our description of a coastline. Imagine you want to write about a cliff, concentrating on the sense of sound, sight, touch, taste and smell.
- the waves crashed on the rocks beneath and I heard the gulls screaming above me.
- the heavy, grey rocks looked as if they were about to slide into the leaden sea.
-the wind lifted my hair and I felt sudden gusts sting my face.
- the spray from the waves hit my face and I could taste the salty water on my lips.
- the damp, warm scent of the seaweed rose gently.
Now, see if you can use the same list of senses to describe another sea scene. This time, describe a sunny beach. You don't have to tell a story, just make your description come alive and imagine that you really are there. Once you've written it, compare your ideas to ours on the next page...
Can you match Viral Vinnie's appetite for English, Maths and Science?

373,185,"To multiply 237 by 4 without using a calculator, you can set it out like this:
Start with 4  7, which is 28, so write the 8 and carry the 2 to the tens column.
4  3 = 12, but remember to add the carried 2 to get 14. Write the 4 and carry the 1 to the hundreds column.
4  2 = 8, and we add the carried 1 to get 9.

374,482,"A sentence is made up of words put together to do a certain job.
Let's take a look at what those pieces are and how they fit together to make a sentence.
First, we have words. Words are the smallest meaningful bits of sense.
Each of these words does a different job.
is a verb - it tells us what happens in a sentence.
is a noun - it names things in a sentence.
is an adjective - it gives us more detail about a noun.
We put words together to make a
A phrase is a short, single piece of information:
We use phrases to make a clause.
A clause is a larger word group that includes a little more information. It consists at least two phrases - one is a noun phrase known as the subject, and the other is the verb.
In this clause, the noun phrase is
This now takes us to the sentence.
If we put a capital letter at the beginning of the clause we've used, and a full stop at the end, we have a sentence.
. A simple sentence consists of one clause that has a subject and a verb. A simple sentence puts across one simple idea.
A complex sentence is used to put across more
ideas. A complex sentence contains one main clause that can make sense on its own, and one or more minor clauses that are linked to it.
The main clause is the 'big dog barked' because it has a subject and a verb and makes sense by itself.
The minor clause is 'When I arrived'. Although it is a clause with a subject and a verb, it doesn't make sense on its own, it needs a main clause.
We can add more minor clauses to make a more complex sentence.
We can even split the main clause with a minor clause and still have a complex sentence.

375,499,"> Drama - Drama from your imagination
Taking part in drama doesn't always involve learning lines from scripts - often you'll be asked to improvise. Usually you will work in groups or pairs to devise a piece of drama from your own imagination. You'll need to be able to think on your feet and become a different character.
This might sound difficult, but you've probably improvised before without realising it - in games you used to play as a child. If you've ever played pirates, nurses or superheroes when you were younger, you were improvising - although don't think running around your classroom with a tablecloth for a cape pretending to be Superman will impress your drama teacher - it probably won't!
As with any English work, you need to think about your audience when you devise drama. Your drama needs to entertain them and keep their attention. Your drama also needs to be believable - your audience is likely to become disconnected if your story or characters are too far fetched.
The story of your drama begins with your character. Ask yourself: what does my character feel, think and react?
Here are two ideas for a character:
You are a journalist who has uncovered a story that will have big consequences and you're about to tell the world. Would your character be confident or scared?
You are a global superstar - singer, actor and producer - and paparazzi follow your every move. You live a glamorous and privileged life, but what are the secrets behind the smiles?
When you have decided on your character, you need to create a scene.
Here are some ideas for a scene based on the characters above. Can you think of any more?
You're about to appear on the most popular morning TV programme and expose your discovery when you suddenly receive a startling phone call. Who is on the phone? What do they say? How do they make you feel?
You've landed a part in a popular soap but you don't get on with the other actors. Should you tell the press the truth or pretend that you all get along?
You've been working late in the library just double checking a few facts for your article when you notice a menacing looking man watching you. Does your character panic or keep calm? Do they run or confront the man? Maybe they are being paranoid?
The press have published some false rumours about you and you're really upset. Your agent has secured a slot on a popular chat show to give your side of the story. Do you accept the offer or decide to lie low? How do you feel?
Your article has been published and has been a massive hit. You're receiving job offers from high profile newspapers and magazines and your life is about to change for the better. How do your family react? What do you decide to do?
You've found out that one of the other band members is planning to leave the group and go solo. You confront them - can you persuade them to stay, or would it be better for everyone if they left?
When you have a rough idea of your character and scene, you can think about what your character might say. If you're given time to prepare you should write a short script. If working in pairs or a group, you could improvise the scene first to get more ideas.
You may be allowed to use props to make your scene more realistic and interesting. Only use a prop if it is relevant, otherwise it could end up distracting you and your audience. If you decide to use props and costumes, always practice with them first.

. Examples include time, height and weight.
Because continuous data can take any value, there are an infinite number of possible outcomes. So
before it can be represented in a frequency table or statistical diagram.
When choosing groups for the data, make sure that each piece of data can be placed in one (and only one) of the groups.
You are investigating the length of time each member of a class spends on the internet per week. Look at the class groupings below - do you think they are right?
, because the times of '10 hours' and '20 hours' can be entered into two different groups.
For example, the time 10 hours can be entered into 0  time 10 (where time is less than or equal to 10 hours), and also into 10  time  20 (where time is more than or equal to 10 hours).
, because the times '10 hours' and '20 hours' cannot be entered into any of the groups.
For example, the time 10 hours can neither be entered into 0 < time < 10 (where time is less than 10 hours), nor can it be entered into 10 < time < 20 (where time is more than 10 hours).
'10 hours' is included in the second group, but not the first and '20 hours' is included in the third group, but not the second.

Energy transfer and storage - Energy transfer diagrams
Energy transfer diagrams show the locations of
. For example, consider the energy transfers in the simple electrical circuit below.
We can show the transfers like this:
the energy to the surroundings by light. These are the
energy transfers - we use electric lamps to light up our rooms.
But there are also energy transfers that are not useful to us. In the example above, the lamp also transfers energy to the surroundings by
. If we include this energy transfer, the diagram looks like this:
Sankey diagrams summarise all the energy transfers taking place in a process. The thicker the line or arrow, the greater the amount of energy involved. This Sankey diagram for the lamp shows that it transfers most of the energy by heating, rather than by light:
Notice that the total amount of energy transferred to the surroundings is the same as the amount of electrical energy. We say that the energy has been conserved. Energy is always conserved, it is never ""lost"" or ""wasted"", although some energy transfers are useful and some are not.

384,112,"> Drama - Working from a script
There's much more to acting than just reading a script out loud. If you're nervous, it's tempting to read the lines really quickly, using the same tone of voice all the way through, but this isn't very interesting for your audience.
Try to think of the punctuation as musical notes telling you when to pause for a breath (or for dramatic effect!). Don't be tempted to take a little break at the end of each line - the piece might not make sense.
To understand this, first read the script below, pausing at the end of each line. Then try again using the punctuation as your guide for when to pause.
Juliet is waiting for the nurse to come home and tell her whether the wedding with Romeo is still on. Time is ticking and she's pretty fed up.
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood
She would be as swift in motion as a ball:
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
But old folks, many feign as they were dead -
Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.
Which way worked better? Using the punctuation as your guide makes it sound like a real person thinking aloud.
Don't be such a drama queen! Try this activity.
Talk your way out of trouble using your English skills.
Get creative, go backstage and find drama tips and inspiration.

Acids, bases and metals - Reactions of acids with metals
Acids react with most metals and a salt is produced. But unlike the reaction between acids and bases we don't get any water. Instead we get
This is the general word equation for the reaction:
The salt produced depends upon the metal and the acid. Here are two examples:
It doesn't matter which metal or acid is used, if there is a reaction we always get hydrogen gas as well as the salt.
There is a simple laboratory test to see if a gas is hydrogen. A lighted wooden splint goes pop if it is put into a test tube of hydrogen. This is because the flame ignites the hydrogen, which burns explosively to make a loud sound.
All acids contain hydrogen atoms. Apart from hydrochloric acid, this is not clear from their names, but you can tell they contain hydrogen from their chemical formulae. Remember that the chemical symbol for hydrogen is H.

387,127,"There are two main types of language: literal and figurative.
Literal language is explicit, obvious, out in the open and plainly stated. It is a major part of non-fiction texts, but can also be found in fiction.
Figurative language infers or suggests things rather than stating them. Figurative language can give a text more richness and depth. It is often found in fiction texts and autobiographies, but can also be found in non-fiction.

The Tempest second key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Second Key Extract takes place outside Prospero's cave. Ferdinand is carrying logs. He thinks to himself that he doesn't mind the hard work because he is doing it for Miranda,
Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble.
even if her father is cruel and grumpy.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
Miranda comes to see him. Neither of them realise that Prospero is watching them from a distance.
On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance?
Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
but he says he has too much to do, so she offers to carry some logs for him.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
He says he would rather break his back than see her work. Miranda insists again that she should help him.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Looking on, Prospero sees how much Miranda is in love with Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Ferdinand asks Miranda her name and when she tells him, she remembers that in doing so, she has broken her promise to her father.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand admits that he has liked lots of different women in the past
Ferdinand uses the word 'bondage' to describe his reaction to listening to beautiful women talk. It links back to the issue of Freedom and Slavery in the play. Ferdinand means that he has been like a slave to beautiful women in the past.
, but they have always disappointed him with some fault or other in the end.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
However, Miranda, he says, is perfect. Miranda, on the other hand, hasn't met any men except for her father, or any women, except for herself. Even so, she says that she can't imagine liking anyone more than she likes Ferdinand.
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand tells her that he is a prince, possibly a king (although he hopes his father isn't dead). He wouldn't usually put up with having to carry logs like a slave
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
but he knew as soon as he saw Miranda that he'd do anything for her. When Miranda asks him if he loves her, Ferdinand says he loves, prizes and honours her more than anything else in the world. This makes Miranda so happy that she cries. As Prospero watches them together, he is moved.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Ferdinand asks Miranda why she is crying. She says she thinks she isn't good enough for him
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!
but realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else. Ferdinand happily agrees to marry her. They say goodbye and part.
Prospero is happy for them, but he claims that their engagement is no surprise to him as it was all part of his plan. He goes to get his magic book because he has lots of work to do before supper time.
Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance?
Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.

Within a population of animals, plants or any living organisms, there will be
. Within each species the individuals with the variations best suited to the environment will survive better than the others. More of them will survive to reproduce than the others. When they do, they pass on the genetic information for these variations to their offspring.
Species gradually evolve in this way. This process is called
Over time a population can change so much it may even become a new species, unable to reproduce successfully with individuals of the original species.
to produce new varieties of a species. A variety is a type of a particular species that is different in some clear way from other varieties of that species.
For example, pedigree dogs come in lots of different varieties, called breeds of dog. They may be different colours and sizes, but they are all still dogs. They are all still the same species. Different varieties of dog have been produced by selective breeding.
Suppose you wanted a variety of cow that produced a lot of milk. This is what you could do:
choose or select the cows in your herd that produce the most milk
select the offspring that produce the most milk
keep repeating the process of selection and breeding until you achieve your goal.
The key here is to identify the feature you want, and only breed from the individuals that have that feature. Here are some examples of what selective breeding can produce:
hens that lay big eggs of a particular colour
tomato plants that produce lots of tomatoes

1. This is an extract from the Anthony Shea Community School newsletter:
During the past three years, mobile phones have become more and more popular. Growing numbers of our students bring them to school, and parents encourage this as they can stay in touch with their children and know they are safe. However, many of our students keep their phone on during the day which can disturb lessons. A number of phone thefts have also occurred recently, both in and out of school. I would like to call a meeting to discuss this issue with staff, parents and students. I don't want to ban them, but we must agree on how they can be used sensibly and safely.
Write a speech to be given at this meeting analysing the advantages and disadvantages of allowing mobiles in school and suggest how they can be used sensibly and safely.
2. Read this extract, which considers the issue of horror movies:
As a parent, I have constant battles over TV and films. My children feel they should be allowed to watch whatever they want, no matter how violent, gory or creepy. They say it's just entertainment, and that it has no effect on them. I don't agree! Many of the films are rated 18, and my oldest is 14. I'm afraid my kids will become more aggressive and uncaring towards people, or that they might end up seeing something which really disturbs them.
Write an article for your school magazine commenting on why horror movies are popular with teenagers and explaining the advantages and disadvantages of parents banning them at home.

Graphs - Plotting y = ax + b using tables
To plot a graph, you need to find some coordinates that satisfy the equation of the graph.
Plot the graph of y = 2x + 1
We need to choose values for x and see what value of y they give.
y = (2  -2) + 1 = -3
y = (2  0) + 1 = 1
y = (2  2) + 1 = 5
You can show this in a table:
You can now plot these points and join them to give the graph of y = 2x + 1:

There are two types of circuit we can make, called
The components in a circuit are joined by wires.
if there are no branches then it's a series circuit
if there are branches it's a parallel circuit
In a television series, you get several episodes, one after the other. A series circuit is similar. You get several components one after the other.
If you follow the circuit diagram from one side of the cell to the other, you should pass through all the different components, one after the other, without any branches.
If you put more lamps into a series circuit, the lamps will be dimmer than before.
In a series circuit, if a lamp breaks or a component is disconnected, the circuit is broken and all the components stop working.
Series circuits are useful if you want a warning that one of the components in the circuit has failed. They also use less wiring than parallel circuits.
In parallel circuits different components are connected on different branches of the wire. If you follow the circuit diagram from one side of the cell to the other, you can only pass through all the different components if you follow all the
In a parallel circuit, if a lamp breaks or a component is disconnected from one parallel wire, the components on different branches
. And, unlike a series circuit, the lamps stay bright if you add more lamps in parallel.
Parallel circuits are useful if you want everything to work, even if one component has failed. This is why our homes are wired up with parallel circuits.

402,2914,"Metals are extracted from ores. An ore is a rock that contains enough of a mineral (metal compound) for the metal to be extracted from it. Most metals are extracted from an ore by reduction with carbon or by electrolysis.
Metals such as zinc, iron and copper are present in ores as their
. Each of these oxides is heated with carbon to obtain the metal.
iron oxide + carbon  iron + carbon dioxide
(s) + 3C(s)  4Fe(l) + 3CO
The source of carbon for this reduction is
, obtained by heating coal in the absence of oxygen. Note that the iron is
when it is formed, due to the very high temperature at which the reaction takes place.
Some metals, such as aluminium, are so
that their oxides cannot be reduced by carbon.
. For example, copper(II) chloride contains positively charged copper ions and negatively charged chloride ions. Ionic substances can be
into the elements they are made from by electricity, in a process called
For electrolysis to work, the ions must be
, the ions break free from the ionic lattice. These ions are then free to move.
For example, if electricity is passed through copper(II) chloride solution, the copper(II) chloride is broken down to form copper metal and chlorine gas.
There is a similar result if electricity is passed through molten copper(II) chloride.
The solution or molten ionic compound is called an
. The negative electrode is called the
, while the positive electrode is called the
Positively charged ions move to the negative electrode. Metal ions are positively charged, so metals are produced at the negative electrode (cathode).
Negatively charged ions move to the positive electrode. Non-metal ions, such as oxide ions and chloride ions, are negatively charged, so gases such as oxygen or chlorine are produced at the positive electrode (anode).
metal on Earth. Despite this, it is
, largely because of the amount of
. The bauxite is purified to yield a white powder, aluminium oxide, from which aluminium can be extracted.
. But first the aluminium oxide must be made
so that electricity can pass through it. Aluminium oxide has a very high melting point (over 2,000C), so it would be expensive to melt it. Instead, it is
, an aluminium compound with a lower melting point than aluminium oxide. The use of cryolite reduces some of the energy costs involved in extracting aluminium.
The diagram shows an aluminium oxide electrolysis tank. Both the negative electrode (cathode) and positive electrode (anode) are made of
forms at the negative electrode and sinks to the bottom of the tank, where it is tapped off.
forms at the positive electrodes. This oxygen reacts with the carbon of the positive electrodes, forming carbon dioxide, and they gradually burn away. Consequently, the positive electrodes have to be replaced frequently, which adds to the cost of the process.

Given the equation for the extraction of a metal, it is possible to calculate the mass of
What mass of iron metal can be made from 5 tonnes of iron(III) oxide?
(s) + 3C(s) = 4Fe(l) + 3CO
C = 12, Fe = 56, O = 16
These relative atomic masses can be used to find the
has the formula mass = (2 x 56) + (3 x 16) = 160
produces 4Fe. Working this out in tonnes gives:
= (2 x 160) = 320 tonnes produces 4Fe = (4 x 56) = 224 tonnes of iron metal.
5 tonnes of iron(III) oxide produces 5 x 224/320 = 3.5 tonnes of iron.
It is also possible to calculate the maximum mass of a metal that can be obtained from a specific mass of ore by comparing their formulae.
contains 2 x 56 = 112 tonnes of Fe
5 tonnes of iron(III) oxide produces 5 x 112/160 = 3.5 tonnes of iron.
During electrolysis, metal ions, which are positive, gain electrons from the negative electrode (cathode) to form
In the extraction of aluminium, this is the equation for the reaction at the
At the positive electrode (anode), non-metal ions, which are negative, lose electrons to form neutral atoms. These atoms join to make molecules of the non-metal element, such as a molecules of oxygen gas.
In the extraction of aluminium, this is the equation for the reaction at the
The removal of electrons from the cathode and addition of electrons to the anode means that an

407,7331,"One government that is often seen as an example of 'reforming' by introducing positive changes that really improve peoples' lives is the Liberal government in Britain of 1906-1914. Many historians label this period the beginning of the
A state (or a country) where the government provides welfare benefits such as education, health care, and unemployment payment to its population free at the point of use, although paid for by general taxation.
, but why did the Liberal government introduce its reforms?
Some governments in history seem to have implemented changes that have particularly improved people's lives. For instance, Roosevelt's New Deal in America, or the Labour government in Britain after the First World War. The dynamism and positive achievements of these governments make them look much better than the governments that came before or after them.
A study of poverty in 1901 by Seebohm Rowntree found that in a society where those who didn't work didn't eat, there were three times in people's lives when they were especially vulnerable:
After 1906, the Liberal government, with Lloyd George as Chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced reforms to help these three groups:
Children and Young Persons Act introduced a set of regulations that became known as the
. This imposed severe punishments for neglecting or treating children cruelly. It was made illegal to sell cigarettes to children or send them out begging. Separate juvenile courts were set up, which sent children convicted of a crime to

was passed. Part 1 of the act gave people the right to
of 10s a week for 26 weeks in return for a payment of 4d a week. Part 2 of the Act gave people the right to unemployment pay (
) of 7s 6d a week for 15 weeks in return for a payment of 2d a week.
1906 - the Trades Disputes Act ruled that unions were not liable for damages because of strikes.
1906 - the Workers Compensation Act granted compensation for injury at work.
1910 - half-day a week off for shop workers.
A Merchant Shipping Act improved conditions for sailors.
From 1911, MPs were paid. This gave working men the opportunity to stand for election.
Why did the Liberal government introduce these reforms?
in 1901 found that 28 per cent of the population did not have the minimum to live on at some time of their life.
- when Britain went to war in 1899, the army found that two-thirds of the men who volunteered for the army were unfit to join up.
- which had a good system of state welfare for workers, was passing Britain as a great industrial power.
meant politicians feared that, unless standards of living improved for the workers, they might turn to Communism or rebellion.
and it was attracting working-class voters because of its demands for welfare reform.
Liberal Party did not get a majority
of seats in the House of Commons, so it had a coalition with the 42 Labour Party MPs who had been elected.
Many government politicians, especially Lloyd George, genuinely wanted to

By 1914, 1 million people were being employed through the labour exchange.
Most of these jobs were temporary or part-time; the government did not do anything to increase the number of jobs available.

Poor people had to pay the contributions out of their wages; dole and sickness pay only lasted for a limited time; and

was not enough to live on - a family of five needed 1 a week.
Only for the wage-earner - it was not available to their wife or children.
A plan for expected income and spending over a specified time period.
- to pay for the reforms, Lloyd George's 1909 budget raised duties on tobacco and spirits, raised income tax by 16 per cent (from 1s to 1s 2d), and introduced a new 20 per cent tax on profits from selling land.
When the House of Lords refused to pass Lloyd George's budget, the House of Commons passed an Act stating that the House of Lords could not reject a bill that had been passed three times in the House of Commons. It also required a general election every five, not seven, years.
Lloyd George became loved - old people cried when they got their pension and blessed 'Lord George' who gave them - and hated - workers who objected to paying national insurance chanted: 'Taffy was a Welshman, taffy was a thief' at him.

412,2529,"is not just a book about a man who creates a Monster. Mary Shelley intended her readers to learn from her tale. It contains many of her ideas on how people should behave. These were shaped by her upbringing, relationship with Shelley, and her reading of the works of many famous authors and philosophers. These ideas can be summed up in the main
The novel begins with Walton describing his own voyage of discovery, which he hopes will lead him to the North Pole. On meeting Victor, he hears of another tale of discovery, that of the secret of creating life itself.
The Monster is also on a path of self-discovery, and all three characters share a powerful desire to acquire knowledge - a desire that ultimately leads two of them to their deaths, and which very nearly kills Walton.
The Monster quite naturally seeks knowledge about where it came from and how to survive in a hostile world. Through patient
, it learns how to speak and read. But the knowledge it gains only leads it to curse its existence.
It knows that it can never be accepted in the world of man, yet craves human company and the love of the father who abandoned it. Finally, through learning of the 'sanguinary (bloody) laws of man', the Monster is taught that it can be acceptable to kill in some circumstances. This knowledge leads to the deaths of many innocent people.
Robert Walton was brought up by his uncle, and is self-taught in the art of sea-faring. This is despite his father's dying wish that his uncle forbid him from embarking on a life at sea. His determination to succeed, shown by his willingness to work ""harder than the common sailors during the day (and devote his) nights to the study of mathematics medicine... and physical sciences"", leads him to believe he can be the first to discover the sea passage to the North Pole. However, his real motivation is self-glory, fuelled by overwhelming ambition. This leads to him failing to assess the dangers of his voyage and knowingly putting the lives of his crew at risk.
Victor Frankenstein also puts others' lives at risk, as well as his own, through his ambitious pursuit of knowledge. He neglects his loving family and allows his health to suffer greatly in his obsession to discover the secret of creating life out of death.
Shelley makes it clear she believes knowledge such as this cannot lead to good. Some benefit may have come from finding a way to the North Pole, but no good is shown to come from Victor's creation of the Monster.
She shows Victor's 'success' to have severe and tragic consequences that should serve as a warning to scientists, past, present and future, that knowledge is a very dangerous thing and should only be used for the good of mankind - and certainly not personal gain.

413,6357,"More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs] have high levels of economic development compared with Less Economically Developed Countries [LEDCs]. Many MEDCs make allowance in their domestic budgets to provide aid to LEDCs. This aid may be given as part of a planned process or as a response to an emergency. Many charities also exist to provide aid to LEDCs.

Perhaps Clarke chose this structure because, in a way, it reflects what the poem suggests about memory - the main points are fixed but the details are looser.
Think about how the language the poet uses helps to convey her ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is the scene of the near-tragedy, Cold Knap Lake, an artificial lake in a park in Glamorgan. It is haunting that the name of the lake includes the word Cold - it is a word we associate with fear and death, ideas that are explored in the poem.

(line 14). We are not told specifically why she was beaten - perhaps her parents were angry with her for the trouble she had caused, or found that hitting her was a way of venting the anxiety they had when they realised she was missing. Either way, the beating troubled Clarke so much that she wonders whether it actually happened -

She says, ""When you recapture a memory from early childhood, you're sometimes not sure if you were really there, if someone told you about it, or if you read it in a story.

Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint.
Both express love. Shakespeare writes to his mistress, Hopkins writes about a much-loved landscape.
Shakespeare mocks the common cliches that poets use about their mistresses - lips redder than coral, breasts whiter than snow, etc - to emphasise the reality of his love. Hopkins also wants to get away from the cliched use of language - by inventing words, like rollrock and twindles, to pinpoint his meaning.
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint, and both express danger as well as beauty.
However, in Clarke's poem man has caused the destruction already (cutting hay kills the field mouse; war is taking place in Bosnia) - Hopkins' poem is a plea to stop man from causing destruction.
Images or things (usually physical, like a flag) that stand for or represent something else - usually abstractions, like a nation. A crucifix is a symbol of Christianity.
to convey their message. The central image for Clarke is the field mouse, which represents all the innocent, vulnerable people in the world who are killed or injured. Inversnaid represents all areas of wet and wilderness in the world that mankind could jeopardise.
Both poems describe watery river scenes, but while Perch is purely a vivid word-picture, Inversnaid contains more of an explicit 'message'.
The language in Perch has many similarities with the Hopkins poem: combination words and word-plays (alder-dapple, finland of perch) dialect and obsolete words (grunt, slub, runty, adoze) and lots of sound devices. The unorthodox grammar of on hold / In the everything flows and steady go of the world (where the last 8 words make up a giant compound noun) is very like Hopkins.
While the Hopkins poem is full of movement, and ranges over the landscape, the Heaney poem stays very still and focused on the almost motionless fish, adoze in the current.
How does the rhythm and rhyme scheme of Perch compare with that of Inversnaid?
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint, describing an experience which is for the poet is intensely present.
Both poets use an extended image to put their point across. The canary-yellow cotton jacket is the central image in Homecoming. A row over the jacket caused the family row; the reconciliation is likened to putting the jacket back on. For Hopkins, the darksome burn represents all areas of wilderness in the world that could be vulnerable to man.
language to help us 'hear' events in the poem - Temper, temper... Blue murder. Hopkins uses different techniques -
Words strung together with repeated (often initial) consonants, eg Max made many men mad.
Words that sound the same through the use of similar vowels or consonants, eg hot and slop or fold and filled.
The pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of poetry.
- to help us hear the sound of the rushing water.
The way a text is built and shaped. Chapters, plot, acts and scenes, stanzas, narrative, verse-form, rhyme and rhythm - all these (and many more) are aspects of structure.
In poetry, the use of words which have the same or a similar sound - eg 'flow' and 'bow' - to form a pattern of sound.

to show the intensity of the love, while Hopkins invents words or uses dialect (a windpuff bonnet of fawn-froth) to convey his feelings.
Anne Hathaway's love of Shakespeare is confident and will last forever - I hold him in the casket of my widow's head - while Hopkins' is more tentative - he fears for the future and asks What would the world be? without the wilderness his poem evokes.

416,2826,"Compare your answer with the hints below:
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Both poems are about water when it is dangerous. Clarke describes a near-drowning while Heaney describes the savage sea in a storm.
In Clarke's poem the water seems to subtly hide its dangers (e.g. satiny mud blooms in cloudiness) but Heaney recognises its force and violence - the flung spray hits the very windows.
Clarke uses the image of water to question our powers of memory, whereas Heaney uses it to show the power of nature.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Like Heaney, Whitman describes a violent storm at sea.
Like Clarke, however, Whitman hints at the supernatural. His references to demoniac laughter and the savage trinity seem on the surface more threatening than the fairytale references in Clarke's poem.
We question the endings of both poems. We wonder about the dim weird forms that Whitman sees and about the lost things that Clarke imagines drowned in the lake.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Yet for Clare, the water is innocent. It is part of the beauty of summer as it supports the wildlife: marsh marigolds and water lilies, moor hens and insects. Clarke also suggests the beauty of the water (e.g. long green silk), but for her it could be hiding something potentially sinister, while for Clare it is simply the clear lake.
The sonnet form suggests Clare's love of the water, while Clarke's use of alternating stanzas and half rhyme suggests an uncertainty. She cannot be sure what is under the water; she cannot be sure of her memory.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

420,1137,"A theme is a subject or idea that keeps appearing in the text. You usually find more than one theme in a story. They help to hold the story together, and often encourage us to think more about the plot, and what lies beyond it
""You're so innocent, you didn't realise. You're too trusting, too kind, you don't know what these people can be like.""
The narrator wishes her daughter was still innocent like a young child. She is shocked and disgusted at the evidence she finds of her growing experience.
The mother also feels guilty and ashamed of her own sexual experience before marriage, and has kept it a secret. This relates to the narrator's obsession with purity.
The word 'white' is often mentioned. And cleanliness is important to her, too.
The daughter, by contrast, is seen as 'dirty', lying 'on a pile of filth', living the most sordid life the narrator can imagine.
What is interesting about these contrasting ideas is that we realise things are not always what they seem. The narrator seems to have high moral standards, but when she was young she broke the rules, too.
""I had to help with the housework but my brother did nothing.""
The narrator seems to have different standards for men and women:
It's OK for men to use bad language, but not women.
Fathers are in charge, and might be strict if you do not abide by the rules.
Men do not like to talk about emotions.
Women should keep the house tidy and learn to cook.
Women should not say how they feel. They should also avoid being rude.
When a man loses his temper, a woman should accept this and not defend herself.
Women who try to make themselves look attractive are 'tarts'.
Girls who are curious about sex before marriage are 'dirty'.
Which of these points do you agree or disagree with?
You may think it is no wonder the daughter ran away. You might also comment that these expectations belong to a different era to the modern day.
""Rows of high heels, all of them too small for her, she was so vain, all of them moulded to the shape of her feet.""
The narrator wants to control her daughter, but finds that she cannot do this.
The narrator feels the need to control her emotions. She finds this increasingly difficult as the story progresses.
The daughter displays a lack of control: she loses her temper, drinks alcohol, binges on food, and does not want to wait until marriage before having sex.
The narrator's mother displayed a lack of control, too: she was ""plump"", said things without thinking, and had rows of shoes that were too small for her - but wore them anyway, rather than sensible shoes.
The narrator finds comfort in the fact that she can lock up the shoes, tie them together, make them clean, and keep them safe and warm in bed.
""They're best in here with me I think, safe and warm in bed. Tucked up tight.""
The narrator could not live up to her father's expectations.
Her daughter is not living up to her expectations.
The narrator is sad that she was not close to her mother.
She recognises the distance between herself and her daughter's generation.

422,245,"They have got to pay back the money they borrowed.
Jamie needs to give far more explanation. He should use business terms and show he understands what fixed costs are.
They have to pay Ashley's father each month, as well as the loan from the bank. They may have other costs, like the cleaning materials they buy to run their business.
Morag started her answer quite well, mentioning both loans which, as fixed costs, have to be repaid. The cleaning materials, however, form part of the variable, rather than the fixed costs.
Costs which have to be paid, regardless of the level of output, are called fixed costs. Martin and Ashley have the fixed costs of repaying Ashley's dad 50 a month, and they probably pay bank interest on the loan. Their pay is a fixed cost. They might want to consider paying themselves piece rate, to help their business survive. The road tax and insurance on the van are fixed costs they have to pay. They have already bought the van, so this is a sunk cost, and no longer a fixed cost they have to pay.
Rani's answer would probably get a A grade. She has answered the question well, and has shown she can use business terms like fixed costs. She has thought about the pay they only receive when they have the business, and correctly counted it as a fixed cost.

Often they need to be printed as well, using either block-printing or screen-printing techniques. Garments are assembled using various joining techniques including sewing, fusing and heat-sealing. Finishing is a process which improves the appearance, handle and performance of fabrics; while pressing is used to shape and stabilise fabrics.

Before dyeing and printing the fabric is prepared by washing, bleaching and
treating cotton yarn with an alkali to improve its strength, lustre and receptivity to dye.
In industrial production fabric is dyed by continuous or batch dyeing:
, the fabric passes through a dye bath. The fabric is then squeezed between rollers to spread the dye evenly and remove excess dye. Continuous dyeing is used for colours that do not need to change too quickly with fashion.
, fabrics are produced without dye. They are then dyed to order in large batches according to the colours required. Batch dyeing is used for colours that need to change frequently with fashion.
Fabrics are printed by block or screen printing:
is done using metal or wooden blocks, one for each colour. The background shapes are cut away to leave a raised design on the block. Dye is applied and stamped onto the fabric. This is a very slow process used by specialised craft industries.
a pattern is printed onto fabric through a
a sheet of paper, celluloid, or other material in which a design has been cut, so that when ink is passed over the sheet the design is reproduced on the surface below
held in place by a screen. Each screen prints one part of the design in one colour. After printing the dyestuff must be fixed using steam or dry heat.
The graphics show three different types of screen printing.

automates this process, with the fabric moved through the machine on a conveyor belt and the print repeating rapidly.

and roller squeegees - one roller for each colour; this is a very fast process used in the continuous printing of furnishing and clothing fabrics.

resin. Fusing is sometimes done by hand, sometimes by machine.
Fusing by hand is used to join Vilene to fabric to make it stable and strong. It is also used to reinforce and strengthen fabrics for garments, bags and accessories; and allows hems to be turned up without stitching.
In a factory there are two types of machine used for fusing: a flat-bed press is used to join short fabric lengths for batch production; a conveyor press is used for fusing long fabric lengths for mass production.
is used for synthetic fibres made from thermoplastics, such as polyester or nylon. Heat-sealing is used to set a material into a shape, eg pleats. It is also use to seal the seams on all-weather gear and tents to make them waterproof.
In industry a range of different sewing machines are used for stitching seams, embroidery, buttonholes etc. The main ones are listed in the table below:
Stitches, cuts and finishes seams in one process
Finishing is done to improve a product's appearance, properties and quality. It covers many different processes, some mechanical and some chemical.
Mechanical finishing uses heat, pressure and rollers to improve the appearance of the fabric.

using caustic soda. Mercerised fabrics are stronger, dye well and have improved lustre.
Wool can be given a shrink-resist finish using silicone or Teflon. This results in soft, smooth, lustrous yarns and fabrics that are machine-washable.
Cotton and viscose fabrics are given a crease-resistant finish using
'raw' plastic, especially when in semi-liquid form (Resistant materials). Substances (eg acrylics and urethanes) which, applied to a fabric's surface, evaporate to leave a film upon it (Textiles technology).

Some knowledge of ancient Egyptian civilisation will help you to understand Egyptian medicine.
The Egyptian civilisation was the first of the great world civilisations, and the
of this society led to important spin-offs into medicine.
, with an organised government, laws and social conventions. This was a society in which people were wealthy enough to pay to take care of their health.
, which required temples, priests and rituals that included mummification. Their experience of mummification taught the priests about the workings of the human body, and some members of the priesthood evolved into professional doctors.
Further still, the Egyptians invented the skills of
, which Egyptian doctors were able to use to develop their ideas and record their cures.
The ancient Egyptians travelled and traded all over the known world, and brought back all kinds of herbs and spices, which their doctors then used to heal certain diseases. Most of all, they developed a wealthy way of life, which left them time for observation and reflection.
From their observations of the irrigation channels used by farmers to water their crops came an important medical development - the invention of the

431,4962,"In this Revision Bite we are going to look at standard index form and zero, negative and fractional powers.
Adding and subtracting numbers in standard index form:
Convert them into ordinary numbers, do the calculation, then change them back if you want the answer in standard form.
Multiplying and dividing numbers in standard form:
Here you can use the rules for multiplying and dividing powers. Remember these rules:
To multiply powers you add, eg, 10
To divide powers you subtract, eg, 10
Multiply 2 by 3 and add the powers of 10:
If not, remember that you should first work out 36  6, then work subtract the powers of 10 (because it is division), like this:
) = (36  6) x (10
In the previous pages, we only looked at positive whole number powers. We can also find zero, negative and fractional powers. The rules below apply to these powers.

433,5428,"You need to go to the exam with strategies that will help you work well under pressure. Here are some suggestions:
You are usually given 5 minutes to read through the paper before the tape starts. Use this to your advantage by looking right through the paper so see what kind of tasks there are.
Look closely! Should you listen for precise information (like train arrival and departure times)? Or should you be listening to the whole passage, in order to draw a conclusion (for example, name the girl who has the best relationship with her parents)?
As you read the question, try to predict the sort of information that may be in the passage. It will help focus your mind.
Look at the title of the question or section very carefully. Make sure you understand
to give your answer. If there is an example, look closely at the answer given - it will show you whether you need to write a single letter, a single word, or more than one word.
Have a good look at any illustrations. They could give important clues as to what is coming.
word - there is probably a lot of 'redundant' language you don't need. Be positive. Concentrate on what you do understand. Sometimes the passage can be difficult, but the questions are easy.
Use your knowledge of grammar. For example, it may be important to know whether someone is talking about the past, the present, or the future.
Use your knowledge of Spanish-speaking countries. For example, if you hear someone was on holiday in Madrid, it is unlikely they spent time on the beach.
Don't just listen to the words. The tone of someone's voice may also be helpful - for example in telling you if they are making a statement or asking a question.
If you have to write answers in Spanish, remember you will not be penalised for minor spelling mistakes.
Don't just read it, practise your Spanish with downloadable audio bites.

436,4852,"Generators can be turned directly, for example, by:
When electricity is generated using wave, wind, tidal or hydroelectric power (HEP) there are two steps:
Generators can be turned indirectly using fossil or nuclear fuels. The heat from the fuel boils water to make steam, which expands and pushes against the blades of a
. The spinning turbine then turns the generator.
These are the steps by which electricity is generated from fossil fuels:
Heat is released from fuel and boils the water to make steam.
The turbine turns a generator and electricity is produced.

437,3531,"Once you have understood how to use the plot and the characters, you should move onto the themes. The themes are the basic ideas in Othello - we have already met one - the play deals with the subject of jealousy and revenge. There are others, such as race and foreign cultures or appearance and reality.
Perhaps the most obvious subject or theme in
. Iago is the key to almost everything that happens. He has been passed over for promotion, so he dislikes Othello and must be jealous of Cassio. He thinks Othello might also have slept with his wife. However, we can never be completely sure what motivates Iago to be so destructive - he manages to get Cassio dismissed but then Iago doesn't seem interested in Cassio's job, only in causing more problems. We also learn that Iago has tried many times in the past to steal the handkerchief that means so much to Othello. This tells us that he was planning against Othello long before his promotion was blocked.
Jealousy affects most other characters as well. Othello cannot bear the fact that his wife might be having an affair and Iago cleverly plays on this. For instance, when Othello thinks his wife is honest and needs proof of the affair, Iago asks if he would want to see her 'topped' (i.e. with a man on top of her) but then tells Othello to calm down and that his mind 'perhaps may change'. Of course it won't - Iago presents the worst image possible to Othello knowing the damage it will cause.
Jealousy affects almost all of us at sometime in our lives, and Shakespeare shows the destructive effects it has throughout the play. In fact only two characters seem unaffected by jealousy - Desdemona and Cassio. Desdemona dies, but everyone realises what a good woman she was, and Cassio is rewarded by taking Othello's place as general (and by deciding Iago's punishment).

439,5729,"Making decisions on moral issues is not easy. Religion helps followers to make decisions that are pleasing to God and create a society where people respect and care for each other
People draw on a variety of sources of authority to help them make a decision. For example:
religious leaders and the official teaching of their religion
There are two types of morality that affect the decisions people make  absolute morality and relative morality.
If you believe in absolute morality you will have faith that there is a right course of action to take in a moral dilemma, which is true in all situations regardless of culture, religious tradition, time or age.
How would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment Do not kill? They would try to make sure that they were not involved in any killing, which would affect their views on issues such as war, abortion and euthanasia. They would say that these actions are wrong in all circumstances.
If you believe in relative morality you would agree that different courses of action might be needed in different situations.
How would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment Do not kill? They would agree that killing is wrong, but would look at a range of other issues as well and say that sometimes killing might be necessary in a particular situation, such as abortion, if continuing the pregnancy would result in the birth of a very disabled child, or if the mother had been raped.

440,5973,"William Blake: The Little Boy Lost / The Little Boy Found
is about a boy walking with his father through marshy land at night. He becomes separated from his father and is obviously in danger. Even the
that might have provided him with some light disappears, so he is left alone in total darkness.
is about the finding of the lost boy, who has been following a 'wandr'ing light'. God appears and leads him back to his mother, who has been searching for him. Strangely, she was searching for him in the dale, not the fen. This could be interpreted as meaning she was in the wrong place and would not have found him without God's help.

446,5815,"W B Yeats: Song of the Old Mother
Yeats wrote a great deal about the passage of time, and of youth and beauty giving way to old age and death.
A central, unifying idea that runs through a text or performance.
. The poem contrasts two types of human endeavour: the young women's dreams of love and obsession with appearance; and the hard, grinding, thankless work that is the Old Mother's lot.
An interesting cross-current is set going by our uncertainty about who the young women are.
Are they the Old Mother's own children? If so, their idleness is easier to forgive. Perhaps in her youth the old woman herself dreamed of love, lay late in bed, and obsessed about whether her ribbons matched. Perhaps, as old people often do, she has forgotten what it's like to be young!
Or are they the children of the old woman's rich employers? If they are, we are more likely to view them as spoilt and selfish young people whose idle lives are made possible only by the drudgery of poor servants like the Old Mother.
And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress:
While I must work because I am old,
And the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold.'

447,2893,"There are different opinions about what the Industrial Revolution actually consisted of and what caused it. This Revision Bite will look at some of the arguments that question the definition and timing of the Industrial Revolution.
wrote the famous economic historian EJ Hobsbawm.
""It is little wonder that the Victorian period is sometimes called the Age of Iron""
The economic historian JU Nef always argued that it was the move to coal as a fuel that kicked off the technological changes, which created the Industrial Revolution -
""The steam engine was one of the most important of mans inventions for without it the Industrial Revolution could never have taken place""
confusion about the nature of the Industrial Revolution
, and where the revolution in the British economy started.
Recently, certain economic historians have claimed that there was
revolutionary change only in the cotton and iron industries
, and that change in other areas of the economy was much slower  so much so, that one economic historian has argued that the period as a whole no longer deserves the title ""Industrial Revolution"".

What values of s satisfy the inequalities -1
s < 6 and s > 0?
s < 6, then s = -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
If s > 0, then s = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
The only values of s that satisfy both of these inequalities are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. So the solution is:

Click 'Next' for some background information on this artist.
Born in 1950, Caroline graduated from the Leicester School of Art in 1969 and the Central School of Art and Design, London in 1972. Although Caroline trained as a jeweller she soon diversified into textiles and sculptural installations incorporating clothing as pieces of art which are not intended to be worn. Caroline uses garments to explore ideas about personal identity and the portrayal of hidden feelings and emotions. Her recent work concentrates not only on clothing and textiles but on the space around garments on the body and shadows.
She has been exhibited widely throughout the world. Caroline was the winner of the Jerwood Prize for Applied Arts: Textiles in 1997.
'Dress with Holes' is part of a body of work I made using shadows as an integral part.
Previous work had used the dress as a metaphor for a person, but with these works, I was using the play between object and image to refer to substantial and insubstantial elements.
Shadows of people are both part of them and separate, perhaps the outermost visual boundary of someone, giving a likeness but more usually a distortion. There are many stories, like Peter Schlemihl or Peter Pan, about people trading their shadows with the devil or otherwise becoming separated and the subsequent struggle to reunite with it.
My intention was to give the shadow equal attention to the dress. The silk of the dress was dyed a mid grey and was a lightweight, transparent fabric. Because the silk was so fine the shadow carried the details of overlaps, seams, creases. In the shadow, I painted the inside spaces of the dress on the wall behind, like the neck, cuffs and the hem, so it looks like there might be a lining to the shadow, give a sense of three-dimensions.
I was also interested in the process of completing a work in the space it would be exhibited. These pieces depend on the theatrical nature of traditional art galleries - smooth white walls, controlled lighting. I always started with the light source and worked by placing the dress to get the right shadow.

460,1598,"If you are mainly painting and drawing, you'll be expected to develop your knowledge and understanding of colour, form, tone, texture and shape.
You'll need to explore the results of painting on different surfaces, the qualities of different paints, and the effects of using different painting tools. For example, acrylic paint can be used to create flat surfaces of colour but if it's watered down sufficiently, it can be used to create washes of colour.

What is each painting about? What is each artist trying to represent or say?
How does the subject matter differ between the two paintings?
How has each artist used paint to show how they feel about their subject matter?
How have time and/or place influenced each artist?
Does it look like the artist has used a brush or palette knife to apply the paint?
Does the way in which each artist has used the paint affect the mood, atmosphere or the way it looks?
Does the size of either of the paintings affect the viewer?
What (painting) devices does Justin Mortimer use to show Mick Scarletts personality. How does he show his response to and feelings about him?
How does Robert Maclaurin show that the atmosphere and mood of a place is more important to him than the accurate recording of its details?

experiment with thick and thin areas to create textures
surface. By adding turpentine to the mix, you can make the paint thinner, more
and have a more matt finish. By adding oil (such as linseed or poppy oil) you make the paint thinner, more transparent and give it a more glossy finish. Adding wax will give a soft matt finish and make the paint thicker too.
Acrylic paint can be mixed with anything water based, such as water, soap, PVA glue and other water based paint. It can be applied thin or thick. You can try mixing in an acrylic medium to make the paint more transparent. This is useful for glazing effects and more subtle colouring.
Water colour and gouache paints are both water based, so like acrylic they can be mixed with anything water based.
experiment with the surface you are painting on
. Try wood, paper, card, glass or metal. Create a collage, cut into the surface, or tear the paper and rejoin it in a different way.
Surfaces can be changed in a variety of ways, scratched, roughened, made uneven or smoothed
. Try using sandpaper to remove some of the paint from previous painting and then paint onto it some more.
Try painting onto a wet surface, and a dry surface. Try painting over old painting once it's dry. You can be surprised how good the results can be.
Make use of a palette knife to discover new textures, or draw into the paint with the wrong end of your paintbrush. Try adding things such as glue, rice or sand onto, or into, the paint to build up or create a variety of interesting textures.
Try different sizes and shapes of brushes. Decorating brushes are a cheap alternative to large artist quality brushes. Try painting without brushes, using pieces of wood or plastic as scrapers, or bits of rag to apply the paint.

explore a range of materials on which to draw
, such as different thicknesses, types and textures of paper. Experiment to see the difference it makes what type of marks you use to draw the same subject. Try making marks that are all the same all over. Then try to get a wide range of different marks into the same drawing.
a collective name for images, video and audio
. Try drawing with wet media like watercolours, ink or watered-down acrylic paint. Try different mark-making materials from pencils to pastels, inks, pens, charcoal, sticks, matches. Try fine aquarelle pencils for subtle colour blending, or make a delicate wash by brushing over them with water.
Try using different types of eraser. Try using erasers to make marks and remove parts of the drawing. Putty rubbers are very soft and can be used to lighten shadows, to give delicate shading, by rubbing gently at areas you've already shaded. Try rubbing out an area and then drawing back into the mess that is left behind.

Sometimes the instructions on the reading exam are in English - but be careful,they may not be as straightforward as they seem!
Read each situation carefully and think about what you actually need to know.
Read every choice all the way through. There might be a word or part of a word that you recognise.
Don't jump to conclusions! Sometimes a word like 'Oficina' can be used in a way that it isn't in English.
Don't panic if you don't know what a word means. Look through all the choices and eliminate the ones you know aren't the right answer.
Be careful! Sometimes the question tries to mislead you by offering you information you don't need.

468,1543,"Life was very tough for early settlers and homesteaders on the Great Plains - how did they cope with the
Female homesteader, contemplating her life on the Plains
Early settlers and homesteader on the Plains faced huge problems. The burden of many of these fell on the women, whose lives were burdensome and unpleasant:
There was little wood to build log cabins.
Settlers built 'sod houses', while they lived out of doors - people did their cooking on an open fire.
Outdoor toilets and open wells. The sod houses leaked, and fleas and bedbugs lived in them 'by the million'. It was impossible to disinfect the floor. As a result the death rate, especially from diphtheria, was high.
A 'good thick coat of whitewash' killed bedbugs. 'A layer of clay' stopped leaks. Homesteaders eventually built more modern houses.
There was no wood for fuel, and no shops to buy items such as candles and soap. A typical household had only two buckets, some crockery and one cracked cup. There was no water and little food.
A travelling shoe-maker or tinker might pass through who would provide or mend household items, but usually families just had to make do. The women collected 'buffalo chips' for fuel, stoked the stove, and made their own candles and soap. 'I have often wondered how my mother stood it', wrote an early settler.
No doctors or midwives. No social life 'because of the distances between farmhouses'. In the winter families were shut in 'and longed for spring'.
People had to make the most of any trip to their nearest town, where the women talked of the harvest and the men smoked corncob pipes and talked politics.
Local government was non-existent, and some early lawmen (such as Henry Plummer) were worse than the bandits.
Law courts and sheriffs such as Wyatt Earp slowly established law and order.

471,5218,"The amount of energy transferred from the burning fuel to the water in the calorimeter can be calculated if you know:
energy transferred (joules, J) = mass of water heated (grams, g)  4.2  temperature rise (C)
For a given amount of water heated up, the greater the temperature rise, the greater the amount of heat energy transferred to the water. For example, twice as much energy is transferred to the water to achieve a temperature increase of 20C compared with 10C.
You can compare fuels by measuring the mass of fuel burned in the experiment. The best fuel is likely to release the most energy per gram of fuel. This is worked out using:
energy released (J/g of fuel) = energy transferred to water (J)  mass of fuel burned (g)

472,6930,"William Blake: The Little Boy Lost / The Little Boy Found
are deceptively simple poems, written as if spoken by children. They are generally hopeful and optimistic. The
are also childlike in approach, but darker and more pessimistic.
When Blake published them together, he called them
Shewing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul.
This suggests he believed people needed both 'states' to understand life. Many of the
poems have a poem that 'answers' them in the

473,2197,". This is when a character reacts to something - it's not quite the same as a soliloquy because it's a comment on what is happening around them. However, the other characters are not aware of it and it's as if the speaker is confessing. So in Act 2, Scene 1 Iago sees Cassio take Desdemona's hand and his asides tells us he has decided to 'ensare' Cassio with 'tricks', which is exactly what he does later on.
- Othello hides away to hear Cassio talk, Iago hides to watch Roderigo's attack on Cassio and even Desdemona's body is hidden until Emilia 'draws the bed-curtain' to reveal her lying there.
- it seems completely unimportant at first, it is just a handkerchief which Desdemona has dropped. But we soon realise that Iago has been trying to get hold of it for a long time, and it is a
of loyalty, so losing it means Desdemona is unfaithful. Othello even thinks it has magical properties. This shows how Shakespeare cleverly takes an ordinary object and makes it the focus of the drama.

teaches Pip how to be a gentleman. His wife Belinda is pretty and should have married 'well', but is an incompetent housekeeper. In Chapters 22-23, Mrs Pocket and her two nurses, Flopson and Millers, introduce some slapstick comedy (mostly at the expense of the poor baby).
At the end of the novel, Pip persuades Miss Havisham to leave her money to the decent Matthew Pocket, rather than her other 'friends', who only want her money.
is Jaggers' clerk. His main comic feature is having a mouth like a letterbox, which grows wider when he is stressed. At work, he is severe and formal. At his home (which he has converted into a mock-castle), he is kind and generous, and his mouth relaxes.

476,3857,"We often use formulas without even noticing. For example, we might convert miles to km by multiplying by 1.6, or find the circumference of a circle by multiplying pi by the diameter.
km = 1.6 x miles is an example of a formula.
We have already seen that km = 1.6 x miles and C =
 d are examples of formulas. There are many others that we use regularly in other subjects. Sometimes we have to construct our own formula:
A taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00. Write down a formula for the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles.
Travelling 1 mile would cost 2 + 50p.
Travelling 2 miles would cost 2 + 2 x 50p.
Travelling 3 miles would cost 2 + 3 x 50p.
So travelling for 'n' miles will cost 2 + n x 50p.
The formula is C = 2 + (n x 50p)
A rectangle has a width of x and a length of 2x.
Write down a formula for the perimeter (P) in terms of x.
P = 2x + x + 2x + x
Did you remember to include all 4 sides?
To recap, the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles, when a taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00 is:-
C = 2 + (n x 50p)
To find the cost of the taxi for a journey of 20 miles, replace 'n' with 20.
C = 2 + (20 x 50p)
What is the cost of hiring this taxi for 16 miles?
Remember that C = 2 + (16 x 50p)
The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.
r, so we divide both sides by 2
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c
Rearrange the formula to make 'c' the subject.
[To work this out: y = mx + c, so subtract mx from both sides.]

Drawing 1: Sketching, enhancing, shapes and charts
There are a range of techniques for enhancing the appearance of a drawing, making it look more like the real object. The technique used will depend on the type of drawing and what you are trying to show.
For this technique, thin lines are used in between adjoining surfaces. Thick lines are suitable when only one side can be seen. The drawing illustrates the idea.
of the same colour. A lighter tone is called a tint and is made by adding white to the base colour. A darker tone is called a shade and is made by adding black to the base colour.
Tone can also be shown by using patterns of lines, dots, shading, reflections and highlights. It is also possible to obtain sheets of dry transfer material to represent different tones.
There are a number of ways of showing on paper the texture of materials used to make a product. These are intended to give an impression of the material, rather than represent it exactly. Some examples include drawing the grain on pieces of wood or drawing lines at angles to show reflected light on clear glass or plastics. Textures can be represented in shades of grey or colour.
Colour is an important part of graphic design. You need to know the following facts about colour.
are made by mixing the primary colours as follows: red + yellow = orange; red + blue = violet; blue + yellow = green.
Mixing primary and secondary colours together creates tertiary colours. These are dark browns, greens and greys.
The colour wheel illustrates how the colours relate to each other.
The colours next to each other harmonise (go together). Use harmonising colours to make elements of a design look related to each other.
Colours that are on opposite sides of the wheel contrast with each other (they are 'complementary' colours). Use contrasting colours to make elements of a design stand out from each other.
Yellow, orange and red are 'warm' colours; green and blue are 'cold'. Warm colours appear to come towards you from the page, while cold colours appear to recede.

478,5734,"In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.

479,5959,"Calculating the number of sides in a regular polygon, given the interior angle
We already know the following facts about polygons:
The interior and exterior angles add up to 180 (a straight line - eg, a + f = 180), and
The sum of the exterior angles is 360 (a + b + c + d + e = 360).
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 120. Calculate the number of sides.
The interior angles are 120, so the exterior angles are 180 - 120 = 60. The exterior angles add up to 360, so if we divide 360 by 60 we find there are 6 exterior angles. Therefore, there are
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 150. Calculate the number of sides.
If not, remember that the exterior angles are each 30 (180 - 150).
360  30 = 12, so there are 12 exterior angles, and 12 sides.

480,3794,"Infectious diseases are caused by the transmission of pathogens, which are microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. Pathogens can be transmitted by direct contact - horizontal and vertical transmission - and by indirect contact - vehicle-borne transmission and vector-borne transmission.
Pathogens are microorganisms that cause infectious disease. Bacteria and viruses are the main pathogens.
Bacteria come in many shapes and sizes, but even the largest are only 10 micrometres long (10 millionths of a metre).
Bacteria are living cells and, in favourable conditions, can multiply rapidly. Once inside the body, they release poisons or toxins that make us feel ill.
Hepatitis C virus. DNA are enclosed in a protein coat.
Viruses are many times smaller than bacteria. They are among the smallest organisms known and consist of a fragment of genetic material inside a protective protein coat.
Viruses can only reproduce inside host cells, and they damage the cell when they do this. A virus can get inside a cell and, once there, take over and make hundreds of thousands of copies of itself. Eventually the virus copies fill the whole host cell and burst it open. The viruses are then passed out in the bloodstream, the airways, or by other routes.

482,2494,"We have already looked at one aspect of language - in the section on
we saw how you could use short quotations as evidence.
We might want to say Don John is an aggressive and angry character. We can then support this view by looking at his language. He says that if he had a mouth he ""would bite"", and that he only has his unhappiness to make use of.
Here we are using two ways to provide evidence: words that are directly from the play are put in quotation marks, for example, ""I am a plain-dealing villain."" The second way is to describe what is said in your own words, for instance, Don John plans to stop Claudio's marriage to Hero. It is often good to combine these methods, perhaps quoting just one word from the play. For instance, Don John despises Claudio and calls him a ""start-up"" (an 'upstart' in modern English).
The one thing you should avoid is using a long quotation. Many students write out whole chunks of the play. This is just like retelling the story - there is no reason for it, and you will not get any marks for it.

The question does give you most of your introduction, but don't forget to change the verb to refer to yourself.
If necessary, add something extra to set the scene.
Where times or parts of the day are referred to, extend them to make suitable expressions of time.
You are writing about what the Spanish school was like, so use the imperfect tense. Use the first person plural to say what we did.
Sometimes you may have to change the tense from the one in the notes.
You may need to use the verb comer instead of the noun
Be prepared to make some guesses of your own. If there was no canteen where did the pupils eat? Probably at home!
Did you do the homework as well? If not, refer to Marisol and show you can use a different verb ending.
Don't just stick to the notes here. Add something to introduce the next point. It's time to give your opinion.
If necessary, add something extra to set the scene.
Remember to change the tense to fit.
Which expressions of time should you use?
Don't forget to put an article before the days of the week.
You are now talking about the situation generally, so you probably need to use the present tense.
Remember to compare Spanish and English holidays.
Show that you know the difference between
Take this opportunity to put in another different tense.
You will generally be told about how many words to write. Take note of this because you won't get any more marks for writing too much and you may lose marks for writing too little.
Use what you're given. The question and the notes both give you lots of language that you can use in your answer.
Remember to adapt the information in the question so that any verbs and pronouns refer to whoever you're writing about.
If you have to work from notes, think about the way they would be set out in English and what you would have to add.
Think carefully about what tense and what person of the verb to use. Once you have decided, make sure that you use that tense and person every time it's appropriate.
After you have finished, check your work for verb endings and tenses.
In a piece of writing, numbers are generally written as words.

484,6456,"Where no profit or loss is made ie where total revenue = total costs.
point is when a firm begins to make a profit. It will make a loss if it produces and sells output below this level.
The breakeven point for a firm is when total costs equals total revenue. Expenditure and income are the same and the firm makes neither a profit or a loss. If the firm can sell at production levels above this point, it will be making a profit. If sales fall below this point, it will be making a loss. Establishing the breakeven point helps a firm to plan the levels of production it needs to be profitable.
Before you can calculate the breakeven point, you need to identify the firm's costs. These include:
Renting an office block is part of a company's fixed costs
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
are constant and do not change however many goods are produced. They include rent and insurance.
Wages paid to employees are part of a company's variable costs
These change according to output eg raw materials.
include raw materials and wages. You need to calculate the variable costs per unit. These costs increase in direct proportion to the number of units produced.
By adding the firm's variable costs and fixed costs you can work out the
Fixed costs plus variable costs make total costs.
The firm's variable costs are added to the fixed costs and these make the total costs.
You need to establish how many units are to be produced.
You need to know the selling price of the units.
Once you have the above information, you can begin to calculate the breakeven point. You do this either by using a chart or an equation.
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
These change according to output eg raw materials.
You may find it helpful to work through the
Here is how to work out the breakeven point, using the example of a firm manufacturing compact discs. You can assume the firm has the following costs:
You first construct a chart with output (units) on the horizontal (x) axis, and costs and revenue on the vertical (y) axis. On to this, you plot a horizontal fixed costs line (it is horizontal because fixed costs don't changewith output).
Then you plot a variable cost line from this point, which will, in effect, be the total costs line. This is because the fixed cost added to the variable cost gives the total cost. To do this, you multiply:
variable cost per unit  number of units
In this example of the CD manufacturing firm, you can assume that the variable cost per unit is 2 and there are 2 000 units = 4,000
Once you have done this, you are ready to plot the
The value of sales at a given output ie sales price multiplied by output.
sales price  number of units (output)
If the sales price is 6.00 and 2.000 items were to be manufactured, the calculation is:
6.00  2,000 = 12,000 total revenue
Where the total revenue line crosses the total costs line is the breakeven point (ie costs and revenue are the same). Everything below this point is produced at a loss, and everything above it is produced at a profit.
Fixed costs: 10,000, Variable costs: 2 per unit, Sales price: 6 per unit
If you read downwards, it tells you how many units you need to produce and sell at this price to breakeven: 2,500 CDs
If you read across, it tells you how much money you must spend before you recover your outlay: 15,000
As with any calculation, it is easy to make a mistake. There are two simple equations you can use to double-check your answer. You can calculate the breakeven point in:
Either way, the result should be the same.
For the breakeven point in costs/revenue, you then multiply the breakeven point in units, which you have just calculated, by the sales price.
If you look at the breakeven chart, you will see this is the correct answer.
Breakeven analysis is a favourite exam topic. In an exam, you could be asked to complete a breakeven chart. With these two equations, you'll be able to double check your calculations, get them right and improve your marks.
Use the example of the CD manufacturer above and plot your own chart with the same costs, but this time with a different total revenue line:
You should have calculated a breakeven point of 2,000 units and a costs revenue of 14,000.
If you have made a mistake, calculate the breakeven point in units, and then in costs/revenue again and double check your calculations again.

489,2508,"German 19th-century scholar, who founded Marxism (key theory of Communism).
People should contribute to the public wealth according to their ability, but receive according to their needs.
The means of production should be owned equally by the whole community (hence communism), not as in capitalism where individuals (who might be very rich) own the means of production and leave the rest of society to be poor and oppressed wage slaves.
A deterministic interpretation of history, which said that society must inevitably develop through successive stages of slavery, feudalism, then capitalism, ending up with the violent overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a communist society.
They should work to overthrow capitalism throughout the world by means of a revolution by the proletariat (workers).
Class was a feature of capitalist society, and should be destroyed and replaced by a society of equals.
The economy should be planned - controlled by the government.
Lenin changed Marx's ideas to add that a Communist government first had to be a dictatorship which was essential in order to bring in the communist state safely.

491,1307,"You will need to use your Ideas about science to:
Distinguish questions that can be answered using a scientific approach from those that cannot. For example, science can answer the question, ""What are the chances of my child having cystic fibrosis?"". However, it cannot answer the question, ""Should I have my pregnancy terminated?""
State clearly what the issue in any debate is. For instance, in a debate about treating genetic diseases with gene therapy, some people think that altering our
The material inside the nucleus of cells, carrying genetic information. DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid.
is against nature or God. The ethical issue is whether scientists should be allowed to use
treating or preventing disease by introducing or replacing specific genes inside human cells
You will also need to summarise the different views that different people might hold. For example, if gene therapy saves lives, it can only be a good thing. Or, we should not use gene therapy because we do not know the long-term outcomes.
Identify arguments that are based on the right decision, ie a decision that produces the best outcome for most of the people involved. So, if a certain type of gene therapy involves a risk of causing harm, but 90 per cent of the people who have the therapy are cured, is it worth taking the risk?
Identify when certain actions are never justified because they are unnatural or wrong. For example, we could wipe out cystic fibrosis in one generation if we made sure that anyone who was a carrier was not allowed to have children. However, most people would consider this action to be immoral and wrong.

492,2527,"Once you have an idea of the main tasks involved in a project, break down each task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
Think about all the different things you need to do for each task, and the order they need to be done in, and add them to your overall plan. Allocate a number to each main task and give each sub-task a number or letter to show which main task it is part of, and where it is in the order. For example:
Task 3: Produce a formal letter to a newspaper explaining why animal experiments might be necessary.
Once you have an idea of the main tasks involved in a project, break down each task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
You could write this plan on paper and scan it before saving it on your computer. You could also write it straight onto the computer using a word processor, a spreadsheet, a mind mapping application or other suitable software.

493,5727,"The poem is about the experience of crossing Westminster Bridge early in the morning and seeing the calmness and beauty of the city of London. The poem describes the city in a very positive way, communicating its power and 'splendour'.
Wordsworth suggests that the view of the city is a rival for anything naturally occurring: 'Earth has not anything to show more fair' is the opening line.
The use of the word 'smokeless' in line 8 gives the reader a clue about why this scene is so powerful. Under normal circumstances, the smoke from homes and factories would have obscured the view of the city; it is as if the speaker is experiencing the true beauty of the city for the first time.

494,581,"Huntingtons disorder is caused by a dominant
, written as H. The symptoms usually develop in middle age, and include problems with controlling your muscles and forgetfulness.
You only need to inherit one copy of the faulty allele to have Huntingtons disorder, unlike cystic fibrosis, where you need to inherit both copies. You can inherit Huntingtons disorder if one or both of your parents carry the faulty allele, because it is a
an allele that always expresses itself whether it is partnered by a recessive allele or by another like itself
You can show inheritance of the disorder using genetic diagrams.
In this example, one parent, the mother, carries one copy of the Huntingtons allele. She has the disorder. The father does not carry the Huntingtons allele, so he does not have the disorder.

496,2210,"Public health is about avoiding the spread of disease within a particular society - often through providing water to help people keep themselves, their animals and their surroundings clean. The Egyptians stressed the importance of cleanliness, but this was for
reasons, not in order to keep the population at large healthy.
Archaeologists have discovered that the Egyptians had simple baths and toilets. Egyptian men and women took great care over their
and appearance, and there is evidence that they used eye make-up that helped protect their eyes from diseases. They slept under mosquito nets.
, kept themselves scrupulously clean. They regularly washed themselves, their clothes and their cups.
The Egyptians didn't use cleanliness to ward off disease, however, but instead
a public health system in the modern sense of state-organised sewers, public hygiene or medical care.

497,1793,"The search to combat disease gained enormous
in the 19th century. Instruments such as the
were invented, and research into inoculation began to bear fruit.
Methods of diagnosis changed massively during the course of the 19th century.
(France: 1816) invented the stethoscope and started the practice of 'auscultation' (listening to the patient's chest).
(France: 1834) argued that symptoms were irrelevant, and that what was happening inside the body was much more important when it came to diagnosing illness. As a result, doctors made diagnoses on the basis of a full clinical examination of the 'signs' made by the disease on the body.
(Germany: 1878) developed the technique of biopsy (removing cells to determine if they were cancerous).
to measure the functions of the body precisely:
(Germany: 1847) invented the kymograph (which measured the pulse).
(Holland: 1900) invented the electrocardiograph (which measures heart activity).
The search for new ways to cure disease also gained momentum in the 19th century, and included the discovery of how
Usually a medical injection, which introduces a weakened dose of harmful disease-causing organisms into a patient's body. This induces the body to develop an immunity to the disease, which protects the patient from the full-blown sickness.
(France: 1880) discovered by chance (when he left bacteria exposed to air) that injecting chickens with an attenuated (weakened) form of chicken cholera gave them immunity to the disease (ie he discovered the principle of inoculation).
That realisation was the start of an important chain of events.
developed an effective inoculation against anthrax (1881), and rabies (1885).
(France: 1906) developed the BCG injection against TB.
(Germany: 1913) developed an anti-toxin against diphtheria.
(Germany: 1890s) reasoned that, if certain dyes could stain bacteria, perhaps certain chemicals could kill them. He set up a private laboratory and a team of scientists. By 1914 they had discovered several 'magic bullets' - compounds that would have a specific attraction to disease-causing microorganisms in the body, and that would target and kill them. These were methylene blue (for malaria), trypan red (for sleeping sickness) and Salvarsan (for syphilis) - although Salvarsan was more effective than the other two.
Preparations, often made of weakened viruses of a disease. These are given to a sick person (often by injection), in order to protect him or her from that disease, by causing the body to form antibodies against it.
, however (eg one developed by Robert Koch against TB in 1891), were not successful. And against
. They carried, as one medical historian wrote, 'a box of blanks'. So people looked elsewhere for their cures - sometimes in strange places.
A home medicine encyclopaedia of 1910 recommended cures that included electrical shocks, injection with animal hormones, and a range of
Other alternative medical treatments included mesmerism (hypnotism), homeopathy (taking tiny doses of poisons), 'health reform' (a religious movement which recommended a healthy lifestyle - it was run by John Kellogg whose brother invented cornflakes) and Christian Science (which taught that disease only existed in the mind).

498,5968,"Calculating the interior and exterior angles of regular polygons
We already know how to find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon using the formula
We also know that all the interior angles of a regular polygon are equal.
Interior angle of a regular polygon = sum of interior angles  number of sides
Find the interior angle of a regular hexagon.
We know from the formula that the interior angles of a hexagon add up to 720.
As a hexagon has six sides, each angle is equal to
We know that the exterior angles of a regular polygon
add up to 360, so the exterior angle of a regular hexagon is
The interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle always add up to 180. (For a hexagon, 120 + 60 = 180.)
Calculate the exterior angle of a regular octagon, and write down the value of the interior angle.
The sum of the exterior and interior angles is 180, so the interior angle is 180 - 45 =

For your exam, you will need to feel confident when dealing with fractions. This section will help you to recognise equivalent fractions and practise simple calculations.
It is easy to add fractions when the numbers on the bottom are the same.
All you need to do is add the tops of the fractions together.
Sometimes you need to cancel down the answer to its simplest terms.
When the numbers on the bottom are not the same to start with, you use equivalent fractions to make them the same.
The numbers on the bottom of the fractions are not the same. You can use equivalent fractions to make them both equal 20.
You subtract using the same methods you use for adding.
8 and 10 both divide into 40. So re-write the fractions using 40 as the number on the bottom of each one.
To multiply fractions, you need to multiply the top numbers together, and multiply the bottom numbers together. Remember that you cannot cancel numbers that are both on the top of a fraction. Have a look at the example below.
OR cancel between the top and the bottom then multiply:
The 5s do not cancel because they are both on the top of the fraction.
Dividing a fraction by a whole number
of the original fraction, which would make the answer
The rule to remember when dividing fractions is that you
turn the fraction you are dividing by upside down, and multiply.
So going back to the previous example we can work this out by turning the
Dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying by
It works with all fractions. For example dividing by
