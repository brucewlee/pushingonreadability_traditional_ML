5,467,"Students recently planted trees in Brechtel Park. It is in New Orleans, Louisiana. The park lost thousands of trees in 2005. A big hurricane hit the area then. Its name was Hurricane Katrina.
The students worked hard. They raised money to buy the trees. How? They sold T-shirts and had an art fair. The group planted about 100 trees.
The event was a great success, says Brad Philipson. He is a teacher at Metairie Park Country Day School. One day, these kids will come back and see how the trees have grown.

6,428,"Kids are helping keep track of monarchs. The kids are putting tags on the butterflies. The tags are tiny stickers. Each tag has a number on it. The number shows when and where each monarch was found.
Scientists look for monarchs with the tags. They want to keep track of them. Why? The number of monarchs is getting smaller. People are cutting down plants and trees where the butterflies live. Scientists want to learn more about monarchs so they can save them.
Why might scientists want to save monarch butterflies?

7,52,"Lava is flowing out of a volcano in Hawaii. The volcano is named Kilauea (kee-lah-WAY-ah). It is one of the worlds most active volcanoes. It has been erupting for more than 25 years!
Scientists are keeping a close watch on Kilauea. They want to make sure people living nearby are safe.
The lava from Kilauea goes into the Pacific Ocean. The lava cools. Then, it hardens into rock. The rock forms new land over time.
Many people visit Kilauea each year. This is one of the few places in the world where you can get really close to an actively erupting volcano, says scientist Jim Kauahikaua (koh-wah-hee-KOH-wah). Its really cool.

15,338,"Animals that are too old to perform in zoos or circuses now have special places to live. They can live in retirement homes. Both Nevada and California have special places for retired animals. The animals have plenty of room to run and play. The animals have pools to swim in and trees to climb. Volunteers take care of the animals.

17,246,"When snow first falls, it is usually soft and fluffy. But tightly packed snow is very strong, and it is almost as hard as ice. Tightly packed snow is so strong that some people use it to build homes called igloos. Some Inuit (IN-oo-it) people in Canada use blocks of snow to build igloos.
Snow is a good insulator. An insulator holds heat inside. Sometimes people, such as campers and hikers, dig a hole in the snow or make a snow cave to stay warm.
The largest snowflake ever measured was almost a foot across.
Stampede Pass, Washington, is called the snow capital of the United States!

20,226,"Hurricanes are big storms. They bring lots of rain and strong winds. Most hurricanes happen in places near oceans. Hurricane season is from June to November.
Why might it be important to stay away from windows during a hurricane?
. The eye of a hurricane is the calm center of the storm. The storm clouds move around the eye. A lot of rain and strong winds are found inside storm clouds.
Hurricane winds spin around and around. In very strong hurricanes, the winds can blow more than 155 miles per hour. Hurricane winds can harm houses and trees. Those winds can also pick up cars and boats.
Hurricane hunters are scientists who fly planes into hurricanes. The hunters study those storms. Hunters measure the speed of the wind and the amount of rain in a hurricane. Their work helps people learn more about weather. The hunters let people know when a hurricane is on the way.

21,488,"Ann Bancroft and Liv Arnesen are trying to become the first women to ski across Antarctica. They plan to ski 4,200 miles in 100 days. That is the longest distance ever skied by women.
The women began their journey in November. That is spring in Antarctica. But the average temperature is 39 degrees below zero! Freezing winds blow at 100 miles per hour.

29,541,"Many schools are growing their own food. Chatham Elementary School in Illinois is one of those schools. In September, students planted seeds in a garden. They are growing spinach, lettuce, radishes, and herbs.
A group of volunteers created the schools garden project. The group was started by Dr. Kemia Sarraf. She wants to teach kids healthy habits.
Gardens are wonderful, says Kim Sepich, the schools principal. When kids plant and grow their own food, they are more likely to try it. We want kids to eat their veggies!

31,456,"Many different animals live in the Arctic.
Welcome to the Arctic! That is the cold, windy area around the North Pole. It includes the Arctic Ocean and the land near it. Snow and ice cover the ground for much of the year.
, or place in nature where many animals live. The walrus, polar bear, and snowy owl are a few of those animals. They have different ways to survive the cold.
A walrus spends most of its time in the icy water. This marine animal has a thick layer of
, or fat, under its skin to keep it warm.
When a walrus swims, its body works in a special way to stay warm. Blood flows away from its skin to important
inside its body. They include the heart and brain. That keeps heat from leaving the walruss body, and the animals skin turns white. When the walrus is warm again, its skin turns a pink color.
A polar bear has special fur to keep it warm. Each hair is shaped like a straw. The shape helps direct sunlight toward the bears black skin. The black skin collects and holds in heat. Polar bears also have a layer of blubber under their skin.
How does a snowy owl stay warm? It has two layers of feathers. They cover the owls entire body, including its legs and feet. The bottom layer of feathers, called
, is soft and fluffy. The outer layer of feathers is thick. In strong wind, the snowy owl may hide on the ground behind a pile of snow or rocks to block the wind.

36,325,"Here are four safety tips you should know.
Smoke alarms save lives. Have an alarm inside and outside each bedroom. Make sure you have a smoke alarm on every level of the home. Push the test button at least once a month. That will let you know whether the alarm is working.
Fire can spread quickly. Every family needs to be prepared. How? Have a home fire escape plan. Draw the plan, and talk about it. The drawing should show two ways out of each room. Those may be doors or windows. Then practice the plan twice a year. Practice during the day and at night.
Choose a safe place outside where everyone will meet. Get out and stay out! Never go back inside a burning building.
Once you are outside, dial 9-1-1 or the number for your fire department.
Why is it important to have a home fire escape plan? How might practicing it help you?

39,434,"What sounds do you hear right now? You may hear a fan blowing, kids talking, or a bell ringing. All the sounds you hear travel in waves. Those waves enter your outer ear. They travel through your middle ear and inner ear. Your inner ear sends a message to your brain. Then you hear sound. Study the ear below to learn more.
That means it moves quickly back and forth. When people speak, their vocal cords vibrate. When you pluck a guitar string, it vibrates and makes sound.
Did you know that sounds can travel through solid materials? Try this experiment with a partner to find out. Place a plastic ruler on a table. Make sure one end is hanging over the edge. Hold the ruler down with one hand. Ask your partner to place his or her ear against the surface of the table. With your other hand, gently snap the end of the ruler that is hanging over the floor. What did you and your partner see, hear, and feel?

has begun. A powwow is a festival. It celebrates Native American life.
People sing songs in Native American languages. Some of the songs are old. Other songs are new. People sing to the beat of a drum. Dancers move to the beat. The drum is an important part of the powwow.
Dancers wear special clothes at a powwow. The clothes are made by hand. As the dancers get older, they add pieces to the clothes. Some of the pieces are gifts from family and friends.
People sell arts and crafts at some powwows. The artists make each item by hand. The arts and crafts often include beadwork, baskets, and pottery.
Fry bread is often found at powwows. The bread is sometimes used to make special tacos. People put meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and hot peppers on top of the bread. Then they roll it up and eat it.
Is it important to learn about Native American life? Why or why not?

44,142,"The U.S. Mint will release the last five state quarters this year!
Many kids are checking their coins for new state quarters. This year, they can complete their collections. The
will release the last five of the 50 state quarters starting this month. The U.S. Mint is the place that makes coins.
The 50 State Quarters Program began in 1999. Since then, the U.S. Mint has made five new state quarters each year. The coins are released to the public in the order in which each state became part of the United States.
The front, or heads side, of each state quarter is the same. They all have a picture of George Washington. He was the first president of the United States. He became president in 1789.
The back, or tails side, of each state quarter is
(yoo-NEEK). That means one of a kind. The design shows something special about that state. ""The program teaches people about the rich history of the states,"" says Michael White. He is a spokesperson for the U.S. Mint.
Many kids and adults started collecting coins in 1999 because of the new state quarters. ""It is, by far, the most popular and successful program in U.S. Mint history,"" says White. ""More than 140 million Americans collect them.""
Until 1965, quarters were made of silver. Today, quarters are made of copper and nickel.
New Jersey's quarter has a picture of George Washington on each side.
Coins last for about 30 years. Paper money lasts only about 18 months.
The main office of the U.S. Mint is in Washington, D.C. Offices are also located in five other cities across the United States. Study the map to learn more.
The U.S. Mint in Philadelphia is the largest mint in the world!
If you could design your own state quarter, what would it look like? Why?

45,148,"Scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates can be a lot of fun. But without safety gear, kids who use these toys are in danger. Play it safe!
In 1999, about 3? million kids were hurt while playing sports and using outdoor toys. Almost half of those kids got hurt while playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates.
The injured kids were probably not wearing safety gear. Without safety gear, playing with some toys can be very dangerous. Pads and guards protect parts of your body that could be hurt if you fall.
Most kids know that they should wear a helmet when they ride a bike. But kids should also wear helmets when they play with scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates. Kids can cut the chances of getting hurt in half by wearing protective gear.
Follow these safety tips when playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates:
Learn how to use the toy the correct way.
If a move seems dangerous, do not try it!
Do not play with the toy outside at night.

This year, farmers are growing the largest amount of corn since 1944. Experts say that is because people are using more ethanol.

""Many people now know ethanol's benefit as a fuel,"" says Weber. ""It's good for farmers, consumers, and our planet.""
Corn is grown on every continent except Antarctica.
An ear of corn has about 800 kernels in 16 rows.
A corn plant can grow to be 20 feet tall.
A popcorn kernel can pop as high as 3 feet into the air.

49,452,"Scientists in California recently explored a large inactive, underwater volcano. They were looking for ways to protect this special sea mountain that is home to many animals. Bright yellow sea sponges and 10-foot-tall pink coral live there. It is located deep below the surface of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. Its name is Davidson Seamount. The rocks there make good homes for deep-sea animals.
Scientists used a remote control vehicle to help them explore the volcano. It took photos and collected bits of rock and coral. Scientists say that we must find ways to protect this place or we will lose these sea creatures forever.

53,127,"Scientists have never seen a living giant squid. They want to learn more about this huge animal that lives deep in the ocean.
Scientists believe giant squids live about a mile down in the ocean. They live in the coldest, darkest part of the ocean.
Recently, scientists traveled in submarines to look for the giant squid. Even with the light from the submarine, they could not see the huge giant squid.
The sperm whale is the giant squid's only enemy. Scientists attached video cameras to the heads of some sperm whales with suction cups. They hoped the cameras would take pictures of giant squids swimming. The cameras filmed other types of squids, but not the giant squid. For now, the giant squid remains a mystery.

59,459,"Inventing is not just for adults. Kids from across the country recently showed off their great ideas. They took part in a contest to create a new use for Bubble Wrap. Bubble Wrap is a packing material that has air-filled plastic bubbles. It is used to protect objects that are breakable.
Andy Boler, age 10, from Texas, used Bubble Wrap to make a cover for plants. It protects plants from the cold. I like building things that could help people, he says.
Other inventions in the contest included a kite-making kit and a wrist cushion. Some of the kids inventions may be turned into real products.
We have very few rules, says a contest spokesperson. One of the main goals is to get young students thinking.

asked him to share his thoughts about Thanksgiving.
My family gathers for a big meal. We say a few words in our native language of Abenaki around the table to express our thanks.
What does Thanksgiving mean to Native Americans?
Native people give thanks for all things. Different groups have many thanksgiving festivals during the year.
Native Americans were one of the first to have a fall harvest festival. Squanto and other Native Americans taught the Pilgrims how to survive in a new land. The Pilgrims shared their first harvest with the Native Americans.
In 1620, the Pilgrims landed in what is now Massachusetts. Squanto showed the Pilgrims which crops to grow, such as corn, beans, and squash. He showed them which animals to hunt and where to fish.

67,113,"Many people visit Hawaii each year. They admire the coral reefs that surround the islands. But those beautiful reefs have been damaged by people and ships. Recently the United States government made a law to protect the reefs around Hawaii.
is a large strip of hard sea animal skeletons that is close to the ocean's surface. More than half of the United States' coral reefs are located in the waters around Hawaii.
Coral reefs provide homes for sea animals. Reefs also protect coastlines from dangerous, pounding waves. When waves pass over reefs, they slow down and get smaller.
Hawaii's reefs are being hurt. People have polluted the water around the reefs and have taken too many fish.
Before he left office, President Bill Clinton created the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Reserve. A
is an area protected by the government. This reserve is underwater and covers 84 million acres. That is almost as big as the states of Florida and Georgia combined.
Special rules make sure the reef reserve will be protected. People are not allowed to remove coral from the reefs. The number of fish taken from the reserve area cannot go up. Hawaii's reefs are now protected from further damage.
A coral reef is built by tiny sea creatures called coral
Coral polyps have hard outer skeletons that protect them. When the polyps die, their skeletons stay. After a long time, the coral skeletons build up, forming a reef.
More than 2/3 of the world's coral reefs have been damaged by pollution and too much fishing.
Coral can be tan, orange, yellow, purple, or green.

71,81,"Earth Day is a time for people to think about taking care of Earth. People can celebrate Earth Day by keeping plants and animals healthy. They can also help keep Earth clean. But taking care of Earth is important all of the time. Turn the page to see how you can be Earth-friendly every day!
Each person in the United States makes about 4 pounds of trash per day! So landfills, or places where people dump trash, are starting to get full. People should reduce, or make smaller, the amount of trash they throw away.
Paper takes up the largest amount of space in most landfills. Paper does not easily biodegrade, or break down. But paper is easily recycled, or used again, after going through a special process.
Recycle by taking old newspapers or old homework to a recycling center.
Some trash in landfills could be used for other things! Instead of throwing trash away, people should find more ways to reuse it, or use trash again.
Reuse the top of a pizza box as an easel. Use the bottom part of the box to store your art supplies.
Many times people forget to respect, or care for, Earth. One way to show respect for Earth is to use less water, electricity, and gasoline.
Respect Earth by turning off the water faucet while you are brushing your teeth.

83,82,"Whiskers's class went to the museum for a field trip. But, oops, the story of their trip is in the wrong order. Use the clues to put the story in order.
Fourth, Whiskers and his class went to see the train display. They saw an old locomotive--a train's engine. The first locomotives used steam to move. This steam locomotive could pull many train cars, or parts of a train.
First, the students went to see the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs lived long ago. Dinosaurs are now extinct, or all gone. Scientists use dinosaur fossils, old bones or marks made by body parts or plants, to learn about dinosaurs.
Fifth, Whiskers saw real moon rocks and pictures of astronauts, the people trained to visit space. Astronaut Neil Armstrong was the first man to step onto the moon. He put an American flag up on the moon. He brought moon rocks back to Earth.
Second, Whiskers's class went to see an Egyptian mummy, or a dead body that has been kept in a special way. Egyptians buried their pharaohs, or kings, as mummies. The bodies were wrapped and put in fancy boxes. The boxes were decorated with paintings and writing.
Sixth, Whiskers's class met by the main door. They looked at a statue,or form of something or somebody. The statue is a copy of one called The Thinker. Whiskers was thinking, too. He was thinking about his day. He was glad he had visited the museum!

86,378,"Many children are in need of winter coats. Operation Warm is a group that wants to make sure those kids are cozy. The group gives away new coats to kids whose families dont have enough money to buy coats. The new coats bring smiles to kids faces, says Cydney Irving-Dasent. She is a spokesperson for the group.
Two girls receive new winter coats from Operation Warm.
Operation Warm started in 1998. The group expects to give away its millionth coat this winter! We are really excited about reaching this important milestone, says Irving-Dasent. Our goal is to serve as many children as possible. A million is a really big number. After that, we are looking forward to giving away the next million.

87,396,"Your bones are still growing. Exercise helps build strong bones. Do all kinds of exercise build bones? No! That is what a recent study has found. Experts say
activities are best. They take a lot of energy. Light exercise, such as walking, does not help bones.
Experts say running and playing sports help kids build strong bones. Which vigorous activities might help you build strong bones?

Kids who like to cook dont have to stay out of the kitchen. However, they should ask an adult for permission first, say fire officials. There are many tasty treats you can make without using the stove or oven. For recipes and cooking safety tips for kids, go to

93,196,"A new food program helps kids cook up healthy habits.
If you are what you eat, then students at MacGregor Elementary School are fresh fruits and vegetables!
Kids at the school in Houston chow down on everything from strawberries to sweet potatoes. They grow all the food themselves in a school garden. Then they
the fruits and veggies and turn them into healthy meals. To harvest is to collect.
The students got their green thumbsand their appetites for fresh foodfrom the Recipe for Success Foundation. That group teaches kids about the food they eat. We make good food fun, says Gracie Cavnar, the groups founder.

 A stem and leaves come out of the seed and grow upward. The stem brings water and minerals to the leaves.
 The leaves use sunlight to make food for the plant. That process is called

95,186,"Should Native American names and mascots be allowed in college sports?
Football fans cheer as a student rides a horse down the field. The student is dressed as Chief Osceola, a famous leader of the Seminole tribe. In one hand, the student holds a flaming spear. As he throws it into the ground, the crowd goes wild.
Some find Florida State University's mascot doesn't respect the real Chief Osceola.
That tradition takes place before every football game at Florida State University (FSU). The NCAA recently tried to end the tradition. The NCAA is the group that oversees college sports. It made a rule that sports teams can't use Native American names or
after the regular season. A mascot is a symbol that represents a sports team.
Some members of the Seminole tribe think the rule is unfair. They believe that FSU honors their traditions. Tribe members designed the mascot's costume, they say. They add that the student chosen as the mascot has to study the tribe's culture to earn that honor.
The NCAA decided to let FSU keep its tradition. However, the rule remains for at least 17 other schools.
Native Americans are the people who first settled in North and South America. Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today. Each tribe has its own history and culture.
Other Native Americans say that teams that use Native American mascots do not honor their culture. They think using those mascots supports
A stereotype is an idea that a group of people is alike in a certain way. It may be untrue or only partly true.
""It is not respectful to parade around in war paint and feathers,"" John Sanchez told
. Sanchez is a member of the Yaqui/Apache tribe. ""This is not honoring; it is making fun of.""

96,706,"U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson's job is out of this world! This fall, Whitson became the first woman to lead the International Space Station. She will be there for six months. The space station is being built 220 miles above Earth. Whitson's job is to oversee the construction. She will also help run science experiments on the giant space lab.
astronauts are men. NASA is the U.S. space agency. Between 1978 and 2004, fewer than one in five NASA astronauts were women.
""I think it's special that I get the opportunity to play that role,"" Whitson says. ""But I think it's also special to have an opportunity to [show] how many other women also work at NASA.""
One of those women is Pamela A. Melroy. She recently flew the space shuttle
to the space station. The visit marked the first time two female commanders were in space at the same time.
, or build, the space station. Melroy and her
crew delivered a part named Harmony. Harmony is a hallway that will connect different parts of the space station.
Sixteen countries, including the United States, are working on the space station. Once the lab is finished, it will be about the size of a five-bedroom house. The space station should be finished in 2010.
In 1983, Sally Ride set a record. She became the first American woman to travel in space. Ride traveled aboard the space shuttle
. The shuttle took off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Today, Ride is in charge of her own company. The company encourages girls to
, or work toward, careers in science, math, and technology.
How might it feel to work on the International Space Station?

97,199,"Scientists have been studying how much the ground beneath Machu Picchu has been sliding. In January, some Japanese scientists warned that if the ground continued to slide, a big landslide might destroy Machu Picchu.
Experts have also warned that tourists visiting Machu Picchu are damaging the Inca ruins. In recent years, tourists have started small fires and have littered the Machu Picchu area.
The government of Peru, however, disagreed with the warnings. ""Machu Picchu won't collapse,"" said one government official.
The official said that Machu Picchu has lasted for more than 500 years. He added that he doesn't see why landslides or tourism would destroy the city anytime soon.
The Incas built Machu Picchu sometime around 1460. The blocks used to build Machu Picchu were wedged so tightly together that a razor blade cannot fit between the stones. The ruins include about 200 stone buildings, including palaces, temples, and small homes.
The Incas were a South American Indian people who ruled one of the largest and richest empires on the continent. By 1532, the Incas ruled an area that stretched for 2,500 miles along the west coast of South America. The Inca empire included parts of what are now Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.
The Incas were skilled in farming and in building stone structures and roads. They were also skilled craftspeople, making many fine gold and silver ornaments. They studied the stars and knew how to predict the seasons of the year.
Spanish soldiers, led by Francisco Pizarro, attacked and conquered the Incas in 1532.

98,128,"The life cycle of a frog is amazing. Read below to learn more. (Note: Although many frogs have this life cycle, others do not. Some frogs don't even have tadpoles; instead their eggs hatch directly into frogs!)
A frog begins life as a tiny egg, usually in or near water.
After about 10 days, a tadpole hatches from the egg. It breathes using gills and moves like a fish.
After about five weeks, the tadpole's gills disappear, and it grows lungs.
At about 12 weeks, the young frog grows legs, and its tail disappears. It leaves the water and can live on land.

? A scavenger is an animal that feeds on dead animals.
For years, scientists have been debating that question. Now a new exhibit at the Natural History Museum in London, England, gives evidence for both sides.
""Everything says this dinosaur lived on dead meat,"" said American scientist Jack Horner. He helped the museum prepare for the exhibit.

was not fast enough to catch other dinosaurs. He also says that its arms were too small to use for grabbing prey. Prey is an animal hunted by another animal for food.
means ""tyrant lizard king."" Tyrant means ""cruel ruler.""
Other scientists don't agree with Horner. They argue that
wasn't fast, they say, it could have hunted slower dinosaurs. Scientists also say that
did not need its arms to hunt. Animals without arms, such as sharks and snakes, hunt prey.
have been both a hunter and a scavenger? One museum official thinks ""the truth lies somewhere in the middle."" It is up to visitors to think like scientists and decide for themselves. What do you think?
Why is it important to study both sides of an argument?

111,602,"A new study says chimps want to help.
Everyone knows helping others is a good thing - maybe even chimps! Scientists recently studied from Uganda. That is a country in Africa. The scientists did tests that show that chimps often help people or other chimps, even if they get nothing in return.
In one test, a person dropped a stick near a group of chimps. In most cases, a chimp handed the stick back to the person. Chimps care about other chimps too. In another test, a chimp handed over the stick when another chimp dropped it. The animals did not receive food or praise for their actions in either test.
The results surprised the scientists. They had long thought that humans are the only animals that help others. ""We've never seen this level ... of
in any other animals except humans,"" says chimp scientist Alicia Melis. Cooperation means working together. Scientists say the study suggests that chimps and humans may be born with the ability to be helpful.
So the saying ""Kindness is its own reward"" may not be true just for humans.
Chimpanzees are a type of great ape. Great apes are the largest primates. Primates are a group of animals. Other great apes are gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos.
The gorilla is the largest primate. A male gorilla can weigh as much as 500 pounds and stand up to 6 feet tall. Gorillas live in Africa.
uses tools more than any other animal does - except humans. A chimp might use a stone to crack a nut. Chimps live in Africa.
The orangutan has very long arms. That's because it lives mostly in trees. Orangutans live in Indonesia, a country in Asia.
is the smallest great ape. They can weigh up to 100 pounds. Bonobos are sometimes called ""little chimps."" Bonobos live in Africa.
What does the expression ""Kindness is its own reward"" mean?

112,156,"Many U.S. cities are running out of cash.
From Los Angeles, California, to New York, New York, cities across the country are pinching their pennies.
Because of the struggling economy, many cities do not have enough money to pay their bills. Cities are also short on cash to
workers wages and community programs. To fund something is to pay for it.
Everyone has been hurt by the [economy], William Johnson told
He is a money expert. City and state governments have been hurt the most.
Some experts say about 100 U.S. cities could go
this year. To go broke is to run out of money. One place in a cash crunch is Washington, D.C. The nations capital has millions of dollars of
San Francisco, California, also owes millions. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, recently ran out of money altogether.
Students protest budget cuts in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
To help refill cities piggy banks, officials are coming up with ways to save money. Some towns are turning off streetlights. Other officials say they are forced to cut jobs.
Officials in Detroit, Michigan, are making changes. They have cut police and road repairs in 20 percent of the city. Many people worry about how those cuts will affect life.

or out of work. Experts say there is one position available for every four people who are looking for work.

The act would give $477 billion to businesses, state and local governments, and individuals, Obama says. It would create jobs by paying money to fix roads. State officials would also get cash to pay teachers and police officers.

115,207,"The first day of school, in early October, was a fresh start for millions of kids in Iraq. This year, the old rules and lessons have changed. School is no longer a place where every lesson centers around Saddam Hussein. He ruled Iraq from 1979 until May 2003.
When Saddam ruled Iraq, teachers were forced to mention him in every class, from history to music. In gym class, students had to chant, ""We all love Saddam!"" while they exercised.
""Children's minds have shrunk here. They have no imagination. They [were] taught only to memorize,"" said one teacher.
Now students will have the chance to learn new ideas about the world. They will use new textbooks that do not include pictures of the former president of Iraq.
Although students are eager to learn, not all schools are ready to teach. Many schools still need supplies and books.
Americans are helping out. They have donated pencils, crayons, and other school supplies. U.S. soldiers are repainting and rebuilding schools.
What do you value most about your school? Why?
""Saddam Hussein is the past. He's gone,"" said one school principal. ""Americans are our friends, and they helped us rebuild our school.""

116,18,"People across America reach out to help victims of the hurricane.
Americans are working hard to get the Gulf Coast back on its feet. Cleanup after Hurricane Katrina is expected to take months. In some places, it may even take years. Roads, bridges, buildings, and houses need to be repaired.
Congress will spend billions of dollars to help rebuild. Other countries have donated millions.
Volunteers pass out bottles of water and food.
People across America are reaching out to Katrina's victims. Many people have donated money. Others have opened up their homes to families left homeless.
Government officials have also been working to help provide victims with houses, jobs, and education. Many kids are going to school in new communities.
""Our hearts go out to people, our brothers and sisters, along the Gulf Coast,"" says Mayor Bill White of Houston,Texas. ""They are welcome, and we are going to provide whatever support we need to.""
Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast on August 29. Winds reached more than 145 miles an hour by the time it hit land. The fierce storm destroyed buildings, homes, and trees. Officials estimated that hundreds of people died.
After Katrina passed, most of New Orleans, Louisiana, was flooded. The reason is that the
which protect the city, collapsed. A levee is a raised area that prevents flooding.
Thousands of people fled the storm. Now many want to know when they can go homeand if they still have a home. Many lost everything.
""We're dealing with one of the worst natural disasters in our nation's history,"" said President George W. Bush. ""The folks on the Gulf Coast are going to need the help of this country for a long time.""
is a strong, spinning storm that forms over oceans. Hurricane Katrina slammed into the coastlines of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

117,172,"NASA scientists are preparing for a mission that will have them seeing redthe Red Planet, that is! Officials at the U.S. space agency are gearing up to send a
to Mars in the next few weeks. A rover is a robotic spacecraft. It is expected to land on the planet next August.
. It will help find out whether life was once possible on Mars.
cameras will give researchers close-up views of the planet. They can show details smaller than the width of a human hair. The spacecraft also has a 7-foot-long robotic arm. It holds tools, such as a drill and a scoop. The tools will collect rocks and soil.
Researchers will study the materials to learn more about Mars, scientist Joy Crisp told
. She works for NASA. Im excited about what well find, she says.

118,523,"The third-grade class at Mulberry School has gone to the birds! A dark gray parrot regularly visits the Los Gatos, Calif., classroom to sit in on students reading lessons.
, or sits, on a chair and listens to the students read aloud. During the stories, Starbuck bobs his head, ruffles his feathers, and makes sounds. He responds in so many ways, teacher Judy Quigley told
Sharing a book with Starbuck helps students feel comfortable reading aloud because they dont worry about making mistakes. When you read to people, sometimes they dont really listen, but he always listens, Anna Averfa-Goodman, 9, told
Students keep Starbucks attention by changing their reading styles during stories. I say it kind of louder so he can hear it, explains Justine Hoover, 9. If that doesnt work, the third graders have another trick. They read the parrot a book about worms!

121,619,"On April 22, millions of people around the world will celebrate Earth Day. People are finding many ways-from inventions to projects-to help protect the environment. Look inside to find out how they are working to make a difference.
Earth Day inspires people to take action and help the environment. Many people will be spreading the message that the Earth needs to be cared for year-round.
Kids around the world will participate in Earth Day events. Some will clean up parks. Others will plant trees. What do you plan to do on Earth Day to help the environment?
One way to protect the Earth is to reduce pollution. Pollution occurs when people harm the air, land, and water. Most air pollution comes from the burning of fuels, such as oil, coal, and gas. The fuel is used to run cars and heat homes. Water and land pollution often come from chemicals and garbage.
Some Earth-friendly inventions help reduce pollution. These inventions conserve, or use fewer, energy and natural resources such as water. Take a look at some of these exciting inventions.
? An Earthship is actually not a ship at all. It is a house built to save energy and water. Earthships use solar power from the sun for heat and electricity.
Earthships are made from recycled material. Old tires, aluminum soda cans, and glass bottles are some common materials used to build Earthships.
Many people who live in Earthships also recycle their water. When it rains, they collect and filter the rainwater. The filter makes the water safe to use for drinking, washing, and cooking. The leftover water is saved for other uses, such as watering indoor plants.

122,200,"If you are mailing thank-you notes after the holiday season, each note will cost you a penny more. Starting this month, the U.S. Postal Service has increased the price of first-class stamps to 34 cents. The one-penny increase will raise about $2.5 billion (that's eight zeroes!) for the U.S. Postal Service.

123,387,"A military dog missing in Afghanistan returns to her troops.
Sabi is one smart pup. The dog knows how to sniff for bombs and protect soldiers. Recently, the black Labrador learned another skill: how to live on her own in Afghanistan for more than a year.
Afghanistan is a country in the Middle East. U.S. troops are at war in Afghanistan. They are fighting people who supported the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
About 70,000 U.S. troops are currently fighting in the war in Afghanistan. President Barack Obama recently announced that hes sending 30,000
The United States is not the only country fighting. Soldiers from more than 40 other countries are involved in the war. Sabi is part of a
of soldiers from Australia. A unit is a group. The military dog helps troops by
, or finding, bombs with her nose.
In September 2008, Sabis unit was fighting in Afghanistan. During the battle, she became separated from the soldiers. For months, Sabis unit searched for her without any luck.
Finally, a U.S. soldier spotted Sabi in November 2009. With the soldiers help, Sabi was
with her Australian unit. To reunite is to bring back together.
The troops will probably never know what their furry friend was up to all that time on her own. Theyre just glad to have found her. Says Australian leader Kevin Rudd, Sabi is back home in one piece.
The dog probably wouldnt mind lending another helping handor pawif soldiers need it.
251,827 square miles (slightly smaller than Texas)
28.4 million; about half are kids younger than 15
mostly mountains and deserts; only about 12 percent of the land can be farmed
What are some other ways dogs might help troops serving overseas?

125,173,"Talk about having all the right moves! In
, a tap-dancing penguin named Mumble tries to get his son to enjoy dancing.
Wade Robson lent his fancy footwork to the film, which hits theaters November 18. A choreographer creates the steps in a dance.
student reporter Bella Fletcher recently spoke with the man behind Mumbles moves.
Bella Fletcher: How do you create dances for animated characters?
You actually get to work with human dancers. ... The movements that the humans are doing are [used to create the movements of] the animated characters.
BF: What was the hardest part of making the dances?
There are always hundreds and hundreds of penguins [in a scene], but we only have 15 dancers. ... So I would have to imagine how a scene [would] look with hundreds and hundreds of penguins, but just create it with 15 [people].
[I like] Atticus, whos ... a chubby little rapper penguin. ... I actually played Atticus in the [first dance scene].

127,476,"There was a time when all a backpack was used for was to carry school books and papers. But today, backpacks are being weighed down by many things, such as laptop computers, sneakers, CDs, and video games.
Many doctors warn that heavy backpacks can lead to back and neck pain. Doctors say kids should wear backpacks high up on their backs. They recommend that a kid who weighs 50 pounds should not carry more than a 5-pound backpack.

128,111,"A new report shows pythons are spreading.
Whats 23 feet long, as thick as a telephone pole, and slithering into a state near you? A Burmese python!
Pythons and other giant snakes are worming their way into Florida and other states. That is the finding of a new report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The species are not
to, or originally from, the area. They might have started out as pets that were set free. Many pythons are native to Asia.
Today, there are tens of thousands of pythons in Florida. They may one day creep into almost one-third of the United States, scientists say.
They [can move] long distances in a short period of time, scientist Gordon Rodda told
. He worked on the study. We had a python in Florida that in a few weeks ... traveled 30 miles.
. Those are groups of plants and animals that live in the same area. The snakes eat everything from birds to bobcats. They lie still until an animal comes near. Then the
strike. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals that often have scales.
U.S. officials are coming up with ways to stop the snakes. One idea is to
people from bringing pythons into the country. To ban is to prevent.
People in Florida move an 18-foot-long python to a safer home.
People who own pet snakes can help too, Rodda says. If you have a snake that gets too big for your home, take it to a zoo. We dont want to create a problem by [setting free] an animal we no longer want to take care of, says Rodda.
What makes giant snakes special? Wrap your head around these python facts to find out.
, or squeeze, prey? They loop their bodies around the prey and tighten their muscles to kill the animals. Then they swallow them.
Only alligators are tough enough to eat adult giant snakes. Dont feel bad for the snakes, though. They eat alligators!
Female pythons can lay up to 100 eggs at a time. The snakes stay on the eggs for two to three months to keep them warm until they hatch.
What are other ways U.S. officials could stop the snakes?

129,422,"On Veterans Day, November 11, Americans honor U.S. veterans. Veterans are men and women who served as soldiers for our country. Veterans Day celebrations include speeches, ceremonies, and parades.
This year is the 50th anniversary of the Korean War. The Korean War started when North Korea invaded South Korea. Both countries are in Asia. Many ceremonies will honor veterans of the Korean War. Those veterans helped South Korea fight the war between 1950 and 1953.
Special Veterans Day services will be held at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. Many U.S. veterans are buried in that cemetery. People are also making plans for ceremonies in cities and towns all across the country. Many people will attend those services to honor our American veterans.

130,788,"Trained rats may soon be used to find survivors who are trapped after disasters.
Meet the soon-to-be members of rescue teams--rats! Scientists are training the rodents to help find people who are buried in buildings after earthquakes and other disasters.
Rats have a strong sense of smell, which can help them sniff out people. The rodents are also tiny enough to crawl just about anywhere. They can get into places that are too small for people and other animals, such as dogs.
Scientists trained the rats to search for the scent of people. They attached tiny electronic devices to the brain of each rat. Signals from the rat's brain are sent to a radio that is strapped to the animal's back. Rescue teams will be able to track the signals and follow the rat's path.

131,586,"Eagles and flamingos are invading Fernbank Elementary School in Decatur, Ga.! The animals are the names of some of the yoga poses students practice. Yoga is exercise that involves holding poses while breathing.
Students at the school have done yoga for more than two years. Teachers say it helps improve students' concentration and confidence. Teacher Janet Watson says yoga also helps her students deal with stress during tests. ""In between the different sections [of tests], we have them get up and do the [yoga] stretches,"" she told
Joshua, a third grader, likes the flamingo pose best. The move involves bending forward while extending one leg straight back. ""I love yoga because it is a very nice thing to do after working hard at school,"" Joshua told

132,313,"Finding a bug in your dinner is usually a bad thingunless you like your meals hot!
Scientists in Bolivia recently figured out that bugs help make some chili peppers spicy. Bolivia is a country in South America.
Certain types of bugs can poke holes in a chili peppers skin. That leaves the pepper open to becoming
, or sick. Chili peppers create special chemicals to keep the bugs away. Those chemicals also give peppers their famous spicy flavor.

134,98,"Parts of the Great Wall of China are more than 2,000 years old.
Danny Way, 31, jumped into the record books this summer. He became the first person to leap over the Great Wall of China on a skateboard.
Parts of the Great Wall of China are more than 2,000 years old. The wall is the largest structure ever built. Experts say it is about 4,000 miles long.
Way made the jump using a ramp that he helped build near his home in California. The ramp helped him speed over the wall at nearly 50 miles an hour. That is almost as fast as a car travels on the highway!

135,672,"Last September, scientists announced that an African monkey is now
or is no longer living. Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey is the first monkey to become extinct in nearly 300 years.
Scientists say the monkey is gone because of hunting and because people have destroyed much of the monkey's
or natural home. The monkey lived in the rain forests of Ghana and Ivory Coast, two countries in the western part of Africa.
Scientists warn that 25 other kinds of
(including monkeys and apes) may become extinct within the next 20 years.

136,225,"Everyone onboard the boat waited patiently. Suddenly, one person broke the silence. ""Manatee! Nobody move a muscle,"" whispered scientist Caryn Self Sullivan.
Looking into the shallow water, we spotted a baby manatee. To our surprise, the young manatee was alone. ""I've never seen one this small on its own!"" said Sullivan. We wondered,
That is exactly the kind of question we hoped to answer.
Along with other volunteers, I was helping scientists study manatees off the coast of Belize (beh-LEEZ). Belize is a country in Central America. We observed manatees and their
, an area where an animal lives. We were trying to find out how manatees spend their time.
Manatees are large marine mammals with wrinkled, grayish brown skin. They can grow to 13 feet long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds.
Scientists think that many manatees are living in the warm waters off the coast of Belize. Manatees have been protected by Belize law for about 70 years.
, or plant eaters. They eat more than 100 pounds of plants each day. That is about the same as 200 heads of lettuce!
Many people think manatees look like walruses, but they are actually related to elephants.
Manatees are very curious. They often swim up to boats or snorkelers to check them out.
, or in danger of dying out. Sometimes they are hunted for food. Many are killed when they get tangled in fishing gear or are hit by boats.
Sullivan's team is trying to find better ways of protecting manatees. I hope that with help from volunteers like me, Sullivan will be able to help these gentle giants survive.

138,210,"Superman may not be the only speedster faster than a speeding bullet. A team of
, or designers, in England is building the worlds fastest car. England is a country in Europe.
The Bloodhound SSC will travel at more than 1,000 miles per hour (mph). Most automobiles reach top speeds of about 120 mph. Engineers hope that the Bloodhound will zoom into the record books. They also hope the car will get kids excited to learn about science.
How will the Bloodhound be so speedy? The vehicle will be powered by a rocket and a jet engine.
Engineers hope to finish the car by 2011. Then driver Andy Green will get behind the Bloodhounds wheel and try to set the new speed record. He set the current record in 1997, when he drove another vehicle at 763 mph.

141,56,"NASA slams spacecraft into the moon to look for water.
This drawing shows a spacecraft speeding toward the moon.
Were going to crash! Those arent words NASA scientists usually like to hear. This fall, however, the U.S. space agency crashed spacecraft into the moonon purpose!
On October 9, two spacecraft smashed into Earths neighbor. They created a dent that is 100 feet wide. The big booms were part of a mission to find out whether there is water on the moon.
have found signs of small amounts of water in the moons soil. A satellite is an object that circles something else, such as a planet. Scientists think the moons south pole might have the most water. That part of the moon is almost always cold and in shadow, so the water may be ice.
The two spacecraft aimed for the moons south pole. When they crashed, they kicked up soil. Scientists are studying
, or information, from that soil. It will help them
, or figure out, whether their water guess is right.
Finding water on the moon would make a big splash. Scientists once thought the moon was dry. Having water up there would help astronauts. NASA hopes to set up stations on the moon where astronauts can live. If water were available, they would not have to bring as much of it from Earth.
Water on the moon could also be turned into fuel. That might help NASA power spacecraft headed to explore Mars and other planets.
Scientists are excited about the possibilities. The [spacecraft] returned ... data that will greatly improve our understanding, says Anthony Colaprete. He is a NASA scientist. The team is excited to dive into the data.
Temperatures on the moon can get as low as -400 degrees Fahrenheit. Thats not the moons only cool fact. Read on for more.
Only 12 peopleall Americanshave walked on the moon. The first was Neil Armstrong, in 1969.
Want to wish upon a star? Go to the moon. Stars are always shining, and the sky looks black even during the day.
, or bowl-shaped dents in the ground. The biggest crater on the moon is more than 1,300 miles wide!
Why might scientists want to learn more about outer space?

KR: How do you decide which actors voices to use?
It can be [hard]. ... We know what the character should look like, so we take a picture of it and we put it on a TV screen. Then we play different actors voices ... and imagine the voice coming out of that character.
KR: What do you hope kids take away from the new movie?
[I hope they learn] that its never too late to do the right thing in life. ... Its a good film about friendship too.

145,414,"Are you ready for a vacation thats out of this world? Officials in Russia recently announced plans to build a hotel in space.
The four-room hotel will be designed to
or fit, up to seven guests at a time. Rooms will have large windows so people can look down at Earth. The hotel will most likely open for business by 2016, according to Alexander Derechin. He works for the company that will build the space hotel.
Several other businesses are also working to put more people in space. A British airline company is building a shuttle to take visitors into space. It expects the aircraft to be completed by 2012.
That and other shuttles will keep the space hotel busy, says Derechin. Spaceships [for the public] are being built around the world, he says. They will need to fly somewhere.
Theres no hotel in the world like this one!

147,254,"Scientists in Greenland are going ducky over their latest experiment. Theyre using toy ducks to study ice! Greenland is a large island in Europe. It is near the North Pole.
The scientists recently set loose 90 rubber ducks in the Jakobshavn (yah-cuhb-SAH-ven) Glacier on Greenland. A glacier is a large sheet of ice that moves slowly over land. Scientists dropped the ducks into tunnels in the glacier called
Melting ice on the glacier flows into the moulins. Some experts say
is causing the ice to melt. Global warming is the slow rise of Earths temperature.
Where the water ends up is a mystery. Thats where the ducks come in. Scientists have labeled the toys with an e-mail address. They hope fishing crews will find the ducks and contact them. That will help scientists learn where the melting water travels.
Scientist Alberto Behar is waiting to hear some of the duck tales.
We havent heard back, but it may take ... time, he told reporters.

151,79,"Floodwater recently exploded from Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona. The water gushed down the Colorado River and into the Grand Canyon. A
is a long, narrow valley with high cliffs on each side.
Scientists released water from the dam to move 1 million tons of
down the Colorado River. Sediment is sand and soil carried by water. Scientists hope the sediment will collect on beaches and
to save endangered fish and plants. Sandbars are ridges of sand formed by moving water.
Glen Canyon Dam is a wall that people built across the Colorado River. It was made to store water and generate electricity. When it began operating in 1963, it stopped the flow of river water and most of the sediment.
Glen Canyon Dam is located in Arizona.
Without new sediment, beaches and sandbars started washing away. Plants growing along the beaches began to die off. Many young fish that depend on sandbars to survive started to die off too.
During the next two years, scientists will study the effects of the flooding. ""The Grand Canyon is one of the unique natural areas in the world,"" scientist Denny Fenn told
. ""It deserves protection. Anything we can do to save it, the better off we'll be.""
What might happen if Glen Canyon Dam were removed? Why?

152,298,"On August 14, millions of people were left in the dark. There was a blackout, or loss of electricity. It was the largest in U.S. history. The blackout affected eight states and some parts of Canada.
failure. A power grid is a system that controls the flow of electricity. In many places, the electricity was out for 48 hours.
The power came back on, but the problem is not over. Experts say a future blackout is possible. They say that the grid is carrying more electricity than it can handle.
President George W. Bush called the power failure a ""wake-up call."" He said that the power system is old and needs to be fixed.
Officials are trying to come up with ways to solve the problem. One idea is to build new power lines. Another idea is to update the old system. The goal is the same: to prevent future blackouts.

156,569,"Wiffle ball has become a favorite backyard game through the years. This year, the famous plastic ball turns 50!
The Wiffle ball was invented in 1953. A few years later, the yellow plastic bat became part of the game.
A Connecticut man got the idea for the Wiffle ball after watching his son play ball with a friend. ""He decided he wanted to make a ball that would make it easier for us to pitch,"" said his son.
The Wiffle ball is hollow and has eight holes on one side. In the air, the ball dips and curves. That makes it hard for a batter to hit.
How did the ball get its name? When a kid swung at a ball and missed, kids used to say he or she had whiffed, said the inventor's grandson.

Cartoon characters are being used to sell junk foods on TV. How does that affect you?
Thats wrong, says the Institute of Medicine, which advises the nation on health issues. The group says that kid-friendly characters should promote only foods that are good for you.
The group recently reported that food ads on TV have astrong influence on what kids under the age of 12 eat. ""Our eating habits and preferences form early in our lives,"" the groups spokesperson, Christine Stencel, told
Advertisers know kids have spending power. ""American kids spend about $200 billion each year. Foods high in sugar and fat are among the top 10 items,"" says Stencel. ""Kids also influence what their parents buy.""
Junk foods such as candy bars, sugared cereals, and potato chips are high in
A calorie is a measure of the amount of energy a food can provide. The body needs food as fuel. However, people gain weight when they take in more calories than they use up through activity.
Millions of people in the United States are
or severely overweight. Being overweight can lead to serious health problems.
""The committee thinks it is time people should take steps to reduce the problem of obesity,"" says Stencel. ""That includes making changes in what foods are marketed to kids and how they are promoted.""
Foods that are high in nutrition help people stay healthy. Good choices:
foods with whole grains, such as whole-wheat breads and pastas
a variety of fruits and vegetables in a rainbow of colors
calcium-rich, nonfat or low-fat foods, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt
What are some other ways advertisers get kids to buy their products?

158,352,"You shrink down in the chair, looking nervously at the door. As the doorknob turns, your knees start to shake. You look for somewhereanywhereto hide.
Does that sound like your last trip to the dentist?
Checkups for your chompers may not be scary for much longer. Experts in England have come up with a gel that can fix common tooth troubles without a drill.
, or rot. That occurs when bacteria create tiny holes in your teeth. The gel fills those holes. It helps the teeth rebuild themselves. [The gel] is ... pain-free, says scientist Jennifer Kirkham. She helped invent the gel.

160,652,"Say good-bye to French fries and hello to fresh fruit. The U.S. Congress is considering new rules to make school lunches healthier.
, or lawmakers, plan to discuss the Child Nutrition Act this fall. That law, passed in 1966, requires schools to make sure lunches have enough healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables.
Health experts say Congress may chew on changes to the law. For example, legislators may ask schools to serve only low-fat milk and to use less salt in lunches.
Some schools are already on the right track. Many have traded in hot dogs for baked chicken tenders. Others serve whole-wheat bread.

Being president of the United States isnt easy. Ask Barack Obama. Every day he faces huge problems, such as trying to create work for unemployed Americans.
Who would want such a hard job? Many people! There are 10 Republican
They want to run against Obama in the 2012 presidential election. A candidate is a person who runs for something. Obama is a Democrat.
Republicans and Democrats are the two main U.S.
Those are groups of people who share beliefs about how a nation should be run. Each party
The main Republican candidates are Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, Jon Huntsman, Gary Johnson, Ron Paul, Rick Perry, Buddy Roemer, Mitt Romney, and Rick Santorum. When
went to press, Romney and Gingrich were leading in polls of Republican voters.

Romney was the governor of Massachusetts. If elected, he says, he will create jobs. About 9 percent of Americans are unemployed. My number-one job will be to see that America ... is number one in job creation, Romney says.
Gingrich was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1978. Today he works as a political speaker. I believe we can return America to ... full employment, Gingrich says.
Election Day is almost a year away, but Republicans are hard at work. Beginning in 2012, they will hold special votes. They will narrow down their choices for a candidate.
Who will Obama face to be our next president? The voters will decide.
There are only three requirements to serve as the nations president, according to the U.S. Constitution.
How might Republicans decide which candidate to nominate?

165,214,"On March 27, hundreds of colorful kites will fill the sky over the National Mall. That is a park in Washington, D.C., where a kite festival will be held. Nearly 25,000 people attend the popular event each year. This year's theme is ""Kites Around the World.""
""Kites are something people celebrate all over the world,"" event organizer Brandi Rose told
. ""The festival is a way to bring all of the
together in one place,"" she said. The culture of a group of people refers to their way of life, ideas, and traditions.
Some people have built their own kites for the festival. ""I chose to build a Japanese fighter kite,"" said Mike Van Meers. ""In 17th-century Japan, the kites were built with bamboo and paper. I'm building one with modern materials.""
Experts think kites were first made in China more than 2,000 years ago. Legend has it that a Chinese farmer invented the kite. On a very windy day, he tied a string to his hat. He held the string to keep his hat from blowing away.
Traders from China spread kite flying to other parts of the world. ""Kites come in all different shapes and sizes,"" said Van Meers. ""Every culture is unique, and every culture has a different style.""
The kite gets its name from a bird of the same name. Kites are graceful, soaring birds with long, narrow wings. These birds were once common in England. In the 1600s, kids in England made toys that sailed through the sky when pulled with a string. When the toys moved, they looked like the gliding birds.
Why is learning about different cultures important?

166,729,"The future of three NASA space shuttles is up in the air. NASA stands for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. That is the U.S. space agency.
in 2011. It has used space shuttles for 29 years to send astronauts into space. NASA is replacing the shuttles with more high-tech spacecraft.
Officials at 21 museums are making it their mission to get a shuttle. They are trying to
NASA to choose them. To persuade is to convince. Mike Bush is one of those officials. He works at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington. That museum has already built a special room for the spacecraft in case it is chosen.
The shuttle would help kids learn about space, Bush told

167,330,"Heres a fun holiday gift! Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are back in
. Actor and singer Jesse McCartney, 22, does the voice of Theodore.
student reporter Arin Soileau interviewed McCartney about the movie, which comes out December 25.
. Theodore ... was actually my favorite. Hes easy to like. Hes very friendly.
How long did it take you to make the movie?
It takes ... about six to eight weeks to record all the voices, but it takes the
[or people who draw the scenes] up to two years to animate all of the cartoons.
What advice do you have for kids interested in movie or music careers?
It is one of those things that ... doesnt happen overnight. You have to put a lot of time into it. Its an amazing experience. Its also a lot of hard work.
I love to cook. I [also] love classic cars.

168,453,"A United States vice president is a heartbeat away from the most powerful position in the world. A vice president must be ready to become president if the current president dies or cannot finish his or her term in office.

Professor Sharon Gursky-Doyen helped find the critters. She told

172,10,"Railroad tracks connecting Seoul and Pyongyang should be completed in September 2001. Seoul is South Korea's capital. Pyongyang is North Korea's capital.
North Korea and South Korea are two countries in Asia. They have been officially at war for 47 years. Now, however, the countries seem to be making tracks toward peace.
South Korean workers have begun rebuilding railroad tracks that will connect South Korea's capital with North Korea's capital. When complete, the tracks will connect the cities for the first time in 50 years.
The two countries fought a war against each other from 1950 to 1953. The United States, China, and other countries also fought in the war. The war ended when North Korea and South Korea agreed to stop fighting. However, neither country signed a peace treaty. Since then, they have been enemies. Today, 2 million soldiers protect the border between North and South Korea.

173,684,"Scientists put on their detective hats in search of giant pandas.
Scientists were on the case! They collected clues. The scientists saw paw prints in the mud and fur on the bark of trees. What were they doing? Counting giant pandas!
After four years, the detective work is done. During that time, scientists figured out how many pandas live in China. All wild giant pandas live in that country.
""Pandas are very hard to see in the wild,"" scientist Colby Loucks told
. ""They hide in the thick bamboo forests."" That is why scientists used clues to do the count.
The result of the panda count was a surprise to scientists. They learned that hundreds more pandas exist than experts once thought! ""We found pandas living in areas we didn't know had any,"" said Loucks.
Is it important to protect endangered animals? Why?
Although the news is good, pandas remain
. That means they are in danger of dying out.
A Panda spends 14 hours a day eating up to 83 pounds of bamboo.
A Newborn panda weighs 3 to 4 ounces. That is about the size a hamster.
A panda's front paws have a wrist bone. The bone works like a thumb. The panda uses it to grasp bamboo.
loss. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal lives. Panda habitat is lost when people cut down parts of the forest for wood and farming.
Currently, China has more than 40 giant panda nature centers. People are not allowed to cut down trees there. Scientists want to create more nature centers to give pandas a better chance for survival.

Katies Krops took root two years ago when Katie received a cabbage seedling in her third-grade class. Katie planted her seedling in her yard. It grew into a 40-pound cabbage!
Katie decided to donate the giant cabbage to a
A soup kitchen is a place that gives food to people who cannot afford it. When Katie saw all the people who depended on the soup kitchen for their meals, she knew she wanted to do more to help. Thats when she thought of Katies Krops.

175,563,"In 1990, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) launched the Hubble Space Telescope into space. It has taken thousands of photos of planets, stars, and other space objects.
The Hubble Space Telescope takes photos from 380 miles above Earth. Hubble is huge. It is almost the size of a large school bus!
Earlier this year, astronauts went to space to attach a new camera to Hubble. The new camera has helped scientists make many discoveries.
Recently, Hubble took a photo of the Cone Nebula. A nebula is a cloud of gas and dust in space. Nearby hot stars cause the Cone Nebula to glow red.

176,442,"What would you get if you crossed a dinosaur, a bird, and Bugs Bunny? You might get a bucktoothed dinosaur. Scientists recently found the remains of such a dinosaur in China. The dino has birdlike wings and two large buckteeth!
Scientists say the bucktoothed dinosaur's teeth were not sharp. That is why they think the creature was most likely a plant eater. The dinosaur is related to the T. Rex. Until now, scientists thought all dinosaurs related to T. Rex were meat eaters!

178,480,"Welcome home, Hua Mei (HWAH MAY)! Hua Mei is the first giant panda born in the United States to survive and go to the panda's homeland of China.
Hua Mei, now 4 years old, was born at the San Diego Zoo in California.
In 1996, China loaned her parents to the United States. The two nations agreed that any cubs born in the United States would be sent to China.
A few months ago, Hua Mei arrived in China by airplane. Now she lives in a protected nature center with other pandas. ""She seems quite happy to be in the land of her ancestors,"" said one spokesperson.

all rooms, doors, windows, and smoke alarms.
at least two ways out of each room. That way you will know how to escape no matter where you are, and no matter where the fire is.
a meeting place outside, away from your home, where all members of your household can gather after they have left the building.
any fire escapes or fire stairs in your building if you live in an apartment or high rise. (Talk to your building manager or local fire department about what you should do if a fire starts in your building.)
the location of a neighbor's house, public phone, or call box to alert the fire department. (Or, assign a family member to bring a portable phone when exiting your home.)
""Develop a home fire escape plan with your family. Practice your home escape plan at least twice a year. Pretend that some escape routes are blocked by smoke and fire so that you can practice using different exits. Close all doors behind you as you exit to keep smoke from spreading through your home.

181,759,"Standing on a cliff, a sharpshooter carefully aimed his rifle at a Mexican gray wolf. Bulls-eye! The wolf went down. A short time later, he shot a second wolf.
The wolves, however, weren't injured. The sharpshooter had shot special darts at them. The darts contained a drug that put the wolves to sleep.
U.S. government officials picked up the sleeping wolves. They planned to move the wolves to an area far away from people.
The two wolves are part of a program to bring wolves back to Arizona and New Mexico. Until about 1900, the Mexican gray wolf lived in both states. Some of the wolves ate cattle and attacked people. People hunted the wolves because they thought the animals were dangerous. By 1950, few wolves were left in the area.
The U.S. government has brought wolves back to those states. But ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico say wolves are causing problems again.
What's the scariest animal? Is it a grizzly bear, a shark, or a wolf? Or is it something else? Believe it or not, deer are more dangerous.
Deer may seem harmless, but they can cause a lot of trouble. Deer often wander onto busy roads. When they do, they can cause car accidents. In 2001, deer caused 26,000 car accidents. A year earlier, they caused 83 human fatalities.
Ranchers say the wolves that the sharpshooters hit with darts killed 19 calves. The ranchers fear that the wolves might attack people as well.
""I can handle the bears and the mountain lions and the bobcats,"" said one rancher. When you see [those animals], they take off. They're scared of you. These wolves, they're not scared. And that's what scares me.""
The ranchers say wolves cannot be reintroduced to their area because too many people live there now. ""You can't turn back the clock,"" one person said.

182,134,"Kim Corbin of California skips everywhere she goes. She skips to work, she skips to the store, and she skips home. As she skips around town, Corbin shouts, ""Skippers, skip on!""
Corbin got hooked on skipping in April 1999 when she began skipping with a friend. As she skipped, she thought, ""This is happiness.""
Since that time, Corbin has founded her own organization dedicated to getting people to skip. So far, 1,000 people in 32 cities have become skipping enthusiasts.
Soon, Corbin will skip into classrooms across the United States. She plans to take her message that skipping is a fun and healthful activity to school-children in 38 states.
Corbin says skipping can be part of an exercise program. She wants to get kids and their parents to skip and do other exercises together. Corbin has lost 25 pounds since she started skipping two years ago.
Corbin says that she makes skipping into a game. ""Just sneak in five steps wherever you are, and no one is even going to notice it,"" she advised.

185,634,"Ann Thompson is one of the best athletes in the world. She is the captain of the U.S. Paralympic women's basketball team. She has already won five medals in earlier Paralympic games, and she is determined to win another in Sydney, Australia. Recently,
The Paralympics run from October 18 to 29.
: The Paralympics began in 1960. They parallel the Olympic Games. That's where the name comes from.
: What sports are part of the Paralympics?
: Eighteen sports are included the Paralympics. This year, we have two new sports, wheelchair rugby and sailing.
: Who can compete in the Paralympics?
: This year, 125 countries are sending 4,000 athletes, each with a physical disability.
: Besides the health benefits, sports teach many skills. First, there's the mental discipline involved with sports. You always have to concentrate, think, and plan ahead. Also, sports teach teamwork, leaderships skills, and self-confidence.
: Sports have always been a part of your life. What happened when you were 16 years old that almost ended your sports career?
: When I was younger, I was a skier. I was training in Austria when I fell and severed my spinal cord.
: How did that accident change your life?
: It didn't change anything. I never missed a beat. The accident didn't change my goals. My mind was not touched in the accident. I could do everything after the accident that I could do before it, except walk.
I'm the same person today that I was before the accident.
: Well, one thing changed. I switched sports. I'm no longer a skier. In the 1988, 1992, and 1996 Paralympics, I competed in track and field events, winning four medals. This year, I'm on the basketball team.
: What do you plan to do in Sydney?
: If you could say one thing to the kids of America, what would you tell them?
: Try. And I mean really try. If you want to do something, give it your best effort. If you find a roadblock in your path, take a detour. If you really want to do something, you can find a way to do it.

186,740,"Have you seen a 6-foot-tall statue that has red hair and red nose and is wearing a yellow outfit with big, floppy red shoes? If so, the police in Normal, Illinois, want to talk to you. They're looking for a statue of Ronald McDonald that was stolen from a McDonald's restaurant.
Police say this is the third time that the statue has been stolen in the last five years. A spokesperson for the McDonald's restaurant isn't sure how the statue was removed from the restaurant grounds. ""The guys who put the statue in [after the last time it was taken] said there was no way he was going to be taken again,"" the spokesperson said. But the installers were wrong.
The people who stole the statue may think that the theft is a prank. But they broke the law by stealing someone else's property. McDonald's wants Ronald back. The restaurant is offering a $250 reward for information on the missing statue's whereabouts.

. On April 14, 1912, the luxury liner struck an iceberg on its first voyage and sank to the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean. Now the world's most famous shipwreck is rapidly falling apart, say divers.

wreck had changed since his dive four years earlier. ""It is just deteriorating so much more rapidly than I would have expected.""

historians say that divers and filmmakers are contributing to the deterioration of the ship.
departed from Southampton, England, it was hailed as ""unsinkable."" The ship was traveling to New York. More than 1,500 people sank to their graves 2 miles below the ocean's surface on that fateful April night.
In 1985, ocean explorer Robert Ballard and his team discovered the wreck. They found it in two pieces about 350 miles off the coast of Newfoundland. The team was amazed at how well the ship had withstood the test of time. In fact, they believed it would remain in good condition for years to come.
But that's no longer the case. Since its discovery, the
wreck has drawn filmmakers, scientists, and even tourists. During the past 18 years, divers have recovered objects-from shoes to dinnerware to life preservers-from the wreck. Thieves have also stolen items.
Some tourists pay thousands of dollars to visit the

Each time a mini sub visits the site, further damage occurs. The propellers swirl around the rusticles and stir up the sandy bottom. ""Visitors do more damage than anybody else,"" said the president of the
In recent years, the mast, boat deck, and officer cabins have all collapsed. So has the crow's-nest where a lookout once warned, ""Iceberg right ahead!""
Ocean experts fear that the rest of the ship could fall apart within the next 50 years. Government officials in the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and France are exploring ways to save the wreck.
Historians continue to debate whether people should be allowed to visit the shipwreck. Some think it should be left as a memorial to those who sank with the ship.
Marine explorer Robert Ballard found the Titanic wreck 18 years ago. He told Weekly Reader that he had mixed feelings about the discovery. Although he felt both pride and joy, he also remembered that the site is a graveyard. ""I couldn't help but think about the [more than 1,500] lost souls who died,"" he said.
Do you think it's important to preserve the Titanic? Why or why not?
Ballard believes the wreck should be left alone. ""The site is a memorial, and it is better to bring people there through advanced technology rather than ravage the site through salvage,"" he said.

188,787,"Condoleezza Rice is the first African American woman to become secretary of state.
After the November election, President Bush nominated Condoleezza Rice to become secretary of state. That is the highest job in the president's
Rice will make history as the first-ever African American woman secretary of state. ""The secretary of state is America's face to the world, and in [Condoleezza Rice] the world will see the strength, grace, and decency of our country,"" Bush told reporters.
Being a leader is nothing new to Rice. In 2001, Rice was the first African American woman to become national security adviser. In that position, she worked closely with President Bush and advised him on defense matters.
As secretary of state, Rice will advise President Bush on U.S. foreign affairs. She will serve as a top
. A diplomat is a person who represents his or her country abroad. Rice will also work with leaders of other countries on important issues, such as the war in Iraq and the rebuilding of South Asia after the tsunami.
Rice has overcome odds to make it to one of the country's top jobs. She was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1954, during a time when black people were
, or separated, from white people in the South.
Rice says her parents taught her that education was the best way to overcome segregation. At 15, she attended college at the University of Denver in Colorado.
Bush believes that Rice, a classical pianist and former competitive ice skater, is up to the challenge. ""It is an honor to be asked to serve ... my country once again,"" said Rice.
The president's Cabinet is made up of a group of leaders who are in charge of the 15 departments in the executive branch of the government. The president heads up that branch.
The Senate must approve President Bush's Cabinet choices. Not everyone agrees with the president's choices for those positions.
The chart shows the Cabinet departments in the order in which they were created.

189,261,"Manatees often graze in shallow waters off the coast of Florida. These seadwelling plant eaters play with divers and swimmers. The huge animals are often called sea cows because of their large size.
Manatees were once thought to be on the edge of
or dying out completely. In the 1970s, there were only about 1,000 manatees left. Today, there are more than 3,000.
As a result, Florida recently removed the manatee from its list of
Endangered species are animals or plants that are at risk of dying out.
The first laws protecting this slow-moving marine mammal were passed in the late 1970s. Those laws made hunting, capturing, or killing manatees illegal.
As Floridas human population grew, however, manatees faced more threats. Last year alone, 396 manatees died in Florida, according to the states Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Many manatees have been injured or killed in collisions with boats. Others have gotten tangled in fishing gear. Manatees are also threatened because of the loss of their
As builders develop along the coastline, they destroy the manatees natural homes.
Environmental factors, such as red tide, have also taken their toll on the playful creatures. Red tide occurs when millions of tiny organisms are present in an area of the water. Those tiny organisms turn the ocean red and brown. Some of them are harmful to fish and other animals.
Red tide occurs naturally in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2005, more than 80 manatees were killed in red-tide outbreaks.
Not everyone thinks it is a good idea to remove manatees from the list. Many wildlife experts worry that the unusual mammals will not receive the same protection they had in the past. ""We cant celebrate yet,"" warned manatee expert Patrick Rose in an interview with
State officials say that the manatee is not under urgent threat. Although the huge creatures are being removed from Floridas list, state scientists say that the animal will remain protected under the nations Endangered Species Act. That law offers special protection to animals and plants facing extinction.
Wildlife officials say protection of the manatees might even be strengthened. The next step calls for the writing of a plan to continue increasing the number of manatees. ""There will be no less protection,"" says Henry Cabbage of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
A manatee recently got a taste of the Big Apple. Manatees are rarely seen far from the warm coastal waters of Florida, but one adventurous sea cow swam north to waters off New York City this summer. The large marine visitor then swam to waterways about 25 miles inland. Wildlife officials say its not unusual for manatees to
or move from one place to another. However, the mammals typically dont go much farther north than Virginia.
Should manatees have been removed from Floridas endangered species list? Why or why not?

The $10 bill is getting a new look! To outsmart counterfeiters, the U.S. government is rolling out a newly redesigned $10 bill that has splashes of red, yellow, and orange.
are people who try to make fake bills that look like the real ones. Counterfeiting is a crime.
""The new $10 note design continues the U.S. government's efforts to make our currency safer, smarter, and more secure,"" says Dawn Haley of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which produces all U.S. paper money.
The $10 bill is the latest in the series to get a new design. The $50 bill was updated last year, and the $20 bill was given a makeover in 2003.
There are several colorful changes on the new bill. A red image of the Statue of Liberty's torch appears next to the portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the treasury. On the portrait's other side is the phrase ""We the People,"" also in bright red ink. The background is light orange, and small yellow 10s surround the torch. A new ink makes the numeral 10 in one of the corners change color from copper to green when the bill is tilted.
But don't expect to find the new $10 note in your wallet just yet. In January 2006, the U.S. government will begin to circulate the new bills. The government plans to redesign the currency every seven to 10 years to stay ahead of counterfeiters.

191,127,"Trained rats may soon be used to find survivors who are trapped after disasters.
A team of scientists might be ditching the phrase ""oh, rats!"" from their vocabulary. They are experimenting with ways that rats may help find people who are buried as a result of earthquakes or other disasters.
Like dogs, rats have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out survivors. The rodents are also small enough to crawl almost anywhere. Dogs can be limited in their searches because of their larger size.
The scientists trained the rats to recognize the scent of people. To do that, researchers implanted electronic devices into the brains of the animals.
The electronic devices affect the rat's brain so that it picks up the scent of a person and then plans how to locate the person. Signals from the rat's brain are relayed to a radio transmitter that scientists attach to the rodent's back.
Rescue teams then will be able to track those signals and follow the rat's path. That will help rescuers determine where to start digging for survivors. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next nine months.

192,54,"In the summer of 2004, Olivia Till, a student at Courtland Elementary School in Virginia, cut off a foot of her light brown hair. She donated her ponytail to Locks of Love. The Florida-based organization provides wigs to children who have lost their hair because of illness. Some children have lost their hair from cancer treatments.
Olivia, then a fourth grader, felt proud of herself for making the donation, but she wanted to do more. So she asked her principal, Sherri Steele, if she could organize a schoolwide cut-a-thon for the program.
Her principal liked the idea so much that she decided to donate her own hair as well. ""I've never had short hair in my life, so this was a personal challenge for me,"" Steele told
This past spring, a group of 29 students and teachers cut off their hair for donation to Locks of Love. Now a fifth grader, Olivia is planning to hold a second cut-athon in her school in December. She hopes her hair is long enough for another donation. What's her advice to others? ""Start something in your school or your community,"" Olivia told

194,531,"For most kids, the average school daysix and a half hoursis long enough. But in some states, officials want more time on students' side. Kids need more time to learn, they say.
More class time can improve test scores, according to a recent report by the research group Education Sector. As a result, schools are experimenting with tacking on an hour or more to the school day.
Elementary and middle school students at Fletcher-Maynard Academy in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have gone to an eight-hour school day. Fletcher-Maynard Academy is just one of 10 schools in Massachusetts trying out the new schedule. Lawmakers in Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, and Washington, D.C., are also debating extended school hours.
People in favor of longer school days say kids need to learn more to stay competitive in today's world. The additional hours enable teachers to spend more time on each subject. Fletcher-Maynard principal Robin Harris likes having the extra hours. ""Teachers can be a little more creative,"" she told
Students aren't just spending the extra time with their heads in a book, though. Harris explains that her students get longer recesses and more snack time. Parent Dawn Oliver says her 11-year-old daughter, Brittany, is an advice columnist for a magazine at her school in Fall River, Massachusetts. ""The kids get so involved in these things because it's not all book work,"" says Oliver.
Critics argue that extended school days could be too long for today's busy kids. And extra school time might prevent students from exploring other interests. Some students have complained about having to stay later. They are concerned that they wouldn't be able to concentrate during the last classes of the day.
Other people point out that longer school days
with, or get in the way of, after-school sports and clubs. ""The day is long enough already,"" student Cameron Villers from Ansonia, Connecticut, told
""After-school activities would be affected. Nobody wants to be at school from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m."" If schools have different schedules, planning athletic games could prove difficult.

195,652,"Your body is constantly under attack. Dirt and germs surround your body. Only one thing stands between dirt and the organs inside your body-skin.
Skin may not seem very important, but it is. It protects your body from burns, dirt, germs, and dangerous rays from the sun. It keeps fluids inside your body. And it contains all the nerves that allow you to feel things.
Skin is the largest organ in your body. If you stretched out an adult's skin into a flat sheet, it would cover an area of about 21 square feet. A square foot is a square whose sides each measure 1 foot.
Skin may cover a large area, but it is very thin. It is only about 1/8 inch thick. Despite being so thin, skin is made of three layers. The outermost layer is the epidermis. Just below the outermost layer is the dermis. Beneath those two layers is the subcutaneous tissue.
The epidermis contains a chemical called keratin. Keratin makes skin tough and waterproof. Keratin keeps germs out of your body.
The dermis is mainly made of blood vessels and nerve endings. The dermis provides the epidermis with food and oxygen.
The lowest layer, the subcutaneous tissue protects the body from blows. It also regulates the body's temperature.
All three layers of your skin protect you. Because your skin protects you, you should protect it by keeping it clean and eating a healthful diet. You should use sunblock when you are in the sun. If you take care of your skin, it will last a lifetime.

197,720,"People often take trips on our nation's roads and highways. But recently, several sections of an old road went on a trip of their own.
Last month, workers in Oklahoma loaded about a dozen pieces of historic Route 66 onto trucks. Each of the 3,000-pound pieces then made a 1,400-mile trip to Washington, D.C., where they will become part of an exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
Route 66 has been called the ""Main Street of America."" It once stretched 2,400 miles, from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California. The road connected eight states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
In the 1920s, engineer Cyrus Stevens Avery of Tulsa, Oklahoma, envisioned a road connecting the Midwest and the Pacific Ocean. During the 1930s, Route 66 was completed and was soon lined with hundreds of businesses.
The road became so popular that it inspired a 1960s TV show,
, as well as a famous song, ""Get Your Kicks on Route 66.""
In the past few decades, however, Route 66 has fallen into disrepair, and parts of the old route have been dug up. Today, drivers use faster superhighways to get where they were going.
Even though fewer people drive on Route 66 now, many people still think of the road as the Main Street of America. That's why the National Museum of American History wants to include the road in its new exhibit, ""America on the Move."" The exhibit is scheduled to open in 2003.

198,783,"Elephants in New Delhi will soon be wearing reflectors so they can be seen at night.
The size of an elephant should make it easy to spot, right? That is not the case for some elephants in India.
Several elephants in New Delhi--the capital of that Asian country--have been hit by cars and killed. So a wildlife group has begun fitting the elephants with safety reflectors.
The reflectors work like the ones you find on a bike, bouncing back light from oncoming cars. The reflectors are attached to ropes that hang near an elephant's tail and hind legs.
In New Delhi, about 30 elephants work at night to help clear fallen trees. Many elephants are also forced to walk in the dark, after working at weddings and other religious festivals late at night. The elephants' dark skin makes it difficult for drivers to see them in the evening.
A wildlife group expert said, ""Most of India's 5,000 working elephants will soon [be wearing reflectors]."" That's a safe move!

An expedition to the Arctic has uncovered a giant sea reptile.
Scientists have discovered the skeleton of a sea monster near the North Pole. Researchers from Oslo, Norway, recently announced that they have found a complete
skeleton. A plesiosaur is a prehistoric marine reptile about the size of a bus. The recent discovery is believed to be the first complete plesiosaur skeleton ever found.
during an expedition to the Svalbard islands, 300 miles off the coast of Norway, in August. Fossils are the remains of plants or animals from millions of years ago preserved in rock.
The meat-eating reptile lived more than 150 million years ago, during the Jurassic Period. Some scientists call it the
of the sea. ""We think it is [a 26-foot] skeleton from snout to tail,"" team leader Jorn Hurum told
He described the plesiosaurs long teeth as being ""the size of bananas.""
The expedition also uncovered fossils from 27 other marine reptiles on the islands. ""We hope to find lots more in the years to come,"" says Hurum. ""We have just scratched the surface.""

200,35,"Are You Smarter Than A Fifth Grader?
How many sides does a rhombus have?
Which planet is typically the brightest in the night sky?
In what month do we observe Columbus Day?
Stumped? Those are just a few of the questions that have challenged adult contestants on the TV quiz show
Are You Smarter than a Fifth Grader?
Fox's hit show, hosted by the comedian Jeff Foxworthy, is making the grade with audiences. About 26.5 million viewers tuned in for the
or first show, earlier this year. It was the biggest audience for a U.S. television premiere in more than eight years.
In each episode, adult contestants are quizzed on a series of questions from their elementary school days. The grown-ups tackle questions in various subjects, including math, science, geography, and social studies. The player's goal is to answer 10 questions plus a bonus correctlyand then take home $1 million!
But the show has a twist: The players are not alone. Five fifth graders appear on each episode to lend a hand. The kids have their favorite subjects. Ten-year-old Kyle Collier from Los Angeles, California, is fond of math, reading, and history.
The show offers up its share of embarrassment for the grown-ups. If a contestant drops out or answers incorrectly and isn't ""saved"" by a fifth grader, the player must face the camera and say, ""I'm not smarter than a fifth grader."" The program airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

201,45,"Third grader David Bates won the Weekly Reader American Values contest. The U.S. Army and the Pentagon sponsored the contest. Nearly 14,000 kids in grades 3 through 6 entered the contest.
The contest asked kids to write an essay that answered this question: Which of seven American values-loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, or courage-is the most important in your daily life? Those seven American values are the core values of the U.S. Army.
David chose selfless service as the most important value in his life. David wrote that the other six values are part of selfless service. ""It is most important in my everyday life because it incorporates all the other values.""
David; his younger brother, Andrew; and his parents traveled from their home in Spanish Fork, Utah, to Washington, D.C., to get his prize. On November 11, they attended the Veterans Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery.
The next day, David was made honorary mayor of the Pentagon. He toured the Pentagon, where he met Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard Myers.

202,494,". If you think those words are spoken only by adults who wear suits and work on Wall Street, think again. Some of today's investors wear baggy pants and T-shirts and ride skateboards. In other words, they're kids! About 5 million U.S. kids ages 12 to 17 don't just stash their money in piggy banks or savings accounts. They invest in the stock market.
A stock market is a place to buy and sell
of stock in all kinds of companies. Owning a share of stock means you own a small piece of a company. The more shares you own, the more of a company you own.
, or use their money to buy stocks, in the stock market are called
. If a company makes money, it may pay investors
, or some of the company's profits. Another way investors make money is by selling their shares of stock at a price higher than the price they paid when they bought shares of the company's stock.
Making money in the stock market may seem easy, but it's risky. Investors can lose money when a stock's price drops.
That's why financial experts say kids should learn about a company before investing in it. One expert suggests that kids start by investing in companies that make products they use.

205,568,"Ten-year-old Hunter York might have a fear of snakes, but that didn't stop him from picking up the two-headed creature that he found in his father's backyard.
The Kentucky boy used a stick to pick up the two-headed black king snake.
The snake ""kind of freaked me out a bit,"" he said.
Hunter ran into the house to tell his father about the 8 1 / 2-inch reptile.
, like this snake, are cold-blooded animals that either crawl around on the ground or, like turtles and lizards, creep on short legs.
Hunter's dad left the reptile with a snake expert because they couldn't get it to eat.
""We couldn't force-feed it because we don't know which head eats,"" said his dad.
One scientist said that Hunter's find was very rare. Only about one of every 10,000 snakes has two heads!

206,665,"In San Francisco, baseball last season went to the dogs-- Portuguese water dogs, that is.
A team of six Portuguese water dogs helped the San Francisco Giants every time the baseball team played at home at Pacific Bell Park. The dogs are members of the Baseball Aquatic Retrieval Korps (BARK). They retrieved home run baseballs hit into nearby McCovey Cove.
BARK uses Portuguese water dogs because they are excellent swimmers. The dogs have webbed feet and use their tails as rudders. Portuguese fishermen use these swimming hounds to herd schools of fish into nets and deliver messages between ships.

207,628,"Drinks like soda have caffeine and lots of sugar.
Soft-drink companies are in fizzy competition. Many people in the United States are overweight. In the face of the nation's growing health and nutrition problems, many schools have banned soft drinks and other high-sugar snacks from vending machines.
As a result, the pressure is on for soft-drink companies to find new ways to stay in school. Some companies, such as Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, are introducing new milk-based drinks in different flavors to be sold in schools.
Some experts claim, though, that the milk-based drinks are still too high in sugar. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration won't allow the makers of those products to use the word
in their names. That's because the beverages don't have enough calcium and other minerals in them.
is a mineral found in milk and other dairy products that helps build strong teeth and bones.
Soft-drink giants aren't the only beverage companies trying to find their place in school districts. As part of a deal with New York City, Snapple will be the only drink company to have vending machines in the city's schools. To meet the city's rules banning high-sugar foods from schools, Snapple had to create four new 100-percent juice drinks.
Not good enough, say some nutrition experts who claim the new Snapple drinks have more calories and sugar in them than soft drinks have. Unlike orange juice and grapefruit juice, the new juices contain only small amounts of nutrients and vitamins. ""The fact is... they are pretty much the same as a [soft drink],"" said one expert.
Why is it important to read food labels carefully?
Other nutritionists disagree. They say the new juices and milk products are an improvement over previously available choices.

208,64,"Environmental experts are working hard to clean up beaches in Spain. Spain and Portugal are two countries in Europe. Some of their beaches are covered with oil that leaked from a tanker called the
A storm with high winds and waves pounded the tanker in the middle of November. During the storm, the
began to leak. Nearly 2 million gallons of oil leaked into the Atlantic Ocean.
Oil from the tanker formed a huge slick on the ocean. Much of the oil washed up on nearby beaches. It covered at least 150 miles of coastline, killing fish, birds, and other animals. Some experts say cleaning up the oil-soaked beaches could take years.
A few days after the tanker began leaking oil, it broke in half. After the tanker broke apart, its
, or front, remained on the ocean surface for several hours. The ship sank about 150 miles off the coast of Spain.
About 18 million gallons of oil are still inside the ship. The weight of the ocean water pressing on the ship could cause the oil tanks on the ship to explode, spewing oil across the ocean floor. Even if the oil tanks don't explode, they will rust and leak.
""[The ship is] a time bomb at the bottom of the sea,"" said one expert. ""There's nothing that makes us believe it won't finally burst and leak all its oil.""

209,238,"Laura Bush (above) thinks that reading is one of the most important things you can do.
kid reporter Fabien Navidi-Kasmai visited the White House on a special assignment. The 10-year-old found out what it's like to be a member of the press. He interviewed First Lady Laura Bush as part of the National Book Festival in early October.
The National Book Festival, which was held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., celebrates books and reading. Approximately 75,000 people attended the festival this year. Laura Bush told Fabien that she was happy to see such a large turnout at the festival.
Fabien was nervous before the interview, but the first lady quickly put him at ease. They discussed the Harry Potter book series and shared their love of reading.
In fact, the fifth grader learned that Laura Bush especially enjoyed reading Weekly Reader when she was in elementary school. ""Reading is one of the most important things you can do,"" the first lady told Fabien. ""If you love to read, you'll never be lonely-you'll always have a friend.""

210,399,"Students in Colorado are riding a school skateboarding trend.
Skateboard class is rolling into schools! For sixth grader Carlos Cervantes, learning to skateboard takes a lot of work, but its worth it. ""[On] the first day of class, I was scared, but I tried it,"" the 12-year-old told
""After two days of practice, I felt more comfortable.""
Carlos is learning to skateboard in an after-school program at West Middle School in Aurora, Colorado. Skateboards are now finding their way into the regular school day as well. Douglass Elementary in nearby Boulder is the first public school in the country to offer skateboarding in gym class.
Douglasss physical education (PE) teacher Richard Cendali starts his skateboarding class by teaching students how to put on their safety gear and how to fall without getting hurt. Then kids start rolling around the gym. ""Sometimes theyre so excited, they fall. Theyre screaming, Im doing it! Im doing it!"" says Cendali, laughing. ""Its such a thrill to see those kids succeed and see their smiles.""
PE instructors around the country have started teaching classes such as skateboarding, in-line skating, yoga, and even rock climbing. Experts call these sports ""the new PE."" These individual sports are designed to help fight childhood
by getting kids involved in fun physical activities. Obesity is the condition of being dangerously overweight. Another goal of these nontraditional activities is to promote lifelong fitness habits.
Since 1980, the percentage of young people who are overweight has more than tripled. The time students spend in PE class, however, is decreasing. Many schools have dropped gym classes to save money or to provide students with more classroom time. Only 8 percent of elementary schools offer gym class to students every day, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Because students have less PE time, teachers are searching for ways to keep kids moving. ""[Skateboarding] is a great activity that keeps kids engaged in physical movement and gives them new skills and interests,"" says West Middle Schools afterschool program coordinator, Lindsey Johnson.
Some people say skateboarding not only offers health and fitness benefits but also teaches life lessons that could help kids with their schoolwork. Students who are learning to skateboard often spend hours practicing a new trick before they get it right. ""Skateboarding teaches kids to believe that if they stick with something, they will ultimately succeed,"" says education expert Richard Sagor of Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon.
Carloss skateboarding teacher at West Middle School, Eric Klassen, agrees. ""A baby will attempt to walk 600 to 900 times before [he or she] is successful,"" Klassen says. ""We tell students that they shouldnt say I cant do it unless theyve tried 600 to 900 times.""
Klassens students take his advice to heart. ""It took me 600 times to learn one new trick,"" says Martin Carrera, 11.
Over the last decade, team sports have dropped in popularity while individual sports, such as skateboarding, have been on the rise. This trend may affect the kinds of activities PE teachers offer in gym class. Learning individual sports gives all students an opportunity to exercise, whether they make it onto a school team or not.
Imagine that your school offers a skateboarding class. Would such a class have a positive effect on you? Explain.

211,348,"As firefighters battle the flames, how do some fires help Mother Nature?
Whoosh! Within seconds, a spark sets off large flames. The flames of a wildfire tear through a forest, destroying thousands of acres of trees and brush and threatening the homes of people and animals.
From California to Colorado and from Alaska to Arizona, firefighters have been battling thousands of wildfires this year. Wildfire season began in June and will last through November. So far, the flames have destroyed more than 3 million acres in the United Statesan area about the size of New Jersey!
The states in red show where the most wildfires have occurred this year.
Most wildfires are started naturally, either by lightning or from the sun's heat. Others are accidentally started by careless humans who leave campfires burning.
Hot, dry weather has caused most of this season's wildfires to spread. ""This year is unique,"" Rose Davis, an official at the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center, told
. Davis explained that the Northwest is suffering a
. A drought is a long period of dry weather with little rain. In the Southwest, heavy rains in the spring caused a lot of new grass to grow. The new grass burns quickly when it dries out.
Firefighters have been fighting the scorching flames from the ground and the air. Specially trained firefighters called
parachute from planes or helicopters to reach
fires. Because smoke jumpers leap into out-of-the-way areas, they carry enough food and water with them to survive for several days.
Although wildfires can be very dangerous, they are not all bad. In areas where few people live, officials monitor the wildfires. Sometimes, officials allow them to burn because the fires help the environment and keep forests healthy. ""If fires are going to spread to people's homes and property, we have to put them out,"" smoke jumper Lori Messenger told
Wildfires are like nature's housekeeperand forests come back to life after fires. ""Fire is a natural part of our forests,"" says Messenger. ""The fires kill the less healthy, diseased trees. They clean out the brush to make space for animals to graze on the new grass that grows.""
Some plants also need heat from a fire to help them release their seeds, which grow into new plants after a fire. Fire is nature's way of recycling dead plants into the soil. The dead plants help return nutrients to the soil.
Although some animals die, many creatures have ways of protecting themselves. Large animals, such as deer, moose, and buffalo, head to safety. Small animals, such as snakes, toads, and mice, burrow in the ground.
""It's important to realize that fires are an important part of what happens in a forest,"" says Messenger. ""It's a complicated balance, and people who manage the forest have to make good decisions about what fires will be fought and what fires will be left to burn.""
What qualities do you think a person needs to be a smoke jumper?
A fire requires three ingredients to burnheat, fuel, and oxygen. The combination of those three building blocks is referred to as the fire triangle.
is responsible for starting the fire. Heat can come from a lit match or a bolt of lightning, for example.
is anything that will burn. In a wildfire, fuel can be logs, grass, or even paper and trash.
is a gas and must be in the air for a fire to start. Burning fuel reacts with oxygen in the air to release heat, gases, and smoke.

212,193,"Children find open arms in new schools after Hurricane Katrina.
as she watched heavy rains and high winds rip through her hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana. The 9-year-old had been getting ready to start fourth grade. Her brother, Terren, had arranged his school supplies in his backpack to prepare for his first day of second grade. But Hurricane Katrina prevented schools in New Orleans from opening.
When New Orleans flooded, Tenisha and her family headed 350 miles west to Houston, Texas. They spent five days in a Houston hotel until a local family provided them with shelter. Now Tenisha and her brother are getting used to a new school in Houston. ""I've started making new friends already,"" Tenisha told
Tenisha and Terren are not alone. An estimated 372,000 children from Louisiana and Mississippi have found themselves in new schools, since the hurricane caused damage and flooding in those states. Schools from Maine to California have embraced students like Tenisha and Terren with hugs, smiles, and welcome signs.
Schools in Texas expect to enroll as many as 60,000 new kids. Houston schools alone enrolled almost 2,000 students in the few days following the devastating hurricane.
Two schools in Houston that had closed last spring have reopened. The two schools are now devoted entirely to
children. An evacuee is a person forced to move from a place of danger. School principals are also hiring hundreds of new teachersmany are evacuees from Louisiana and Mississippi.
Being the new kid at school is never easy. Experts say that it's even harder for children
because of the hurricane. Displaced people have been forced to flee from their homes.
Students who have left their homes have to
or get used to, new schools, teachers, and friends, say officials. Schools also play an important role in helping kids from the stricken areas cope with the disaster of Katrina.
Tenisha and Terren are adjusting well to their new schoolMacGregor Music and Science Magnet School in Houston. So far, MacGregor has accepted more than 12 displaced students. ""We want each one of the new children to feel this is home for them,"" the school's principal, Patsy Brown, told
Students at MacGregor have welcomed the new faces. ""We want to make our new classmates feel good because we know they've gone through so much,"" fourth grader James McKethen told
James's sister, third grader Tiye McKethen, agrees. ""It's cool to have new friends. And they get to have fun in a new school and stay in a safe place.""
After just two days, Tenisha and Terren were settling in at MacGregor. ""Our new school is great!"" Tenisha told
But the siblings know that life has changed. Despite the warm welcome, Terren misses playing basketball with his friends in New Orleans. Tenisha, too, misses her old teachers. What's next for the family? They will likely settle down in Texas. Tenisha says, ""I want to stay in Houston.""
I live in Desoto, a town outside Dallas, Texas. My school district has taken in roughly 188 students from New Orleans. I must hand it to the kids; they are adapting pretty fast. It is cool because our school is doing everything to make the new students feel at home. We call it ""Southern hospitality.""
I have seen many acts of kindnesswhether it's letting a kid from New Orleans go to the front of the lunch line or giving a new student a personal tour of the school.
I wonder if I could be as strong if my city went through a disaster such as Katrina. What happens to New Orleans from here, we don't know. But what we do know is that we need to appreciate our family and friends. We need to be thankful for the things that we have because we do not know what tomorrow will bring.
Christopher Ray Clark is a sixth grader from the DallasFort Worth area. He and his family have been volunteering to help Katrina evacuees.

213,174,"Leapin' Lizards! It's TV's Favorite Croc Hunter!
Leaping from his rowboat, Australian crocodile hunter Steve Irwin lands on top of a fierce 12-foot-long crocodile. Covered with mud, Irwin wrestles with the reptile and finally ties up its snout and legs. The out-of-breath hunter then stands in front of the croc and declares, ""She's a beauty!""
Irwin is the star of the hit TV show
. In the United States, 60 million viewers see the wildlife show each week. The show is watched by people in 122 countries around the world.
Irwin, age 38, has been interested in animals and the environment since he was a child. He grew up in a wildlife park in Queensland, a state in Australia. For his sixth birthday, Irwin's parents gave him a 12-foot snake called a scrub python. At age 9, Irwin captured his first crocodile. Ten years ago, Irwin took over the park that his parents had started. Five years ago, his show aired on American TV for the first time.
is about more than wrestling crocodiles, snakes, and other wild animals, Irwin says. He explained that the show is also about making people aware of problems facing many animals.
""We don't run around capturing wildlife for the fun of it,"" Irwin said. ""Our love is to educate and share with the world threatened wildlife. We want to bring animals into your house so that we can share and learn about them.""
For example, Irwin was recently on the Australian island of Tasmania. Irwin was working with the World Wildlife Fund to rescue stranded whales. He wants to call attention to whale hunting in the South Pacific Ocean. ""This practice [whaling] has to stop,"" Irwin said.
Not everyone agrees that Irwin's show is good for animals or the environment.
Kent Vliet does not like ""the haphazard way in which [Irwin] handles snakes and gets bitten."" Vliet is a reptile expert who has worked for the National Geographic Society. Vliet fears that viewers might copy the croc hunter's dangerous moves and get hurt.
Instead of wrestling animals, Vliet said, Irwin should talk more about protecting endangered animals and the environment.
For now, the croc hunter said he will keep on wrestling crocs and snakes and bringing people up close with some of Earth's endangered animals. ""I will continue to put my life on the line to save wildlife,"" he said. ""This is my passion, and it won't stop.""

214,89,"Fingerprint technology has a new home  in the cafeteria.
Talk about easy money! Students in Rome, Georgia, can now pay for cafeteria food with a touch of the finger. The Rome City School District has a new, high-tech payment system that reads students fingerprints instead of asking students to punch in codes or swipe their ID cards.
""The finger scan system is faster,"" Rome superintendent Gayland Cooper told
""This is the kind of thing that technology should help us with.""
Before the new system, students often lost their lunch cards or forgot their codes. In addition, the cafeteria lines moved slowly, often cutting into students mealtimes.
The new fingerprint scanner has sped things up. ""Our students have really enjoyed the new system,"" Narkissa Ware, principal of Anna K. Davie Elementary School, told
""When the lines move faster, the students have more time to enjoy their meal.""
Getting a students fingerprints into the new system takes 10 minutes. After that, the student can touch the scanner at the cashier counter. The students picture and account information then appear on the computer screen.
Although fingerprints are an easy way to pay for lunch, some parents arent happy with the new system. Some students dont use the fingerprint scanner because their parents dont like the idea that their childrens fingerprints are being scanned daily.
Cooper says that students still have the option of punching in their codes. He adds, however, that students fingerprint information is secure.

215,108,"Map of Washington, D.C.: The World War II memorial is located between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument.
Francis Campane and his wife took a train trip from Connecticut to Washington, D.C., in the spring. They were headed to the nation's capital to visit the newly opened National World War II Memorial.
is a special monument that honors a person, a group of people, or an event. The World War II memorial opened in April. It was built to honor the 16 million men and women who had served in the armed forces during World War II (1939-1945).
The trip was especially meaningful to Campane, 80, because he is a World War II
. Veterans are people who have served in the armed forces. Campane served in the U.S. Navy during the war. He was stationed aboard a ship called the U.S.S.
""I was amazed at the memorial and the gratitude the American people have shown World War II veterans,"" Campane told
. ""It's great to know our generation will be remembered.""
A plaza, a reflecting pool, fountains, and stone arches are among the memorial's main features. A wall of gold stars at the memorial honors the more than 400,000 Americans killed in the war.

The World War II memorial is one of many places across the country where people will remember the U.S. military on November 11. That is Veterans Day--a holiday set aside to honor our nation's armed forces.

216,692,"Four hundred years after its founding, Jamestown is a historical hot spot.
Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on armor and talk to tour guides. This year, more than 2.4 million people from across the country are expected to attend Jamestown events.
Stepping into Jamestown Settlement museum in Virginia is like stepping into the past. And that's just what thousands of people are planning to do this spring. May marks the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America. Organizers are expecting nearly 90,000 visitors on the weekend of May 11 to 13, when many major events are planned.
Jamestown is a tourist destination for people who want a frontrow seat to American history. ""The whole idea is to give people an idea of Jamestown and the world in 1607,"" historian Tom Davidson told
Davidson helped put together exhibits at the Jamestown museum for the anniversary.
Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on English armor and watch experts demonstrate how to fire muskets. Tourists can also go aboard and explore
or models, of the three ships that brought the first settlers to present-day Virginia.
The story of Jamestown began on May 14, 1607, when about 100 English men and boys arrived in present-day Virginia. They came seeking gold and other treasures. The settlers, called
built a fort on the bank of a river and named their colony Jamestown, after King James I of England.
or businesspeople, of the Virginia Company to make money in North America. But the settlers faced many problems, including disease, starvation, and conflict with the area's Powhatan people (see ""
At first, settlers stayed close together for protection. ""There were hundreds of people living inside a wooden-walled fort,"" explains Davidson. Living in the fort helped the settlers defend themselves from attack, but it also made hunting for food or growing crops difficult.
Captain John Smith was one of Jamestown's original leaders. He took command of the colony in 1608. When the colony was in danger of running out of food, Smith gave an order: ""He who does not work, will not eat.""
spent five months crossing the Atlantic. The original Godspeed carried 39 passengers from England to Virginia, making two stops along the way. The new Godspeed traveled from Maine to Virginia, stopping along the way to let visitors see the ship.
By 1613, Jamestown had expanded into a successful colony. At about that time, the settlers began to grow tobacco. Tobacco was a
meaning that it could be sold in large amounts to England. In the following years, the settlers pushed the Powhatan off the land and built tobacco
or large farms. Later, the Jamestown colonists bought slaves from Africa to work on the plantations.
Over time, Jamestown grew to become the colony of Virginia. Virginia was one of the 13 colonies that joined in 1776 to rebel against England, starting the American Revolution (17751783).
Much is known about Jamestown, yet more details are being discovered. For more than a hundred years, experts thought the site of the original settlement had been destroyed by the James River. In 1994, archaeologists, or scientists who study the remains left behind by past cultures, discovered what may be Jamestown's original location.
""Visitors can see things being excavated that haven't seen the light of day in 400 years,"" Jamestown spokesperson Mike Litterst told
Scientists are currently looking for the foundation of the first church that the Jamestown settlers built. If found, it will be the oldest English church ever discovered in the United States.
The skeletons of two settlers have already been uncovered at the site. They are on display beneath a glass case, exactly as they were found. Historians believe that one of the skeletons is that of Captain Bartholomew Gosnoll, a member of Jamestown's original ruling council. Gosnoll and Jamestown Settlement will have a lot of visitors in the coming weeks for the 400th anniversary. ""It's the biggest event we've had since 1957, when the [Jamestown] museum first opened,"" says Litterst.
When the English colonists first settled in what is now Virginia, a powerful Native American group had lived on the land for hundreds of years. ""There were about 20,000 Powhatan people there when the English arrived in Jamestown,"" Virginia Indian culture expert Karenne Wood told
She hopes that the 400th anniversary of Jamestown will help shed light on the Powhatan's story.
When Jamestown began, the English and the Powhatan tried to trade with each other peacefully, but soon fighting broke out over land and resources. Beginning in 1614, the fighting stopped for eight years when Pocahontas, a daughter of the Powhatan chief, married Englishman John Rolfe. However, the fighting quickly resumed as Jamestown expanded.
Over time, the Powhatan people lost their land to the English settlers. However, Virginia is home to many Native American descendants today. ""We have changed a lot,"" says Wood, ""but we are still here.""
Organizers at Jamestown are not calling the 400th anniversary a celebration. Why might that be?

217,747,"Students are spending more time studying at home, but is that a good thing?
Homework is on the rise! Nine- to 12-year-olds are spending 20 percent more time studying at home than they spent in 1997, according to a recent study from the University of Maryland. ""Kids spend an average of 50 minutes to 75 minutes studying every day,"" says the studys author, Sandra L. Hofferth.
But is taking schoolwork home a good thing? Two recent books have education experts asking, is homework helpful?
writers Nancy Kalish and Sara Bennett write that homework keeps kids from participating in school sports and other after-school programs. ""Its the youngest kids who seem to be getting the most homework,"" Bennett told
""and theyre the least ready to do it.""
that ""no scientific studies have shown that kids
from homework in any way before high school."" (
means ""to receive help."") Kohn thinks that too much homework can take the fun out of learning.
Many education officials say homework is good for learning. ""Its important [for kids] to get used to doing homework,"" Harris Cooper of Duke University told
Cooper is one of the countrys leading researchers on homework. He says practicing homework now will help kids in high school. Cooper suggests that students should expect to do 40 minutes of homework each day.
Many teachers see the value of homework as well. ""I think homework is helpful to most kids. It gives them more responsibility,"" fourth-grade teacher Pepper Schrock of Orlando, Florida, told
""I try to give meaningful projects as homework.""

Stonehenge is a mysterious monument that consists of a circle of stones. It was built about 4,600 years ago in southwestern England. Researchers recently unearthed an ancient village near Stonehenge. The village may have been home to the builders of the stone circle.
discovered the remains of close to 25 small houses about 2 miles from Stonehenge. (Archaeologists study the materials left by prehistoric peoples and their cultures.) The researchers say the village, known as Durrington Walls, was built at about the same time as Stonehenge. They
or guess, that Stonehenge was a memorial site or cemetery for the villagers. The village includes a wooden version of the stone monument.
""Clearly, this is a place that was of enormous importance,"" says British researcher Julian Thomas, who helped discover the village. He noted that both Stonehenge and Durrington Walls have avenues connecting them to the nearby Avon River. Villagers may have frequently traveled between the two sites.
Eight of the wooden houses have been
or dug up. The structures are about 14 feet long. There was evidence of bed frames along the walls and a dresser or storage unit on the wall opposite the door.
Two of the houses found by Thomas were separate from the others. They may have been the homes of community leaders. Stone tools, animal bones, arrowheads, and other
(humanmade objects) were also uncovered in the village.

220,34,"Five California condors died last summer in Arizona's arid backcountry.
A condor's wingspan is 9.5 feet across. That's about as wide as two kids lying down head to toe.
Wildlife experts say the condors did not die from the heat. Instead, the experts believe the huge birds died from lead poisoning. They say the condors had swallowed lead shotgun pellets.
, which means they eat the remains of dead animals. The condors probably ate the remains of an animal that had been shot by a hunter. As they ate the dead animal's flesh, the birds ate the deadly pellets.
If swallowed, lead can make an animal sick or cause death. Lead stops the body from making red blood cells. It can also damage an animal's organs, including the brain and liver.
The five poisoned birds were among 35 condors that have been released in Arizona since 1996. The release program has cost millions of dollars.
After the dead condors were found, wildlife experts recaptured and tested the 16 birds left in the Arizona group. All the birds were healthy and were soon released.
Members of the Peregrine Fund have been releasing and watching the condors set free in Arizona. Jeff Cilek, of the Peregrine Fund, told
that saving California condors is important. ""Condors are good for the environment. They [eat] dead animals,"" Cilek said.
California condors are among the world's largest birds. A hundred years ago, the birds were found in many parts of the United States. Today, the condor is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's list of endangered species. That means the number of California condors is so low they all could disappear someday.
Why are scavengers an important part of the food chain?
Peregrine Fund officials say there are 150 California condors left on Earth. Forty-eight of those birds are living in the wild; the rest are in zoos.
Although the loss of five birds is a ""serious setback,"" Cilek said his group is looking to the future. Peregrine Fund officials recently announced plans to release 12 more California condors in Arizona this winter.

221,353,"Say Ahh! A New Vaccine Fights Cavities
If you have had a cavity, you have probably felt the bite of a dentist's whirling drill as it cuts into your tooth. Soon, however, the dentist may no longer need a drill.
Tooth decay is a disease. So dentists at Harvard University decided to fight the disease that causes cavities. ""We decided to try to beat the disease, rather than just drill and fill [cavities],"" said dentist Daniel Smith.
, or a medicine, that could prevent cavities. The vaccine attacks the
, or germs, that live on teeth. The germs make an acid that causes cavities.
The vaccine is a new way to prevent tooth decay. Brushing after meals and cutting back on sweets are two other weapons used to fight cavities.
, a chemical that strengthens teeth, also fights cavities. Fluoride is added to water and toothpaste. But many countries can't afford to put fluoride in water, and fluoride doesn't kill cavity-causing bacteria.
""[Tooth decay] is an epidemic worldwide,"" Smith said. ""Even if you have fluoride, you still have the bug [that causes tooth decay].""
So far, the scientists have tested the vaccine on rats. The rats that took the vaccine didn't get many cavities.
Now the scientists want people to try the vaccine. If it works, dentists may have a lot less drilling to do--other than drilling it into people's heads to remember to take the vaccine!

222,133,"Now that you have an escape plan, get your family together to practice it. Join families across the U.S. and Canada in practicing ""The Great Escape"" on October 11, 2000, at 7:00 p.m. You'll be part of the world's largest fire drill! Better yet, you and your family will know exactly what to do if there is ever a fire in your home.
Test your doors and windows. They must all open easily so that you can get out easily.
Are there any boxes, toys, or pieces of furniture blocking your escape path? Move them out of the way!
Make sure all smoke alarms are working by pushing the test buttons.
: Newer smoke alarms have a universal signal repetition pattern of three beeps, followed by a one and a half second pause.
Start your home fire escape drill by assigning one member of the family to push the test button on your smoke alarm. When you hear the alarm, spring into action!
Feel around the door frame and the space between the door and frame with the back of your hand. Is it warm? For the first run through of your drill, pretend that it's not warm. That means you can exit the room safely because the fire is not nearby.
For the second drill, pretend that the door does feel warm. What's your plan now?
At the end of each drill, meet outside at your family meeting area. Practice your home fire escape plan at least twice a year with every member of your household.
Many communities have 911 emergency telephone service. Other communities have a different number for help in an emergency. What is the emergency telephone number where you live?
""Change the batteries in your smoke alarm once a year. Get into the habit of changing smoke alarm batteries on the same day each year, such as a special holiday, birthday, or when you change your clocks in the fall.""

223,258,"The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle's grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles.
The disease attacks an infected bird's brain and spinal cord.
At first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird.
In recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year.
Although the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased.
By the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild.
Wildlife experts are especially concerned because they don't know much about the disease, including what causes it. ""We have some ideas, but we don't have any answers,"" John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said.
Experts also don't know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. ""This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn't noticed,"" Fischer said.
While wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Scientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America's bird--the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn't true in 1782.
Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol.
""I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country"", Franklin wrote. ""He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird"".

224,481,"Archaeologists in northwestern England are thrilled about a rare find. The scientists recently unearthed a burial site of six Viking men and women. They discovered swords, spears, jewelry, and other artifacts.
This copper brooch belonged to one of the Vikings.
, or dug up, after a metal detector user discovered two copper brooches in the ground. The worker informed archaeologists, who believe the site dates back to the 10th century. It is one of only a few Viking cemeteries found in England.
The Vikings were pirates and warriors, known for their sea faring voyages. From the late 700s to 1100, the Vikings lived in Scandinavia. That region of Europe includes the present-day countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
Viking sailors spread fear throughout Europe. They raided and conquered coastal villages in Europe and along the Mediterranean coast. During their raids, Vikings captured slaves. They also
, or stole, treasures, such as silver and gold.
For their voyages, Viking sailors crafted swift, narrow
that could navigate the stormiest seas. The Vikings were the master shipbuilders of their time. Vikings also worked as farmers and craftspeople. Others hunted and fished.
The Vikings' claim to fame may have been their fearsome raids, but they were explorers and traders too. They were among the earliest explorers to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to North America.
The Vikings traveled to other parts of Europe, the Mediterranean, Greenland, and North America.
One of the most famous Vikings was explorer Leif Eriksson. He reached North America almost 500 years before Columbus arrived in 1492.
Longships varied in size, but many were between 60 feet and 90 feet in length.
A larger ship could carry about 50 raiders at a time.
Strong winds allowed a longship, which had one large sail, to reach speeds of up to 17 miles an hour.
Vikings used multiple oars to row the ship when there was no wind.
The front end of a longship curved upward and was adorned with a wood carving of a snake's or a dragon's head.
Over time, the Viking raiders lost their power as people learned to defend against their attacks. Today, the remains of Viking villages can be found throughout Europe and North America.
Archaeologists plan to study the burial ground in England to learn more about the life of the Vikings. Based on the objects found, they believe the site was once a Viking settlement.

225,280,"The grizzly and cubs may soon be taken off the endangered species list in the Northwest.
Grizzly bears are considered one of the great symbols of the American wilderness. When explorers Lewis and Clark traveled west in the early 1800s, they found a healthy grizzly-bear population.
At the time, about 50,000 grizzly bears roamed the West. But as pioneers moved westward, the number of grizzly bears began to shrink. Illegal hunting, trapping, and habitat loss were to blame for the bears' disappearance. A
is the place in nature where an animal makes its home.
Today, there are only 800 to 1,000 grizzlies remaining in the lower 48 states, but there is hope for these creatures. About 550 of the grizzlies live in the Yellowstone National Park area in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. That is almost double the number that lived there in the 1980s.
Thanks to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the grizzly is making a comeback. Congress passed the act to protect animals that were in danger of becoming extinct.
Wildlife officials hope to remove grizzly bears in the Yellowstone National Park area from the endangered species list within the next year. Steven Williams, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told USA Today that the change is ""a tribute to the American people's commitment to wildlife [protection].""
Why is it important to protect endangered animals?
Scientists have worked to help bring grizzlies back from the brink of extinction. They set the animals free in their original habitats. They also plan to limit the number of roads in areas where grizzlies live. That action will give grizzlies more room to roam-and will help make life more bearable for them!

226,281,"An American classic turns 50 this year--the Wiffle ball! In air, the round, hollow ball dips and curves, making it hard to hit.
The Wiffle ball's design, which has not changed since 1953, includes eight holes on one side. The idea was the brainchild of a Connecticut man who watched his 12-year-old son and a friend struggle to throw curve balls to each other.
""He decided he wanted to make a ball that would make it easier for us to pitch,"" the creator's son told
Early versions of the Wiffle ball included square holes and diamond-shaped holes. Neither of them worked.
That's how the Wiffle ball was born. Several years later, the plastic bat joined the ball.

227,158,"Giant pandas get a new home at the National Zoos Asia Trail.
These lucky animals are getting some extra room to stretch out! Giant pandas at the National Zoo, in Washington, D.C., have a bigger home. The zoo opened its Asia Trail in October.
The zoos three pandas may be the stars of the show, but they arent alone. Six other threatened or endangered Asian species have new
or homes, on the trail. The animals with new homes are red pandas, fishing cats, sloth bears, Asian small-clawed otters, clouded leopards, and Japanese giant salamanders.
The $53 million makeover doubles the space for those animals. ""This is a giant leap forward for the National Zoo,"" says its director, John Berry.
The Asia Trail is part of a 10-year project to improve the zoo. Before the exhibit was
or updated, the animals lived in cramped quarters. Covering nearly 6 acres, the new area gives animals more room to roam and play.
""Visitors are treated to up-close views,"" says Susan Ades, head of the zoos exhibit design. ""You can see, hear, touch, and even smell the zoos science.""
The pandas are among the zoos most popular attractions. They draw huge crowds, which are expected to reach a record 3 million people this year. The pandas new habitat includes waterfalls and shallow pools, along with more rocks and leafy trees to climb. Fog machines even help model the pandas wet natural environment in China.
Along with the giant pandas, here are a few animals that capture visitors attention on the Asia Trail.
are the smallest of the worlds 13 otter species. They live in family groups of about 12 creatures.
are noisy, busy creatures. They grunt and snort as they pull fruit from trees and dig for termites.

228,23,"Did you know that the average child will spend more time in front of the television than at school this year? That's according to the TV-Turnoff Network.
Beginning April 21, millions of children and their families across the country will trade some TV time for other activities. They will zap off their television sets for an entire week.
April 21 through 27 is the ninth annual TV-Turnoff Week. ""The idea of the week is to encourage people to take a break from TV,"" said Frank Vespe of the TV-Turnoff Network. ""One of the things we learn is that TV is taking away from other things that we might do for fun.""
The goal of the week, according to its organizers, is to help kids discover other activities they enjoy. Then kids may make lasting changes in their lives.
Health experts warn that too much television can have negative effects on kids. Children who spend too much time watching television often get too little exercise. They also don't perform as well in school as do children who watch less TV.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
1. This is the ninth year of TV-Turnoff Week.
2. Many kids like to watch TV.
3. TV-Turnoff Week lets kids discover other activities they enjoy.
So think about what you might do if you zapped off your television set for an entire week. Would you read a book? Head outside to ride your bike? Play a board game with your mom or dad?

229,467,"How will a growing U.S. population affect the countrys future?
The United States is about to reach a huge milestone. The population will hit 300 million sometime in late October, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The estimate is based on a running total of births, deaths, and the number of people moving in and out of the country.
""[The 300 million mark] is like a birthday. Its a number that gives us an opportunity to see where weve been and think about where we want to go,"" scientist Howard Hogan of the U.S. Census Bureau told
Its been almost 40 years since the U.S. population hit the 200 million mark. The country has added about 2.8 million people each year. On average, a baby is born every eight seconds in the United States.

Hispanic Heritage Month is September 15 to October 15.
Hispanic Americans are the fastest-growing minority group in the United States. Nearly 43 million Hispanic Americans live in the country, reports the U.S. Census Bureau. They are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries.
To honor Hispanic traditions and history, Americans celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. It began on September 15. That date marks the anniversary of independence for Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.
During Hispanic Heritage Month, many Americans will take part in festivals and parades. Students across the country will also spend the month learning how people of Hispanic heritage have added to our countrys history.
WR News / U.S. Census Bureau, July 2005

is a person who comes from one country to live in a new country. Many immigrants come to the United States in search of freedom or a better life for themselves and their families.
Illegal immigrants have been a topic of debates throughout the country this past year. Congress is currently working on changing immigration laws to tighten the countrys borders. The laws may also give many illegal immigrants a chance to become citizens. A
is a person who is a member of a country.
With the 300 million milestone getting closer, more people are discussing the issue of illegal immigration, along with other aspects of the countrys future. For some, the population growth means more power.
Others argue that a bigger population means more traffic jams, fewer jobs, and a strain on natural resources. For example, more people could lead to
Deforestation occurs when farmers and loggers cut down trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads.
""Population growth and change brings opportunities and challenges,"" says Hogan. ""At the Census Bureau, we provide information. ... Thats when weve done our job.""

230,548,"Brazil protects part of the Amazon rain forest.
Jaguars and anteaters in northern South America can rest easy. A section of the Amazon rain forest as big as Illinois was recently placed under government protection. The land in Brazil links to protected areas in other South American countries, including Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana.
In total, these protected forests cover nearly 58,000 square miles. The land also contains more than 25 percent of the world's
A tropical rain forest is a dense forest in a warm region that gets at least 100 inches of rainfall a year.
Environmentalists from the group Conservation International say this area of the northern Amazon has more
than all tropical forests on the planet. Biodiversity is the variety of plants and animals in an environment. The Amazon is home to more
or types, of plants and animals than any other place in the world.
Since 1970, more than 232,000 square miles of the Amazon rain forest have been destroyed. That is nearly the size of Texas! The destruction has endangered many animal species. Experts predict that the continued
or clearing of trees, at this rate would endanger the entire region by 2050.
Officials were especially concerned about preserving the forests. Part of the area is believed to contain more than half of all bird, animal, and plant species found in the Amazon. Many endangered animals, including the giant Amazon otter, make their homes there. Under the government's plan, those parts of the Amazon will be off-limits to the public.
""If any tropical rain forest on Earth remains intact a century from now, it will be this portion of [the northern Amazon],"" says Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International.
The Amazon rain forest is the world's largest tropical rain forest. It covers about 2 million square milesroughly two-thirds the size of the United States. The map shows the location of the Amazon rain forest and its newly protected areas.

The small, bear-like animal likes to dine mainly on bamboo but also munches on fruits, acorns, and insects. Red pandas are excellent climbers and spend most of their time in trees. They are mainly found in Nepal and southern China. Habitat loss and illegal hunting have endangered red pandas in the wild.

232,676,"Hours before giant waves pounded coastlines in South Asia, many animals started behaving strangely. In Sri Lanka, elephants trumpeted frantically and fled to higher ground. Bats and flamingos deserted low-lying areas. Many other animals escaped unharmed.
Wildlife experts are amazed that many animals survived the tsunami. The series of huge waves killed thousands of people in South Asia and East Africa about two months ago. Experts say animals might have sensed the approaching waves and moved to higher ground.
""I think animals can sense disaster. They know when things are happening in nature,"" said an official at the national wildlife department in Sri Lanka.
Elephants' sharp senses may have warned them about the tsunami.
Other stories of odd animal behavior before the tsunami have also surfaced. Giant waves flooded low-lying parts of Yala National Park in Sri Lanka, uprooting trees and killing hundreds of people. Wildlife officials reported, however, that few animals died. The park is home to hundreds of animals, including elephants, monkeys, leopards, tigers, deer, and water buffalo.
In Thailand, elephants carrying tourists from Japan bolted for the hills, and other elephants broke free of their chains. In one fishing village, nearly 1,000 locals escaped safely after birds squawked madly.
Although some animals in South Asia successfully fled to higher ground before the tsunami, other animals were not as lucky. Many dogs and other pets lost their owners in the tsunami and are homeless, sick, and without food or water. Cows, goats, and other farm animals are also roaming aimlessly. Many of those animals are drinking polluted water. Rescue groups have been sending animal food and
to the area. Veterinarians are doctors who care for animals.
Why might animals have known trouble was on the way? Forget special powers. Instead, experts say that animals have better senses of hearing, smell, and sight than humans do. Those sharp senses help warn animals when natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes, are about to happen.
""It doesn't surprise me that animals had an early warning of the tsunami,"" animal expert Michael Dee of the Los Angeles Zoo told
. ""The senses of certain species are far stronger than what any human has."" Dee points out that dogs, for example, have a stronger sense of smell than humans and that cats can see better in the dark than people.
Scientists say that animals might have felt the vibrations from the earthquake that set off the tsunami. In addition, many animals, including elephants, pigeons, and dogs, can also pick up
. That is a sound that is too low in pitch for humans to hear.
""Elephants can hear or feel other elephants grumble up to 2 miles away, so they probably felt the earthquake,"" said Dee. ""Their first
would be to move away from the direction of the sound."" An instinct is a natural, untaught behavior or reaction.
Before the tsunami struck, animals may have started to flee because they saw other creatures running. ""Animals take their cues from other animals,"" said Dee.
How animals sense danger has fascinated people for centuries. Most scientists are quick to point out, however, that nothing has ever been proven.
Will animal instincts be used to create a warning system about natural disasters anytime soon? ""I wouldn't count on [it],"" said Dee.
In the meantime, animals are helping out in other ways. For example, elephants are assisting in the cleanup of areas hit by the tsunami.
Scientists say that elephants can pick up vibrations from earthquakes through their broad feet.
Elephants' toenails are in the skin and not attached to the toes.
Elephants' soles have sensitive foot pads that detect vibrations, such as those from an earthquake. That signals elephants to move to more stable ground.
In what other ways might animals' sharp senses be helpful?

233,358,"A young mountain climber sets his sights on the world's tallest mountains.
Jordan Romero celebrated his 10th birthday in a way he'll never forget. Last summer, the fifth grader from Big Bear Lake, California, became the youngest person to climb Kilimanjaro in Africa. ""I knew I could make it to the top,"" Jordan told
Kilimanjaro is one of the Seven Summits. The
are the highest mountains on each of the seven continents. With one down and the rest to go, Jordan plans to hike to all the summits in the next few years.

234,694,"Should handheld video games be banned from recess?
Many kids think playing handheld video games is a great way to spend their break time at school, but not all parents and school officials agree. Florence Rideout Elementary School in Wilton, New Hampshire, recently banned handheld electronic games, such as the PlayStation Portable and the Nintendo Dual Screen, at recess. Other schools across the country have taken the same action. Should portable video games be allowed on the playground?
Some school officials and parents argue that portable video games defeat the purpose of recessexercise. Lisa Lewis, a parent at Florence Rideout, told the school board that students should be encouraged to ""go out and play"" and not huddle around an electronic game.
In addition, portable video-game systems can stir up trouble. When students bring their gaming gear to school, fights sometimes start or the device gets stolen. Educators hope that keeping video games at home will help keep the peace at school. School officials at Florence Rideout added the video game ban to school rules to satisfy some parents' concerns.
Don't toss out video games from recess, say others. A recent report from the NPD Group shows that video games are becoming more
or established, in kids' daily lives. NPD reports that 41 percent of students between the ages of 4 and 14 own portable video game systems. ""Today's kids are digital [citizens] whose activities are different [from those of] previous generations,"" says Anita Frazier of NPD.
Some people argue that electronic devices are a part of modern life, the same way jacks and marbles once were. Would schools ban those games just because they don't require exercise, they ask?
Video games are part of everyday life.

237,559,"I [want] to bring common sense and fairness to the tax code
Governor Bush says that roughly one-quarter of the government budget
(extra money), which comes from taxes, should be returned to the people. He says his plan would promote economic growth and help people lead better lives by cutting high tax rates. The plan would lower the tax rate for married couples and families with children. He says the 6 million poorest families would pay no taxes.
I am calling for the right kind of tax relief--tax cuts that [will] help those who need them the most
Vice President Gore wants to lower taxes, but not by the amount Bush wants to. He says some of the surplus money is needed to support Social Security, a program that helps older people.

238,550,"A filmmaker finds out that elephant families can be comfortable with visitors.
""I started thinking of them as a family almost immediately,"" filmmaker Martyn Colbeck told
He was talking about wild elephants, not his next-door neighbors. For more than 15 years, Colbeck has filmed a family of African elephants in Amboseli National Reserve in eastern Africa.
airs April 1 on the PBS television show
The new film comes after recent studies found that elephants can recognize their reflection in a mirror. That is something only humans, chimpanzees, and dolphins were thought to be able to do. ""These animals are smart,"" Colbeck says. His documentary shows just how intelligent African elephantsthe world's largest land animalsare.
Colbeck's film follows an elephant family led by a 62-year-old female elephant named Echo. In the wild, African elephants live in herds. They roam long distances to find food. The oldest female elephant, called the
leads the herd. Adult male elephants live separately from the females and the young calves.
Echo guides her family to fresh water and food while staying alert for danger. The young elephants are the most
or at risk of being harmed. Colbeck witnessed that danger when he saw another elephant family attempt to kidnap Echo's calf Ebony. Echo gathered the other adult female elephants in her family to come to the rescue. ""Together they plowed into the kidnappers to recover Ebony,"" Colbeck explained. ""It showed forethought and teamwork.""
During his years of filmmaking, Colbeck observed other signs of elephant intelligence. Elephants communicate with each other through low rumbling sounds that people often cannot hear. Family members also make distinct sounds that other members can recognize.
or customs. After an elephant dies, the other family members cover the body with sticks and leaves and linger near the site for days. The animals often return to the site years later.
Amboseli National Reserve covers about 150 square miles in southern Kenya, near the Tanzania border. The Kenyan government protects the nature reserve's elephants from
or illegal hunting. Elephants have been hunted throughout history for the ivory in their tusks. Humans have used ivory to make jewelry and other objects. Today, elephants are an endangered species.
Since strict anti-poaching laws were put into effect in 1968, the number of elephants in Amboseli has risen from 500 to more than 1,200. When Colbeck began filming Echo's family in 1990, the family had only 14 members. Today it has 30 members.
Although the elephants still face some danger from the local Masai tribespeople, the creatures have become remarkably comfortable around human visitors. That makes Amboseli an ideal place for scientists to study elephant behavior.
""The elephants are totally relaxed about having vehicles in amongst the herd,"" says Colbeck. ""Nevertheless, it is still very important to respect the animals and not disturb them.  That respect develops into a trust, and in that way we have been able to document some extraordinary moments in their lives."" That trust has not only allowed Colbeck to film Echo's family, but it has also made him feel like one of the family.
The elephant families in Amboseli National Reserve are organized alphabetically. Echo's family is the ""E"" family, so every member of the family is given a name starting with
Here's how Echo fits in with some of her relatives.
(age 62): Echo is one of the oldest elephants in Amboseli. She is the leader of her family. You can tell that she is old by the length of her tusks. They are almost touching! Wild African elephants live an average of 60 years.
(died at age 34): She was Echo's eldest daughter. Erin died from a spear injury after she wandered too close to a watering hole protected by the local Masai people.
(age 22): As a young calf, Eliot would to run up and rest her head on researchers' vehicles. Now that she has grown up, Eliot keeps her distance from people.
(age 17): When he was born, Ely couldn't walk. The family waited to move until he stood on his own. Now he lives alone. He left the herd at age 12.
(age 25): Edwina is Echo's first known grandchild.
(age 22): Eleanor helped care for Email after Erin died.
(age 6): Email's mother, Erin, died when he was 2. Now the rest of the family takes care of him.
(age 12): Europa is Echo's first known great-grandchild.
(age 8): Elaine is Echo's second great-granddaughter.
(age 8): Elmo is Echo's only surviving great-grandson.

241,414,"The waters in the San Francisco Bay, off the California coast, are cold, choppy, and infested with sharks. But that didnt stop 9-year-old Johnny Wilson from braving the waves. The fourth grader swam the 1.4 miles between Alcatraz Island and San Francisco in just less than two hours. He swam to raise money for Hurricane Katrina victims.
Although Johnny trained for three months, the water was colder and wavier than he had expected. Johnny made it to the shore by telling himself, ""Im almost there. Im almost there.""
His classmates were waiting on shore, cheering ""Go, Johnny! Go, Johnny!"" When he came out of the chilly water, his father hugged him and said, ""Can you believe it? You did it!""
Johnny successfully made the trek that Alcatraz prisoners had dared to cross years ago. Alcatraz Island housed a prison from 1934 to 1963. In 1962, three prisoners escaped by swimming across the bay. They were never heard from again, so it remains a mystery whether they made it through the frigid waters to land.
Johnny didnt only raise more than $30,000 for his swim. He also reportedly became the youngest person to swim the distance from Alcatraz to San Francisco.

242,795,"Experts scramble to keep this world-famous city from sinking.
Venice attracts millions of tourists each year for its beautiful art and architecture. People weave their way through the city on boats because there are no streets. A maze of long
or waterways, takes the place of roads. In fact, there are no cars or trucks in Venice.
Venice is located in northern Italy on the Adriatic Sea. The city was built on a series of small islands in a
or an area of shallow water. During some high tides, water floods the city. For hundreds of years, people have tried to keep water out of the city to save it from sinking. Now a group of scientists has introduced a bold plan to keep the city afloat. And it means adding more water!
Venice is sinking at a rate of 1.57 inches per year, according to scientists. The Italian government has proposed the building of floodgates to control the flow of the sea.
Scientists hope to turn the tide in favor of Venice. They want to pump huge amounts of water into the ground through sturdy pipes. Scientists expect the water will expand the sand underneath and prop up the city. They hope to test the project on a small area over the next few months.
In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads.
Scientists behind the plan say that the pipes will work along with the floodgates to help save the city. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnt carried out in a careful way.
Everyone, however, agrees that saving the sinking city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose tremendous part of [history],"" Melissa Conn of Save Venice, an organization dedicated to helping preserve the city, told reporters.
Venice in Italian means ""city of canals.""
About 1.6 million people live in Venice.
The most famous building in Venice is the Basilica of St. Mark, a church dedicated to the patron saint of the city.

243,15,"Car tires have been rolling through the news. The news is that experts believe Firestone tires have a
, or problem, that is causing the tires to burst. Bursting tires may have caused many car accidents.
As a result of the possible defect, 6.5 million Firestone tires are being taken off cars and thrown away. But what happens to old tires?
Each year, Americans throw away 276 million tires. About 70 percent of those tires are
, or made into other things. Many of those tires are shredded and pressed together to make surfaces for playgrounds. Kids could be playing on surfaces made from tires that your family threw away.
Even though most tires are recycled, many are piled up in huge mounds because the tires can't be recycled fast enough. Some experts say between 2 billion and 3 billion tires in the United States are waiting to be recycled.

244,156,"talks to actor Elijah Wood about playing a penguin.
Penguins are back on the big screen! The new movie
hits theaters on November 17. Elijah Wood stars in the animated movie as a tap-dancing penguin. Wood began his acting career when he was 9. He is known for his role as Frodo in the
caught up with Wood to find out what its like to become a cartoon penguin.
Did you think your first animated movie role would be as a penguin?
[laughs] No, definitely not. Getting to meet and work with George Miller, who directed
was pretty amazing. Im a big fan of his films.
So your character, Mumble, is a penguin that can dance but cant sing?
It was an idea developed by George. Apparently, emperor penguins can recognize each other in a group based on their songs. Mumble is born without the ability to sing. In its place, he has an odd ability to dance.
Ultimately, at the end of the film, the larger penguin community is taught a lesson that having a difference is all right. Everybody feels as though they have to change to fit in sometimes. In school, theres a feeling [that] you have to conform. Its actually our differences that should make us strong.
What do you think of the finished

245,151,"or the NBA playoffs? The TV-Turnoff Network wants you to do just thatand imagine what you can do instead of watching TV.
As a result, the theme of TV-Turnoff Week is ""Imagine."" The celebration takes place from April 24 to April 30. During the weeklong event, TV-Turnoff officials hope to raise awareness about the harmful effects of too much television.
Each American watches, on average, more than four hours of television per day, according to RealVision and the TV-Turnoff Network. In fact, kids spend more time in front of the television (1,023 hours per year) than in school (900 hours per year)!
Experts say that too much time in front of the TV can have a negative effect on children. Kids dont do as well in school and dont get enough exercise to stay in shape.
Robert Kesten, executive director of the TV-Turnoff Network, hopes that kids will turn off the television and get involved with other interests. ""Turning off the television allows children to see the real world,"" Kesten told
""We think kids will be surprised with the new discoveries they will make if they choose to shut off the TV for a week.""

If you have access to a computer, you can log on to the Internet to find information and go to places without ever leaving home.
The Net also has some sites that aren't so nice. Many stories in the news lately have been about kids who have gotten into trouble because they weren't careful about using the Net.
The number of kids who use the Net has exploded in the past few years. According to studies by eMarketer, an Internet company that studies who uses the Net, the number of U.S. kids between ages 5 and 13 going online at home will grow from 11 million in 1999 to 22 million in 2003.
Not all kids are surfing the Internet safely. Many kids are giving out information that they shouldn't reveal on the Net, such as their real last names, addresses, and phone numbers. Some kids have online conversations with people who mean them harm or could get them into trouble.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), you can have fun on the Net without putting yourself at risk if you stick to the following rules. The FBI says:
meet someone or have him or her visit you without your parents' permission.

247,663,"Why do some books make people angry?
How would you feel if your favorite book was yanked from library shelves? Beginning September 23, the American Library Association (ALA) observes Banned Books Week. When a book is banned, it is removed from a library or a school. Many people say that banning books goes against the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech. People who challenge books often claim that they want to protect others from dangerous ideas. Weve piled up some well-known titles that have been challenged.
Should some books be banned? Why or why not? Write your opinion in a paragraph. Then hold a class debate for or against book banning.

248,19,"The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States. It has nine justices. They are appointed for life by the president and approved by the Senate.
The Supreme Court rules whether federal, state, and local governments are following the written laws of the U.S. Constitution.
The Supreme Court hears only certain cases. Once the Court rules on a case, the decision is final. All other courts in the United States must follow the Supreme Court's decision in similar cases. This helps make sure that all Americans receive equal justice.

249,651,"Fall is here, and lots of boys and girls are hitting the football field. Playing football can be lots of fun, but it can also be dangerous. Kids need to play safely to make sure they have fun and do not get hurt.
Most kids who play football get minor bruises and scrapes. Some injure their knees and even break bones. Others get head concussions. But a 10-year-old girl died on September 2. Doctors said a football injury probably caused the fatality.
Taylor Davison, who lived in Illinois, liked to play football. She was the only girl who played in a football league of 400 players.
Taylor played full-contact football. During a practice in August, she complained of a headache and fell down. Three days later, she died. Doctors said she died as a result of a severe blow to the head, possibly caused by a tackle.
Doctors do not know how many child athletes are injured on the playing field each year. ""There is a serious lack of data about what types of injuries are occurring, said Dr. Reginald Washington, a doctor of sports medicine.
Although not enough is known about sports-related injuries among children, Washington and other doctors say kids and coaches can follow certain safety tips. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh give this advice:
Coaches should receive first-aid training. They should also be trained to recognize whether a child athlete has a severe head injury.
Leagues should have rules that require kids to take time off from playing after they have suffered an injury-especially a head injury.
To make sure they are safe, kids should always wear the proper safety equipment when playing any sport.

250,339,"Some experts question rewarding reading with pizza.
Everyone loves pizza, but should it be used as a reward for reading?
Should kids be reading for pizza? A nationwide reading program is drawing criticism for putting pizza front and center. Since 1985, the restaurant chain Pizza Hut has been running the Book It program, which rewards students for reading with personal pan pizzas. Now some people are taking a slice at Book It. They say the program promotes poor eating habits and gives Pizza Hut free advertising in public schools.
""It's clear that Pizza Hut's Book It has no place in public schools. ... It promotes junk food,"" says Susan Linn, a cofounder of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. The group has called for schools to stop participating in the Book It program.
Nearly 22 million children in 50,000 U.S. schools take part in Book It. Since the program began, more than 200 million pizzas have been given away. Each year, from October 1 through March 31, students read books to meet monthly reading goals set by teachers. When students meet their goal for the month, they get a certificate for a personal pan pizza.
""We're really proud of the program,"" says Leslie Tubbs, the director of Book It. ""We get hundreds of e-mails from [past participants] who praise it and say it helped them get started with reading."" In 1988, President Ronald Reagan honored the program for promoting
But critics say schools can teach students to enjoy reading without the help of a fast-food company. ""Schools need to realize that they are undermining their students' well-being,"" says nutrition expert Jane Levine. She explains that the Book It program is a problem not just because it rewards kids with fast food but also because it makes a large company a regular part of the school day.

251,566,"This map might not lead to a pot of gold, but officials at the Library of Congress consider it very valuable. The Library of Congress recently paid $10 million for the first map to name America. Printed in 1507, the map is the only copy of its kind left in the world.
Officials said the map is the most expensive item that the library has ever purchased. The library raised most of the money from Congress and other groups.
America was named after Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian explorer. The map showing America was kept in a castle in Germany for 350 years and was rediscovered in 1901.
For the last century, U.S. officials have been trying to buy the map. It has been called the ""crown jewel"" of the library's map collection.

252,789,"Richard Rodriguez recently set a new world's record for riding a roller coaster. He rode a coaster for 2,000 bone-rattling hours. That's about 22,655 miles.
To set the record, Rodriguez (front) rode a roller coaster at Blackpool Pleasure Beach, an amusement park in England, for 22 hours a day for 90 days. After setting the record, Rodriguez said, ""It was a small step for me, but a giant roller coaster ride for mankind.""

253,111,"Tsunemi Kubodera stands before a giant squid on Display at National Science Museum in Tokyo.
A team of Japanese scientists snapped the first photographs of one of the deep sea's most mysterious creaturesa giant squid. It was the first time a giant squid was photographed in the wild! The researchers took more than 500 pictures of the sea creature off the coast of the Bonin Islands in Japan.
How did scientists nab pictures of the 26-foot-long sea monster? They tracked down the squid by following the only creatures that feed on itsperm whales. Once they determined where the whales dined, the scientists attached a robotic camera to a fishing line with bait. Then they took pictures of the purplish-red squid attacking its prey nearly 3,000 feet beneath the ocean's surface. The squid became caught on the camera but eventually swam away after one of its tentacles broke off. Squid have eight arms, two tentacles, and two huge eyes that can each grow to the size of a volleyball!

254,430,"told you that kids are not getting enough sleep. Now a new report shows that kids are not alone.
About two-thirds of U.S. adults say that they do not get eight hours of sleep a night, according to the 2001 Sleep in America Poll by the National Sleep Foundation (NSF). Those adults also said that they often are not fully awake when they drive and that they find it hard to stay awake while at work. According to the report, more than half of adults drive while drowsy, and nearly two out of ten say they have fallen asleep at the wheel.
""There is an epidemic of sleepiness in our society,"" said James Walsh, vice president of the NSF. ""People may be getting sleep, but it is at school, at work, and behind the wheel.""

255,413,"Assur was once one of the greatest cities in the world. About 30,000 people lived there. A huge temple tower, or ziggurat, stood about 200 feet above the city streets. Assur (or Ashur) was one of the leading cities of Assyria, the center of a great empire.
Today, ancient Assur is in ruins. Desert sand has covered over much of the 3,500-year-old city. Now Assur faces a new threat: water.
Assur is located in what is now Iraq, a country in the Middle East. Many parts of Iraq are covered by desert. Water is hard to find in the desert areas. To increase the amount of water, Iraqi officials are building a dam on the river Tigris.
The dam will trap the river's water. As the water rises, it might flood Assur and many other nearby ancient ruins.
Scientists worry that floodwaters will destroy artifacts hidden beneath the desert sand. Assur has already been the site of some amazing discoveries.
Scientists recently discovered four hidden tombs at Assur. They found ancient coffins, gold, jewelry, and gems. They also dug up the remains of two ancient Assurian queens.
Scientists used modern medical equipment to study the queens' bodies. They learned about some of the medical problems the ancient queens suffered from. The bodies showed evidence of dental cavities, sinus infections, and poor nutrition.
Michael Mller-Karpe, a scientist who studies ancient Assyria, said, ""The Assyrian queens have just begun to speak to us, and we are looking forward to more answers.""
Mller-Karpe and other scientists worry that the new dam may keep them from getting more answers. Even if the new dam doesn't flood Assur, the rising water could damage the ancient city. Moisture could cause the artifacts to crumble.
""You can't save Assur if it's [near] a dam,"" said scientist Peter Miglus. The soil beneath the ancient city would soak up water like a sponge. The water in the soil would destroy what's left of ancient Assur.
For now, scientists are scrambling to uncover the secrets hidden for centuries in Assur and other nearby communities. Meanwhile, some people are looking for ways to save the ancient cities. ""We don't want the slightest damage to Assur,"" one Iraqi official said.

257,331,"Many people think that the new millennium began on January 1, 2000. But they're wrong. The new millennium actually begins January 1, 2001. That's because the calendar we use doesn't have a year zero. Our present calendar actually began with the year 1.
A year may be only 365 days, but a lot can happen in such a short time. Below are just a few of the many important events that took place this past year.
It was a tough summer for many people in the western United States. Wildfires burned about 7 million acres of land--six times the size of the Grand Canyon National Park. The fires forced thousands of people to leave their homes. Many people returned home and found charred rubble.
Recovery is already under way in most burned areas. In Utah, officials from one park are using a helicopter to spread grass seeds over wide areas.
The United States was the top medal winner at the 2000 Olympic Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. The United States took home a total of 97 medals, 39 of which were gold.
There were some spectacular events in this year's Summer Games. One of the highlights was the victory of U.S. wrestler Rulon Gardner (left) over Russian Alexander Karelin. Gardner beat Karelin, who had not lost a match in 13 years, by 1 point.
received its first long-term guests in November. The station, which is being built with help from 16 nations, was first put in orbit in 1998.
According to NASA (the U.S. space agency), the station should be completed by 2006 and will weigh more than 1 million pounds. Scientists will stay in the
to conduct long-term experiments that cannot be done on Earth.
Terrorism struck Americans on October 12 when a bomb ripped a huge hole in the side of the Navy destroyer USS
. The ship was docked in Aden. Yemen, a country in the Middle East.
U.S. officials said that the attack occurred when two men in a rubber boat exploded a bomb next to one side of the
. The blast killed 17 sailors and injured dozens of others. Another ship carried the
to the United States, where it will be rebuilt.
More than 97 million people voted for president of the United States on Tuesday, November 7. Most political experts had predicted that the race would be close, but no one knew that it would be as close as it turned out to be.
On the day after the election, Vice President Al Gore had slightly more votes than Texas Governor George W. Bush had. But the vote in Florida was so close that the state had to recount all 6 million votes cast in that state. The race was so close that no one knew who had actually won the election long after the polls closed.
Here Are a Few More Events That Took Place in 2000...

About 40 years ago, the number of bald eagles in the United States was declining rapidly. Today, however, the bald eagle is returning to the skies. Wildlife officials hope to remove the bird from the list of threatened species by the end of the year.
In the early 1700s, bald eagles were a common sight. There were about half a million of those birds living in the United States.
Over time, their population fell dramatically. In the early 1960s, very few bald eagles remained.
What caused the number to drop? Hunting and the use of harmful chemicals sprayed on crops were largely to blame. Those chemicals poisoned the birds and their eggs.
Pollution also contributed to the problem. Bald eagles often became sick after eating fish from polluted waters.
was being destroyed as people cut down trees to build roads and homes. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal makes its home.
Although some threats still exist, the future looks hopeful for bald eagles. Today, there are about 20,000 bald eagles living in the United States. Thanks to laws that helped protect bald eagles and banned harmful chemicals, the birds are making a comeback.
, or protection, efforts have helped their survival. ""There is no doubt that it is the single best conservation story the United States has had,"" bald eagle expert Bryan Watts told
In 1782, the bald eagle was made the national bird of the United States. The nation's founders chose the bird because it symbolized freedom, strength, and courage. At the time, some people disagreed about the choice for the national bird. Benjamin Franklin, for example, thought the turkey would make a better choice because it was ""a much more respectable bird.""

259,492,"On March 22, Kelsey Penfield, age 9, was working at her desk at Maplehurst Elementary Schook in Norwalk, Ohio. She was also chewing her pen cap. Suddenly, she swallowed the cap.
The pen cap became lodged in Kelsey's throat, and she began choking on it. She tried coughing up the cap, but the cap wouldn't move. Unable to breathe, Kelsey began pointing at her throat.
Kelsey's classmate Elizabeth Muirhead, age 9, realized that Kelsey was choking. Elizabeth immediately sprang into action and performed the Heimlich maneuver on her classmate, saving her life.
Elizabeth had learned the Heimlich maneuver in an issue of
caught up with the two girls to ask them about that fateful day.
: What happened the day that Kelsey started choking?
We were in class doing our grammar work. That's when Kelsey started choking. There was a boy between us, but he didn't know what was going on. Kelsey was pointing to her neck. I asked her if she was choking, and she nodded. That's when I ran over to her and did the Heimlich maneuver.
What were your thoughts? Were you scared?
: I was really scared. The first time I tried the Heimlich, I didn't do it that hard. I was afraid of hurting Kelsey. The second time, I squeezed a little harder. Then the third time, the pen cap just flew out. All the time I was thinking that Kelsey is my best friend and I'm not going to let her die.
How did you know how to perform the Heimlich maneuver?
: We read about it in an issue of
. Mrs. Moore put us in groups of two, and we practiced doing it.
: Kelsey, What was this experience like for you?
: I was really scared. I was chewing on a pen cap, and all of a sudden it slid down my throat. I couldn't breathe. I'm not going to chew on pen caps anymore. You shouldn't really chew on anything. You never know when you can accidentally choke.
1. Stand behind the choking victim and wrap your arms around his or her waist.
2. Make a fist and hold it against the victim's stomach, about halfway between the belly button and the rib cage.

260,109,"Last month in New Jersey, two soccer teams were locked in a tied game. The game finally ended in a dramatic finish.
The game did not end with a tie-breaking shoot-out, however. It ended because of a fight between parents and coaches.
The fight started because one coach wanted the other coach to move from behind the goal during a shoot-out kick. Soon the coaches were yelling at each other. Then parents ran onto the field, and some of the adults threw punches.
No one was hurt and no kids were involved in the fight. But many towns across the United States are wondering what can be done to stop these kinds of ugly scenes from happening.
Many of the fights at kids' sporting events start because of decisions made by referees. ""There are going to be bad calls, and refs have been called names. But that's part of the game,"" Barry Mano told
. Mano is the president of the National Association of Sports Officials.
In kids' sporting events today, bad calls can result in a lot worse than name-calling, Mano said. ""We are seeing between 50 and 100 attacks a year on referees.""
that fighting at kids' sporting events is a national problem. ""We need to have long-term education"" to teach people how to behave at sporting events and solve the problem, Mano said.
Mano said that parents must keep in mind that they are important role models for kids. He also said the quality of referees at kids' sporting events needs to be improved.
""Sports are a great place for kids to learn. We just have to make sure that kids can have fun while playing,"" said Fred Engh. Engh is president of the National Alliance for Youth Sports. The group promotes good sporting behavior among kids, parents, and coaches involved with youth sports.
that there is one important thing kids can do to help prevent bad scenes at sporting events. ""Kids can remind their parents that this is just a game and that it's a time to have fun,"" Engh said.
What are some other ways to prevent fights at sporting events?

261,322,"Scientists are going ape over orangutans (o-RANG-oo-tanz). They are working to help save these endangered tree dwellers before they disappear from the wild.
In recent years, the red-haired apes have found themselves out on a limb. Wildlife experts warn that they may die out, or become
, within the next 20 years. Scientists estimate that only 30,000 orangutans are left in the wild.
Today, orangutans can be found only in tropical rain forests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, in Southeast Asia. They are
creatures, which means they eat, sleep, and travel mainly in trees.
To search for food, orangutans swing from branch to branch. They like to dine on leaves, flowers, bark, and sometimes insects.
""Orangutans spend most of their time in the trees and won't cross open grounds, so the only way they can [move]... is through the trees,"" said one wildlife expert. ""We need to maintain these forest [areas] so that orangutan populations of the future have the opportunity to continue to survive.""
What is causing the numbers of orangutans to decrease at an alarming rate? The main reason is the destruction of their rain forest
Humans pose the greatest threat to orangutans for a number of reasons, say experts. People cut down trees for lumber. This illegal logging is destroying much of the animals' homes. Many countries, including the United States, buy the lumber. It is often used in shelves, picture frames, and floors.
Forest fires and farming are also to blame. As forests are cleared to make way for plantations, orangu-tans lose parts of their habitat.
In addition, orangutans have fallen victim to the recent boom in the illegal pet trade. People steal baby orangutans from the forest to sell them as pets.
To help bring these animals back from the brink of extinction, wildlife groups are working to protect orangutans and stop illegal logging. The government in the area is also involved in the effort to help orangutans. Police go into national parks to prevent illegal loggers from cutting down trees.
""Help is needed to save these amazing creatures,"" orangutan expert Cheryl Knott told
. ""If we can save the rain forest for orangutans, we can save it for other animals as well.""
The average life span for orangutans is about 50 years. Experts hope that orangutans born today will still be swinging through the trees at that age.
The orangutan got its name--which means ""person of the forest""--for a reason. Orangutans are remarkably intelligent. In the wild, scientists have spotted these clever creatures using sticks as tools to open fruit. Orangutans have been observed using large leaves as umbrellas to shelter themselves from heavy rains. Sometimes, the apes even use leaves as cups, from which they drink water.
Are there any endangered animals in the area where you live? What can people do to help them?

262,256,"The poems of Angel Island shine the light on Chinese immigration to the United States.
The year is 1934. Twelve-year-old Wong Kai Chong must leave everything he knows in China and travel to the United States to join his father. He lands in San Francisco, California, on a cold day and is held on Angel Island, a station for immigrants. An
is a person who comes to a country to live.
or question, Kai. He knows his answers must match what his father said before him. If they dont, Kai will be sent back to China. His experience is detailed in the childrens book Kais
Kais story portrays the voyage of more than 175,000 Chinese immigrants to Angel Island from 1910 to 1940.
In December, President George W. Bush signed the Angel Island Immigration Station Restoration and Preservation Act. The law provides up to $15 million to set up a museum and research center on the island to help tell stories like Kais. The money will also be used to protect hundreds of poems carved in the wooden walls of the station that describe the difficult journey.
People from China didnt always have difficulty entering the United States. The earliest Chinese immigrants arrived during the California gold rush in the 1840s and 1850s. They nicknamed the United States
or ""Gold Mountain,"" because many of them hoped to strike it rich.
But as the number of Chinese immigrants grew, Americans became less welcoming. In 1882, the U.S. government passed the Chinese Exclusion Act. The law made it almost impossible for Chinese workers to enter the United States.
or forcibly held, at Angel Island while immigration officials decided whether the newcomers should be allowed to enter the United States. The process was very different from that of Ellis Islandthe New York port of entry for European immigrants.
On Ellis Island, more than 95 percent of travelers were processed quickly and allowed into the United States. On Angel Island, many Chinese immigrants were held for weeks, months, and sometimes even years. After being cruelly questioned by officials, more than 30 percent of immigrants were sent back to China.
Angel Islands doors closed in 1940 when China and the United States became
or partners, during World War II (1939-1945). The islands main immigration station was scheduled to be destroyed in the 1970s until a park ranger found poetry carved in its walls. The poems described the frustration and sadness that many people felt during their stay at Angel Island. (See ""
Later this year, the poems will literally be brought to light. Angel Islands main buildings will reopen to the public, and the poems will be lit up for all to see.
""Angel Island shows a different, but equally important, side of immigration,"" Erika Gee, education expert at the Angel Island Immigration Foundation, told
""We hope that Angel Island becomes a bookend to Ellis Island.""
More than 200 poems are on the walls of Angel Island. The following two poems were recently translated:
Its been a long time since I left my home village
Who could know Id end up imprisoned
Im heartsick when I see my reflection,
  my handkerchief is soaked in tears
I ask you, what crime did I commit
  I give vent to despair
  on a mountainits hard to earn glory
  I watch for my early release
What feelings do these poems capture? How do they tell the story of Angel Islands immigrants?

263,605,"Soaring high above California's coastline stand the magnificent redwood trees. Redwoods are the world's tallest known trees and are also some of the oldest. Some scientists are concerned about a disease that is threatening the ancient giants. It is called sudden oak death.
The disease has scientists alarmed. First identified in 1995, sudden oak death has spread along hundreds of miles of California's coastline and jumped into southern Oregon. In addition to attacking oak trees, it has spread to redwoods, Douglas firs, and other types of trees and shrubs. One of the worst outbreaks of the disease has occurred at California's Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park.
Scientists recently discovered the organism responsible for the disease. It is a fungus that causes oozing red blobs to grow on diseased oak trees. On younger redwoods, it dries up leaves and kills sprouts. According to scientists, redwoods are hosts for the disease. A host is an organism on or in which another organism lives.
The disease first showed up in rhododendron plants in the Netherlands in 1993. Scientists are concerned because the spread of the disease could pose a threat to the redwoods' ecosystem, an environment where plants and animals coexist. Scientist David Rizzo said that anytime you have a strange organism, there is cause for concern.
Coastal redwoods can grow upwards of 360 feet. Some are taller than the Statue of Liberty, which stands about 300 feet.
The diameter of redwoods can measure about 20 feet.
Named California's state tree, the redwood can live more than 2,000 years.
In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Muir Woods a national monument dedicated to protecting and preserving the mighty redwoods.
In 1904, a fungus from Asia began killing chestnut trees in New York. Over the next 50 years, the disease killed about 3.5 billion trees and almost wiped out an entire species. Scientists want to prevent this from happening in California or elsewhere in the United States.
Studies show this disease spreads rapidly during the wet months of spring. The coming months could be vital in tracking the disease. Current weather forecasts predict that this spring will be rainier than the last two springs. ""We have to get familiar with the symptoms and the treatments,"" said another scientist, ""because we don't know how much farther it will spread.""

264,360,"If you listen to music, you are probably like millions of other kids--you turn up the volume when you hear your favorite song. Listening to loud music may be fun, but a government study shows it may also be dangerous.
According to the study, which was paid for by the U.S. government, more than 5 million kids, ages 6 to 19, have suffered some hearing loss. That's more than one out of every ten kids. Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss.
Amanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. ""It was assumed in the past that children wouldn't have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage,"" Niskar said.
Niskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a ""problem for children,"" she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems.
Hearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems.
For example, hearing loss ""can influence [a] child's ability to learn in the classroom,"" Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions.
Niskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead.
Listen Up! This diagram shows the parts of your ear. Loud noises can damage the cochlea and cause hearing loss.

265,456,"On New Year's Day 2001, Irene Alexander and 2,538 other people gathered at Mount Vernon, George Washington's home in Virginia. They came to honor the slaves who had worked there. On New Year's Day 200 years earlier, 123 of George Washington's slaves had been freed.
Washington's widow, Martha, freed her husband's slaves on January 1, 1801. Martha was carrying out the wishes of the country's first president, who had died on December 14, 1799. In his will he had requested that his slaves be freed after his wife's death.
During the ceremony, Alexander, a descendant of a slave who worked at Mount Vernon, told visitors, ""I hope you all feel, as I do, a sense of joy, a sense of sadness but also a sense of hope that the contributions of good people will always be remembered.""
Jennifer Saxon, a spokesperson for Mount Vernon, told
that Mount Vernon couldn't have prospered without slave labor. ""Slaves did most of the work,"" she said.
When Washington was born, many Americans owned slaves. Those people used slaves to plant crops and perform many other duties. Most people thought slavery was OK. When Washington was 11 years old, his father died and left him ten slaves.
During the American Revolution, which began in 1775, some people began to think that slavery was wrong and should be ended. Washington was one of those people. He vowed never to buy another slave.
In his will, Washington wrote that all his slaves should be freed. ""Upon the [death] of my wife,"" he wrote, ""it is my...desire that all the slaves which I hold in my own right shall receive their freedom.""
To make sure Washington's wishes were carried out, Martha freed his slaves in 1801, a year before she died. Martha, however, kept the slaves she owned when she freed her husband's slaves.
Even though Washington freed the slaves he owned, slavery remained legal in some states for another 64 years, until 1865. Slavery did not end in the United States until after the Civil War ended it.

267,147,"Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will take a look at where the two candidates for president stand on important
, or problems facing the country. This week's issue is the
President Bush went to war in Iraq because, he said, the country's dictator, Saddam Hussein, had harmful, illegal weapons. Bush claimed that Iraq and its weapons threatened the United States and other nations. Bush says that the world is safer now that Saddam has been removed from power. His goal is to rebuild Iraq with its own government and establish peace there.
Senator Kerry supported a law that allowed the United States to go to war in Iraq. Since then, he has criticized Bush's handling of the war. Kerry said that Bush misled the nation by claiming that Iraq had harmful, illegal weapons. To date, none have been found. Kerry wants to persuade other countries to help rebuild Iraq and ""win the peace.""

268,341,"For climber Erik Weihenmayer, one of the hardest parts of climbing Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world, was leaping over
. A crevasse is a deep crack in a
, a huge sheet of moving ice.
""I never got used to these 4- or 5-foot crevasses that are hundreds of feet deep,"" said Weihenmayer. ""You had to jump across them. You have to be very careful when you land.""
For most climbers, jumping over a crevasse is hard enough. But for Weihenmayer, jumping over the cracks was particularly hard because he is blind.
Last spring, Erik Weihenmayer became the first blind climber to reach the peak of Mount Everest. He was part of a team of climbers that was sponsored by the National Federation of the Blind.
Mount Everest is 29,035 feet tall and sits on the border between Nepal and China, two countries in Asia. According to many climbers, Mount Everest is one of the hardest and deadliest mountains in the world to climb because of the mountain's height.
""There are a lot of things that can happen up there. You're not ever really sure that you're going to make it,"" Weihenmayer told
. Climbers can suffer from illnesses caused by many things, including the altitude.
sickness occurs when a climber does not get enough oxygen.
The team took more than two months to complete the climb. Weihenmayer spent much of his time moving the team's supplies up the mountain to a base camp, which was located at 17,600 feet. The time spent moving gear helped Erik Weihenmayer get used to the altitude. ""You're letting your body get used to the elevation, the air, the temperature,"" Weihenmayer said.
Weihenmayer, who had already climbed several of the world's highest peaks, had help getting up Mount Everest. ""[People] would walk ahead of me with a bell,"" he said. ""I tried to stay in their footsteps. I tried to stay [close] behind them so I could hear their steps, and I stepped into those places.""
For Weihenmayer, climbing Mount Everest was the toughest but most rewarding experience of his life. When he got to the top, Weihenmayer stopped to think about what he had done.
""I thought about the ground underneath me. I felt these cool flags [at the peak] that were up there in the breeze,"" Weihenmayer said. ""I thought about my family, friends, and about where I was.""
Mount Everest is located in Asia on the border between Nepal and China
May 29, 1953: Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay of Nepal are first to reach to the peak.

269,41,"Recently, historians found an old well in Jamestown, Virginia.
Historians believe that colonists from England dug the well nearly 400 years ago. Shortly after the well was completed, it dried up. The colonists then used the well as a dump.
The historians have found a piece of old armor in the well. Studying the armor and other ""garbage"" from the well will help us learn about life in early Jamestown.
The history of Jamestown begins in England. On December 20, 1606, three ships sailed from England. The ships were bound for Virginia. After the colonists on the ships landed in Virginia, they built a fort. The colonists arrived in North America 14 years before the Pilgrims.
Most of the colonists came to Virginia to search for treasure. Most did not know how to grow crops to feed themselves. They became so hungry that they ate dogs, rats, and snakes.
Eventually, more people settled in Jamestown. They turned the fort into a town. The colonists began to grow and sell crops. The small fort became the first permanent English settlement in North America.
The ""garbage"" from the well is helping historians better understand how the colonists lived.
""When one stands at Jamestown today, it is hard to imagine how much hope, regret, fear, hatred, hunger, pain, and death were experienced at this place,"" historian Ivor Noel Hume wrote of the fort's earliest colonists.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
The settlers at Jamestown were often hungry.
Historians are studying artifacts from a well to learn about Jamestown.

Compounds and mixtures - The reactivity series
Magnesium burns very brightly when heated in air
Some metals are very unreactive. That means they do not easily take part in chemical reactions. For example platinum does not react with oxygen in the air, even if it is heated in a Bunsen burner flame.
Some metals are very reactive. They easily take part in chemical reactions to make new substances.
Magnesium is like this. If it is heated in a Bunsen burner, it ignites and burns with a brilliant white flame.
The reactivity series for some common metals
Other metals may be more reactive than magnesium, or in between magnesium and platinum. If we put the metals in order of their reactivity, from most reactive down to least reactive, we get a list called the
If you want to learn the reactivity series, you could try making up a mnemonic or silly sentence to help. Here's one - can you do better?

272,34,"Cube numbers are formed by multiplying a digit by itself three times.
For example 2 cubed is 2  2  2 = 8
3 cubed is 3  3  3 = 27
4 cubed is 4  4  4 = 64
Each cube number can be represented by a cube made up of unit cubes.
Use your calculator to find the next six cube numbers (from 5 onwards) - then check your answer.
125 = 5  5  5, 216 = 6  6  6, etc.
So the next six cube numbers are:
125, 216, 343, 512, 729 and 1000

277,126,"> Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.
For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.
By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.
You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:
Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:
In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:
To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:
Divide both sides by 2, to give:
a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7
b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7
When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers.
For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7.
7 + 5 does equal 12, so your answer is correct.

Let's look at two examples to see the difference between heat and temperature.
A swimming pool at 30C is at a lower temperature than a cup of tea at 80C. But the swimming pool contains more water, so it stores more thermal energy than the cup of tea.
To boil water we must increase its temperature to 100C. It takes longer to boil a large beaker of water than a small beaker because the large beaker contains more water and needs more thermal energy to reach 100C.

280,46,"There are two different methods for finding the area of this shape:
Divide the shape into squares and rectangles, find their individual areas and then add them together.
Area = 16 + 16 + 48 = 80cm
Imagine the shape as a large rectangle with a section cut out.
Find the area of the large rectangle (12  8) and then subtract the part that has been cut out (4  4)
Area = (12  8) - (4  4) = 96 - 16 = 80cm
In the right area? Find out with this activity.

Graphs - The form y = mx + c
The equation of a straight line on a graph is made up of a y term, an x term, and a number and are written in the form of y = mx + c.
The slope of the line is known as the
All the points that lie on the blue line have a y coordinate that is the same as the x coordinate
We say that the equation of the line is
All the points that lie on the orange line have a y coordinate (the second number in brackets) that is one number higher than the x coordinate of the same line eg
In other words, the y coordinate equals the x coordinate + 1
So the equation of the line is
What is the equation of this line?
The co-ordinates of the points are (2,4), (1,2) and (-2, -4).
The equation of the line that fits these x and y values is y = 2x

289,522,"Liquids and gases do not have a fixed shape. They can flow and fill their containers, but solids cannot. The particle model explains why.
Solids cannot flow because their particles are only able to vibrate and cannot move from place to place.
Liquids can flow because their particles can move over each other. When water is poured into a glass, the particles of water move over each other and into the corners of the glass. The particles keep on moving over each other as the water takes the shape of the glass. The animation shows how this works.
In order to see this content you need to have both
Gases can flow because their particles can move in all directions. When a Bunsen burner is connected to a gas tap and turned on, natural gas flows through the rubber tubing. The particles of natural gas are free to move anywhere inside the tubing, and pressure forces them through the tubing into the Bunsen burner.

291,164,"The beginning, or opening, is one of the most important sections of your writing. It should grab the reader's attention and make them want to read on. For instance, which is the best beginning for a ghost story?
a) The house was built in 1975. It was a typical semi-detached, but it did have quite an impressive front door. Most of the windows were double glazed and the garden was quite neat.
b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.
There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.
So you need to think about TAP (text, audience and purpose) and make a good start to your writing. You should try to 'set a context', which is like setting the scene. So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on.
a) The subject I am going to write about today is why the local park should not be closed.
b) Have you ever stopped to wonder how many hundreds of people make regular use of our Memorial Park?
a) It is unlikely that newspaper readers who enjoy all the things that our park has to offer will want it to disappear forever under tons of concrete.
b) 'Ashfield Park will be ruined,' claim protestors who held a meeting last night to organise opposition to the council's plans for a car park.
It should be clear that the ""b"" versions are better - they fit the style and show that the writer has used TAP to make their writing work. Remember - you need to make it interesting right from the start.
The importance of beginnings, middles and ends.

296,404,"Q1. Which of these lines do you think are NOT written in English?
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain.
Q2. Which of these words are not English?
A1. They are all written in English!
A2. All of them are familiar English words, but originally they were borrowed from Indian languages.
English is a language that is constantly changing and evolving. If it didn't, we'd still be speaking like Shakespeare!
- each generation provides words known as 'slang' - often many of these words become accepted into mainstream English eg 'ok' and 'cool'. However, many slang terms lose popularity as a new generation emerges with their own slang words and phrases - making words such as 'phat' and 'groovy' history.
- the multi-cultural society we live in often provides new or adapted words. You might be familiar with the term 'avatar' in online communities but did you know the word is actually Hindi in origin? Has anyone ever said 'gesundheit' after you've sneezed? This is actually a German word, which has become popular in English.
- these are words or phrases that you only hear in a particular geographical area eg do you eat your sausage in a roll, bap or bun? Depending on where you live, it could be any of these. If you're Cornish, you might hear someone from Birmingham or Scotland using different words and grammar to you, even though you're all still speaking English.
Benjamin Zephaniah is a poet who was born in Birmingham and spent much of his childhood in Jamaica. You can clearly hear these influences in his poems:
Be nice to yu turkey dis Christmas
Let dem eat cake an let dem partake,
In a plate of organic grown beans

The Tempest first key extract - Performance
When you talk about the performance of a play, you should think about how people in the audience feel as they watch it. For instance, the beginning of the first extract is magical and romantic. The tone changes in the middle to one of conflict.
Prospero has lots of asides (thoughts spoken aloud) in the first extract. His role in this scene is made more complex because his character is pretending to be something he is not. The director has to decide whether he wants us to see Prospero as a good father who wants the best for his daughter or a manipulative control freak.
Prospero also speaks to Ariel who is invisible to the other characters on the stage.
When Ariel appears, the director must decide how to present the 'illusion'. Ariel is invisible to the other characters. But it does not necessarily follow that he must be invisible to the audience, too. Try to imagine as many interesting and unusual ways to present Ariel - the 'invisible' sprite - as you can.
When you write about performance, you need to mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:
The characters and how you respond to them
The language used - the detail about freedom and slavery, for example
The issues and ideas - like love, magic and power
The performance instructions, such as stage directions

298,421,"Questioning is an important skill that shows your teacher that you are listening carefully. There are two main types of questions.
These are the type of questions where there is only a yes or no answer or only one possible answer: eg Are you male or female?
These questions let the person answering share their thoughts and ideas more fully: eg What do you think of the new English teacher?
You can show that you are listening carefully to the answer of a closed or open question, by asking another question:
""What exactly do you mean by that?""
Or by checking that you've understood correctly by repeating back to that person what you thought they meant:
""So, you're saying that you think that violence is never the right answer?""
For their Speaking and Listening assessment, Matt has been paired with Tim. Matt has to interview Tim about his favourite character in the play, Romeo and Juliet. Tim is really shy and hates speaking. To get good marks himself, Matt knows that he has to encourage Tim to speak too.
Can you spot the listening skills that Matt uses to help Tim?
Why do you like him better than say, one of the main characters, like Romeo?
He's not so much of a show off.
Do you mean he doesn't talk as much as Romeo?
Yes. (Long pause) It's not just that. He's down to earth.
Whereas Romeo is away with the fairies?
(Laughs) Not exactly. A bit, I s'pose. I just meant that I like Benvolio because he's the only one that just tries to get by without getting into trouble.
Matt has good listening skills - when Tim gives a one word answer, Matt prompts him by asking further questions and he engages with Tim.

The Second Key Extract takes place outside Prospero's cave. Ferdinand is carrying logs. He thinks to himself that he doesn't mind the hard work because he is doing it for Miranda,
Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble.
even if her father is cruel and grumpy.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
Miranda comes to see him. Neither of them realise that Prospero is watching them from a distance.
On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance?
Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
but he says he has too much to do, so she offers to carry some logs for him.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
He says he would rather break his back than see her work. Miranda insists again that she should help him.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Looking on, Prospero sees how much Miranda is in love with Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Ferdinand asks Miranda her name and when she tells him, she remembers that in doing so, she has broken her promise to her father.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand admits that he has liked lots of different women in the past
Ferdinand uses the word 'bondage' to describe his reaction to listening to beautiful women talk. It links back to the issue of Freedom and Slavery in the play. Ferdinand means that he has been like a slave to beautiful women in the past.
, but they have always disappointed him with some fault or other in the end.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
However, Miranda, he says, is perfect. Miranda, on the other hand, hasn't met any men except for her father, or any women, except for herself. Even so, she says that she can't imagine liking anyone more than she likes Ferdinand.
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand tells her that he is a prince, possibly a king (although he hopes his father isn't dead). He wouldn't usually put up with having to carry logs like a slave
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
but he knew as soon as he saw Miranda that he'd do anything for her. When Miranda asks him if he loves her, Ferdinand says he loves, prizes and honours her more than anything else in the world. This makes Miranda so happy that she cries. As Prospero watches them together, he is moved.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Ferdinand asks Miranda why she is crying. She says she thinks she isn't good enough for him
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!
but realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else. Ferdinand happily agrees to marry her. They say goodbye and part.
Prospero is happy for them, but he claims that their engagement is no surprise to him as it was all part of his plan. He goes to get his magic book because he has lots of work to do before supper time.

, remember that any term that contained the same letter can be combined by adding and subtracting.
3g + 2k + 5g + 4k - g
= 3g + 5g - g + 2k + 4k
Like terms with powers can be added or subtracted but only if the powers are the same.
x is not the same as x
, so they cannot be added together.
Rearrange the expression so that like terms are next to each other:
+ 3x - 2x + 5 - 1
People usually write the expression with the 'x
' term first, then the 'x' term and finally the number term.
To get the answer, rearrange the expression:
+ 2x - 4x + 5 - 3

Explore, imagine and entertain - Ending short-stories
The other problem some writers have is ending the story. It doesn't matter if it's a happy ending or not, but it has to make sense. There are lots of ways of ending, such as:
, where we have to wait until the final moment until we know. For instance, the spy who manages to stop the bomb two seconds before it explodes.
, where we are fairly sure about something, but in the final part everything changes. For example, we then learn that this is a fake bomb, and the real one is hidden somewhere else and will explode in five minutes.
, where the story stops, but we aren't sure what has actually happened at the end. For instance, the bomb is defused and everyone is safe. But then an army commander reports the theft of another bomb... only this time twice as powerful.
However, there are two endings to avoid:
, where a bomb will inevitably explode and as it does, the narrator wakes up - it was all a dream. Some English teachers don't mind this sort of thing, but others hate it. You have been warned.
, where the secret agent suddenly stops worrying about the bomb, retires, and goes off to play golf. This is even worse, and no-one likes it because the ending has nothing to do with the story.
Whatever kind of story you write, decide on your ending and include it in your plan.
Writing that explores, imagines or entertains depends on being creative. You need to experiment a little and not be frightened to try something new.

303,429,"> Paragraphs - Why paragraphs are used
There are two main reasons why paragraphs are used:
To show a new speaker is talking.
Without paragraphs, texts would be very confusing.
Have a look at this extract from Louis Sachar's novel, 'Holes'.
He waited while the bus guard gave the man some papers to sign. ""That's a lot of sunflower seeds,"" the bus guard said. Stanley noticed a burlap sack filled with sunflower seeds on the floor next to the desk. ""I quit smoking last month,"" said the man in the cowboy hat. He had a tattoo of a rattlesnake on his arm, and as he signed his name, the snake's rattle seemed to wiggle. ""I used to smoke a pack a day. Now I eat a sack of these every week.""

As you can see, the second version is far easier, and far clearer, to read.

305,77,"We often make judgments as to whether an event will take place, and use words to describe how probable that event is. For example, we might say that it is likely that the sun will come up tomorrow, or that it is impossible to find somebody who is more than 3m tall.
Probabilities can be written as fractions, decimals or percentages.
You can also use a probability scale, starting at 0 (impossible) and ending at 1 (certain).
Here are some events placed on the probability scale.
Now try to order the probabilities in the activity below.

306,620,"> Acids, bases and metals - Introduction
Acids, bases, alkalis and metals are found in the laboratory and at home. They can be irritant or corrosive and must be handled carefully.
How acid or alkaline a chemical is can be measured on the pH scale, using indicators like litmus and universal indicator. Acids and bases react together to form salts and other products too.

308,395,"> Inform, explain and describe - Informing
The key thing about writing to inform is that you stick to the information. You shouldn't really show many of your own feelings, and you definitely don't want to tell your audience how they should feel. Instead, when you inform you make the facts easy to understand, with a clear structure.
Write an information leaflet for Year 6 pupils, telling them about the school day and what they need to know when they start your school in September.
It's important to structure your answer well. Think of the answer in terms of a drawing, like this:
This is a timeline - the arrow is time moving forwards and the four lines are different events in order. Now, you can think of the school day as the arrow, and plan the different events in a typical day. For instance, you could have registration, then an assembly, then two lessons followed by break. It should be easy to add information and detail. The structure also makes it easy for the Year 6 pupils to follow your information. Another way to inform is by subject, as in the diagram below:
These are points linked together. It is not in order of time, but in order of subject. So you could have PE at the centre with all the information connected to PE in the little circles around. For instance, you could have different types of PE kit, the different sports, the sort of exercises you do. Once you have written about PE, you can move on to look at other areas of the school.

310,294,"Living things have certain life processes in common. There are seven things that they need to do to count as being alive. The phrase
Making more living things of the same type
It can be easy to tell if something is living or not. A teddy bear might look like a bear, but it can't do any of the seven things it needs to be able to do to count as being alive.
What about a car? A car can move, it gets energy from petrol (like nutrition), it might have a car alarm (sensitivity), and it gets rid of waste gases through its exhaust pipe (excretion). But it can't grow or make baby cars. So a car is not alive.

313,431,"As well as having lots of ideas, you need to explain them clearly. One really effective way of doing this is to use
So if you're answering a question, state your point, back it up with a piece of evidence and then explain it.
Try out the PEE method. Here's an extract from 'Holes' about Stanley and the prison work camp.
Find two features of Stanley's character and explain how they are suggested. Write your answer down and then compare it to ours.
Stanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for a while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed animals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it. Sometimes he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games. Maybe he'd make some friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake.
Check our ideas on the extract by clicking the button below.
He is willing to make the best of a bad situation.
The writer suggests that Stanley spent long periods, when younger, playing alone with stuffed toys.
Stanley thinks that he will have the chance to make friends and 'at least he'd get to swim in the lake'.
The writer lists the sort of games Stanley played with his stuffed toys at 'Camp Fun and Games' in a way that suggests he was playing on his own - the toys became his friends.
He is going to a boy's prison work camp, but, instead of thinking about the horrors he might face, he shows that he is hopeful and ready to make the best of things.

314,368,"A debate is an organised argument. You might think you've never taken part in a debate before but you probably have without realising it! When you discuss topics in class or at home, and put forward different points of view - this is debating. Debating allows you to discuss your ideas and find out what other people think about a particular topic.
If you're asked to take part in an organised debate at school, this is likely to be a more formal discussion and follow a set of rules.
Here are some simple rules for formal debates:
First of all, you need two teams: the proposition team and the opposition team.
Then you need something to argue about. This is called a motion.
The proposition team starts. Their first speaker has to tell everyone what the motion is all about.
The opposition team goes next. Then the teams take it in turns until everyone has had their say.
The last speaker on each team has to sum up their team's main argument.
Your team will need to do plenty of preparation - writing out the main points of your argument. During the debate, your team is allowed to pass notes to each other so that you can add or change things as you go along. The most convincing team wins the debate. Try to guess in advance what your opposing team might argue to avoid being caught out.
Use these tips to make your arguments as convincing as you can:
Use facts - it's hard to argue against a fact so use as much evidence and as many statistics as possible.
Use opinion too - debating is all about getting your opinion across and persuading others to agree with you, so use a good balance of fact and opinion.
Listen to the other team and comment on what they have said. You then have a chance to convince the audience of the other side of the argument.
Structure your argument - as if you were writing an essay, you need a clear introduction, a middle and a conclusion.
Arguing isn't about shouting the loudest - present your arguments in a clear controlled voice. Don't lose your temper or get too emotional about the arguments.

If two bones just moved against each other, they would eventually wear away. This can happen in people who have a disease called

join the two bones in the joint and stop it falling apart.
The diagram shows the main features of a joint.
In order to see this content you need to have both
Different types of joint allow different types of movement.

allow movement in more directions. Hip and shoulder joints are ball and socket joints.
The bones cannot move on their own - they need muscles for this to happen.

A sunny beach gives you all sorts of possibilities to use your senses. For instance:
The shouts of excited children mingled with the screams of seagulls and the soft roar of breakers on the sandy beach
. I looked down the beach towards the blue sea criss-crossed by the white triangles of sails
. The hot sun burned down onto my back and neck
, and the air was heavy with the smells of suntan oil, sea salt and ice cream
. I could taste the vinegary tang of chips even before I found the busy fish and chip shop
You don't want to overdo the senses, but they are a useful way of making your writing more interesting. Another way of doing this is to look for more original words and phrases to write something that is fresh, not stale.
Avoid clichs. These are phrases that are used so much that they have lost their power. For instance, if you are ""over the moon"" about something, or ""waiting until the cows come home"", then you are using clichs. Look for original phrases instead.
How could you improve the following sentences?
1) He was scared out of his skin.
2) The trees danced in the breeze.
3) She felt that her heart would break.
1) He felt his fingers uncontrollably tighten and clench together so that his nails dug deep into his palms.
2)The wind gradually got stronger and they could see the leaves on the top branches swirling rhythmically, rising and falling.
3) She knew that she wouldn't be able to speak or even look at him, and she kept blinking back the tears.

318,533,"In algebra, a letter can be used to represent a number that you do not know. This gives us algebraic terms, like 2x and 5y.
When algebraic terms are put together by mathematical operations such as + and - we get an algebraic expression, like 2x + 5y +3z.
We can simplify algebraic expressions by collecting 'like terms'.

1. This is an extract from the Anthony Shea Community School newsletter:
During the past three years, mobile phones have become more and more popular. Growing numbers of our students bring them to school, and parents encourage this as they can stay in touch with their children and know they are safe. However, many of our students keep their phone on during the day which can disturb lessons. A number of phone thefts have also occurred recently, both in and out of school. I would like to call a meeting to discuss this issue with staff, parents and students. I don't want to ban them, but we must agree on how they can be used sensibly and safely.
Write a speech to be given at this meeting analysing the advantages and disadvantages of allowing mobiles in school and suggest how they can be used sensibly and safely.
2. Read this extract, which considers the issue of horror movies:
As a parent, I have constant battles over TV and films. My children feel they should be allowed to watch whatever they want, no matter how violent, gory or creepy. They say it's just entertainment, and that it has no effect on them. I don't agree! Many of the films are rated 18, and my oldest is 14. I'm afraid my kids will become more aggressive and uncaring towards people, or that they might end up seeing something which really disturbs them.
Write an article for your school magazine commenting on why horror movies are popular with teenagers and explaining the advantages and disadvantages of parents banning them at home.

Writer's tricks - The effect on the reader
You will now be very familiar with the idea that every text is intended to affect its readers in some way.
Every reader is, of course, different too, and sometimes a text will affect you in ways a writer didn't imagine, or you might notice depth in it that others won't. This is particularly true if the text matches your personal experience. A story about your home town might interest you more than one about somewhere else, or a text about smoking might affect you more if you know somebody who is trying to give it up.
Remember, you get marks for noticing the intended effect on the reader. Even if something doesn't interest, horrify, amuse or persuade you, you need to spot what the writer meant to do. It's usually better not to mention your personal opinion unless you are asked to.

We get energy from many different types of energy resources, including fuels, food and stores of energy such as batteries or the wind. We can divide energy resources into two categories:
Non-renewable energy resources cannot be replaced once they are all used up.
Renewable energy resources can be replaced, and will not run out.
On the this page we'll look at non-renewable resources.
are called fossil fuels. They formed millions of years ago from the remains of living things. Coal was formed from plants. Oil and natural gas were formed from sea creatures.
The energy stored in the fossil fuels originally came from
. Plants used light energy from the Sun for
to make their chemicals. This stored chemical energy was transferred to stored chemical energy in animals that ate the plants. When the living things died, they were gradually buried by layers of rock. The buried remains were put under pressure and chemical reactions heated them up. They gradually changed into the fossil fuels.
When the remains of the plants and animals became fossil fuels, their chemical energy was stored in the fuels. The energy is transferred to the surroundings as
Once we have used them all up, they will take millions of years to replace, if they can be replaced at all. For this reason we call fossil fuels

> Changes in the environment - Humans
Humans are very successful living things. We compete with other organisms for many natural resources. These include:
The worlds population of humans is increasing all the time. In the year 1800 it was about
, and now it is more than
More people mean more use of natural resources, and bigger changes to the environment. The graph shows population growth over the last 200 years.
Humans use machines to move large amounts of earth to make new roads and buildings. We straighten rivers and build walls to stop them flooding. In some countries, such as the Netherlands, land is reclaimed from the sea. Barriers are built and water is pumped out. New dry land forms for people to use.
We also large areas of land for quarries. These are large holes in the ground where rocks containing useful metals are taken out.
The environment is also changed when land is flooded to make reservoirs for drinking water or hydroelectric power schemes. The animals and plants that live in the forest or on the land lose their habitat. They may die out in that region as a result.
Humans have been cutting down trees for thousands of years. We do this to clear land for farming and building, and for wood to use as a fuel or building material.
as long as forests are allowed to replace themselves, or are replanted after felling, but often this is not done. The result is that the worlds forests are steadily shrinking.
The maps below show the loss of forest across the world over the last 10 thousand years.

Sometimes you need to rearrange the formula to find the value you're looking for.
The area of a circle (A) is
This is useful if we know the radius of the circle and want to know the area. But what if we want to find the radius?
We need a formula that has r = (some expression in A). We get this by rearranging the A =
[Then find the square root of both sides]
[Swap the sides to make it easier to read]
The formula has been rearranged. We say that now r is
Q1. The formula to find the circumference of a circle: C = 2
Rearrange the formula to make r the subject.
Q2. The formula to convert the temperature in F to the temperature in C is :
Rearrange this formula so that it will convert the temperature in C to the temperature in F (so that f is the subject). Write down your working, then check your answer.
r, so divide both sides by 2
9c = 5(f  32) [multiply by 9]
= f - 32 [divide by 5]

Inform, explain and describe - Add the senses
Another way to add detail to your descriptions is to use your senses. Think about what you can see, what you can touch, what you can smell, what you can taste and what you can hear. If we go back to your house, you might be able to add sounds, like music from your sister's room, the sound of the neighbour's lawnmower, or a baby crying upstairs.
Here's a typical writing to describe question:
Write a description of your school during a typical break. Include information about the buildings and the people. You might want to write about the classrooms, the hall, the playing fields and the corridors as well as the pupils and the staff.
Why not have a go at planning an answer to this question now? You could have a go at writing a full answer, or just jot down some points and details on rough paper.

333,37,"> More on formulas - Multiplying brackets
When multiplying expressions in brackets, make sure that everything inside the bracket is multiplied by the term (or number) outside the bracket.
Use either method, but remember that everything inside the bracket must be multiplied by the term (or number) outside the bracket.
What happens when we have more than a single term or number outside the bracket? What happens when we have another bracket.
For example, if we want to expand
, we need to make sure that everything in the second bracket is multiplied by everything in the first.
We can do this in two ways, using boxes or lines.

336,532,"> Graphs - The form x = c and y = c
Graphs - The form x = c and y = c
Graphs of this type have either a horizontal or vertical straight line.
All the points on this line have a y coordinate of 4 so you can say that the equation of the line is y = 4.
All the points on this line have an x coordinate of 7 so you can say that the equation of the line is x = 7.
All vertical line graphs have an equation of the form x = c
eg x = 1, x = -3, x = 4, etc.
All horizontal line graphs have an equation of the form y=c
eg y = 3, y = -2, y = 1, etc.
If you can't remember whether the equation of the line is of the form x = ... or y = ..., find the coordinates of at least two points on the line.
If the x coordinates are the same, the equation of the line will be x = ...
If the y coordinates are the same, the equation of the line will be y = ...
Get from X to Y with this activity.

Formal and informal writing - Informal writing
Writing is informal when it reads as though someone is chatting to the reader. In the right situation, it makes your writing seem more friendly and natural.
Which of the following would you NOT write using informal language?
b) An essay about a Shakespeare play
c) A talk aimed at students your own age or younger
e) A story written from the point of view of a character (in the first person)
b) An essay should always be written using formal language. All of the other situations would suit a more informal style.
Tips to make your informal writing more effective
""Dear reader, I'm really glad you've found the time to open this letter.""
2. It's okay sometimes to use the kind of words that are more usual in speech than writing:
""You don't have to put up with bullying. We'll stick together and make it stop.""
3. Contractions sound more natural in certain types of writing eg a talk to fellow students:
""It's good to know that we're all going to work together on this.""
Don't baffle your reader with too much slang.
Think carefully about structure - informal writing is different to speech and needs carefully planned paragraphs to keep it clear and easy to read.
Sometimes there is opportunity to break the rules of Standard English and use English in unexpected ways. Two good examples of writers who achieve this are poet Benjamin Zephaniah and writer Andrea Levy in her book Small Island.
If you're asked to write a story, it would be a mistake for you as the author to use incorrect grammar and slang - but inside speech marks, your characters can!

341,171,"> Explore, imagine and entertain - Short-stories
A short-story is easy to write if you:
Have only one or two main characters. It's a short story and you don't have time for any more.
Use people's words and actions as much as possible. Don't try to give lots of background information - let the reader use their own imagination. Remember - creative writing means creative reading too!
Make your characters and plot realistic. How do people really speak and act? Remember, most writers base some of their characters on people they actually know, so who can you use to improve your story? Would your granny make a good secret agent or your uncle a confident contract killer?
Get straight to the point. Don't worry about long openings or lots of detail. Instead, launch right in, hopefully in the middle of some action, like in the example below.
Steve held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - he was too shocked to speak. One moment he had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next he was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
You will also have to decide whether to write in the first person (using ""I""), or in the third person (typically, using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they""). Using ""I"" makes it easier to write about thoughts and feelings, but using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they"" lets you move from person to person, or from place to place. You can choose whichever you feel happiest with. For instance, we can swap the opening of the story into the first person, like this:
I held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - I was too shocked to speak. One moment I had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next I was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
The only thing you shouldn't do is swap the person - dont start with ""I"" and then switch to ""he"", or you'll spoil the story.
Can you match Viral Vinnie's appetite for English, Maths and Science?

343,447,"The extract comes from a book called 'Face' by Benjamin Zephaniah. Natalie is a Year 9 student and lives in East London. She is out with her boyfriend and his friends. They have stopped to chat with some boys from school. Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. You can use the bullet points to help you.
After a couple of minutes she realised that her every move was being watched by a group of three girls and she couldn't help noticing how tough they looked. All three were wearing dark blue baggy jeans. She was pretty sure they were Londoners born and bred but thought they could find a job working for the Jamaican tourist board, not simply because of their dark skin but also because of their clothing. One had a T-shirt saying 'I love Jamaica'. Another wore a T-shirt that was a Jamaican flag and the third just had a West Ham football shirt on, but she, like the others, was adorned with yellow, black and green bangles, badges and necklaces. Natalie thought they looked good, but dangerous.
Natalie shifted nervously. She didn't know quite where to look but she had to put on a front. The other three girls made no attempt to hide the fact that they were on Natalie's case. They began to whisper to each other and smile as they stared at her. Natalie felt illuminated in her green satins and began to wish she had chosen clothes which weren't so loud. What are they grinning at? she wondered. Is it my clothes? My shoes? My hair? Do I look too innocent? Suddenly the three girls began to walk toward Natalie. Her heart began to race, the palms of her hands began to sweat. She felt like falling apart but she held herself together.
'You from round here, den?' said the big girl wearing the Jamaican flag.
'Yeah, I wanid to go there but they wouldn't let me, said I had ta go ta Lonsdale Park, said it was nearer. What ya doing here?'
The other two girls continued to look her up and down. Natalie expected trouble and in her mind she cursed the boys for bringing her there and for the way they had got lost in their silly conversation about football and cars.
'I'm just hanging around with my boyfriend and his mates.'
At this point the girl wearing the West Ham shirt reached into her back pocket. Natalie swallowed hard as the girl pulled out a couple of leaflets. After separating one from the other she handed one to Natalie. 'Dat's the place to be, check it out, good vibes, good music. Ya like rap?'
Natalie wanted to kick herself. She had completely misread the situation. They weren't out for a fight, they wanted to find out if she liked clubbing. They wanted to find out if she was one of them, an Eastender.
'Yeah,' Natalie replied, feeling a sense of relief. 'Yeah, rap's cool...' She began to wonder if she sometimes looked threatening and if she herself had been misjudged in the past. For people to be friendly, did they have to have permanent smiles on their faces?
How does the writer show Natalie's thoughts and feelings changing during the extract?
her first reactions to the girls she sees
the way she acts just before, and when, they speak to her
her thoughts at the end of the passage.
Just before the girls speak to her, Natalie seems even more anxious. She is used to being out on the streets of London and feels she needs to 'put on a front' and look tough. She is afraid they may be laughing at her clothes or hair, which makes her seem insecure about herself. However, when the girls come up to speak to her she hides her nerves and answers their questions. The way she uses short answers like 'Yeah' suggests she does not want to give too much away about herself or get into a fight.
When she realises the girls are actually being friendly and want to give her a flyer for a club, Natalie's feelings change completely. She is ashamed of being suspicious and feels like 'kicking herself'. She realises the girls are Eastenders just like her. The writer shows how this makes her think about her own image. She wonders if people think she looks threatening, too. At this point she comes across as an intelligent, thoughtful girl who wants to learn how to judge people fairly in the future.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The party
Romeo and his friends decide to gate-crash the party. Romeo has a bad feeling about the outcome of this evening, but decides to let fate take its course.
Capulet is having a great time at his party. People are dancing. Romeo and his friends arrive wearing masks. Romeo spots Juliet. He thinks to himself that he didn't really know what true beauty was until he saw her. He doesn't know that she is a Capulet. Tybalt recognises Romeo from his voice and threatens to kill him because he is a Montague, but Capulet stops him. Romeo and Juliet flirt and finally kiss. The Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet and he is dismayed. He leaves with Benvolio. Juliet is distraught when the Nurse tells her who Romeo is.
The Chorus recaps events for us: Romeo has forgotten Rosaline and is now in love with Juliet. Juliet feels the same way.
Romeo runs away from his friends. Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline.
Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom. Juliet doesn't know that he is there at first and, talking to herself, declares her love for him. She is shocked and embarrassed when he replies. They have only met that evening, but they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and what time their wedding will be! They find it difficult to part.
Romeo goes to see Friar Lawrence, the priest, who is worried that he has spent the night with Rosaline. When Romeo says that he wants to marry Juliet, Friar Lawrence tells him off for falling in love so easily, but agrees to the wedding because he thinks that it might be a solution to the rift between the Capulets and the Montagues.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The end
Meanwhile, in Mantua, Romeo waits for news. A servant called Balthasar arrives and tells Romeo that he has heard that Juliet has died. Romeo decides to buy some poison. He plans to go to see Juliet's body where he will take the poison and die next to her.
Meanwhile, Friar John explains to Friar Lawrence that the letter he wanted him to take to Romeo explaining the truth about Juliet didn't get delivered. Friar Lawrence decides to go to the tomb and wait for Juliet to wake up while he sends another letter to Romeo.
That same evening, Paris goes to Juliet's tomb with some flowers. He hears a noise and decides to investigate.
Romeo pays Balthasar off and breaks into the Capulet tomb. Paris tries to stop him. Romeo begs him to leave him alone, but Paris thinks he is vandalising the tomb. They fight. Romeo kills Paris. Just before Paris dies he asks Romeo to place him next to Juliet's body. Romeo is sad that he had to kill Paris and takes him into the tomb to be near Juliet.
When Romeo sees Juliet lying in the tomb, he can't believe that she is dead because she looks so beautiful. He hugs her and kisses her. He takes the poison then kisses her again and dies.
Friar Lawrence finds the bodies of Paris and Romeo just as Juliet is about to wake up. Juliet wakes up and asks the Friar where Romeo is. He hears a noise and begs Juliet to come away with him, but when she finds out that Romeo is dead, she refuses to go with him. Friar Lawrence runs away.
Juliet tries to kiss the poison off Romeo's lips. His lips are still warm, but there is not enough poison left on them to kill her. She takes his dagger and stabs herself.
Some watchmen discover the bodies outside the tomb. They also find the Friar who is crying and shaking. Prince Escalus and Juliet's mother and father arrive with Romeo's father. Friar Lawrence tells them all the truth about the wedding and their children's deaths. He feels so guilty that he asks the Prince to punish him, but Prince Escalus won't because the Friar is a holy man. Prince Escalus blames Montague and Capulet, but he also blames himself for not doing enough to stop the violence. Capulet and Montague decide to end their rift. Montague offers to have a statue of Juliet made. The play ends as the Prince says that this is the saddest story ever told.

Number patterns - Number patterns in diagrams
A number pattern in a diagram often requires counting shapes to find the rule. Again, look at how the pattern grows from one term to the next.
Pattern 1 has 0 orange tiles and 3 blue tiles, so 3 tiles altogether
Pattern 2 has 1 orange tiles and 5 blue tiles, so 6 tiles altogether
Pattern 3 has 2 orange tiles and 7 blue tiles, so 9 tiles altogether
Q1. Based on the number patterns above, draw pattern 4.
Q2. Look again at the number patterns above. Write the rule and the fourth terms for:
Pattern 4 has 3 orange tiles and 9 blue tiles, so 12 tiles altogether
a) The rule for the number pattern of orange tiles is 'add 1' and the 4th term is 3.
b) The rule for the number pattern of blue tiles is 'add 2' and the 4th term is 9.
c) The rule for the number pattern of all tiles is 'add 3' and the 4th term is 12.
Follow the rules and try this activity!

350,127,"There are two main types of language: literal and figurative.
Literal language is explicit, obvious, out in the open and plainly stated. It is a major part of non-fiction texts, but can also be found in fiction.
Figurative language infers or suggests things rather than stating them. Figurative language can give a text more richness and depth. It is often found in fiction texts and autobiographies, but can also be found in non-fiction.

Of course winning an argument isn't just about being clever or talking loudly, look back at the Speaking Revision Bite to remind yourself how to be convincing during an argument or debate.

Vielen Dank fr Deine schne Postkarte aus Cornwall. Mutti, Paul und ich fahren zu unserer Oma in Schwerin. Wir fahren morgen mit der Bahn dahin. Unser Kaninchen fhrt aber nicht mit und Papa bleibt zu Hause, denn er muss arbeiten. Paul nimmt seine Gitarre mit, die er zu Ostern gekauft hat, aber er kann noch nicht gut spielen! In Schwerin fahren wir gerne Rad. Am Wochenende fahren wir nach Warnemnde. Das liegt an der Kste nicht weit von Rostock. Das macht immer Spa.
They are going to travel by train.
The rabbit was staying behind with Hannah's father.
Warnemnde is on the coast near Rostock.

363,4881,"Victor has a very happy childhood, brought up by a wealthy and caring family in Geneva, Switzerland. He adores, and is adored by, his foster sister, Elizabeth, and has another great friend in Henry Clerval.
However, tragedy strikes when his mother dies of fever just before he leaves to study at the University of Ingolstadt. His father insists he should still go, and while at university Victor's earlier interest in science becomes an obsession - in particular, he wants to discover the secret of life itself.

364,5139,"Most tasks allow you to write or talk about how language is used in the play. So imagine your title is: 'How does Beatrice change during the course of
?' There are all sorts of references you can make to language:
When we first meet Beatrice, she seems to be a clever, independent woman. She speaks openly, not waiting to be asked, and seems to like making fun of Benedick in particular. She compares him with ""a disease"", and her repartee makes even the messenger afraid of her. Throughout the play she uses puns, such as saying Claudio is ""civil as an orange"". This shows her witty nature, because she plays on the similarity between ""civil"" and ""Seville"": he is either polite or bitter (just like the oranges from Seville).
This combines much of what we have covered so far. It starts to answer the question without filling up the page with irrelevant facts, plot details and fancy technical terms. Remember, you do not have to tick off the language terms like a trainspotter. Instead, show you appreciate some of the techniques Shakespeare used, and the effects they have on his audience.

365,2234,"All animals and plants are made of cells. Animal cells and plant cells have features in common, such as a nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria and ribosomes. Plant cells also have a cell wall, and often have chloroplasts and a permanent vacuole. Note that cells may be specialised to carry out a particular function.
Dissolved substances pass into and out of cells by diffusion. Water passes into and out of cells by osmosis.
Function of cells which animal and plant cells have in common
contains genetic material, which controls the activities of the cell
most chemical processes take place here, controlled by enzymes
controls the movement of substances into and out of the cell
most energy is released by respiration here
contain chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy for photosynthesis
filled with cell sap to help keep the cell
having turgor; enlarged and swollen with water
Make sure you can label diagrams of animal and plant cells, like these:

366,5428,"You need to go to the exam with strategies that will help you work well under pressure. Here are some suggestions:
You are usually given 5 minutes to read through the paper before the tape starts. Use this to your advantage by looking right through the paper so see what kind of tasks there are.
Look closely! Should you listen for precise information (like train arrival and departure times)? Or should you be listening to the whole passage, in order to draw a conclusion (for example, name the girl who has the best relationship with her parents)?
As you read the question, try to predict the sort of information that may be in the passage. It will help focus your mind.
Look at the title of the question or section very carefully. Make sure you understand
to give your answer. If there is an example, look closely at the answer given - it will show you whether you need to write a single letter, a single word, or more than one word.
Have a good look at any illustrations. They could give important clues as to what is coming.
word - there is probably a lot of 'redundant' language you don't need. Be positive. Concentrate on what you do understand. Sometimes the passage can be difficult, but the questions are easy.
Use your knowledge of grammar. For example, it may be important to know whether someone is talking about the past, the present, or the future.
Use your knowledge of Spanish-speaking countries. For example, if you hear someone was on holiday in Madrid, it is unlikely they spent time on the beach.
Don't just listen to the words. The tone of someone's voice may also be helpful - for example in telling you if they are making a statement or asking a question.
If you have to write answers in Spanish, remember you will not be penalised for minor spelling mistakes.
Don't just read it, practise your Spanish with downloadable audio bites.

368,2503,"If tourism is to be sustainable then the impacts on local people, the economy and the environment need to be balanced. To achieve this there needs to be cooperation between different interest groups. In The Lake District, this includes:
The National Trust (who own a proportion of the land).
Possible strategies to achieve sustainable tourism could be:
Restricting the number of cars and visitors  although this would have an impact on income from tourism.
Fundraising to repair damage done to the natural environment and footpaths  but who should pay?
Education of local people and tourists about sustainable tourism  but who will pay for this?
Underpinning any sustainable strategy is the successful involvement of the local people. With their cooperation, positive outcomes are far more likely.

369,6661,"This Revision Bite will give you practice in creating and structuring a presentation about a famous person in five key sections: introduction, past, present, future and concluding opinion.
In your presentation exam you should speak for about one minute in Irish on a topic you have prepared, then you will be asked questions in Irish about what you have said. You are usually allowed to take a prompt card into the exam with you with five brief points on it and as many pictures as you like, to help you remember what to say.
A good way to structure your presentation so you include a variety of tenses plus an opinion is to start with
('tomorrow' - the future), before finishing off with
For his presentation Samus has written five paragraphs about Peter Canavan, but the order of the paragraphs has been jumbled up. Can you work out which paragraph is the introduction, which is about Peter Canavan's past, present and future, and which is the concluding opinion? It will help you to look out for uses of different tenses.
Is minteoir scoile  fosta ach n bheidh s ag obair sa scoil i mbliana. Beidh s ag obair leis an pheil i mbliana. Deir daoine nach mbeidh s ag imirt peile ar an bhliain seo chugainn. Nl s iontach g agus sleann daoine go bhfuil s measartha aosta anois. Is fidir go n-ireoidh s as an pheil mar go bhfuil s aosta.

You could summarise the presentation under the following five headings:
- sport and especially Gaelic football; favourite player (Peter Canavan); description (age, appearance, home, marital status, children, etc.).
- All-Ireland Final last year against Armagh; Tyrone won and Peter was captain; how he played and what he scored; Sam Maguire and celebrations.
- very fit and he loves Gaelic football; Errigal Ciaran and Tyrone; very good footballer - skillful and dedicated; training every day.
- P.E. teacher in a secondary school in Co. Tyrone; may not be teaching this year because of work with football; he may not play for Tyrone next year because he may be too old.
- excellent footballer; I was so happy when he lifted Sam Maguire; Come on Tyrone!
In the exam the prompt card can usually have five bullet points of what you want to say. These bullet points can be in Irish. You can prepare the card well in advance of the exam so make sure you check vocabulary, gender and pronunciation thoroughly. If in doubt ask your teacher.
This is how Samus's prompt card might look in Irish:
- sprt agus peil Ghaelach, Peadar  Ceannabhin (33, beag, tana, lidir, psta, trir clainne).
- Cluiche ceannais anuraidh in adan Ard Mhacha; Bhain Tr Eoghain; captaen; d'imir s go maith; cpla pointe; Sam Maguire, cisir mhr.
- acla; suim mhr sa pheil; Earagail Chiarin agus Tr Eoghain; peileadir iontach maith, sciliil; dograiseach; ag traenil gach l.
- minteoir corpoideachais, menscoil i gCo. Thr Eoghain; N bheidh s ag teagasc i mbliana; obair leis an pheil; an bhliain seo chugainn; r-aosta.
- peileadir den scoth; an-ssta, Sam Maguire; Tr Eoghain ab!
This is a very good presentation. Samus has included lots of information about his chosen famous person and has used the past, present and future tenses effectively. He has introduced his topic well with detailed background information and has used structures and vocabulary already known to him from his description of himself. He has also chosen a topic which he is genuinely interested in, therefore making it easier for himself to adopt an enthusiastic approach to the subject. He has concluded by offering a range of opinions, all of which he has explained and for which he has given reasons. His presentation has a clear start, middle and end and offers the listener a well-structured presentation on his chosen topic.
Sa chur i lthair seo beidh m ag caint ar Pheadar  Ceannabhin. T Peadar  Ceannabhin tr bliana is trocha d'aois. T s measartha beag agus tana ach t s iontach lidir.

In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!
After your presentation you will have to answer questions on it. Think about the kinds of questions you could be asked on this topic and prepare answers to them.
You are usually allowed to take a card in with you with five reminders of what you want to say. These should not be in complete sentences but might contain, for example, headings for each part of your talk or unusual words which you need.
Remember to learn the vocabulary you need to describe other people (especially famous people, sports stars and musicians), including how to talk about special features and aspects of their lives and careers. Make sure you can explain why you chose this topic and why you are interested in it.

Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint.
Both express love. Shakespeare writes to his mistress, Hopkins writes about a much-loved landscape.
Shakespeare mocks the common cliches that poets use about their mistresses - lips redder than coral, breasts whiter than snow, etc - to emphasise the reality of his love. Hopkins also wants to get away from the cliched use of language - by inventing words, like rollrock and twindles, to pinpoint his meaning.
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint, and both express danger as well as beauty.
However, in Clarke's poem man has caused the destruction already (cutting hay kills the field mouse; war is taking place in Bosnia) - Hopkins' poem is a plea to stop man from causing destruction.
Images or things (usually physical, like a flag) that stand for or represent something else - usually abstractions, like a nation. A crucifix is a symbol of Christianity.
to convey their message. The central image for Clarke is the field mouse, which represents all the innocent, vulnerable people in the world who are killed or injured. Inversnaid represents all areas of wet and wilderness in the world that mankind could jeopardise.
Both poems describe watery river scenes, but while Perch is purely a vivid word-picture, Inversnaid contains more of an explicit 'message'.
The language in Perch has many similarities with the Hopkins poem: combination words and word-plays (alder-dapple, finland of perch) dialect and obsolete words (grunt, slub, runty, adoze) and lots of sound devices. The unorthodox grammar of on hold / In the everything flows and steady go of the world (where the last 8 words make up a giant compound noun) is very like Hopkins.
While the Hopkins poem is full of movement, and ranges over the landscape, the Heaney poem stays very still and focused on the almost motionless fish, adoze in the current.
How does the rhythm and rhyme scheme of Perch compare with that of Inversnaid?
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint, describing an experience which is for the poet is intensely present.
Both poets use an extended image to put their point across. The canary-yellow cotton jacket is the central image in Homecoming. A row over the jacket caused the family row; the reconciliation is likened to putting the jacket back on. For Hopkins, the darksome burn represents all areas of wilderness in the world that could be vulnerable to man.
language to help us 'hear' events in the poem - Temper, temper... Blue murder. Hopkins uses different techniques -
Words strung together with repeated (often initial) consonants, eg Max made many men mad.
Words that sound the same through the use of similar vowels or consonants, eg hot and slop or fold and filled.
The pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of poetry.
- to help us hear the sound of the rushing water.
The way a text is built and shaped. Chapters, plot, acts and scenes, stanzas, narrative, verse-form, rhyme and rhythm - all these (and many more) are aspects of structure.
In poetry, the use of words which have the same or a similar sound - eg 'flow' and 'bow' - to form a pattern of sound.

to show the intensity of the love, while Hopkins invents words or uses dialect (a windpuff bonnet of fawn-froth) to convey his feelings.
Anne Hathaway's love of Shakespeare is confident and will last forever - I hold him in the casket of my widow's head - while Hopkins' is more tentative - he fears for the future and asks What would the world be? without the wilderness his poem evokes.

373,1173,"This modern story about conflict between a mother and her teenage daughter was published in 1991. The mother is the narrator of the story, so we only see things from her point of view.
""You're not here any longer so how can I speak to you?""
A woman who is deeply upset lies in her daughter's darkened bedroom. She clutches a pair of new white trainers that were a present for her daughter.
In the first sentence, we discover that the narrator is telling the story to another character - the daughter - but the daughter is not there to hear it. This style of writing is sometimes called a
An extended speech performed by one person only
, because there is only one character speaking or thinking.
Her 15-year-old daughter has run away from home. The woman worries that her daughter may have to beg for food to survive, or that she has been forced to become a prostitute.
We are told there was an argument between the father and daughter. Bad language was used on both sides.
The doctor has signed the narrator off work; she is taking medication. The mother aims to pretend to the outside world that everything is okay, but fears her daughter may be dead, or at least living on the streets.
We learn more about the argument. The daughter is brought home drunk at 3am. The father calls her a 'dirty slut'.

You must consider bandwidth when you are designing your images. If you are designing a website with lots of images, it is important to think about how long these images will take to download to a user's

The higher the bandwidth, the faster the images will download. Large image files can take up a lot of

of the image, the clearer it will be. You should aim to use the highest possible resolution. You must be careful though, as an image with a high resolution will often take longer to display, due to the large file size.
You should also consider where the image will be seen. Will it be projected onto a screen? Will it be viewed from a computer screen? Will it be on a TV screen? How big will the display be?

377,5869,"Jane is excited about returning to Thornfield and Mr Rochester, even though she believes he is married to Blanche Ingram. It is obvious when they meet that Rochester is delighted to see her, too.
What follows is ""a fortnight of dubious calm"", in which Jane expects to hear about the marriage but nothing is said.
On midsummer eve, Jane goes into the garden after Adele has gone to bed. She finds Mr Rochester there. The scene is described in extraordinary detail, as it moves to his proposal.
He is perhaps teasing or testing Jane as he talks of her having to move on, claiming to have found her a new position in Ireland. Eventually, however, he proposes, revealing that any chance of a relationship with Blanche ended when he pretended to have less money than she considered acceptable.
Rochester talks frequently of what he is doing as being wrong, but claims his love and care for Jane will atone for it. As readers, we think there could be something sinister behind this. However, Jane does not pick up on more than his emotion as they go into the house.
Jane is blissfully happy, but still aware that Mrs Fairfax seems shocked. So she asks Mr Rochester to speak to her the following day. Her congratulations, when they come, seem very subdued, fuelling our suspicions.
Jane decides she will not abandon her previous path. She refuses expensive gifts and spends a lot of time with Adele. Mr Rochester is eager to be with her, but allows her to dictate terms in this way in the four weeks leading up to the wedding.
Then we hear of a very bizarre episode. Mr Rochester has had to go away. When he returns, Jane describes having been woken by someone in her room. She describes the woman in hideous terms, and explains that her wedding veil was ripped in two, so it could not have been a dream. Mr Rochester encourages her to continue to blame Grace, and insists she shares Adele's room the night before the wedding.
The wedding morning arrives. Mr Rochester is possessed by tension and a desire that everything should be done quickly. Even Jane is encouraged to hurry.
There are no family present at the wedding. Perhaps for this reason, Jane notices two men, apparently waiting for the ceremony, enter the church before them.
When the priest asks if there is any impediment to the marriage, one of the men, Mr Briggs - a lawyer - explains that Rochester is already married to the sister of Mr Mason, who comes forward at this point.
Clearly, there can be no marriage. Mr Rochester takes them back to Thornfield to see his wife, Bertha, a dangerous lunatic, and Grace, her keeper. Bertha attacks Mr Rochester, but he is able to restrain her. Even though
The crime of marrying one person while still being married to another.
is a serious crime, it becomes easy to understand what drove him.
Before Briggs and Mason depart, we learn that it was a chance connection between Jane's uncle in Madeira and Mr Mason that brought Briggs and Mason to stop the marriage. We also learn that Jane's uncle is on his death-bed.
Jane spends a long time numb with shock at what has happened. She eventually meets with Mr Rochester and he tries everything in his power to keep her with him. He explains how he was trapped by his family into the marriage, and how he spent time in Europe seeking, in vain, some kind of escape.
He asks Jane to come away with him, but she is controlled by conscience and cannot allow herself to be loved by a married man. She knows she cannot stay with him and keep her resolution, so says she will leave.

378,3606,"In a bid to improve roads, the first Turnpike Trusts were set up in 1663. These organisations introduced tolls on roads and aimed to use the money raised to maintain the roads. However, the Turnpike Trust scheme still had its problems.
The first attempt in Britain to improve roads started in 1663. This was when the Turnpike Trust was set up. The trusts had one simple aim:
to charge people to use newly improved roads
and then the money raised from the tolls was used to pay for the upkeep of the roads.
who were sometimes more interested in making a profit than maintaining the good condition of roads for their customers. The businessmen had to get an Act of Parliament passed to build their turnpike and had to employ professional road surveyors, treasurers and reputable road engineers.
A carriage passes through the toll gate while engineers survey the road
As you can see from the illustration, the road engineers built
gates across the entrance of the roads
and then toll keepers collected tolls from people using the roads. People were charged different tolls depending on the method of transport they were using. This money was then meant to be used to maintain the roads.
Some trusts did maintain their roads and
(such as Thomas Telford) to build straighter and better roads. However, people who had always used local roads did not like suddenly having to now pay for the same route. For example, during the Rebecca Riots in Wales (1842-44) rioters dressed as women burned down toll keepers' cottages and tollgates in protest at road tolls.
out of a possible 120,000 miles were improved by Turnpikes.
and many minor roads were still in a bad condition.
Trusts began to care more about making a profit than the upkeep of road surfaces and often tried to charge
along routes to make extra money and this began to slow down people's journeys.
from roads as Britain's quickest and cheapest form of transport.
To make sure that you are clear about the changes that took place with roads look back at the diagram and then try to recreate it on a piece of paper.
As part of your revision, think about the

379,5617,"Any large-scale economic activity may have a negative impact on the natural environment. Manufacturing industries in particular can cause air, water and noise
The presence of a potentially harmful substance that can reduce quality of a natural resource, such as water, and have knock-on impacts on the environment.
. Industrial pollution can affect the environment in a number of ways:
It may damage the well-being of humans and other species - for example, it can pollute drinking-water supplies or poison plants and animals.
It may interfere with natural processes - for example, it could change local climatic conditions or destroy wildlife habitats.
It may impact on people's livelihoods - for example, pollution of the sea will hurt people who are involved in fishing and tourism.
Some governments have introduced legislation to try to cut down on avoidable pollution and to encourage industries that are more
Sustainable means using something or doing something in a way that minimises damage to the environment and which avoids using up natural resources, eg by using renewable rather than scarce resources.
. These laws need to be enforced by courts.
A recent example of courts taking action against a company for causing pollution was in 2004 when a US court ordered the oil company
to pay 2.5bn for an oil spill in 1989.
ran aground while off course. It spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil contaminating over 1,300 miles of the coast of Alaska. It is estimated that the spill killed as many as 250,000 seabirds, 3,000 sea otters, 300 seals and 22 killer whales.
The court wanted Exxon to pay to help compensate those people in Alaska whose livelihoods were hurt the worst. The 2.5bn pay out is the latest ruling in a long-running court case.

Is shoe size a discrete or continuous variable?
Shoe size is discrete, as it can only take certain values - eg, 4, 4
Is the length of someone's foot a discrete or continuous variable?
The length of someone's foot is continuous, as it can take any value - eg, 17.9cm, 22.452cm, 25cm, etc.
Number recordings are not always exact, and in some cases they may be rounded up.
When a number has been recorded to a certain accuracy - for instance, the nearest 1cm or the closest 10 - you can work out its highest and lowest possible values according to the limits of accuracy provided.
These outcomes are often referred to as an upper or lower bound.
The number of people on a bus is given as 50, correct to the nearest 10. What is the lowest and highest possible number of people on the bus?
The number 50 is correct to the nearest 10.
Looking at the number line, we can see that
is the smallest possible number closest to 50 when rounding up, and
is the largest possible number closest to 50 when rounding down.
So the lower bound is 45, and the upper bound is 54. Therefore, the number of people on the bus can be any number between 45 and 54.
The number of sweets in a jar is given as 70, correct to the nearest 5. What is the smallest and largest possible number of sweets?
The number of sweets is between 68 and 72.
Here's how you break down a question like this.
Find out what number it has been rounded to.
In this case, 70 is rounded to the
Find out the numbers on either side:
Find the smallest number. Half way between 65 and 70 is 67.5. Rounded up, that is
Find the largest number. Half way between 70 and 75 is 72.5. Rounded down, that is
Remember that the lower bound rounds up, and the upper bound rounds down.
You may find it easier to draw a number line to see how the lower and upper bounds can be found.
Can you see that 68 and 72 are the lowest and highest numbers inside the gren lines.
Mary's height is given as 162cm, correct to the nearest cm. Between which limits does Mary's height lie?
161.5 is the smallest number which rounds up to 162. 162.5 is the smallest number which rounds up to 163. Therefore, Mary's height must be below 162.5cm. (But remember that it could be 162.4999999999999... cm)
The lower limit is 161.5cm. The upper limit is 162.5cm.
This method can also be applied to problems.
The dimensions of a piece of carpet are given as 127cm x 68cm. Both lengths are correct to the nearest cm. Between what limits does the area of the carpet lie?
We can find the lower and upper limits of both the width and height. The lower limits of width and height will multiply to give the lower limit of the area. And the upper limits will give the upper limit of the area.
The smallest possible area is calculated by multiplying the smallest possible length and width together. The smallest possible area is
The largest possible area is calculated by multiplying the largest possible length and width together. The largest possible area is
, and the upper limit is 8733.75cm
In this right-angled triangle, both measurements are given correct to 1 decimal place (d.p.). What is the smallest possible area of the triangle?
You need to find the lower limits for both measurements, 2.35 and 3.65, and put them into the formula for the area of a triangle. So
Area = 1/2  base  height

may have one theme or many. Understanding the themes makes the text more than 'just' a text. It becomes something more significant because we're encouraged to think more deeply about the story - about how it connects to real-life issues, and about what it might mean to us.
The boys try to construct a civilisation on the island; but it breaks down in blood and terror because the boys are suffering from the terrible disease of being human.
A central, unifying idea that runs through a text or performance.
is that of things breaking down. This is shown in a number of ways. Violence replaces peace, friends turn into enemies, life ends in savage death. Everything degenerates.
The boys are on the island because the plane that was evacuating them from Britain during a fictional nuclear war was attacked. Piggy reminds Ralph:
""Didn't you hear what the pilot said? About the atom bomb? They're all dead.""
Ralph is proud of his father - a commander in the Navy. So, the

who tries hardest to keep peace comes from a home that revolved around war.
We know that the civilisation from which they were trying to escape is being destroyed. When Roger stops himself throwing stones at the littluns, we're told:
""Roger's arm was conditioned by a civilisation that knew nothing of him and was in ruins.""
The dead parachutist who lands on the island was gunned down during an overhead battle.
Ironically, the naval officer who comes to their rescue is himself involved in the war. The boys may have been saved from life on the island, but what sort of life are they going back to?
Violence is always present. It starts as a game, but grows more horrific throughout the novel. For example:
When he first finds out Piggy's name,
""Ralph danced out into the hot air of the beach and then returned as a fighter-plane, with wings swept back, and machine-gunned Piggy.""
When the first pig is killed, Jack boasts,
""Kill the pig. Cut her throat. Bash her in.""
The boys become like wild and savage animals: when Jack hunts a pig he is
; Ralph becomes like a hunted animal, not a boy, at the end:
""He raised his spear, snarled a little, and waited.""
The murder of Simon is particularly horrific because it involves
the other boys - they get caught up in the frenzied chant:
""The crowd ... leapt onto the beast, screamed, struck, bit, tore.""
All the friendships and good relationships on the island break down, either through bullying and violence or death.
Ralph and Jack seem to be friends at the start, yet Ralph knows Jack is hurt when he is not elected chief. This rivalry for power is at the root of some of the violence.
Ralph finds it hard even at an early stage to get things done. He and Simon are left to build the third shelter by themselves, because everyone else is too busy having fun. The community spirit of the assemblies is hard to maintain.
Even the littluns' games involve violence and broken friendships. Once Roger watches them playing:
""Percival had gone off, crying, and Johnny was left in triumphant possession of the castles.""
As pressure builds, the boys find that they have to take sides. When Jack defies Ralph and goes off alone, he challenges,
""Anyone who wants to hunt when I do can come too.""
He ignores Ralph's effort to make peace.
Jack's tribe becomes ruled by fear. Most boys don't want to be involved, but have no option. He keeps control by intimidating them and bullying them, such as when he ties up and beats Wilfred.
Roger rules by terror too. When Samneric are captured,
""Roger advanced upon them as one wielding a nameless authority.""
The island is first seen as like paradise, too good to be true. Ralph thinks:
""Here at last was the imagined but never fully realised place leaping into real life""
However, the island is soon found to contain many dangers. For example, coconuts fall from the trees and just miss injuring Roger, the sun burns them, and the isolation is a curse.
Ralph reflects at the end that the island once had a
All this echoes the Bible story of the Fall of Man, when Adam and Eve were cast out of Paradise as a punishment for disobeying God. The island becomes a burnt wasteland, as if as a punishment for all the violence committed by the boys.
The language used by the boys progressively degenerates.

many Greek ideas about medicine. These factors slowed down their progress, but they continued to explore new ideas about the causes and prevention of disease.
Roman doctors learned a lot about the human body as they tended gladiators wounded in the amphitheatres. However, dissection of humans was forbidden in the Roman empire, so Roman anatomists such as
to further their knowledge. Galen recommended dissecting monkeys that walked on two legs, like men.
Galen as depicted in a book by the 16th-century French surgeon Ambroise Par
He did manage to work a little with the human body, and described how he had
to dissect when he found a hanged criminal, and when a flood washed some bodies out of a cemetery. Despite this, he made various errors in his analysis of how bodies work.
Galen's books show a good knowledge of bone structure. He also studied the lungs, the muscles, the heart and blood and the nervous system. He conducted experiments on pigs, and when he cut the spinal cord in different places he realised how the

Galen accepted the Greek theory of the

as the cause of disease. However, the Romans did not continue the Greeks' investigations into disease and rejected Greek ideas, so Roman knowledge of disease did
Roman ideas about disease were muddled. For example:
Crinas of Massilia thought illness was caused by the stars (astrology).
Varro blamed creatures too tiny to be seen.
Columella blamed poisonous vapours in the swamps.
All these ideas survived until the 19th century.
Galen based most of his information about anatomy on what he saw when he dissected the bodies of animals. This led him to make mistakes. Some of his errors were:
He thought that muscles attach to the bone in the same way in humans and in dogs.
He thought that blood was created in the liver. He realised that it flowed round the body, but said it was burned up as fuel for the muscles.
He thought he saw holes through the septum, which allowed the blood to flow from one side of the heart to the other.
He made mistakes about the blood vessels in the brain.
He thought the human jaw-bone was made up of two bones, like a dog's.
He was mistaken about the shape of the human liver.

Diabetes  risk and benefit (Ideas about science)
Weighing up the consequences - higher only
Everyone has to make choices about whether to accept the risks associated with some activities. We accept risk every day. Crossing a busy street involves a risk of being knocked over by a car. We accept this risk because we know that this event is very unlikely to happen. But we also know that if it did happen the result could be very serious.
To decide whether we should accept a risk, we need to consider:
what is the chance of the event occurring
what are the consequences to us if the event does occur
With reference to diabetes, each person must make a decision about the diet they eat based on:
the chance of their getting diabetes if they eat poorly or are obese

388,4008,"Sometimes, rather than rounding off to the nearest whole number, you might need to be a little more accurate. You might need to include some of the digits after the decimal point.
In these cases, we can round off the number up to a certain number of decimal places.
Do not confuse this with rounding off using significant figures (intermediate), as this is slightly different!
The same rules for rounding up apply here:
Write 2.6470588 to 2 decimal places (dp).
? You needed to round up. We want 2 decimal places.
decimal digit is 4. So the number lies between 2.64 and 2.65
The next digit is 7, so we have to round up. So the answer is
, giving your answer correct to one decimal place.
We need one decimal place. That means one number after the decimal point. The 1
number after the decimal point is 8.
This means the answer lies between 7.8 and 7.9
The next digit is 7. This means we have to round up.
Round off the number 3.9762645 to 1 dp.
The number lies between 3.9 and 4.0. The 7 after the 9 means you have to round up. So the answer is
Learn about the dark side of numbers!
Make sure your maths skills add up.

Sometimes the instructions on the reading exam are in English - but be careful,they may not be as straightforward as they seem!
Read each situation carefully and think about what you actually need to know.

Don't panic if you don't know what a word means. Look through all the choices and eliminate the ones you know aren't the right answer.
Be careful! Sometimes the question tries to mislead you by offering you information you don't need.

392,6329,"Account for the emergence of NICRA in 1967?
Teacher's notes: This question is worth 6 marks in the exam. Give yourself 7 - 8 minutes to answer it.
Mark Scheme: In History you are marked by levels. The higher the level the more marks you get and so the higher grade you will achieve.
The answer will provide few reasons for the emergence of NICRA with no real explanations offered.
The answer will provide more reasons with some explanations offered.
The answer will provide a number of reasons with detailed explanations.
NICRA was set up because of events in the USA where Martin Luther King Jr. was leading a similar campaign in America in the 1960s. At the same time discrimination in Northern Ireland was still continuing. NICRA campaigned for ""One Man, One Vote"".
John would get a level 1 for this answer. The candidate only touches on the influence of the USA and events in Northern Ireland. The candidate does not develop the two points to answer the question fully and directly.
NICRA emerged due to a number of events and influences. A major factor in its emergence was the impact of the 1947 Education Act. This made Catholics more confident in the 1960s to demand civil rights. A further influence was the establishment of the Campaign for Social Justice in 1964. This organisation highlighted the forms of discrimination that existed in Northern Ireland by the mid 1960s. This helped bring about the establishment of NICRA in 1967.
A final factor to explain the emergence of NICRA was Labour's victory in the 1964 General Election.
Paul would get a level 2 for this answer. The candidate makes two valid points in the first paragraph. However other important factors are omitted and he does not explain the last point in the second paragraph.
The emergence of NICRA can be explained by a number of events, both within Northern Ireland and outside of Northern Ireland. The 1947 Education Act helped to create a larger professional and educated Catholic class in Northern Ireland. It was more assertive and confident in demanding civil rights for all by the mid 1960s.
Also within Northern Ireland there was the Campaign for Social Justice that was set up in 1964. This organisation acted as a forerunner for the emergence of NICRA in 1967.
Furthermore within Northern Ireland by the mid 1960s, members of a number of political parties, as well as labour and republican groups were working to establish a civil rights movement. They felt that O'Neill's government had done little to address grievances in voting, housing, policing and employment.
Outside of Northern Ireland there were other influences. The 1960s witnessed the emergence of a civil rights movement in the USA. It was having some success and this inspired a similar movement in Northern Ireland.
Also in 1964 a Labour government was elected in Britain. Labour was seen as being more sympathetic to the nationalist cause. This may have raised the expectations of Catholics into believing that a protest group campaigning for civil rights might succeed. A year later over 100 MPs in Britain formed the Campaign for Democracy in Ulster. This further raised the expectations of Catholics and influenced the establishment of NICRA.
Michael would get a level 3 for this answer. This response is very direct and extremely comprehensive. The candidate is aware of all the important factors that account for the emergence of NICRA.

393,6205,"The elements in group 0 are called the noble gases. They belong to the right-hand column in the periodic table. The noble gases are all chemically unreactive which means they are
The noble gases have the following properties in common:
they exist as single atoms (they are monatomic)
The main uses of the noble gases
Used in balloons and airships. It is much less dense than air, so balloons filled with it float upwards.
Used in advertising signs. It glows when electricity is passed through it, and different coloured 'neon lights' can be made by coating the inside of the glass tubing with other chemicals.
Used in light bulbs. The very thin metal filament inside the bulb would react with oxygen and burn away if the bulb were filled with air instead of argon. As argon is unreactive, it stops the filament burning away.

394,3582,"This Revision Bite is about how people communicate with each other in a business setting.
It will help you understand why communication is such an important issue and examines various methods of getting a message across in different situations.
Communicating means passing on information, or receiving it from somebody else. Imagine the problems that could occur if this is not done carefully. Here are some examples of what might go wrong:
Delivering the wrong items to a customer.
Delivering correspondence on the wrong date or to the wrong address.
Management using incorrect data when making decisions.

399,4312,"The development of steam power was crucial to the Industrial Revolution because it was the main source of power that operated the machinery used in industry.
The developments in equipment helped to increase production, formed the basis of railway transport and introduced new machinery for agriculture.
The Industrial Revolution would not have happened without the steam engine.
in 1696, as many books claim. Saverys engine filled a cylinder with steam, and then cooled it, thereby condensing it. This created a vacuum that sucked up water from the mine.
first used in a mine in Dudley in 1712. He used the vacuum created by condensing the steam to power a piston. The piston was attached to pump rods, which worked a pump to pump out the mines.
took the steam engine and developed it further. The improvements he made created the machine that became the basis of all the power in the Industrial Revolution. Watts inventions included:
cooled the steam by exhausting it into a separate chamber
. The cylinder could, therefore, always be kept hot and the separate condenser always cool. This meant huge amounts of fuel were saved.
Turned the up-and-down motion of the piston into a rotary motion
, which allowed the steam engine to be used to power machinery and wheels.
and used steam pressure to force the piston both ways. This invention became the basis of the steam train.
Regulated the admission of steam into the cylinder
, which not only made the engines safer, but meant they could be kept at a regular speed.

404,3342,"Food additives are included in food to improve their shelf-life, appearance and flavour. Antioxidants such as ascorbic acid prevent food from going off by reacting with oxygen. Emulsifiers help oil and water to mix - for example, in mayonnaise. Active packaging meanwhile improves the quality or safety of food.
Everything in food is made from chemicals. Some of these are natural, and some are artificial. Processed foods, including vegetable oils, may have chemicals added to them. These
have different roles, including extending a products shelf-life and improving its taste and appearance.
You can find additives listed on the ingredients label. Many have E numbers to identify them. The table below describes some of these:
orange colouring for soft drinks, sweets and sauces
allows oil and water to mix to make margarine, ice-cream and salad cream
Additives with an E number have been licensed by the European Union. Some are natural, some artificial. But they have all been safety tested and passed for use.
The UK Food Standards Agency - FSA - has strict limits on the amount of colouring allowed in food. Some people have allergic reactions to certain additives, and colourings are banned from baby food.
A red dye called 'Sudan I' was banned for use in food because it was thought to be a health risk. Some of the dye had been used in chilli powder before the ban came into force, and the dye was later added in this form to some foods by mistake. Hundreds of food items had to be taken off supermarket shelves and destroyed.
Immiscible liquids do not mix together. For example, if you add oil to water, the oil floats on the surface of the water. And if you shake the two together then leave them to stand, tiny droplets of oil float upwards. They join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again. To stop the two liquids separating, we need a substance called an emulsifier.
Emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends:
a hydrophilic end - 'water-loving' - that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils; and
a hydrophobic end - 'water-hating' - that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water.
Lecithin is an emulsifier commonly used in foods. It is obtained from oil seeds and is a mixture of different substances. A molecular model of one of these substances is seen in the diagram.
The hydrophilic 'head' dissolves in the water and the hydrophobic 'tail' dissolves in the oil. In this way, the water and oil droplets become unable to separate out. The mixture formed is called an emulsion.
Mayonnaise and emulsion paints are emulsions, but there are others - such as the two in the table.
bacteria and fungi grow on or in the food
chemical reactions take place in the food, such as fats reacting with oxygen to make rancid products
Modern packaging is designed to control or prevent reactions in food that make it go off. Such packaging includes:
cans that will cool down or heat up their contents
Ascorbic acid - vitamin C - is an antioxidant that is found naturally in foods such as citrus fruits, green peppers, green, leafy vegetables, such as cabbage, and potatoes. As E300, it may be added to food such as meat pies and salad cream.
Bacteria and fungi are living organisms. They need water and oxygen (as well as the food itself) to grow and reproduce. If one or both of these is taken away, the microbes are unable to survive and the food will last longer.
Active packaging improves the quality or safety of the food it contains.
Oxygen can be restricted by packaging the food in plastic, or sealing it in an air-tight container. However, the food itself contains some oxygen, and microbes can still survive in it. The air in modern packaging is often replaced by gases such as nitrogen. This restricts the amount of oxygen available so that microbes cannot grow and reproduce.
There are other benefits to this method:
fats in the food cannot react with oxygen to produce substances with rancid smells and flavours
substances in sliced fruit and vegetables cannot oxidise and turn the food brown
crisps and other easily damaged foods are protected from being crushed
Water can be removed by drying the food. Modern freeze-drying methods allow many food items to be dried so that they last longer. Freeze drying is popular for instant drinks, packet soups and fruit pieces in breakfast cereals.

407,2826,"Compare your answer with the hints below:
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Both poems are about water when it is dangerous. Clarke describes a near-drowning while Heaney describes the savage sea in a storm.
In Clarke's poem the water seems to subtly hide its dangers (e.g. satiny mud blooms in cloudiness) but Heaney recognises its force and violence - the flung spray hits the very windows.
Clarke uses the image of water to question our powers of memory, whereas Heaney uses it to show the power of nature.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Like Heaney, Whitman describes a violent storm at sea.
Like Clarke, however, Whitman hints at the supernatural. His references to demoniac laughter and the savage trinity seem on the surface more threatening than the fairytale references in Clarke's poem.
We question the endings of both poems. We wonder about the dim weird forms that Whitman sees and about the lost things that Clarke imagines drowned in the lake.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Yet for Clare, the water is innocent. It is part of the beauty of summer as it supports the wildlife: marsh marigolds and water lilies, moor hens and insects. Clarke also suggests the beauty of the water (e.g. long green silk), but for her it could be hiding something potentially sinister, while for Clare it is simply the clear lake.
The sonnet form suggests Clare's love of the water, while Clarke's use of alternating stanzas and half rhyme suggests an uncertainty. She cannot be sure what is under the water; she cannot be sure of her memory.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

408,3045,"There were two types of water transport available in Britain before the 18th century - coastal shipping and navigable rivers. However, although both these methods were useful, they still had their problems, so something new was needed...
Bad weather was a risk of coastal shipping
, but ships could be affected by tides, winds and pirates.
Heavy goods such as coal and iron could only be transported by coastal shipping and not by roads.
Some rivers had to be widened and deepened for large ships
Rivers that were large enough and deep enough to link towns and cities in Britain were called navigable rivers.
The main navigable rivers in Britain were the Thames, Severn, Humber, Trent and Mersey.
rivers were widened and deepened by local communities
While coastal shipping and navigable rivers were useful, there needed to be a more effective form of transport than roads and the existing water transport. The main reasons for change were:
during winter and dry up during summer months.
did not always link the major towns
A rapidly growing population also needed a more efficient method of transport because
canals would be the next step forward
Read this Revision Bite and then attempt to write down the information that you consider to be
for revising the early problems with pre-18th century water transport.
As part of your revision, think carefully about the
the benefits were of early water transport.
coastal shipping and navigable rivers needed to change.

409,212,"The formula for the relationship between currents in a transistor is
Determine the value of the emitter current (Ie) flowing through a transistor if the base current = 0.015 amps and the collector current = 0.16 amps.
Ie = Ib + Ic = 0.015 + 0.16 = 0.175 amps
The formula for calculating a transistor's current
the amount of amplification of the input voltage - ie how much bigger the output voltage is compared to the input voltage
A transistor has a current of 0.2 amps and 0.09 amps flowing through the collector and the base respectively. Determine the value of the current gain. Note that gain has no units because it is a ratio.

410,2249,"A mountain of household and industrial rubbish
Pollution is the addition of substances to the environment that may be harmful to living organisms. Population growth and increases in the standard of living cause more waste to be produced. If this waste is not handled correctly, it leads to pollution. The most obvious form of pollution is often simply just litter on the ground, but pollution can affect the air and water too.
Most rubbish is buried in landfill sites and not all of it comprises safe materials. Even
common household items can contain toxic chemicals
such as poisonous metals. Many smoke alarms contain radioactive americium.
Industrial waste is also discharged onto the land
chemicals used to kill insects, weeds and micro-organisms that might damage crops
to improve their crops, but these can damage living things. Toxic chemicals can be washed from the land into rivers, lakes and seas.
Spilled crude oil causes a lot of harm to the environment, both sea and land
Water pollution is caused by the discharge of harmful substances into rivers, lakes and seas.
animals cannot survive in polluted water, so their presence or absence indicates the extent to which a body of water is polluted.
Some common water pollutants and their effect
kills aquatic organisms and harms human health
kill aquatic organisms and harm human health

412,5734,"In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!

Have you developed the tasks where appropriate by adding some extra information? This will make your answer more varied and interesting.
Have you stuck to the word limit - not gone under and not gone over by too many words?
Have you covered each task? It is a good idea to tick each one off when completed.
Be sure to treat each task equally as they all carry equal marks.

414,2197,". This is when a character reacts to something - it's not quite the same as a soliloquy because it's a comment on what is happening around them. However, the other characters are not aware of it and it's as if the speaker is confessing. So in Act 2, Scene 1 Iago sees Cassio take Desdemona's hand and his asides tells us he has decided to 'ensare' Cassio with 'tricks', which is exactly what he does later on.
- Othello hides away to hear Cassio talk, Iago hides to watch Roderigo's attack on Cassio and even Desdemona's body is hidden until Emilia 'draws the bed-curtain' to reveal her lying there.
- it seems completely unimportant at first, it is just a handkerchief which Desdemona has dropped. But we soon realise that Iago has been trying to get hold of it for a long time, and it is a
of loyalty, so losing it means Desdemona is unfaithful. Othello even thinks it has magical properties. This shows how Shakespeare cleverly takes an ordinary object and makes it the focus of the drama.

415,2527,"Once you have an idea of the main tasks involved in a project, break down each task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
Think about all the different things you need to do for each task, and the order they need to be done in, and add them to your overall plan. Allocate a number to each main task and give each sub-task a number or letter to show which main task it is part of, and where it is in the order. For example:
Task 3: Produce a formal letter to a newspaper explaining why animal experiments might be necessary.
Once you have an idea of the main tasks involved in a project, break down each task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
You could write this plan on paper and scan it before saving it on your computer. You could also write it straight onto the computer using a word processor, a spreadsheet, a mind mapping application or other suitable software.

Click 'Next' for some background information on this artist.
Born in 1950, Caroline graduated from the Leicester School of Art in 1969 and the Central School of Art and Design, London in 1972. Although Caroline trained as a jeweller she soon diversified into textiles and sculptural installations incorporating clothing as pieces of art which are not intended to be worn. Caroline uses garments to explore ideas about personal identity and the portrayal of hidden feelings and emotions. Her recent work concentrates not only on clothing and textiles but on the space around garments on the body and shadows.
She has been exhibited widely throughout the world. Caroline was the winner of the Jerwood Prize for Applied Arts: Textiles in 1997.
'Dress with Holes' is part of a body of work I made using shadows as an integral part.
Previous work had used the dress as a metaphor for a person, but with these works, I was using the play between object and image to refer to substantial and insubstantial elements.
Shadows of people are both part of them and separate, perhaps the outermost visual boundary of someone, giving a likeness but more usually a distortion. There are many stories, like Peter Schlemihl or Peter Pan, about people trading their shadows with the devil or otherwise becoming separated and the subsequent struggle to reunite with it.
My intention was to give the shadow equal attention to the dress. The silk of the dress was dyed a mid grey and was a lightweight, transparent fabric. Because the silk was so fine the shadow carried the details of overlaps, seams, creases. In the shadow, I painted the inside spaces of the dress on the wall behind, like the neck, cuffs and the hem, so it looks like there might be a lining to the shadow, give a sense of three-dimensions.
I was also interested in the process of completing a work in the space it would be exhibited. These pieces depend on the theatrical nature of traditional art galleries - smooth white walls, controlled lighting. I always started with the light source and worked by placing the dress to get the right shadow.

418,6792,"Fabrics usually need to be washed, bleached and dyed, before they are suitable for making into textile products. Often they need to be printed as well, using either block-printing or screen-printing techniques. Garments are assembled using various joining techniques including sewing, fusing and heat-sealing. Finishing is a process which improves the appearance, handle and performance of fabrics; while pressing is used to shape and stabilise fabrics.
Dyed cloth in a souk in Marrakesh
Before dyeing and printing the fabric is prepared by washing, bleaching and
treating cotton yarn with an alkali to improve its strength, lustre and receptivity to dye.
In industrial production fabric is dyed by continuous or batch dyeing:
, the fabric passes through a dye bath. The fabric is then squeezed between rollers to spread the dye evenly and remove excess dye. Continuous dyeing is used for colours that do not need to change too quickly with fashion.
, fabrics are produced without dye. They are then dyed to order in large batches according to the colours required. Batch dyeing is used for colours that need to change frequently with fashion.
Fabrics are printed by block or screen printing:
is done using metal or wooden blocks, one for each colour. The background shapes are cut away to leave a raised design on the block. Dye is applied and stamped onto the fabric. This is a very slow process used by specialised craft industries.
a pattern is printed onto fabric through a
a sheet of paper, celluloid, or other material in which a design has been cut, so that when ink is passed over the sheet the design is reproduced on the surface below
held in place by a screen. Each screen prints one part of the design in one colour. After printing the dyestuff must be fixed using steam or dry heat.
The graphics show three different types of screen printing.
is a slow process used by designer-makers for complicated fabric designs.
automates this process, with the fabric moved through the machine on a conveyor belt and the print repeating rapidly.
Computer Aided Design - a system which helps the user produce accurate drawings.
and roller squeegees - one roller for each colour; this is a very fast process used in the continuous printing of furnishing and clothing fabrics.
two fabrics together produces an unfinished seam. Finishing the seam prevents fraying and produces a hard-wearing, neat finish.
is used to permanently join two fabrics together using an
a substance which bonds the surfaces of materials together
resin. Fusing is sometimes done by hand, sometimes by machine.
Fusing by hand is used to join Vilene to fabric to make it stable and strong. It is also used to reinforce and strengthen fabrics for garments, bags and accessories; and allows hems to be turned up without stitching.
In a factory there are two types of machine used for fusing: a flat-bed press is used to join short fabric lengths for batch production; a conveyor press is used for fusing long fabric lengths for mass production.
is used for synthetic fibres made from thermoplastics, such as polyester or nylon. Heat-sealing is used to set a material into a shape, eg pleats. It is also use to seal the seams on all-weather gear and tents to make them waterproof.
In industry a range of different sewing machines are used for stitching seams, embroidery, buttonholes etc. The main ones are listed in the table below:
Stitches, cuts and finishes seams in one process
Finishing is done to improve a product's appearance, properties and quality. It covers many different processes, some mechanical and some chemical.
Mechanical finishing uses heat, pressure and rollers to improve the appearance of the fabric.
cotton or nylon fabrics makes them fluffy and warm, with a soft
how a textile feels when touched such as soft, rough, smooth, warm or cool
. The fabrics pass through rollers with wire brushes that lift the fibres to form a
a soft surface created by brushing the fabric, aligning the ends of the fibres
is the industrial equivalent of ironing. It smoothes the fabric and improves its

Relief is the height of the ground above sea level.
is used for thermoplastic fabrics (polyester and nylon). The fabrics are set in permanent shapes or pleats.
Chemical finishing involves the application of chemical solutions or
substances (eg acrylics and urethanes) which, applied to a fabric's surface, evaporate to leave a film upon it
how a textile performs in use - eg water proof or hardwearing.
before dyeing. This makes it easier to dye pastel shades.
treated with an alkali to improve strength, lustre and receptivity to dye (of cotton)
using caustic soda. Mercerised fabrics are stronger, dye well and have improved lustre.
Wool can be given a shrink-resist finish using silicone or Teflon. This results in soft, smooth, lustrous yarns and fabrics that are machine-washable.
Cotton and viscose fabrics are given a crease-resistant finish using
'raw' plastic, especially when in semi-liquid form (Resistant materials). Substances (eg acrylics and urethanes) which, applied to a fabric's surface, evaporate to leave a film upon it (Textiles technology).

textile materials using dry heat or steam. In industry pressing can be done using specialist equipment or by hand. The main methods for pressing are outlined in the table below:
Reduces shrinkage; removes creases; makes sewing easier
Stretches and sets 3D shapes in fabrics eg at top of sleeve
Steam dolly; tunnel finisher; flat-bed press for trousers
Final pressing makes the product ready for sale
Make sure that you can explain any decorative technique you used in your coursework, such as applique, patchwork, tie-dye, batick, quilting or embroidery.These are favourite exam topics!
You may be asked about tools and equipment used for measuring, marking, cutting or sewing fabrics. Again - check your coursework notes.
You may be asked to explain the benefits of using CAM or CNC sewing machines - so make sure you can!

420,1835,"Both heating and cooling food can change its susceptibility to
microscopic (too small to see) organisms such as bacteria and viruses
, and therefore its ability to stay fresh.
Keeping foods such as dairy produce, cooked foods and raw food ingredients in a refrigerator at a temperature from 0C to 3C will slow the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, but won't stop it entirely.
Storing food in a freezer makes long-term storage possible by making bacteria dormant.
Many different types of food are quickly frozen in factories to maintain high standards of freshness and safety. Products are stored in commercial freezers at between -18C and -29C. Home freezers store products at -18C. Freezing does not kill bacteria, but will keep them
A volcano is classed as dormant when it is temporarily inactive but not fully extinct.
Cook-chilled foods can be cooked from frozen without defrosting. The downside is that cook-chilled foods have a short lifespan and have to be thoroughly reheated before eating - to at least 72C - to avoid the risk of food poisoning. Leftovers should be disposed of quickly.
In the factory, the foods are prepared by cooking them to 70C for two minutes to destroy microorganisms. Food is packaged into portions and blast-chilled. Here the temperature is instantly lowered and stored at 0C to 4C.
UHT is used for products such as ""long-life"" milk. The product is heated to a temperature of 132C to 140C for one second to destroy all bacteria. Then the food is rapidly cooled.

421,5167,"Most iron is converted into steel - an alloy - before being used. Compared to iron, steel is:
Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.

425,5878,"Club dance music of the late 20th and 21st centuries has many different forms, including drum and bass, hip-hop, garage, R and B, trip-hop, house, rave, techno, ambient and europop. You won't have to know all the differences between these styles, but you will need to be able to pick out the main musical elements and comment on the use of technology in GCSE questions.
Club dance music always makes use of technology. In particular :
: where a pattern, usually in the bass or drum part, is repeated constantly.
: where a voice or a sound clip has been processed by a computer to distort it.
, an echo effect on the voice, and
, where the voice is given a synthesised effect.
: a DJ technique where the hand is put on the vinyl disc and moved backwards and forwards on the turntable.
: This is a process on the computer where fast notes are automatically put into time by shifting the note to the nearest (usually) semiquaver. The effect of this is that the music is always completely in time with the beat.
: Where each part of the music (bass, drums, main vocal etc.) is recorded on its own track. It means, for example, that a singer can perform the main vocal and later perform the backing vocal as well (overdubbing).

427,7341,"When there is a chemical reaction, air pollutants are produced. You can understand how these pollutants are formed by looking at what happens to atoms during these chemical reactions.
A compound is a substance formed by the chemical union (involving bond formation) of two or more elements.
tells you how many atoms of each element the molecule contains. The table below shows the formulae of some compounds, together with the number of atoms of each element in each molecule and a diagram of each molecule.
The table shows the formulae of some compounds, with the number of atoms of each element in the molecule.
A small (subscript) number after a symbol tells you how many atoms of that particular element are in the molecule. If there is only one atom of an element in a molecule, we do not write the number 1 after the symbol. For example, the water molecule H
O has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

428,5674,"When chemicals react with each other, different chemicals are made. One of the best ways to describe what is happening is by writing a chemical equation.
A chemical equation tells you which chemicals reacted together (the
) and the new chemicals that were made in the reaction (the
The simplest equation is a word equation. For example:
A symbol equation gives more information about what is happening in the reaction:
Each of the reactants and products is shown as a formula. This formula shows how many atoms of each element are present.
The formula for sodium is Na - the same as its symbol.
, because the halogens exist as molecules of two atoms (
Each of the Group 1 halides has a formula with one symbol for the metal and one for the halogen. So, for sodium chloride the formula is NaCl.
The numbers in front of the formulae are there to
the equation. This gives the same number of atoms of each element on each side of the equation.
For the exam you will be expected to know the following formulae:
Halides of Group 1 metals - for example:

431,168,"In your work you need to show how different events fit together. This means you should know the basic storyline and what other parts of the plot are relevant to your task. If your task is about a particular scene, you should know what has already happened and what happens after the scene. Imagine you are looking at Act 2, Scene 1 (which finishes with Macbeth killing Duncan). You would probably want to include details from the plot like:
How Macbeth and his wife have secretly agreed to kill Duncan
How trouble is predicted at the start of the act (with Banquo saying he can't sleep and having 'cursed thoughts')
How Macbeth greets Banquo as a 'friend' when he is really a traitor
How Macbeth denies he has been thinking of the witches and their predictions (so we already know he is a liar)
How leaving Macbeth alone puts the focus directly on him and his thoughts
How Macbeth is relying on his wife for the signal to kill Duncan (just as he relied upon her for the courage to kill him)
How we do not see the murder, so are in the same position as Lady Macbeth - can we be sure Duncan is dead?
How the murder affects all the other characters in the play

433,5959,"Calculating the number of sides in a regular polygon, given the interior angle
We already know the following facts about polygons:
The interior and exterior angles add up to 180 (a straight line - eg, a + f = 180), and
The sum of the exterior angles is 360 (a + b + c + d + e = 360).
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 120. Calculate the number of sides.
The interior angles are 120, so the exterior angles are 180 - 120 = 60. The exterior angles add up to 360, so if we divide 360 by 60 we find there are 6 exterior angles. Therefore, there are
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 150. Calculate the number of sides.
If not, remember that the exterior angles are each 30 (180 - 150).
360  30 = 12, so there are 12 exterior angles, and 12 sides.

Pip is both the hero and narrator of the story, looking back reflectively on the lessons life has taught him. He is critical of the mistakes made by his younger self.
Dickens starts with Pip weeping for his dead family in the churchyard, establishing him as an orphan for whom we feel sorry and protective.
Pip is a good person. He steals a file and food for the convict, but feels guilty about it. He helps Herbert Pocket to get a job. He helps Magwitch, even though it means the end of his dreams of being a gentleman.
Pip's efforts to be a gentleman almost destroy him - he says horrible things to Biddy and is ashamed of Joe. But he maintains our sympathy because he hates himself for it.
Pip's 'training' to be a gentleman was merely learning to eat properly and wear the 'right' clothes - showing that at the time he mistakenly thought that being a 'gentleman' was about surface wealth and manners (when really it was about inner character and worth).
Two things 'save' Pip. Firstly, luck dashes his dreams. Secondly, those who love him stick by him.
In the end, Pip finds happiness in hard work, 'sufficient' income, and doing the decent thing. Pip is an autobiographical projection of Dickens himself. By 1860, Dickens' marriage had failed, and he had worries about his children, and his business. In
he tells us the conclusions of an older, wiser man with experience of setbacks - that happiness is not about being successful, but being good.
In the novel, Magwitch is a father-figure to Pip. (Remember that Dickens' own father was imprisoned.)
Although Magwitch is a convict and 'a fearful man', he is decent enough to take the blame for Pip's theft (which in those days was a hanging offence). This reflects the novel's theme that a real gentleman is not someone who has money and manners, but someone who does good.
In the churchyard where Pip begins his recollections, Magwitch - also an orphan - is first made 'aware of himself' stealing food. It is suggested to us that his poor start in life condemned him to a life as a criminal.
Because Magwitch is a criminal, Pip feels he cannot keep his money, so Magwitch's return means the end of Pip's fortune.
Although he is horrified to meet him at first, Pip comes to love Magwitch as a good and noble man. In the end, he brings the dying Magwitch happiness by telling him Estella is his daughter and that he (Pip) loves her.
Magwitch's story carries the social message of
: that poverty creates crime, and many criminals are decent people who are just unlucky.
is as much Magwitch's story as it is Pip's.
Miss Havisham is a mother-figure to Pip, but taunts and abuses him. (Remember that Dickens disliked his own mother.)
Miss Havisham is a purposefully 'unreal' character. Time has stood still for her: she wears fantastic clothing and looks like a waxwork. Many writers describe
as a 'fairy story', in which Miss Havisham plays the part of Pip's imperfect fairy god-mother.
Miss Havisham also supplies the 'silver fork' element of the novel - stories about rich people that fascinated the poor.
Miss Havisham is a connecting thread for the storyline:
She was swindled by Compeyson, which condemned his partner, Magwitch, to jail.
She adopted Magwitch's daughter, Estella, but encouraged her to break Pip's heart.
Her employment of Pip gives him his yearning to be a gentleman. But she pays for Pip to be apprenticed to a blacksmith, which is the cause of his dissatisfaction.
It is at Satis House that Pip first meets Jaggers, and it is this which leads him to guess, wrongly, that Miss Havisham is his secret
Someone that helps or supports a person or group, usually by offering financial aid.
In Chapter 38, Estella rejects not only Pip's love but also Miss Havisham's, and breaks both of their hearts.
At the end of the novel, Miss Havisham sees she has hurt Pip because she was hurt, and seeks his forgiveness.
In the end, Miss Havisham is consumed by fire (a Christian image of cleansing, as well as punishment).
Although she harms Pip, the reader forgives her because she is clearly psychologically damaged, repents of her actions and dies such a horrific death.
Her name means 'star' - which is associated with beauty and love, yet at the same time is cold, distant and unobtainable. Pip, in his desire to be a gentleman, is 'reaching for the stars', but doomed to fall short.
Perhaps Dickens associated Estella with his teenage, starlet lover Ellen Ternan (the 'ell' of Ellen is picked up in the name Estella). Did this give special vibrancy to his descriptions of Pip's yearning love?
Estella is beautiful and rich, but these are her only qualities. She is otherwise shallow and cruel.
Biddy is the opposite to Estella, who represents the shallowness of money and manners.
tells of how Pip is at first beguiled into wanting Estella, but discovers that Biddy is better.
The reader can forgive Estella because, like Miss Havisham (who trained her to hate men), she too is psychologically damaged. Also, she warns Pip from the start that she has a cold heart and will never love him. Pip's
In the final chapter, after Estella's unhappy marriage to the brutal Bentley Drummle, she tells Pip she has learned good character: ""I have been bent and broken but - I hope - into a better shape.""
On the advice of friends, and to make the book more popular, Dickens rewrote the ending to read: ""'I saw no shadow of another parting from her"" - allowing Pip and Estella to stay together.
Orlick is the irredeemably evil element in
- giving it a Gothic atmosphere of threat and foreboding.
Orlick's favourite phrases are: ""I'll be burned"" and ""I'll be jiggered (meaning 'caught on a sharp hook')"" - conjuring up violent and frightening images.
After Joe (who represents pure good) defeats Orlick in a fair fight, Orlick later creeps back and attacks Mrs Joe from behind (a cowardly and brutal act).
Orlick earns Pip's disgust when he 'dances at' (that is, makes eyes at) Biddy, which frightens her.
Throughout the story, Orlick resents and bullies Pip.
In Chapter 53, he lures Pip to the sluice-house, where he tries to kill him. This chapter is pure Victorian
A play or film characterised by exaggeratedly emotional or overdramatic scenes.
. Orlick - ""with a mouth snarling like a tiger's"" - has ceased to be a real person and become a fairytale 'villain'.
asserts that the middle-class virtues of cleanliness, kindness, hard work, temperance and gentleness make a true 'gentleman'. Some writers see Orlick as the middle-class fear of 'the masses' - dirty, cruel, lazy, drunken and violent.

by Estella, but discovers Biddy is a better choice.
is cold, ruthless and unfeeling. He washes his hands continually (like Pilate in the Bible) to try to cleanse himself of the bad things he is doing. Dickens' portrayal of Jaggers shows he saw being a lawyer as a dirty business.
demonstrates the lesson of the novel: that it is better to be friends with good people who want to be friends with you, than to idolise those who do not want to be your friend.

is a fairly two-dimensional 'bad person'. Jaggers calls him ""the Spider"". Dickens gave him the name 'Bentley' as revenge on a publisher who had cheated him.

loves the sound of his own voice and is hilariously ridiculous. He follows his dream as much as Pip, and ends up acting in a pantomime.
teaches Pip how to be a gentleman. His wife Belinda is pretty and should have married 'well', but is an incompetent housekeeper. In Chapters 22-23, Mrs Pocket and her two nurses, Flopson and Millers, introduce some slapstick comedy (mostly at the expense of the poor baby).
At the end of the novel, Pip persuades Miss Havisham to leave her money to the decent Matthew Pocket, rather than her other 'friends', who only want her money.
is Jaggers' clerk. His main comic feature is having a mouth like a letterbox, which grows wider when he is stressed. At work, he is severe and formal. At his home (which he has converted into a mock-castle), he is kind and generous, and his mouth relaxes.

437,1862,"A group of lines of poetry that make up a unit - like a paragraph in a piece of prose; a verse.
A description of one thing in terms of another - implicitly comparing the two, but without using 'as' or 'like'. 'Sea of troubles', and 'drowning in debt' are metaphors. Something that represents another thing.
for trust in real life situations. In the exercise, the person falling trusts that they will be caught by those behind them. In the minefield of personal relationships, you rely upon family and friends to 'catch' you.
The second stanza is full of colour. The jacket is canary-yellow (line 5) and becomes blackened (line 7). The child see[s] red - Armitage chose a phrase that uses colour to depict anger - and Blue murder is threatened. Yellow, red and blue are the primary colours: perhaps Armitage used these to show how vivid and 'colourful' the child's memories of the row are - it is obviously still important to him many years later.
The mother is described as the very model of a model of a mother (line 8). Does this suggest that she is a typical mother figure (as if like a child's model toy, reproduced in a factory) or a more-than-perfect mother (model as an adjective can mean 'ideally perfect')? Either way, she makes the wrong assumption about how the jacket got dirty - in the child's eyes, as least.
It is midnight when the child escapes to the phone box - always a time when special things may happen! This call seems to have been a symbolic attempt to get in touch with his future adult self.
The father figure (line 17) is in silhouette: the child can see his shape, but not his whole body. Does this suggest that their relationship with him is not now as 'rounded' as a result of the row? It is not definite that he is the child's actual father - only a father figure. The fact that he is waiting outside shows that he is concerned for the welfare of the child, but also that he wants to set things straight (line 17) - perhaps implying that the argument is not over yet!
The final stanza is an extended metaphor. The embrace between the child and the family is likened to putting on the yellow jacket that caused the row in the first place. Parts of the body become parts of the jacket, to show us how warm and loving the hug is. The poet does not know exactly what the jacket looks like -
""these fingers make a zip / or buckle, you say which""
(line 20), but it does not matter as
(line 23). In other words, continuity is restored, the family is whole again.
We can 'hear' some of the family row. Stanza two has many short phrases, showing tension rising in the household. Armitage uses
that the child and the mother may actually have spoken.

of farming takes place in a particular
are the dominant factors in determining which crops will grow and which animals are suited to the landscape.
Arable farming is common in the south-east where the summers are warm and the land is low, flat and fertile. The south-east also has good transport links and farms are close to markets in towns and cities such as London.
Human factors such as finance and proximity to markets are important to market gardening. It is common in East Anglia where fruit, vegetables and flowers are grown.
Hill sheep farming takes place in the north and west of Britain in highland areas such as Snowdonia and the Lake District. There are cool summers and high rainfall. The climate and steep land make these areas unsuitable for growing crops.
Dairy farming is common in the south-west and the west of England where the climate is warm and wet. There are also good transport links and good access routes to markets in these areas. The land may be flat or hilly, but not too steep.
Mixed farming is found in areas where the climate and relief suit both crops and animals. It needs to be warm, but not too wet, and the soils need to be fertile and flat. Mixed farms need good transport links and accessibility to markets.

443,581,"Huntingtons disorder is caused by a dominant
, written as H. The symptoms usually develop in middle age, and include problems with controlling your muscles and forgetfulness.
You only need to inherit one copy of the faulty allele to have Huntingtons disorder, unlike cystic fibrosis, where you need to inherit both copies. You can inherit Huntingtons disorder if one or both of your parents carry the faulty allele, because it is a
an allele that always expresses itself whether it is partnered by a recessive allele or by another like itself
You can show inheritance of the disorder using genetic diagrams.
In this example, one parent, the mother, carries one copy of the Huntingtons allele. She has the disorder. The father does not carry the Huntingtons allele, so he does not have the disorder.

When Blake published them together, he called them

Dependent on others for food and care
Peak health and fitness but no increase in height
Human gestation is around 40 weeks although infants can survive if born earlier than this. Other mammals have different gestation times depending on their size, the number of offspring and how independent they are when born. Large animals with a small number of independent offspring have the longest gestation.
When humans are born, their heads are relatively large, and their legs relatively short. Through childhood their bodies grow faster than their heads until they reach maturity. To check that development is happening at normal rates, infants regularly have their mass and head circumference measured.

448,1800,"Moniza Alvi: Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan
Moniza Alvi: Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan
Moniza Alvi was born in Lahore in Pakistan, the daughter of a Pakistani father and an English mother. She moved to Hatfield in England when she was a few months old. She didn't revisit Pakistan until after the publication of her first book of poems - 'The Country over my Shoulder' - from which this poem comes.
Presents from My Aunts...was one of the first poems I wrote. When I wrote this poem, I hadn't actually been back to Pakistan. The girl in the poem would be me at about 13. The clothes seem to stick to her in an uncomfortable way, a bit like a kind of false skin, and she thinks things aren't straightforward for her.
I found it was important to write the Pakistan poems because I was getting in touch with my background. And maybe there's a bit of a message behind the poems about something I went through, that I want to maybe open a few doors if possible.

449,1375,"Martin Parr talks about why he loves using a camera and how he decides what to take and which photos to use.
Martin Parr was born in Surrey in 1952 and is an acclaimed documentary photographer and photo-journalist.
He studied at Manchester Polytechnic and since then has used photography and film to take a critical look at mass tourism, food and the family amongst other subjects.
Martin Parr still shoots in medium-format colour but has experimented with fill-in flash and a 35mm ringflash camera.
His work can be poignant and joyful at the same time and conveys his natural curiosity:
Photography is the simplest way of articulating how I feel about the world.
I don't crop my pictures. I just move in and out with my feet. So if I want to get closer I won't change lens I'll just get nearer to the subject.
