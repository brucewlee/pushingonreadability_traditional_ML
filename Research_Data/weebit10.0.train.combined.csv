0,367,"This year, Memorial Day will be celebrated on May 28. On this holiday, we honor the American men and women who have served in past wars. A special animal cemetery in New York honors dogs that helped soldiers in wars.
Dogs helped locate people injured in wars. When specially trained dogs brought a soldier's helmet to rescue workers, they knew the soldier needed help. Dogs also carried messages and supplies during wars.
The Hartsdale Pet Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York, built a memorial to war dogs in 1923. Since then, the cemetery has held a special ceremony each Memorial Day to honor the dogs.

2,123,"May is Bike Safety Month. During this month, many communities will have activities to teach kids about bike safety. Events often include safety classes and helmet fittings.
Why is it important that your helmet fit well? If it does not fit, it wont protect your head. To work properly, a helmet should be straight on your head and fit snugly. If a helmet is too loose, it can slip to one side.
Riding a bike is a lot of fun, but remember that safety comes first, says Dr. Jamie Freishtat. She is a childrens doctor and a spokesperson for Safe Kids. The group works to prevent childhood injuries. Wear an approved bike helmet that fits properly every single time you get on your bike. Remember this rule: No helmet, no bike.

5,69,"How can you be ready in case of a fire at home? Learn safety tips and practice! Here are four safety tips you should know.
Smoke alarms save lives. Have an alarm inside and outside each bedroom. You should also have a smoke alarm on every level of the home. Push the test button at least once a month. That will let you know whether the alarm is working.
Fire can spread quickly. Every family needs to be prepared. How? Have a home fire escape plan. Draw the plan and talk about it. The drawing should show two ways out of each room. Those may be doors or windows. Then practice the plan twice a year. Practice during the day and at night.
Choose a safe place outside where everyone will meet. Get out and stay out! Never go back inside a burning building.
Once you are outside, dial 9-1-1 or the number for your fire department.
Why is it important to have a home fire escape plan? How might practicing it help you?

7,127,"Scientists have never seen a living giant squid. They want to learn more about this huge animal that lives deep in the ocean.
Scientists believe giant squids live about a mile down in the ocean. They live in the coldest, darkest part of the ocean.
Recently, scientists traveled in submarines to look for the giant squid. Even with the light from the submarine, they could not see the huge giant squid.
The sperm whale is the giant squid's only enemy. Scientists attached video cameras to the heads of some sperm whales with suction cups. They hoped the cameras would take pictures of giant squids swimming. The cameras filmed other types of squids, but not the giant squid. For now, the giant squid remains a mystery.
What Does a Giant Squid Look Like?
A giant squid has eight arms and two
. A tentacle is like an arm, except it is much longer.
A giant squid can be 60 feet long and weigh 1,000 pounds.
A giant squid has huge eyes, as big as a kid's head.
A giant squid has a beak that looks somewhat like a parrot's beak.
Debra Ingrao works at Mote Marine Laboratory in Florida. Last year, Debra flew to New Zealand to bring back a dead giant squid to study. She talked to
I love the ocean and want to learn more about the sea animals living in it.
What do you love most about your job?
I enjoy studying sea animals in their natural habitats. [A
is the place where an animal lives.]
Why is studying the giant squid important?
Everything we learn helps us understand the deep sea better.
Should we be afraid of the giant squid?
Its large size is scary! But giant squids don't live where people swim.
What does a giant squid's skin feel like?
The skin is very smooth and a bit slimy.
Do you want to go on a search for a living giant squid in the future?
If I got to go on a search, it would be my wildest dream come true!

11,264,"Why do some plants and animals die out?
Venice is a famous city in Italy. It is built on small islands. To get around the city, people travel by boat. Over the years, Venice has been sinking slowly into the sea. Water levels are rising and causing flooding. The city needs help to stay above water.
The government of Italy has a plan to save the city from floods. Government officials want to build a system of gates. The gates would block the seawater from flooding the city.

President Bush is excited about cars of the future. In a recent speech, he told Americans he wants our country to lead the world in building cars that do not pollute the environment.
Auto companies are currently designing cars that will not run on gasoline. They will use other fuel sources that do not pollute the environment. Those cars may be on the road by the time you are old enough to drive.

14,414,"Are you ready for a vacation thats out of this world? Officials in Russia recently announced plans to build a hotel in space.
The four-room hotel will be designed to
or fit, up to seven guests at a time. Rooms will have large windows so people can look down at Earth. The hotel will most likely open for business by 2016, according to Alexander Derechin. He works for the company that will build the space hotel.
Several other businesses are also working to put more people in space. A British airline company is building a shuttle to take visitors into space. It expects the aircraft to be completed by 2012.
That and other shuttles will keep the space hotel busy, says Derechin. Spaceships [for the public] are being built around the world, he says. They will need to fly somewhere.
Theres no hotel in the world like this one!

Like other carnivores, this dinosaur had sharp claws and could move fast. At the same time, it had teeth shaped for eating leaves, and a long neck to reach tall trees.
The fossils are an important discovery, say scientists. They hope it will help them understand how the dinosaurs changed from a diet of meat to one of plants.

About 5,300 years ago, a man walked along a mountain path. He stopped to rest and set down his copper ax. The man died there. In time, his body froze in the mountain's ice and snow. Now, scientists are trying to solve the mysteries this frozen man left behind.
In 1991, two climbers discovered a frozen body in the tztal (OETS-tahl) Mountains in Italy. Italy is a country in Europe. Scientists learned that the body was of a man who lived about 5,300 years ago. The ice had preserved his body, making it a
or warmed, the body so they could study the man's remains.
Scientists have nicknamed the mummy tzi, after the mountains where he was found. They have studied tzi's hair, teeth, skin, and clothes. So far, scientists have learned that tzi was probably a shepherd. He was wearing a grass cape, goatskin leggings, a bearskin cap, and fur-lined shoes. A
or guess, is that tzi was leading his herd of animals over the mountains when he died.
When he is not being studied, tzi is kept in a special freezer in a museum in Italy. His body is kept frozen so it does not
or rot. tzi's remains are helping scientists learn how much the world has changed in 5,300 years.

18,789,"Iraq is a country in the Middle East.
This October, U.S. soldiers from the Fort Lewis army base in Washington state had a chance to be kids for a day. They headed to nearby Boze Elementary School. There they spent the day with some second and third graders.
for the rest of the school year. Pen pals are friends who keep in touch by writing letters.
A few days after meeting their new pen pals, the soldiers left for Iraq. That is a country in a part of Asia called the Middle East.
The soldiers from Fort Lewis are part of the 140,000 U.S. troops serving in Iraq. They are working to help bring
to that country. A democracy is a type of government in which people choose their leader. The United States is a democracy.
Iraq's previous leader, Saddam Hussein, was a
. A dictator is a ruler who has complete control over the country. Saddam ruled Iraq from 1979 until 2003.
With the help of teachers, students will send letters to the Fort Lewis soldiers in Iraq once a month. They will also send care packages for the holidays.
""We wanted to support our troops,"" teacher's aide Bev McDonald told
. ""The pen pal project will give the soldiers something to look forward to.""
Language: Most of the people in Iraq are Arabs. They speak Arabic, the official language of Iraq. A smaller group of people in Iraq are Kurds. Most Kurds speak Kurdish.
Is it important for people to be able to choose their country's leader? Why or why not?

19,788,"Trained rats may soon be used to find survivors who are trapped after disasters.
Meet the soon-to-be members of rescue teams--rats! Scientists are training the rodents to help find people who are buried in buildings after earthquakes and other disasters.
Rats have a strong sense of smell, which can help them sniff out people. The rodents are also tiny enough to crawl just about anywhere. They can get into places that are too small for people and other animals, such as dogs.
Scientists trained the rats to search for the scent of people. They attached tiny electronic devices to the brain of each rat. Signals from the rat's brain are sent to a radio that is strapped to the animal's back. Rescue teams will be able to track the signals and follow the rat's path.

20,627,"How hard will the flu hit this season? U.S. health officials aren't sure, but they fear the number of cases may be higher than usual.
There has been a shortage of flu
this year. A flu vaccine is a substance that helps fight the flu. Most people get the vaccine in the form of flu shots. Others get it in the form of nose sprays.
This year, only two companies made flu vaccine for the United States. One of the two companies found that its supply, which was being made in England, was damaged. That company was supposed to provide the United States with half of the 100 million doses of flu vaccine expected.
. A virus is a tiny organism that makes people sick when it invades cells in the body and multiplies.
Flu season typically runs from November through March. Fever, a cough, a headache, and muscle aches are among the flu's many signs, or
There isn't a cure for the flu. Yet health officials say that the flu vaccine can help keep people from catching the bug. Scientists have to create a new flu vaccine each year. That is because the
, or type, of flu virus changes from year to year.
Due to the shortage of flu vaccine, the people at highest risk will get a flu shot first.
Because of the shortage, the people at highest risk will get the vaccine first. That group includes adults 65 and over, kids 6 to 23 months, and people with serious medical conditions. The vaccine was sent to doctors' offices that care for high-risk patients.
Despite the shortage of flu vaccine, doctors say that there are ways to stay healthy. The flu spreads through the air when infected people sneeze or cough. The virus also can spread on the hands of an infected person. Here's how to stop germs from spreading:
Wash hands regularly with soap and warm water.
Use a tissue to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze. If there isn't a tissue handy, cough or sneeze into your sleeve. Using your hand may spread the germs.
Practice healthful habits, such as eating right, getting plenty of rest, and exercising.

21,120,"There's good news for manatees. For some time, manatees have been in danger of dying out. Now some scientists in Florida say the number of manatees has increased and the sea mammals should no longer be considered endangered.
Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.
Is it important to save manatees and other endangered plants and animals? Discuss in class and let us know at

Drew is not alone. More than 16 percent of U.S. school children report having been bullied, a recent survey shows. As a result, many states across the country are passing anti-bullying laws.
At least 22 states have enacted anti-bullying laws since 1999. However, many Maine law makers said those laws were not tough enough. As a result, Maine passed a new law that requires school officials to develop stricter policies to deal with bullying. Teachers must also be trained to deal with bullies.

will capture photos from Pluto. It will also gather information from objects in the Kuiper Belt, the mysterious region on the fringes of our solar system.
Very little is known about Pluto, currently the farthest planet from the sun. The tiny planet is one-sixth the size of Earth. It is more than 3 billion miles away, much too far to be seen in detail with a telescope from Earth. Pluto is the only planet that has not been explored by a spacecraftuntil now.
In late January, NASA, the U.S. space agency, launched the
spacecraft from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The space probe is now speeding toward Pluto. ""The United States of America has just made history by launching the first spacecraft to explore Pluto,"" mission expert Alan Stern said at launch time.
or scientists who study space, hope they will soon have much more information about the planet that lies on the edge of our solar system. New Horizons will fly by Pluto to take photos and study the icy planet. All the information it gathers will be beamed back to Earth.
will reach Pluto in July 2015. The 1,054-pound spacecraft will get as close as 6,200 miles from Plutos surface.
which is about the size of a grand piano, will also use its powerful cameras to capture images of Plutos moon, Charon. The probe will then zoom beyond Pluto and take pictures of the
The Kuiper Belt is a region that orbits the sun in the far reaches of the solar system. It is filled with thousands of rocky, icy objects.
Many scientists believe that objects in the Kuiper Belt are leftovers from the formation of the sun and planets about 4.6 billion years ago. Researchers hope the images will provide clues to how the solar system was created.
The nine and a half years it will take
to reach Pluto will be a long wait for scientists, but they say it will be worth it. ""This is one of the most important regions of the solar system,"" says mission expert Hal Weaver. ""It hasnt been explored yet, and
is going to be the first mission to go out there and look at it up close and personal.""

24,115,"Who gets burger bragging rights? A meaty battle is sizzling among three states over the history of the hamburger. In Texas, lawmaker Betty Brown proposed a bill declaring Athens, Texas, the home of the hamburger. Wisconsin has also jumped into the food fight. State Representative Tom Wilson argues that Seymour, Wisconsin, is the place where the famous sandwich was invented.
Not so fast, say the owners of Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut. Established in 1895, the restaurant is maintaining its claim as the burger birthplace. ""It's a well-known and established fact that New Haven is the home of the hamburger,"" says New Haven Mayor John DeStefano Jr. ""In fact, New Haven's claim to the hamburger is even supported and documented in the Library of Congress.""

25,758,"Talk about a bird's-eye view of an ostrich farm!
visited the Westcoast Ostrich Show Ranch near Cape Town, South Africa. South Africa is a country in Africa.
Ostriches are the world's biggest birds. They have plump, round bodies covered with feathers, and long, skinny necks covered with soft fluff. Male ostriches weigh up to 350 pounds and can grow up to 8 feet tall. That's a foot taller than basketball player Shaquille O'Neal!
Ostriches don't fly. Instead, they use their wings to attract mates, alert other ostriches to danger, and keep their balance. Being stuck on the ground doesn't slow ostriches down, though. They can run as fast as a car can travel--up to 50 miles an hour for about 30 minutes.
At the farm in South Africa, the ostriches roam an area of flat land almost the size of 200 football fields. The workers at the farm take care of the ostrich eggs--the biggest of all bird eggs. At almost 3 pounds, each egg is about the size of a football. Even though an ostrich egg looks fragile, it is very strong. You could put a 300-pound weight on the egg without cracking its shell. Believe it or not, even a baby elephant could sit on an ostrich egg!

Entire communities used to shut down each summer between 1930 and the early 1950s as families kept their kids indoors. Parents feared their children would be exposed to a disease called
. The disease crippled many people and sometimes caused death.
Thanks to Jonas Salk, polio has been almost wiped out worldwide. Salk was a doctor who invented a
to prevent the disease. Vaccines are shots or medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Salk's vaccine was officially declared safe on April 12, 1955. In honor of the 50th anniversary of that event, a new exhibit will open on April 12 at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. The exhibit is called ""Whatever Happened to Polio?""

The disease spreads when a virus attacks the nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain that control muscles in the arms, legs, and stomach. It can
people, causing them to lose movement in different parts of their body.
The museum's exhibit will look at the history of polio and the development of the vaccine. Included among the objects to be displayed are the leg braces worn by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who suffered from the disease.
""The introduction of a successful polio vaccine in 1955 was one of the most significant events of the 20th century,"" said museum director Brent Glass.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world, it still threatens children in Africa and Southeast Asia. The new exhibit will focus on current efforts to
, or give vaccines to, children in those places.
One of the most famous victims of polio was Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted polio and was confined to a wheelchair, although he was able to stand and take a few steps while wearing leg braces. The president declared a war on the disease. Exactly 10 years after his death, Salk's vaccine was announced officially safe.

In other words, they're kids! About 5 million U.S. kids ages 12 to 17 don't just stash their money in piggy banks or savings accounts. They invest in the stock market.
A stock market is a place to buy and sell
of stock in all kinds of companies. Owning a share of stock means you own a small piece of a company. The more shares you own, the more of a company you own.
, or use their money to buy stocks, in the stock market are called
. If a company makes money, it may pay investors
, or some of the company's profits. Another way investors make money is by selling their shares of stock at a price higher than the price they paid when they bought shares of the company's stock.
Making money in the stock market may seem easy, but it's risky. Investors can lose money when a stock's price drops.
That's why financial experts say kids should learn about a company before investing in it. One expert suggests that kids start by investing in companies that make products they use.
Eric Olson, age 17, has been investing since he was 13 years old. He says kids should ""read everything on investing--books, magazine articles, the business pages of [the] newspaper."" As kids read, investing will be easier to understand, Eric said.

28,254,"When thousands of baseball fans head to ballparks this summer, chances are theyll have trouble reciting the words to our national anthem. Two out of three Americans dont know the words to ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" according to a recent Harris Poll.
As a result, the National Anthem Project, spearheaded by music educators, is dedicated to reteaching people the words to Americas official song. A crosscountry campaign kicked off in January and is currently touring cities in the West from Los Angeles to Seattle.
The tour includes interactive exhibits and a singing contest. In each location, the singer who belts out the best version of the national anthem wins a $1,000 donation to a school music education program of his or her choice. In Richmond, Virginia, an 11-yearold boy took home the top prize.
Why dont people know the words to our countrys most famous tune? ""We see it as a consequence that music education programs are being diminished in schools,"" project spokesperson Elizabeth Lasko told
""[People who do] know the words say they learned them in school.""
or end, in Baltimore, Maryland, at Fort McHenry on September 14. That date and that place are when and where Francis Scott Key penned the poem that later became the national anthem.
According to the National Anthem Project, the song represents our countrys history and culture. Many people sing it at community events.
""We want people to know the words so they sing it together,"" says Lasko. ""If youre taught as a young person to sing it, youll always be able to sing it."" For more information on the National Anthem Project and tour cities, visit
During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote the poem that later became the national anthem.
On September 13, 1814, Key watched British ships bomb Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. The next morning, he spotted the American flag still flying over the fort. The sight inspired him to write the poem. In 1931, Congress made it the national anthem.
Here is the first verse of the four-verse song:
O say, can you see, by the dawns early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilights last
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through
     the perilous fight,
Oer the ramparts we watched, were so

29,481,"Archaeologists in northwestern England are thrilled about a rare find. The scientists recently unearthed a burial site of six Viking men and women. They discovered swords, spears, jewelry, and other artifacts.
This copper brooch belonged to one of the Vikings.
, or dug up, after a metal detector user discovered two copper brooches in the ground. The worker informed archaeologists, who believe the site dates back to the 10th century. It is one of only a few Viking cemeteries found in England.
The Vikings were pirates and warriors, known for their sea faring voyages. From the late 700s to 1100, the Vikings lived in Scandinavia. That region of Europe includes the present-day countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
Viking sailors spread fear throughout Europe. They raided and conquered coastal villages in Europe and along the Mediterranean coast. During their raids, Vikings captured slaves. They also
, or stole, treasures, such as silver and gold.
For their voyages, Viking sailors crafted swift, narrow
that could navigate the stormiest seas. The Vikings were the master shipbuilders of their time. Vikings also worked as farmers and craftspeople. Others hunted and fished.
The Vikings' claim to fame may have been their fearsome raids, but they were explorers and traders too. They were among the earliest explorers to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to North America.
The Vikings traveled to other parts of Europe, the Mediterranean, Greenland, and North America.
One of the most famous Vikings was explorer Leif Eriksson. He reached North America almost 500 years before Columbus arrived in 1492.
Longships varied in size, but many were between 60 feet and 90 feet in length.
A larger ship could carry about 50 raiders at a time.
Strong winds allowed a longship, which had one large sail, to reach speeds of up to 17 miles an hour.
Vikings used multiple oars to row the ship when there was no wind.
The front end of a longship curved upward and was adorned with a wood carving of a snake's or a dragon's head.
Over time, the Viking raiders lost their power as people learned to defend against their attacks. Today, the remains of Viking villages can be found throughout Europe and North America.
Archaeologists plan to study the burial ground in England to learn more about the life of the Vikings. Based on the objects found, they believe the site was once a Viking settlement.
Vikings were known to bury valuable items with the dead. As one historian put it, the site will allow experts to ""uncover the secrets of a time capsule more than 1,000 years old.""

To work out pressure, we need to know two things:
the area over which the force or weight works.
This is the equation for working out pressure:
A force of 20 N acted over an area of 2 m
(two square metres). What is the pressure?
Notice that the unit of pressure here is N/m
(newtons per square metre). Sometimes you will see another unit being used. This is called the
, so in the example above the pressure is 10 Pa.
Drawing pins make good use of pressure
Drawing pins have a large round end for you to push. The round end has a large area, so it applies a low pressure to your thumb. The sharp end has a very small area. The same pushing force produces a high pressure there, so it pushes into the notice board.
If you swing round on one leg of a chair, you put four times as much pressure on one point of the floor as you do if you sit properly. This is because four chair legs spread the pressure over four times more area than one chair leg can.

35,126,"> Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.
For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.
By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.
You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:
Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:
In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:
To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:
Divide both sides by 2, to give:
a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7
b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7
When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers.
For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7.
7 + 5 does equal 12, so your answer is correct.

Measures of average - Mean and modal class
Calculating the mean and modal class for grouped data is very similar to finding the mean from an ungrouped frequency table, except that you do not have all the information about the data within the groups so can only estimate the mean.
This table shows the weights of children in a class.
To estimate the mean weight, you know that 7 children are between 30kg and 40kg, but you don't know exactly how much they weigh, so assume that they all weigh 35kg (the midpoint of the group).
Do the same for all the other groups:
a) Estimate of mean = 1215  25 =
b) The modal class is the class that has the highest frequency. In this case the modal class is

Character - First, second and third person accounts
A text can be written in the first, second or third person. This is all about who is telling the story. Here is a quick summary:
means ""I"" or ""we"". The narrator of the account will be a character in the text and we will read about events from their point of view. We will also tend to relate to and sympathise with their feelings because of this.
means ""you"". It is very rare to find a story written in the second person (why not have a go at writing a piece to see how difficult it is). Parts of adverts or leaflets are addressed directly to you, however, which can be a very persuasive way of writing.
means ""he"", ""she"", ""it"" or ""they"". The narrator of the story will usually be the writer. The text may give many different characters' viewpoints. Some stories focus on one character, the hero or heroine, and we usually relate to and sympathise with them more than others.
Take a look at these three extracts. Decide which ""person"" each one is written in and check your answers to see if you are correct.
When you arrive at Oldcastle Cottage you'll receive a warm welcome. Your every need will be taken care of by your hosts.

Mr. Fogg's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste. Each pair of trousers, coat, and vest bore a number, indicating the time of year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing; and the same system was applied to the master's shoes.

I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed (crossed) the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing.

38,336,"When describing coordinates, always count from the origin.
For example, to describe the position of point A, start at the origin and move two squares in the horizontal (x) direction. Then move three squares in the vertical (y) direction.
The coordinates of point A are therefore (2, 3).

. This means that they pass through the wall of the small intestine and into our
. Once in the bloodstream, the digested food molecules are carried around the body to where they are needed.
Only small, soluble substances can pass across the wall of the small intestine. Large insoluble substances cannot pass through. Study the slideshow to check your understanding of this.
The inside wall of the small intestine needs to be
. This allows absorption to happen quickly and efficiently. If the small intestine had a thick wall and a small surface area, a lot of digested food might pass out of the body before it had a chance to be absorbed.
To get a big surface area, the inside wall of the small intestine is lined with tiny
). These stick out and give a big surface area. They also contain blood capillaries to carry away the absorbed food molecules.
Excess water is absorbed back into the body in the large intestine. What is left then is undigested food. This is stored in the

: material service to other people, eg, giving money to charities or giving time to help people who are in need.
All of these must be done because a Sikh wants to serve
and not for personal gain. So by performing sewa Sikhs serve God and the world.
A place in Gods court can only be attained if we do service to others in this world Wandering ascetics, warriors, celibates, holy men, none of them can obtain moksha without performing sewa.

41,6210,"Evidence for the Big Bang - higher
There are two key pieces of evidence for Big Bang theory. Theses are
You may have noticed that when an ambulance or police car goes past, its siren is high-pitched as it comes towards you, then becomes low-pitched as it goes away. This effect, where there is a change in frequency and wavelength, is called the Doppler effect. It happens with any wave source that moves relative to an observer.
This happens with light too. Our sun contains helium. We know this because there are black lines in the spectrum of the light from the sun, where helium has absorbed light. These lines form the absorption spectrum for helium.
When we look at the spectrum of a distant star, the absorption spectrum is there, but the pattern of lines has moved towards the red end of the spectrum, as you can see below.
This is called red shift. It is a change in frequency of the position of the lines.
Astronomers have found that the further from us a star is the more its light is red shifted. This tells us that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and that the further a galaxy is the faster it is moving away. Since we cannot assume that we have a special place in the universe this is evidence for a generally expanding universe. It suggests that everything is moving away from everything else. The Big Bang theory says that this expansion started billions of years ago with an explosion.
Scientists discovered that there are microwaves coming from every direction in space. Big Bang theory says this is energy created at the beginning of the universe, just after the Big Bang, and that has been travelling through space ever since.
A satellite called COBE has mapped the background microwave radiation of the universe as we see it. Big Bang theorists are still working on the interpretation of this evidence.
A summary of some of the evidence of the Big Bang and its interpretation
The light from other galaxies is red-shifted.
The other galaxies are moving away from us.
The further away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.
The most likely explanation is that the whole universe is expanding. This supports the theory that the start of the universe could have been from a single explosion.
The relatively uniform background radiation is the remains of energy created just after the Big Bang.

42,5959,"Calculating the number of sides in a regular polygon, given the interior angle
We already know the following facts about polygons:
The interior and exterior angles add up to 180 (a straight line - eg, a + f = 180), and
The sum of the exterior angles is 360 (a + b + c + d + e = 360).
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 120. Calculate the number of sides.
The interior angles are 120, so the exterior angles are 180 - 120 = 60. The exterior angles add up to 360, so if we divide 360 by 60 we find there are 6 exterior angles. Therefore, there are
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 150. Calculate the number of sides.
If not, remember that the exterior angles are each 30 (180 - 150).
360  30 = 12, so there are 12 exterior angles, and 12 sides.

43,2476,"will ask you to look at the relationships between the characters, their feelings or problems. You could also be asked to write about how characters are presented by Doris Lessing, the writer, or the methods she uses. Whatever you are asked to do, make sure you read the question very carefully and spend some time planning your answer.
One important thing to remember is that these questions might look very different but they often cover very similar ground. For instance, if you are going to write about the old man, you need to show how the writer presents him. Or if you are writing about the problems a character faces, you should also look at their relationships with other characters in the story.
The other thing to remember is that there are a lot of different ways to answer the same question. You do not have to include things in a fixed order.
It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters and themes.
It is also useful to include a personal reaction. This shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied someone else's ideas. For instance, you might feel sympathetic to the old man's situation, or feel he has no right to try to control Alice as he does.
In addition, try to include short quotes in your answer. The previous sections have plenty of examples, like using in a single word:
When he lets the pigeon escape he smiles 'proudly' at his granddaughter.
You can also use a short phrase, such as:
She stares, does 'not smile' and is 'wide-eyed, and pale' with 'tears shivering off her face.
Many people make the mistake of regurgitating numerous sentences, or even complete paragraphs, from the story. There is no need for this. It wastes time and does not provide a focus to your answer. Instead, look for a specific point and the exact word or words to illustrate it. Next, we will look at an example these techniques.
The old man is clearly the main focus of
. He is the first character we meet, and the one we know most about. For instance, we find out he lives with his daughter and her family, and how important his pigeons are to him.
Lessing also writes the story mainly from his point of view. For instance, we are told his thoughts, such as thinking about how his other granddaughters were 'transformed' by marriage and became 'serious young matrons' rather than girls who doted on their grandfather. In this way, the old man is shown to be rather selfish - he is thinking more about himself than the happiness of others in his family. This is most clearly shown when he asks his daughter about Alice and if they can 'keep her a bit longer'.
This is a good start - it keeps to the point and does not waste time retelling the entire story. It also includes short examples to make each point clearer.
The word 'keeping' might strike us as rather odd, because it is usually reserved for animals, not your children or grandchildren. However, Lessing draws several comparisons between particular characters and animals, in particular the pigeons. I especially liked the old man's fingers 'curling like claws into his palms', because it made me think he was becoming just like his birds. It also indicates that his quiet rage is building up as he starts to speak to Alice.
Alice seems to be the one the old man loves the most, but also despises. At times he is very rude to her, even calling her an 'impudent little bit of rubbish'. Yet it is obvious to me that he loves her deeply and can hardly bear to see her leave. For instance, he almost instantly regrets being rude to her, and starts to cry when he learns she is going to marry Steven.
Lessing seems to use contrasts like this throughout the story. For example, the behaviour of the old man and Lucy is very effectively portrayed. The old man is angry, stamps his feet and shouts like a child, while his daughter is able to humour him, and even 'croons' like one of his pigeons to calm him down.
This is only the start of the task. There is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction. It continues to treat each point fairly briefly, but manages to refer to the plot, language, relationships and themes. It also includes some of the writer's personal thoughts, giving a wide-ranging and detailed discussion of how the old man is presented in the story.

44,1375,"Martin Parr talks about why he loves using a camera and how he decides what to take and which photos to use.
Martin Parr was born in Surrey in 1952 and is an acclaimed documentary photographer and photo-journalist.
He studied at Manchester Polytechnic and since then has used photography and film to take a critical look at mass tourism, food and the family amongst other subjects.
Martin Parr still shoots in medium-format colour but has experimented with fill-in flash and a 35mm ringflash camera.
His work can be poignant and joyful at the same time and conveys his natural curiosity:
Photography is the simplest way of articulating how I feel about the world.
I don't crop my pictures. I just move in and out with my feet. So if I want to get closer I won't change lens I'll just get nearer to the subject.

45,3430,"Website designs vary from basic ones set up by users as a hobby to sophisticated designs that represent large international companies. Before designing a website, you should take a look at other websites to help you decide how your webpages should look.
You should also read the project brief carefully. Make sure you do exactly what the examiners want. There is no point in doing any more - if they say five pages, only do five pages.
Normally, on a website there is a title bar at the top, a menu on the left and then the main information appears in the big space on the right.
Stick to a simple, clear page layout
Try to avoid flashy things like sound, scrolling banners and animated text/graphics. These might look 'cool' to you, but, unless they are really suitable for the purpose and audience, they are more likely to lose you marks than earn you marks.
The examiners will be looking for a consistent house style throughout each publication you produce.
A good example of this can be seen on the BBC GCSE Bitesize website. GCSE Bitesize uses the same font, sizes and layout throughout the site. This gives a much more professional impression than constantly chopping and changing between different pages.
Ideally, you should come up with a few ideas for fonts, layouts and colour schemes and then test them on members of your target audience. Remember to include details of this testing when writing your reviews and evaluations. Always remember the publication has to appeal to your target audience!
Have consistent left-hand navigation on each page.
Don't have too much text on one page - people don't like scrolling down pages.
Break text up using bullet points, short paragraphs and tables. It's more difficult to read text on screen than it is on paper.
Keep graphics to a minimum. Graphics increase the page weight and increase the time pages take to download.
Take a look at the image below. It's a classic example of a badly designed website! Make sure you avoid using garish colours and patterned backgrounds.
Bright colours and poor quality photographs are not very attractive
Here are some important rules to stick to when writing text for a website:
Stick to a single font colour and size on your website. Try to stick to black text on a white or light-coloured background.
Arial size 12 is easy to read on websites. Try not to use a smaller sized font.
Remember the intended audience. Always test your website on users.
Do not use underlining on webpages. Users will think it is a hyperlink and get confused when it doesn't link to another website.
Keep it simple. Be consistent across the whole website.
Webpages need file names. This allows you and visitors to your website to identify each webpage.
There are several rules you need to stick to when naming webpage files.
Use correct file extension names, eg .htm .html or .shtml.
Do not use symbols, eg + & % in file names.
Do no put spaces in your file or folder name. Use either dashes (-) or underscores (_)
Name your files sensibly. Video_intro.shtml, video_movie.shtm are easier to identify than page1.shtml, page2.shtml etc.
Webpage file names should mean something to you and the user
Keep html, image, flash and other media files in separate folders.
Put images in a folder called images, put audio files in a folder called audio.
There should be an index.shtml file in the site folder.
Do not create folders that contain too many or too few files.
All screen-based publications are likely to need some images. The things to keep in mind when selecting images are:
For the current eportfolio, you are only allowed to use jpg, png, gif and tif. You may need to use a graphics package to convert the graphic to a suitable format.
If they are copyright images, you will actually lose marks for putting them in (you could email the person who holds the copyright, but this can take months to sort out).
If not, use a graphics package to re-size or crop them. Editing inside Powerpoint or a website package is likely to spoil the way the graphic appears.
Have you updated your list of sources?
Each time you add a graphic to a publication, you should update your list of sources.
Can you use some of your own graphics?
It's a good idea to create some graphics. This could be with a digital camera or by doing some original artwork on the computer.
How much memory do the graphics take up?
Remember your eportfolio has a maximum size so keep an eye on individual graphics to make sure they are not too big.
At all times, make sure the graphic is suitable for the intended audience and purpose.
Before creating a website, make sure you know the difference between relative and absolute links.
These point to where the file you want to link to is saved. For example, Jeff is saving his files on his school network. He has a file called intro.html for which the absolute link is:
Look at the image below to see the folders in which intro.html sits.
The problem with absolute links is that the examiner will not have access to your schools server. When your folder and files are copied across to the exam boards server, any absolute links will not work.
For example, Jeff hands in his folder called
to the examiner. In this folder is another folder called
. The examiner, therefore, has access to everything stored within the jeffd201 folder. Now look at the absolute link again - everything that has been handed into the examiner is in bold:
The part that is not in bold represents the school's server, which the examiner
Therefore, you must use relative hyperlinks (the part in bold) when linking your webpages together.
As you have read above, an example of a relative link in Jeff's folder is:
This hyperlink just describes where the file (intro.html) is relative to the current file  in this case, in a subfolder called webpages.
Relative links make it easier to type hyperlinks  youre less likely to make errors. Files can be moved from a local system (your school server) to another server (the examination board).
Remember that the examiner will not have access to your school server. Never refer to the server, or absolute address when you use hyperlinks.
Now look at the image below taken from the examiner's computer. Notice how Jeff's files and folders have been copied on to the exam board's server.
The absolute link for Jeff's file has now changed to:
But notice how the relative link is still the same:
It is crucial to thoroughly test your presentations and websites, as well as all the publications you produce.
First, check that all the links work. It is best to copy the website or presentation onto another device (like a memory stick or CD) and try it out away from the school network - this will show if you have used absolute hyperlinks by mistake. All the links must work before you submit your work for marking and moderation.
Secondly, test your publication with members of the target audience.
Listen carefully and improve your publication accordingly.
One good way of doing this is to prepare a checklist for the reviewer to fill in. Include questions like:
Was the information at the right level?
Finally, write the results of your tests in the review section of your eportfolio. Remember to say how well your publication meets the needs of the audience and include ideas on how it can be improved.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a computer language. HTML is used to make webpages. Many software packages such as Dreamweaver and Homesite allow you to build webpages and save them as html files.
The websites listed below offer HTML tutorials and advice for building your first website.
Practise your HTML in this online text editor with examples and tutorials.
This site is a bit patronising but is a good source of basic information
Images on websites can improve the look and style of the page. However, you must be careful to save images in the correct format.
The two main formats for web images are gif and jpg.
These are used for images that have only a few colours, such as line drawings, text and logos.
Images with few colours should be saved as a gif file
These are used for images or photographs that include details and more colours.
If you save a photo or graphic in the incorrect format, how the image looks will be affected. Look at the images below. When the fish photo is saved in a gif format, colours and details are lost.
When the bitesize graphic is saved incorrectly as a jpg, unwanted colours appear and the looks less sharp. Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Cropping allows you to select the part of the image you want to show. It's likely that you may take a photograph or find an image that is too big and you only want to use one part of the image.
To crop an image, you can use image editing software such as Word, Photoshop or Paintshop.
1. Crop this image to include only the penguin.
A penguin surrounded by a large area of pebbles and someone holding a bucket
2. Select the crop tool in a picture editing package.
3. Use the crop tool to outline the part of the image you want to keep. Adjust the size of the area to be cropped by dragging on the boxes on the selection border.

46,2529,"is not just a book about a man who creates a Monster. Mary Shelley intended her readers to learn from her tale. It contains many of her ideas on how people should behave. These were shaped by her upbringing, relationship with Shelley, and her reading of the works of many famous authors and philosophers. These ideas can be summed up in the main
The novel begins with Walton describing his own voyage of discovery, which he hopes will lead him to the North Pole. On meeting Victor, he hears of another tale of discovery, that of the secret of creating life itself.
The Monster is also on a path of self-discovery, and all three characters share a powerful desire to acquire knowledge - a desire that ultimately leads two of them to their deaths, and which very nearly kills Walton.
The Monster quite naturally seeks knowledge about where it came from and how to survive in a hostile world. Through patient
, it learns how to speak and read. But the knowledge it gains only leads it to curse its existence.
It knows that it can never be accepted in the world of man, yet craves human company and the love of the father who abandoned it. Finally, through learning of the 'sanguinary (bloody) laws of man', the Monster is taught that it can be acceptable to kill in some circumstances. This knowledge leads to the deaths of many innocent people.
Robert Walton was brought up by his uncle, and is self-taught in the art of sea-faring. This is despite his father's dying wish that his uncle forbid him from embarking on a life at sea. His determination to succeed, shown by his willingness to work ""harder than the common sailors during the day (and devote his) nights to the study of mathematics medicine... and physical sciences"", leads him to believe he can be the first to discover the sea passage to the North Pole. However, his real motivation is self-glory, fuelled by overwhelming ambition. This leads to him failing to assess the dangers of his voyage and knowingly putting the lives of his crew at risk.
Victor Frankenstein also puts others' lives at risk, as well as his own, through his ambitious pursuit of knowledge. He neglects his loving family and allows his health to suffer greatly in his obsession to discover the secret of creating life out of death.
Shelley makes it clear she believes knowledge such as this cannot lead to good. Some benefit may have come from finding a way to the North Pole, but no good is shown to come from Victor's creation of the Monster.
She shows Victor's 'success' to have severe and tragic consequences that should serve as a warning to scientists, past, present and future, that knowledge is a very dangerous thing and should only be used for the good of mankind - and certainly not personal gain.

47,5479,"Chemical synthesis is the procedure used to make useful compounds. This often involves a number of chemical reactions and other processes.
In the synthesis of any chemical compound in useful quantities, there are a number of common stages:
Choosing a reaction to make the desired product
as possible. The reaction must also be as easy to carry out as possible.
. The risk involved must be as
Working out the quantities of reactants to use
Using too much of one of the reactants would be
Carrying out the reaction using suitable apparatus, in the right conditions
. This will make the product as cheaply as possible. The correct concentrations, pressure or catalyst may be required.
Separating the product from the reaction mixture
Some of the reactants may remain, and
Measuring the yield and checking the purity of the product
product is made from how much reactant, and whether the product contains any other compounds.
