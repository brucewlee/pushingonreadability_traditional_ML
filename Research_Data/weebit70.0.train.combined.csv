2,416,". Mammals are animals that drink milk from their mothers. Whales live in oceans. There are many kinds of whales. Whales are some of the biggest animals alive.
. Krill are tiny animals that look like shrimp. The humpback opens its mouth and takes in water and krill. Grooves in the whale's throat stretch to help it hold a lot of water and food. Then it pushes the water out and eats the krill.
All whales, like blue whales, breathe air through
. A blowhole is an opening on top of a whale's head. The blowhole is closed when the whale is under the water. When the whale comes to the top, its blowhole opens. The whale breathes out, making water spray into the air. Then the whale breathes in and goes under the water again.
Killer whales breach, or jump out of the water.
. A breaching whale jumps up out of the water. Then it comes down and makes a huge splash!
No one is sure why whales breach. Some people say that they do it just for fun!

6,597,"On September 15, a runner will carry a torch into the Olympic stadium in Sydney, Australia. When the runner arrives, the 2000 Summer Olympic Games can begin!
The torch traveled for 128 days from Greece, a country in Europe. It was carried by more than 13,000 people. The torch was carried on an airplane, in a helicopter, and on a camel's back. It was even carried by a diver underwater!
The torch is special because the smoke from the torch's flame does not pollute the air. Empty fuel cans and leftover fuel will be used again.
The torch also has a built-in safety system. If the torch is turned upside down or left lying on the ground, the flame goes out.
The torch will light the Olympic flame in Sydney. The flame will burn until the Games are finished on October 1.
More than 100 countries will send their best athletes to compete in the Olympics. The United States will send at least 200 athletes to the Games.
The top three finishers in each event win a medal. First-place finishers win a gold medal, second-place finishers win a silver medal, and third-place finishers win a bronze medal.
The first Olympics took place long ago in Greece. The Olympics helped keep peace among different groups of people.

8,281,"When kids get flu shots, everyone may end up healthier. That is what a new study shows. Almost 50 farming
in Canada took part in the study. A community is a group of people living in an area.
Kids in half the communities were given flu shots. Kids in the other half were not given flu shots. No adults were given flu shots.
What did scientists learn? Fewer adults and kids in the flu shot group got the flu. The scientists say that giving flu shots to kids can protect the whole community.

13,516,"lived millions of years ago. Scientists recently discovered something new about dinosaurs.
Scientists stumbled upon strange-looking dinosaur bones in Germany.
that are unlike any they had seen before. Fossils are remains of plants and animals that lived long ago. This is what scientists found:
The fossils were from a sauropod (SAWR-uh-pahd). Sauropods were tall, plant-eating dinosaurs. The fossils were much smaller than other sauropod fossils.
The fossils were from a dinosaur that lived on an island in Germany. The dinosaur had little food to eat and little space to roam. It never grew!
Germany is a country in Europe. Why might scientists have named the dinosaur Europasaurus?
The dinosaur shrank over time to fit on the island. Scientists named their new discovery
Scientists sometimes group dinosaurs by the food they eat.

14,623,"How do bugs exchange thoughts and ideas?
If insects could talk, what might they say? I found food. Are you a relative? Watch out for danger! Of course, insects dont talk the way people do, but they do
with one another. That means they exchange information.
A bee does the waggle dance. It walks in a figure eight and shakes its body. The farther away the food, the longer the bee shakes. The direction in which it walks tells other bees the way to the food.
Honeybees get food from flowers. When a honeybee finds a field of flowers, it flies back to the hive. The bee tells the other bees where to find the food. How? It dances! The round dance shows that food is nearby. If the food is far away, the bee performs the waggle dance. That dance shows the location of the food.
Fireflies have a chemical inside their bodies. It makes light. Fireflies flash lights at one another. Each
or kind, of firefly has a different flash pattern. That helps the insects find members of their own species. The flash pattern also helps male and female fireflies find one another
Grasshoppers send messages by chirping. They often rub a back leg against a wing. That causes a vibration and makes sound. Mostly male grasshoppers make sounds. They chirp to attract females. Each species of grasshopper has its own call. Some grasshoppers make sounds to warn other males to go away.
A leaf-cutter ant carries a piece of a leaf back to its nest.
Ants give off scents to pass along messages. If an ant finds food, it goes back to its nest. The ant leaves a scent trail along the way. Other ants follow the trail to find the food. They walk with their antennae to the ground. Why? Ants smell with their antennae. Ants can also leave a special scent to warn about danger.
What are some ways that people communicate besides talking?

How do you know which foods to eat? Follow the food pyramid. Use it to make good choices. Choose more foods from groups on the pyramid with wider stripes.
The grains group gives you energy. Make sure at least half the grains you eat are whole grains. Eat brown rice, oatmeal, and popcorn. Try whole-wheat bread instead of white bread.
Color your plate with all kinds of veggies. They help your heart, eyes, skin, and teeth. Experts say to eat a rainbow of colors. Each color helps the body in a different way. Munch on carrots, corn, and broccoli.
The meat and bean group is high in protein. That helps build strong muscles. Eat fish, chicken, lima beans, and nuts.
Fruits are natures treats. They are sweet and tasty. They help your heart, eyes, skin, and teeth too. Eat a variety of colors. Try an apple or a banana. You can also mix pieces of different fruits to make a salad.
Have milk and foods made with milk. Those foods are high in calcium. Calcium builds strong bones. Foods made with milk can be high in fat. Try low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese.
Your body needs only a little oil to keep it healthy. Some foods that have oils are nuts, tuna fish, and salad dressing.
The child climbing the food pyramid is a reminder to exercise. Why might exercise be important?

The amphibians have not been seen in years. What happened to them? Nobody knows for sure. Some of the animals may be
Something that is extinct is gone completely.
Until recently, the Omaniundu reed frog had not been seen since 1979.
They are at risk of becoming extinct. Loggers cut down the forests where the animals live. They also face other dangers, including pollution and diseases.

19,158,"What is life like in the Arctic?
The Arctic is cold and windy. Snow and ice cover the ground for most of the year. The
is near the North Pole. A habitat is a place in nature where a plant or an animal normally lives. Bundle up! Meet some animals that live in the Arctic.
The harp seal lives in the water. It can also be found on the ice. The harp seal has thick fur. That helps it stay warm. The seal also has
under its skin. Blubber is fat that protects an animal from the cold.
A harp seal rests with its pup. A pup is a baby seal.
The arctic fox travels on snow and ice. It has thick, white fur in the winter. The fur acts as
(KA-muh-flahzh). It helps the animal match its surroundings. The fox uses its bushy tail as a warm cover. The fox can curl its tail around its face.
The polar bear spends much of its time on the ice. It hunts for seals through holes in the ice. The polar bear can swim too. A layer of blubber keeps the bear warm. It also has thick, white fur. The fur blends in with the snow. That helps the polar bear sneak up on seals.

They are active at night. They sleep during the day.
Many owls, bats, and snakes are nocturnal. They have special ways to find
in the dark. Prey is an animal that is hunted by another animal for food.
Owls can see well at night. They also have great hearing. The feathers on the edge of their wings are soft. That lets owls fly quietly. They can sneak up on their prey. Owls hunt mice and other small animals.
Bat: Delpho M/Photolibrary; Moth: Michael Durham/Minden Pictures
Most bats eat insects. Bats have a special way of finding food. They make high-pitched sounds. The sounds bounce off insects and return to the bats. That lets the bats know where to find the insects.
Pit vipers are snakes. They sense the heat of other animals. Their heat sensors are inside holes on their faces. The holes are called pits. They help the snakes find their prey in the dark. Pit vipers eat frogs and other small animals.
How might being nocturnal help animals survive?

Did you know that Popsicles were once called Epsicles? They were named after Frank Epperson. He invented them by accident in 1905 at the age of 11. One night, he left a drink outside in the cold. The drink had a stirring stick in it. The next day, he saw that the drink had frozen around the stick. Epperson began selling his Epsicles in 1923. At that time, they came in seven flavors.
 What name did Frank Epperson give his invention?
 What happened when he left his drink outside?
 When did he start selling his frozen treats?
 How many flavors of Epsicles did he sell?

36,293,"The Bowler family of England took a trip back in time last year. The Bowlers moved into a house that did not have electricity or a telephone. The Bowlers lived for three months as a family would live in the year 1900.
The family even had to wear clothes from the year 1900. The clothes were not comfortable. The girls wore long dresses that they often tripped on.
For fun, the Bowlers played card games. They also built a puppet theater and put on puppet shows.
TV cameras took pictures while the Bowlers lived in the old house. Those pictures were made into a TV program called
These are just a few of the rules the Bowlers had to follow while living in the 1900 house:
All meals had to be cooked using recipes from 1900. They seldom ate eggs or bananas because they were expensive.
The family had to use toothbrushes from 1900. They were made of pig and horse hair.

37,189,"You probably know that cigarette smoking makes people sick. But did you know that smoking hurts the environment?
Sometimes people drop cigarette butts on the ground. Many beaches in the United States are littered with cigarette butts. When beach cleanups are held, cigarette butts are picked up more often than any other kind of trash.
Cigarette butts can be dangerous. Cigarettes have hundreds of poisons in them. Scientists worry that the poisons could pollute the ocean water.
Cigarette butts can also harm animals. Seabirds will try to eat cigarette butts. The birds think the butts are food. The butts get stuck in the birds' stomachs and make them sick.
Every day, about 3,000 kids start smoking.
The average age a kid starts smoking is 13.
About 46 million adults in the United States smoke.
Smoking-related illnesses kill about 500,000 people each year.
Smoking one cigarette takes about seven minutes off the smoker's life.
On November 16, kids across the United States will scream their lungs out. That's when the Great American SmokeScream will happen. The kids will tell people not to smoke.
You need healthy lungs to breathe and to scream loudly. Keep your lungs healthy by not smoking. Use your healthy lungs to tell other people not to smoke.

39,197,"Some people fly airplanes into hurricanes! That is what Chad Gibson does. He is a member of a group called Hurricane Hunters.
Hurricane Hunters measure the storms wind speed and strength. Scientists use that information to predict when and where a hurricane is going to hit land.
What is it like to fly into a hurricane? There are times when you just see the clouds, says Gibson. You really cant see anything else.
Why might scientists want to predict when hurricanes will hit land?

season is here. A hurricane is a storm that forms over warm ocean water. It brings strong winds and heavy rains. The season lasts from June to November.

Hurricanes can damage trees, cars, and buildings. A hurricane's strong winds can also make ocean levels rise. That is called a
It happens when a hurricane travels over water. The strong winds push against the water. The water gets higher and higher. As the hurricane passes over land, the water pushes onto the shore. The rising water can cause flooding.
Hurricane Hunters are ready. They are a part of the U.S. Air Force Reserve. Their job is to fly airplanes into the
of a hurricane! The eye is the calm center.
Inside the storm, the hunters measure the amount of rain and the speed of the wind. Their work helps weather experts predict where the hurricane will go and how strong it will become.
The three pictures show how a hurricane forms.
 First, small storms begin over an ocean.
 Then strong winds make the storms spin around and come together.
 Soon, a hurricane forms. It spins around and around. Sometimes it moves over land and brings heavy rains and strong winds.

43,349,"November 11 is Veterans Day. On that holiday, Americans honor U.S. veterans. Veterans are men and women who have served in the military for our country.
Many cities will hold events to honor veterans. The oldest and largest celebration is held in Birmingham, Alabama, each year. Veterans from all over the country attend. Events include an awards dinner and a parade. We want to thank our veterans for their service, says event planner Bill Voigt.
Why is it important to honor our veterans?

. Put on your sea legs and join Christopher Columbus and his crew on their journey across the Atlantic Ocean.
Christopher Columbus and his crew started their trip in Spain. They had three ships: The
. Columbus and his crew were looking for a shortcut to Asia to buy gold and spices.
The trip was long. Many of the sailors thought they were lost. They were running out of food. Some of the sailors wanted to turn around. Columbus said they must be close to land because he saw birds flying in the distance.
Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division (reproduction number LC-USZ62-1784)
In late October 1492, Columbus landed on an island near the United States.
Many of the sailors were scared and tired. They knew they were lost. Columbus told his crew that they would turn around if they didn't see land soon. Thankfully, one of the ctrew members spotted land the next day!
Columbus did not find a shortcut to Asia. Instead, he landed on an island near what is now the United States. Columbus called it San Salvador. People called the Taino (TIGH-noh) lived there. The Taino lived in straw huts and fished from canoes.
Why might some people call Columbus a brave sailor?

50,512,"Hi, my name is Hannah. Meet my dad, Paul. He is a firefighter in Connecticut. We spent a day together at his firehouse.
My dad taught me that there are many important parts of a firefighter's job. Look at some things firefighters do every day.
If a fire happens, firefighters hurry to get onto the fire
An engine is a fire truck. Engines have ladders, hoses, and other tools to fight fires.
Firefighters teach people. All families should have a
. A fire escape plan shows two ways out of every room. Families should have an outside meeting place, away from danger.
Firefighters have to practice so they know what to do during a real fire. Here, my dad climbs a ladder. That helps him get used to wearing his heavy gear and tools without falling.
After a fire, firefighters take care of the engines and their gear. Firefighters put their gear away neatly so they can get dressed quickly for the next emergency.
Paul shares these important fire safety rules.
Remind a grown-up to test smoke alarms once a month.
Be sure you know and practice your family's fire escape plan.
Decide where to meet outside in case of a fire.
Know two ways out of every room.
When fire strikes, be sure to get out and stay out!

63,182,"Each fall, monarch butterflies migrate south for the winter.
The orange-and-black butterflies are on the move.
It's time for monarch butterflies to take a trip. Each fall, they
means ""to move from one place to another."" Many monarchs leave Canada and the United States to travel to Mexico. Others go to California, Texas, or Florida.
In the winter, monarchs stay close together on trees. That helps protect them from wind, rain, and cold. The trees look bright orange because they are covered with millions of butterflies!
In the spring, monarchs migrate north. On the way, female monarchs stop to lay eggs. A baby caterpillar hatches from each egg. Many of the new monarch butterflies finish the trip north.
Second graders at Arlington Elementary School in Indiana are ready for a monarch visit. That school has a garden full of milkweed plants. Monarchs can rest, eat, and lay eggs there.
The red lines on the map below show places where monarch butterflies migrate for the winter.
Milkweed is the only type of plant where female monarchs lay their eggs. ""If the milkweed disappears, so do the monarchs!"" says teacher Edie McDonnel.
for the monarchs to eat. Nectar is a sweet liquid. ""Monarchs have to stop and eat along the way,"" McDonnel says.
Why might monarch butterflies need to stay warm in the winter?

64,472,"Scientists from the United States are studying elephants in Africa. They say elephants make sounds that cannot be heard by humans. Now those scientists have found a way to study the sounds and what the sounds mean.
In a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear.
Scientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help.
Scientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled.
Scientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest.
The African elephant is the largest animal that lives on land. African elephants can weigh up to 16,000 pounds.
An elephant's trunk contains more than 40,000 muscles. The trunk is used to smell, breathe, touch, eat, drink, and bathe.
An angry or frightened elephant can run about 25 miles per hour.
Move over Backstreet Boys, something bigger is now on music store shelves. The Thai Elephant Orchestra released its first album last December. The orchestra is made up of six Asian elephants from the Thai Elephant Conservation Center. The center is located in Lampang, Thailand. Thailand is a country in Southeast Asia.
The elephants play many instruments, including drums and a xylophone. The money raised from album sales will be used to care for baby elephants. Workers will buy milk to feed elephants that have lost their mothers.

69,471,"Chaille Stovall is making a movie about the 2000 presidential election. His friend Zac Skipp is helping him. Chaille (pronounced shal-ee) is only 11 years old!
is the name of Chaille Stovall's latest movie. The movie is about the 2000 presidential election. For the movie, Chaille talked to the two main candidates. He talked to Texas Governor George W. Bush at the governor's home. Chaille also traveled with Vice President Al Gore on his campaign bus.
Chaille has been making films since he was 8 years old. Chaille's first movie was
. The movie explored what people think about boy ballet dancers. Chaille won two awards for the movie.
Chaille has also made movies about religion, how kids cope with pain, and musicians.
How did you get started making movies?
. Then people at HBO [a cable TV company] saw it, and they said they wanted to show the film.
How do you decide what your movies will be about?
I just take stuff that's a part of everyday issues.
It's mostly about the 2000 election. The movie asks why a kid should care about politics.
What was it like talking to Governor George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore?
Very surprising. George W. Bush said his daughters weren't so happy with him running in the election because they didn't want to leave their school or stay inside all the time. When I first went to speak to Al Gore in New Hampshire, he knelt down in the snow. It was sort of like he understood children. They both seemed like very nice men.
Filmmakers have their own language. Here are some words they use and their meanings.
--an actor who is hired to play a small, nonspeaking part, such as someone in a crowd
--a worker who helps move the scenery and cameras during filming
--a scene that is filmed but is not used in the movie
--a movable arm that holds a microphone over an actor's head during filming

Although coral may look like a plant, it is actually made up of tiny sea animals called polyps.
Live from Australia, its the Great Barrier Reef! Scientists are using special
known as digital skins, to monitor changes in this underwater treasure.
The sensors are devices that record changes in the ocean and send up-to-the-minute information to computers. Until now, scientists were able to monitor changes only after they had occurred. Scientists hope the new information will help them learn how to better care for coral reefs.
Coral reefs around the world are in trouble. Fishing nets and ships break off sections of the reefs and damage them. Natural disasters and pollution are also doing harm. At the same time, warmer sea temperatures cause the
Although coral may look like a plant, it is actually made up of tiny sea animals called
As polyps die, they leave behind hard shells. Other polyps grow on top of the shells. Over many years, the polyps form coral reefs.
Coral reefs play a very important role in ocean life. They supply food and shelter to thousands of different types of ocean creatures living in and around the reefs. People also depend on coral reefs for jobs, food, and medicine to treat diseases.
""Coral reefs are incredibly threatened,"" Rick MacPherson of Californias Coral Reef Alliance told
""They require, now more than ever, that people pay attention and work toward protecting them.""
The Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef in the world. It stretches 1,250 miles along the northeast coast of Australia.
What might happen if coral reefs continue to be damaged?

72,24,"Tourists can now see the Grand Canyon from a new angle. A glass walkway lets visitors step out over the canyon. The structure, which opened in March, is called the Grand Canyon Skywalk. It is shaped like a horseshoe and
or extends, 70 feet beyond the canyon's edge.
is a deep, narrow valley with steep sides. The Grand Canyon, in Arizona, was carved by the Colorado River over millions of years. Looking down from the skywalk, people can see the canyon floor 4,000 feet below.
The Hualapai (WAH-luh-pie) Indians, who live near the Grand Canyon National Park, allowed the structure to be built. Some tribe members hope the skywalk encourages tourists to visit the natural wonder. The glass walkway can hold the weight of a few hundred people, says architect Mark Johnson. Hualapai leaders and two former astronauts were the first people to set foot on the new skywalk.

73,328,"The world's largest volcano appears to be coming back to life. Scientists are keeping a close watch on it. If the volcano erupts, it could destroy nearby towns.
A giant volcano on the island of Hawaii is beginning to show signs of life, scientists say. The volcano is called
Mauna Loa is Hawaiian for ""Long Mountain."" It is the largest volcano on Earth. The volcano makes up half of the island of Hawaii. Hawaii is one of the islands that make up the state of Hawaii.
Recently, scientists have noticed changes in Mauna Loa. The top of the volcano is growing slightly. Magma is rising into the giant volcano.
is hot, liquid rock beneath Earth's surface.
The last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984. A river of
flowed from the volcano for three weeks. Lava is magma flowing out of a volcano. The lava can reach temperatures of nearly 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit. Lava can burn everything in its path.
Since 1984, many more people have moved to areas around Mauna Loa. They have built homes on the volcano's slopes. If the volcano erupts now, hot lava could destroy those homes.
For now, people should not worry too much about an eruption, experts say. ""We're at a stage where it's months to years, rather than days to weeks"" before the next eruption, said scientist Peter Cervelli. Until then, scientists will continue to keep track of changes in the volcano. They hope to give people lots of warning about future eruptions.
Mauna Loa is a shield volcano. Shield volcanoes form from lava flows. When lava cools, it hardens. The lava builds up and forms a low mountain.
Why is it important for scientists to study volcanoes?

Algae are plantlike creatures that carry out photosynthesis. Eating algae gives the slugs special materials that allow them to get energy from the sun instead of from food.
It takes only one helping of algae for the colorful critters to be able to perform photosynthesis, explains Sidney K. Pierce. He is one of the scientists who made the discovery. After eating algae once, the slugs depend on only the sun for energy. They never have to eat again, Pierce told

75,659,"Penguins waddle down a snow-covered hill. They dive into the cold waters off the Antarctic Peninsula. The peninsula is on the continent of Antarctica. That area is very cold.
Penguins called Adlies (ah-DEH-lees) are hunting for
. Krill are tiny, shrimplike animals. This year, there is less krill for the penguins to eat. Scientists say that is because very little winter sea ice formed this year. The ice holds the tiny food the krill eat.
Several million Adlie penguins once lived on the Antarctic Peninsula. By the late 1980s, their numbers decreased by half, scientist Wayne Trivelpiece told
Ice in that area once formed every winter and melted away in the summer. Trivelpiece said that recently winter ice has been ""forming only once every five to six years.""
Many scientists say the disappearing ice is caused by
. That is the slow increase in temperature around the world.
Most scientists say people are partly to blame for global warming. When people drive cars and use electricity, they burn
, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived long ago. The burning of fossil fuels gives off gases that add to the overheating of Earth.
""Our research teaches a lesson,"" said Trivelpiece. ""Even a small change in the environment can have a big effect.""
The burning of fossil fuels gives off carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide and other gases around Earth trap heat from the sun. That can cause a rise in temperature around the world. That rise is known as global warming.
How might people reduce their need for fossil fuels?

Erin was on a field trip with her class to Mount Vernon, in Virginia. Mount Vernon was once Washington's home. Today, it includes a new museum about his life.

or shows, Washington at age 19. Another shows him as a military leader at age 45. At that time, he led the American army that fought the British for our nation's
or freedom. The third statue shows Washington, at age 57, being sworn in as the first U.S. president.
or proof, from history to make the statues look real. They made a computer model of Washington using earlier statues and paintings. That helped the team show Washington at different ages. This will be the first Presidents' Day that the new statues are on display.
The statues are among the many exhibits at the new museum. Visitors can also watch a high-tech movie about Washington's life. Snow seems to fall inside the theater, and the seats shake with cannon fire. ""You feel that you are part of Washington's battles in the Revolutionary War,"" Mount Vernon education expert Ann Bay told
George Washington isn't the only famous U.S. president to come to life recently. The people who created the new museum at Mount Vernon were inspired by the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. It is located in Springfield, Illinois. The Lincoln museum is home to a ""ghost library."" There, the use of special effects makes Lincoln (18091865), the 16th president, seem to appear in the room.

77,476,"There was a time when all a backpack was used for was to carry school books and papers. But today, backpacks are being weighed down by many things, such as laptop computers, sneakers, CDs, and video games.
Many doctors warn that heavy backpacks can lead to back and neck pain. Doctors say kids should wear backpacks high up on their backs. They recommend that a kid who weighs 50 pounds should not carry more than a 5-pound backpack.

78,675,"Scientists are purring over the latest panther news. The cats are slowly making a comeback.
or very, endangered species. Fifteen years ago, only about 25 of the adult cats were left in the wild. Today, there are more than 100.
Scientists helped the panthers by starting a special breeding program. They moved eight cougars to Florida. Cougars and panthers are both types of mountain lions.
The panthers and cougars had healthy babies together. In fact, todays Florida panthers are bigger and stronger than their grandparents.

80,623,"Theres a bookworm in the White House. Its U.S. President Barack Obama. He wrote a new book for kids. The book is called
Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.
The picture book goes on sale November 16. It tells the stories of 13 important Americans, including baseball player Jackie Robinson. He was the first African American to play major-league baseball since the late 1800s.
Obama was excited to pen the book. Its a great
for me to speak to young people, he said in an interview on Sirius XM Radio. An opportunity is a chance.
The inspiring tales already have two young fansObamas daughters, Malia and Sasha. There is a drawing of them walking their dog on the cover. The girls were among the first people to review the book. I asked them to read it, [to] see what they thought, Obama says. They approved!

81,244,"Scientists are rushing to uncover and protect ruins of some very old cities. Those scientists have found lost cities in Asia and Africa that are more than 2,000 years old!
Thousands of years ago, enemy armies and natural disasters destroyed the cities of Zeugma and Herakleion (ee-RAH-klee-on). This summer, however, scientists known as archaeologists (ahr-kee-OL-uh-jists) discovered the lost cities. They found Zeugma in Turkey, a country in Asia. Other scientists found Herakleion underwater off the coast of Egypt, a country in Africa.
About 2,000 years ago, Zeugma was an important meeting place for traders and soldiers. The ruins show that some of the homes had water pipes and mosaics.
Zeugma is located near a dam on the Euphrates (yoo-FRAY-teez) River. The dam is needed to make electricity for people who live nearby. But the dam will cause the river to rise. Soon the river's water will cover part of Zeugma's ruins.
Off the coast of Egypt, divers are finding the remains of Herakleion. Herakleion was built to honor Hercules, an ancient hero.
Experts say Herakleion is at least 2,500 years old. They say an earthquake probably caused the city to sink into the Mediterranean Sea. Archaeologists have found the remains of houses, roads, temples, statues, and coins under 30 feet of water. ""It was really a lost world,"" said Franck Goddio, an archaeologist working on the site.

species, such as cats and dogs. A mammal is a warm-blooded animal that feeds its babies milk. Experts found that all the species have become heavier over time.
Some creatures owners may be partly to blame for their pets increase in size, say researchers. People may feed their animals more unhealthy foods today than they did in the past.
Other animals extra pounds, however, are harder to explain. Animals some scientists study, such as mice and rats, have also grown bigger. [Those creatures] have been getting almost the exact same type of food over the past few [years], scientist David Allison told
Experts will continue to research the animals to learn more. This study lays out a puzzle, says Allison. There may ... be other important causes of obesity that we do not usually consider.

83,340,"New NASA projects get ready to take flight.
Get ready for a birthday party thats out of this world. NASA turns 50 on October 1! The U.S. space agency has a lot to celebrate. NASA was
, or started, in 1958. Since then, the agency has
, or sent, more than 250 astronauts into space. The agency has also created robot spacecraft to explore
, or faraway, planets. There are even U.S. astronauts living and working in space on the International Space Station.
NASA officials have big plans for the next 50 years too. They plan to send humans back to the moon by 2020. U.S. astronauts first visited the moon in 1969. They stayed less than a day. This time, astronauts will live on the moon for up to six months.
NASA is designing a new spacecraft to carry the astronauts to the moon. Scientists are also redesigning the space suit. They say astronauts will need lighter suits for exploring.
Scientists hope that the moon mission will lead to an even bigger trip. NASA wants to send astronauts to Mars! The space agency has sent robot spacecraft called
to explore the Red Planet. NASA will send a new rover to Mars next fall.
Scientists want to determine whether Mars could have supported life at one time. They hope astronauts will one day be able to answer that question themselves.
Were trying to [go to Mars] as early as 2035, Jeff Hanley of NASA told
. Maybe someday in the far, far future [humans will reach] the stars.
NASAs history is a blast from the past! Read the time line to learn some important firsts in U.S. space travel and exploration.
U.S. astronaut Alan Shepard is the first American in space.
Americans become the first people to walk on the moon.
The International Space Station is under construction. It should be finished by 2010.
How would visiting Mars be different from visiting the moon? Why?

84,226,"A new glass walkway will allow visitors to step out over the Grand Canyon.
Brave visitors will soon have a birds-eye view of the Grand Canyon in Arizona. Plans are being made to build a glass walkway. It will jut out 70 feet from the canyons edge. Looking down, visitors will be able to see the Colorado River flowing 4,000 feet below.
is a deep, narrow valley with steep sides. It is cut into the earth by running water. The Grand Canyon was carved by the Colorado River over millions of years.

88,128,"The life cycle of a frog is amazing. Read below to learn more. (Note: Although many frogs have this life cycle, others do not. Some frogs don't even have tadpoles; instead their eggs hatch directly into frogs!)
A frog begins life as a tiny egg, usually in or near water.
After about 10 days, a tadpole hatches from the egg. It breathes using gills and moves like a fish.
After about five weeks, the tadpole's gills disappear, and it grows lungs.
At about 12 weeks, the young frog grows legs, and its tail disappears. It leaves the water and can live on land.

89,669,"In the future, a fly on the wall may really be a robot! Scientists in California are developing a tiny flying robot. The flying robot is so small that scientists have to pick it up with tweezers.
Scientists are modeling the robot after a fly. They say flies are amazing insects. Flies can land upside down on the ceiling. They can fly backward. Flies can even turn faster than fighter jets!
Scientists say the flying robot will have many uses. For example, a tiny camera could be placed on the robot. Soldiers could then use the robot to spy on enemy troops.

91,45,"Scientists used the satellite to count different types of animals at the Bronx Zoo.
As the tallest animals in the world, giraffes have a great view of the zoo. Scientists recently had an even better view--from 280 miles above Earth! Animals at the Bronx Zoo in New York City were tracked from outer space with a
. A satellite is a spacecraft that orbits a planet or moon.
of zoo animals and sent the images back to Earth. A species is a group of plants or animals that are alike in certain ways. Scientists studied the images to see how well the satellite could spot different species.
The Bronx Zoo is located in New York City.
So far, scientists are pleased with the results. They hope to use the satellite to track
animals in faraway places in the wild. Endangered animals are at risk of becoming
, or dying out completely. Currently, people track animals either by foot or by airplane. Scientists think that using a satellite to track animals will be both easier and cheaper.
""Taking a count is the first step in finding out if a species is in danger of extinction,"" scientist Scott Bergen told
Along with counting endangered animals, scientists want to learn where they
. When animals migrate, they move from one place to another.
Why do scientists want to learn where animals migrate? ""[We want to know where to] create national parks and other protected areas for endangered animals,"" said Bergen.
Would you want to be a scientist who studies endangered animals? Explain your answer.

93,411,"Nine giant panda cubs are born in China.
Giant pandas feast on bamboo at the Beijing Zoo in China. These animals, including the newborn panda (inset), live in captivity.
China is hosting a panda party! Nine giant panda bears were recently born in the Asian country. Most of them are pairs of twins. The cubs were born in
. That means they live in places controlled by humans rather than in the wild. These pandas live in special centers where animal experts care for them.
[The centers] provide a safe place for animals to ... raise their young, scientist Sarah Bexell told
Thats a good thing, because giant pandas need all the help they can get. The animals are
, or at risk of dying out completely. Only about 1,600 giant pandas live in the wild.
Pandas favorite food is bamboo, but they have trouble finding enough of it to eat. Almost all of the bamboo in their habitat, or home, has died off. The bamboo has died in part because people have built cities where pandas live.
People created the panda centers to help keep the giant pandas safe. One of the most famous centers is the Wolong Nature Reserve. It is in southwest China. More than 100 giant pandas have been born there since it opened in 1980.
The goal is for the young pandas to be able to live safely in the wild one day. Until then, some of the animals will continue to live in captivity. Scientists in China hope to raise more giant pandas within the next few years.
The future of captive giant pandas is [very] bright, Bexell says.
Chinas giant panda cubs arent the only baby animals making the news. Read to learn about other
Seven white lion cubs were recently born in Germany at a safari park. All of the white lions in the world live in captivity.
Hadiah is a type of hairless pig. She was born at the Houston Zoo in Texas. Little Hadiah weighed about 1 pound at birth.
More than 120 shortsnouted sea horses were recently born at an England aquarium. They will grow up to look like this one.
Why might people want to protect giant pandas?

95,730,"Adara Claphan (below) has a gift for music. Now shes sharing that gift with others. The fifth grader from Wichita, Kansas, is raising money to donate guitars to kids in Nicaragua. That is a country in Central America.
Adara began taking guitar lessons last year. Music is a part of life, she told
Recently, the music maker learned about a
called HeartStrings. A charity is an aid group. The organization raises money to send guitars to kids in countries where many people are poor, such as Nicaragua.
After hearing that, Adara came up with a plan to help. She began selling necklaces and earrings for $5 each. Before long, the student had raised enough money to donate her first guitar.
Adara hopes to send about 10 more guitars to Nicaragua. She says helping other kids feels great. Im putting music into their lives, she says.

96,626,"U.S. cities jump on the bicycle path.
A bicycle boom is headed to a city near you! More Americans than ever are hitting the road on two-wheelers.
About 1.7 million U.S. residents use bicycles as their
or main, way to get around. The number of riders has nearly doubled since 2000. That is according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The spike in bikes may be thanks to the work of U.S. cities. From San Francisco to Boston, cities are becoming more bicycle-friendly. Some towns are adding more bike lanes. That makes
easier for cyclists. To commute is to travel regularly from one place to another, such as school or work.
Officials are adding more bike lanes in Washington, D.C.
the length of traffic lights. To alter is to change. That helps riders stay safe. Longer lights give them more time to cross busy streets. The nations capital also has a bike-sharing program. Riders can borrow bicycles at one location. Then they can return them in another part of town.
U.S. officials hope the new projects mean people will use their bicycles more and their cars less. Fewer cars on the road can help cut pollution. Thats because driving cars gives off harmful gases.
Riding bicycles helps more than just the environment, though. Cycling is a great way for people to stay active and fit, explains Meghan Cahill. She is a spokesperson for the League of American Bicyclists.
Cities will continue to increase their bike-friendliness, she told
Officials realize that bicycle-friendly cities [have] healthier and happier citizens.
Take a spin around the map to learn about some U.S. cycling programs.
Note: Alaska and Hawaii are not shown.
A program in Portland donates bicycles to people who cannot afford to buy their own.
More than 30 schools in Boulder encourage students to walk or cycle to school along safe paths.
Houston has set up 345 miles of bike paths so that people can cycle to school and work.
Lawmakers are working to add more bicycle lanes in New York City and the rest of the state.
What are some other ways people commute to school or work?

97,487,"NASA wants to build an even better telescope than Hubble! It will be called the James Webb Space Telescope. James Webb was one of the people in charge of NASA.
In 2010, NASA is planning on sending the new telescope into space. A rocket will launch the telescope. It will take the rocket about three months to complete its journey.
The new telescope will be much farther from Earth than Hubble. Webb will take photos from 940,000 miles above Earth. That is about 700,000 miles farther than the moon! Scientists will use the new telescope to learn even more about the universe.

98,737,"How good are you at keeping a secret? Waldo Wilcox, 74, of Utah, kept one for more than 50 years! Until recently, people didn't know about the ancient Native American village on his land. ""I wanted to keep it the way it is,"" said Wilcox.
Since Wilcox is no longer able to care for the land, he decided it was a good time to share his secret. The state of Utah now owns the land. Officials plan to make it open to the public.
Experts say the village once belonged to the Fremont people. They lived in central and northern Utah more than 1,000 years ago.
at the site. Artifacts are objects made by people long ago. Some of the finds include arrowheads, beads, and pieces of pottery. Scientists hope the artifacts will teach them more about Fremont culture.

99,619,"On April 22, millions of people around the world will celebrate Earth Day. People are finding many ways-from inventions to projects-to help protect the environment. Look inside to find out how they are working to make a difference.
Earth Day inspires people to take action and help the environment. Many people will be spreading the message that the Earth needs to be cared for year-round.
Kids around the world will participate in Earth Day events. Some will clean up parks. Others will plant trees. What do you plan to do on Earth Day to help the environment?
One way to protect the Earth is to reduce pollution. Pollution occurs when people harm the air, land, and water. Most air pollution comes from the burning of fuels, such as oil, coal, and gas. The fuel is used to run cars and heat homes. Water and land pollution often come from chemicals and garbage.
Some Earth-friendly inventions help reduce pollution. These inventions conserve, or use fewer, energy and natural resources such as water. Take a look at some of these exciting inventions.
? An Earthship is actually not a ship at all. It is a house built to save energy and water. Earthships use solar power from the sun for heat and electricity.
Earthships are made from recycled material. Old tires, aluminum soda cans, and glass bottles are some common materials used to build Earthships.
Many people who live in Earthships also recycle their water. When it rains, they collect and filter the rainwater. The filter makes the water safe to use for drinking, washing, and cooking. The leftover water is saved for other uses, such as watering indoor plants.

100,74,"This year, no one has been able to catch Tiger Woods on the golf course. Woods set a record this year by becoming the fourth golfer in history to win the Grand Slam.
The Grand Slam is the name given to four of golf's most important tournaments: the Masters, the U.S. Open, the British Open, and the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Championship.

101,342,"What's green, wears a crown, and is a symbol of freedom? The Statue of Liberty! Over the years, millions of people have visited this statue in New York City. However, it has been closed since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Visitors have not been allowed to climb the 354 steps to the crown.
Experts say that it might be difficult for people to make their way down from the statue's crown in an emergency. The group that cares for Lady Liberty is raising money to make the statue safer so it can reopen. Officials have not said whether people will be allowed to climb above the
, or base, of the statue again.
For third grader Nina Wade that would be very sad news. She moved to New York City almost two years ago and has never climbed the statue's steps. ""I would be disappointed if it didn't reopen,"" Nina told Weekly Reader, ""but it makes me feel good to know that [officials are] taking safety measures.""

? A scavenger is an animal that feeds on dead animals.
For years, scientists have been debating that question. Now a new exhibit at the Natural History Museum in London, England, gives evidence for both sides.
""Everything says this dinosaur lived on dead meat,"" said American scientist Jack Horner. He helped the museum prepare for the exhibit.
Scientists once believed that T. rex was a fast runner. But recent studies have shown that might not be true. Horner says that
was not fast enough to catch other dinosaurs. He also says that its arms were too small to use for grabbing prey. Prey is an animal hunted by another animal for food.
means ""tyrant lizard king."" Tyrant means ""cruel ruler.""
Other scientists don't agree with Horner. They argue that
wasn't fast, they say, it could have hunted slower dinosaurs. Scientists also say that
did not need its arms to hunt. Animals without arms, such as sharks and snakes, hunt prey.
have been both a hunter and a scavenger? One museum official thinks ""the truth lies somewhere in the middle."" It is up to visitors to think like scientists and decide for themselves. What do you think?
Why is it important to study both sides of an argument?

103,728,"The Hispanic American population tops 50 million.
eres looking at you! The countrys population is becoming bigger and more
or different, than ever before. There are now more than 308 million people
or living, in the United States. Many of them come from different countries and backgrounds.
More than 50 million of those people are
Those are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. Only about 35 million Hispanic Americans lived in the United States 10 years ago.
The new numbers are from the nations
That is an official count of a countrys population. The U.S. census takes place every 10 years. U.S. officials recently announced the 2010 census results.
The Asian American population grew the fastest of all races, the count showed. That group increased by 43 percent from 2000 to 2010. There are now about 14.7 million Asian Americans in the nation.
Kids are a big reason the country is getting more diverse, officials say. Nearly half of all children [are] something other than non-Hispanic white, Stacy Vidal told
She is a spokesperson for the U.S. Census Bureau.
The census didnt just track who lives in the United States. It also showed
people live. California, New York, and Texas still have the biggest populations. About one-fourth of Americans live in those three states, the count found.
States in the South and West saw most of the population growth over the past 10 years. Nevadas population grew the fastest. It went up by 35 percent since 2000.
The census can teach us a lot about the United States, Vidal says. It paints a picture of who we are as a nation.
The United States has seen a big jump in the Hispanic American population over the past 40 years. This graph shows how that groups numbers have grown. What do you think its population will be in 2020? Why?
Why might U.S. officials want to know how many people live in the country?

105,513,"The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is located in northern Alaska. The ANWR is home to polar bears, wolves, caribou, and other animals.
In 1960, the land was made a protected area for animals and plants. But now, President George W. Bush wants to allow companies to begin drilling for oil in the ANWR.
Supporters say that the oil drilling would provide jobs for Alaskans. They also argue that the oil in the ANWR will help lower oil and gasoline prices. They say that taking oil from U.S. land is cheaper than using foreign oil.
Today, most of the oil that is used in the United States is
Opponents say the drilling would pollute the area's land, air, and water. Pollution would harm the plants that the area's animals eat to survive.
Studies by the U.S. government show there may be only a six-month supply of oil in the ANWR. Opponents believe the risk of polluting the ANWR is not worth such a small supply of oil.
Is drilling for oil in the ANWR worth the risk to plants and animals?

or clean, the air. They take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. People could not survive if the air had too much carbon dioxide or too little oxygen. The trees are also being planted because they add beauty to city neighborhoods and provide shade.
Arbor Day traces its roots to Nebraska. In 1872, J. Sterling Morton started the holiday in that state because Nebraska was almost treeless. Today, National Arbor Day is celebrated each year on the last Friday in April. This year, it takes place on April 27. Many states, however, celebrate Arbor Day on different dates based on their best tree-planting times. The holiday encourages people to plant and care for trees.
To find out when your state observes Arbor Day and whether the tree-planting project is coming to a city near you, visit
If kids help plant 100 trees in 10 cities, how many trees will be planted altogether?

This October, U.S. soldiers from the Fort Lewis army base in Washington state had a chance to be kids for a day. They headed to nearby Boze Elementary School. There they spent the day with some second and third graders.
for the rest of the school year. Pen pals are friends who keep in touch by writing letters.
A few days after meeting their new pen pals, the soldiers left for Iraq. That is a country in a part of Asia called the Middle East.
The soldiers from Fort Lewis are part of the 140,000 U.S. troops serving in Iraq. They are working to help bring
to that country. A democracy is a type of government in which people choose their leader. The United States is a democracy.
Iraq's previous leader, Saddam Hussein, was a
. A dictator is a ruler who has complete control over the country. Saddam ruled Iraq from 1979 until 2003.
With the help of teachers, students will send letters to the Fort Lewis soldiers in Iraq once a month. They will also send care packages for the holidays.
""We wanted to support our troops,"" teacher's aide Bev McDonald told
. ""The pen pal project will give the soldiers something to look forward to.""
Language: Most of the people in Iraq are Arabs. They speak Arabic, the official language of Iraq. A smaller group of people in Iraq are Kurds. Most Kurds speak Kurdish.
Is it important for people to be able to choose their country's leader? Why or why not?

112,83,"Taking those first baby steps is very excitingespecially for a robot. For years, scientists have worked to create a robot that could walk in a humanlike way. That time has finally arrived!
This February, scientists unveiled three robots that can walk like humans. The robots swing their arms for balance, as people do. The new robots require far less power than earlier versions did.
Toddler is the most advanced of the three. It learns to walk like a
, or a young child. Its balance improves with each step.

Should gray wolves be taken off the endangered species list? Why or why not?
Not all people agree with the plan to remove gray wolves from the endangered species list. They are especially worried about the recovery of gray wolves in the Northeast. ""We don't believe there are wolf packs in the Northeast,"" Peggy Struhsacker told
. She is a scientist who studies gray wolves. ""The Endangered Species Act must recover wolves back to their [original] range,"" she said. ""This has not been done. Right now, wolves only live in a small area of the country.""

Tornado in Union City, Oklahoma, May 24, 1973
season in the United States. A tornado is a powerful, spinning wind. It travels quickly and can destroy everything in its path. Tornado season, which lasts for several months, is the time these twisters are most common.
The National Weather Service recently said it will change the tornado rating system next year. The strength of a tornado will continue to be rated on a scale from 0 (weakest) to 5 (most powerful). However, the new rating system will be more exact.
Under the old system, tornadoes with wind speed of about 300 miles per hour were given the rating 5. Studies have shown that slower winds can cause as much damage. The new system rates a tornado 5 if wind speed is at least 200 miles per hour.
Adverbs are words that describe verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. They tell where, how, or when. Examples are
Circle two adverbs in the tornado story.

The Willow School in Gladstone, N.J., is made of more than just bricks. The insides of the walls include denim from blue jeans! Other parts of the building are made of wood from an old toothpick factory.
. That is a school built in a special way to save energy and resources. Green schools also provide a healthy environment for students. Some green schools have rooftop gardens to grow foods for their cafeterias. Others use special window shades to keep the buildings cool on hot days.

Representatives for the organization say they have approved about 85 green schools. About 650 more schools are waiting to be considered for green school status.

How can your school help the environment? Keep reading for some ideas.
Start a recycling program at your school. Everything in your classroom from old papers to art supplies can be recycled.
Ask your teacher if your class can plant an herb garden. The cafeteria can use the fresh herbs in school lunches.
Instead of using paper or plastic bags, pack your lunch in a container you can reuse each day. You'll throw away less trash!

The Colima (koh-LEE-mah) Volcano in Mexico has roared to life again. The 12,500-foot volcano is also called the ""Volcano of Fire."" Over the past few months, its eruptions have been larger and more frequent. It has been shooting hot gas and ash high into the sky.
The Volcano of Fire is Mexico's most
volcano. It has erupted many times over the years. What scientists are most worried about is the next big eruption. The volcano has had huge eruptions about every hundred years. The last one took place in 1913.
Scientists have noticed a pattern in recent activity that is very much like the pattern before the 1913 eruption. ""Most scientists are expecting a large, explosive eruption in the next 10 years or so,"" volcano expert Jim Luhr told
The volcano is 20 miles north of the city of Colima. To make sure no one is in danger, officials created a safety zone around the volcano. People aren't allowed in that area.
Scientists use special equipment to track changes within the volcano. ""We're looking for clues of another large, explosive eruption,"" says Luhr. ""That way, we can be prepared.""

126,101,"Hello! My name is Jasmine Padilla. I'm 8 years old and in the third grade. I live in a town called Tusayan. It is a town next to Grand Canyon National Park. My family has lived here a long time. I go to Grand Canyon School.
The Grand Canyon has very tall cliffs for walls, and it is so wide that the trees on the other side look like trees for ants! The rocks are shades of pink and brown.
My favorite time of year in the Grand Canyon is winter. I like the winter because we play in the snow and can make a snowman. I also like to play with my friends and hike. I have seen rabbits, deer, and elk. Sometimes I can hear coyotes howling.

127,700,"California has the bluesblue butterflies, that is! Scientists in the state recently released 80 Palos Verdes blue butterflies into the wild.
The experts raised the fliers because the insects are endangered. They can live only in a small area of California. That area is called the Palos Verdes
A peninsula is a stretch of land that is bordered by water on three sides.
The butterflies lay their eggs on two types of plants found on the peninsula. However, those plants have been harmed by people moving into the area.
To save the butterflies, scientists grow the insects favorite plants in parks around the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Then they release the insects into those areas each spring.
Scientist Jana Johnson hopes her work helps the blue butterflies bounce back with flying colors. We are undoing the wrongs of the past and trying to save this planet, one species at a time, she told

, Jason Segel plays Gary, a man who tries to
the Muppets to save their old theater. To reunite is to bring back together. Segel also wrote the movie, which hits theaters November 23.
student reporter Elliott Hansing recently spoke with Segel about making
Amy Adams and Jason Segel team up with the Muppets.
Elliott Hansing: Which Muppet is your favorite?
I like Fozzie Bear the best because even though he tells bad jokes, he keeps on trying.
EH: What was the hardest part of filming?
The hardest part ... was not laughing all the time. ... Those Muppets are so funny that I kept breaking character and laughing during scenes.
EH: Did anything unexpected happen while you were making the movie?
There was one day when I went to sit down on a couch ... built for Kermit. And Im much, much bigger than Kermit, [so] I fell straight through the couch and [broke] it!

Those are questions that scientists hope to answer. They recently set out around the world in search of those and other long-missing
An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Frogs, toads, and salamanders are amphibians.
Where in the world is this green frog?
The experts are looking for about 100 species. They are searching at least 14 countries on five continents. They will look for the salamander in North America. They hope to find the scarlet frog in South America. Theyre also looking for species in Africa, Asia, and Australia.
Scientists are hopeful that theyll find the amphibiansand soon! If the creatures are out there, they may need help. Many amphibians are
Something that is endangered is at risk of becoming extinct. The animals face dangers including pollution and diseases. Loggers cut down the forests where they live.
If researchers can find the missing critters, they might be able to figure out how to save them, explains expert Robin Moore. He began searching for the amphibians earlier this month.
This search will tell us a lot about how amphibians are doing, Moore told
I dont know what we will find, but that makes the search even more exciting.
Scientists hunt for missing amphibians is under way. Read about some of the species they hope to find.
This salamander is a mystery to scientists. Experts found a few of the critters more than 100 years ago, but none have been seen since.
Experts first discovered this frog in 1914 in eastern Australia. It may be extinct because of disease and habitat loss.
Scientists hope to find this spotted toad in rivers and rain forests in Ecuador. The animal faces threats including pollution and disease.
Why might scientists want to keep track of the worlds animal species?

131,456,"A new report shows more people are online than ever before.
Everyone who is online, please stand up! What if that message could be heard all over the world at the same time? How many people do you think would stand up?
The answer is nearly 2 billion. That is how many people worldwide are expected to be on the
by the end of this year. The Internet is a communications system. It connects computers around the world. Today, nearly one-third of all human beings use the Internet.
Children in Asia learn how to use the Internet in class.
Those figures are from a new report by an international technology
An agency is an organization. Since 2005, the number of people in the world with Internet
has doubled. To have access to something is to have the ability to use it.
Most of those people live in richer nations. However, the report shows that the number of Internet users in poorer countries is on the rise. Of the 226 million new users in 2010, about 160 million are from poorer nations.
Until recently, many people in those countries didnt have computers. Increasing Internet use is bringing the world together, expert Toshie Takahashi told
Kids are more connected too. Young people can play games and do homework on the Internet, Takahashi explains. They can even communicate with kids on the other side of the globe.
For kids, the Internet has shrunk the world, she says. It doesnt seem like such a big place anymore.
Ever wonder how the Internet began? Browse through the time line to learn about some major moments in the Internets history.

132,143,"Scientists are teaching whooping cranes to fly south.
Dressed in a white costume, scientist Joe Duff pretends to be a whooping crane. He may look silly, but he has an important job to do. Duff is training a flock of whooping crane chicks in Wisconsin to think he is their mother. ""It's like becoming a bird yourself,"" he told
Joe Duff is the team leader of a group called Operation Migration. Members have been teaching ""whoopers"" to
to Florida since 2001. When animals migrate, they move from one place to another.
Operation Migration workers train the young whoopers to follow very light aircraft called
. Each aircraft is flown by a pilot in a whooping crane costume. In six months, the birds will be ready to follow the aircraft and migrate to Florida for the winter.
The whooping crane is an endangered bird. Only one flock of whooping cranes lives naturally in the wild. Those birds migrate between Canada and Texas. Scientists decided that having more than one flock would keep these birds from dying out.
Whooping cranes trained by Operation Migration in the past have remembered the route. They return to Wisconsin each spring and fly back to Florida in the fall.
""We want our birds to pay attention to us for the first year, until we get them down to Florida,"" said Duff. ""After that, we hope they communicate with wild birds and become wild birds themselves.""
In October, pilots will lead the new flock of whoopers south for the winter. The migration route will take them over seven states: Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and finally Florida.
Joe Duff spends a lot of time pretending to be a whooping crane. If you could be any animal, what would you be? Why?

133,254,"Scientists in Greenland are going ducky over their latest experiment. Theyre using toy ducks to study ice! Greenland is a large island in Europe. It is near the North Pole.
The scientists recently set loose 90 rubber ducks in the Jakobshavn (yah-cuhb-SAH-ven) Glacier on Greenland. A glacier is a large sheet of ice that moves slowly over land. Scientists dropped the ducks into tunnels in the glacier called
Melting ice on the glacier flows into the moulins. Some experts say
is causing the ice to melt. Global warming is the slow rise of Earths temperature.
Where the water ends up is a mystery. Thats where the ducks come in. Scientists have labeled the toys with an e-mail address. They hope fishing crews will find the ducks and contact them. That will help scientists learn where the melting water travels.
Scientist Alberto Behar is waiting to hear some of the duck tales.
We havent heard back, but it may take ... time, he told reporters.

135,414,"Are you ready for a vacation thats out of this world? Officials in Russia recently announced plans to build a hotel in space.
The four-room hotel will be designed to
or fit, up to seven guests at a time. Rooms will have large windows so people can look down at Earth. The hotel will most likely open for business by 2016, according to Alexander Derechin. He works for the company that will build the space hotel.
Several other businesses are also working to put more people in space. A British airline company is building a shuttle to take visitors into space. It expects the aircraft to be completed by 2012.
That and other shuttles will keep the space hotel busy, says Derechin. Spaceships [for the public] are being built around the world, he says. They will need to fly somewhere.
Theres no hotel in the world like this one!

139,695,"Get ready to sing Happy Birthday! On July 9, a new nation will be born.
That country may be called the Republic of South Sudan. It is in Africa. Earlier this year, southern Sudans people voted to become an
or free, country. They recently announced the results of the election.
The future nation is currently part of Sudan. That is the largest country in Africa. More than 2 million people in southern Sudan voted to
from northern Sudan. To separate is to pull apart.
The north and the south had been at war on and off for more than 50 years. Most people in the north follow a religion called Islam (iss-LAHM). People in the south practice Christianity and other religions. Some of the fighting happened because Sudans government tried to make people in the south follow Islams rules.
Soon, southern Sudans people will govern themselves. It wont be easy, world leaders say. The area is very poor. More than half of southern Sudans population lives on less than $1 a day. Many people do not have access to clean water.
A man works on an oil rig in southern Sudan.
The young nation will be rich in one thing, thoughoil. Southern Sudan produces about 375,000 barrels of oil a day. The south used to share its oil money with the north. Now it will keep the money and pay the north to help move the oil.
Southern Sudans leaders are hopeful about the future. We are a ... nation that has just been born, says official Pagan Amum. And like a human baby, we are
[or weak] but have the [chance] to become great.
247,105 square miles (slightly smaller than Texas)

140,266,"Are Kids' Movies and TV Shows Too Violent?
have in common? Both movies were made for kids and are rated G, which means they are OK for everyone to watch. But two scientists say those movies and many others should be rated ""V"" for their violent content.
The two scientists--Kimberly Thompson and Fumie Yokota--work for Harvard University. They watched 74 G-rated movies and said, ""We were surprised that every single movie had some act of violence."" The violence in the movies ranged from insults to attacks.
One in five TV shows for kids has no educational content, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center.
The two scientists also found that, in 46 of the movies, at least one character was hurt. And they found that, in 37 of the movies, at least one character was killed.
Most of the movies contained nearly ten minutes of violence, the scientists said. The most violent movie the scientists watched was
. That movie has 24 minutes of violence, Thompson and Yokota said.
Violent programs can also be found on TV. The Media in the Home Survey, conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, recently found that more than one-quarter of all children's TV shows had four or more violent scenes in each episode.
Some scientists say that watching too many violent TV shows and movies could make some kids violent. Watching violent shows could make some kids ""think it's no big deal for somebody to be smacked in the head with a hammer,"" said Yokota.
Scientists also worry that kids might imitate the violent acts they see on TV and in movies. Joanne Cantor, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin, said TV and movies usually don't show the effects of violence. Instead, shows often make violence look funny. Kids who think violence is funny might hurt other people without thinking about the pain they're causing.
You can protect yourself from violent TV shows and movies. First, you can limit the amount of TV you watch. The American Pediatrics Association says kids should watch no more than two hours of TV a day. Next, watch TV and movies with your parents. Talk with your parents about what you are watching on TV, and discuss what would happen if the same things happened in real life.
You and your parents can use the Internet, magazines, and newspapers to learn more about TV shows and movies. For instance, you can read TV and movie reviews on the ""Kids-in-Mind"" and ""Screen It"" Web sites.

In late January, officials fro South Korea traveled to North Korea. Both countries are located in eastern Asia. The reason for their visit was to try get North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Last October, officials in North Korea admitted to a U.S. official that North Korea is building nuclear weapons. That action violates a 1994 agreement to stop the spread of nuclear arms.
Tensions further increased when North Korea's leader, Kim Jong II, opened up nuclear power plants. The power plants had been closed under an agreement that North Korea made with the United States nearly ten years ago. Officials in North Korea say the power plants will only be used to generate electricity.
However, people in the United States and countries near North Korea, like South Korea and Japan, are concerned. They think that North Korea will use the plants make nuclear arms. North Korea recently kicked out U.N. weapons inspectors. That only added to the mistrust.
North Korea is an extremely poor country. Yet it spends most of its money on its army. It relies on help from other countries to feed its starving people.
Area: 46,500 square miles (about the size of Mississippi)
Economy: many children and families are starving
Area: 38,000 square miles 9about the size of Indiana)
Economy: it has the fourth largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The United States is working with countries in the region, such as South Korea, to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear crisis. South Korea was hoping to help the United States negotiate a peaceful solution. However, officials in North Korea want to discuss the issue directly with the United States.
U.S. official have said they will communicate with North Korea if it abandons its nuclear weapons program. President Bush has said that the world will respect North Korea when it is no loner a nuclear threat.
North Korea and South Korea are located on a Peninsula in Eastern Asia. Soldiers from the United States and South Korea routinely divides North Korea and South Korea.

142,587,"Florida is the 23rd largest state in the United States. Key West is the southernmost part of the continental United States.
Moving slowly and silently through more than a million acres of wetlands in Florida, water is the lifeblood of the Everglades. However, for the past few decades, the Everglades has been losing its lifeblood.
President Bill Clinton plans to sign a new bill into law that may breathe new life into the Everglades. The bill is called the Everglades Restoration Act. The act will help restore parts of the Everglades to the way they were many years ago, say supporters. Critics of the plan say that it does not go far enough to restore the Everglades.
The Everglades is like a shallow, slow-moving river that covers millions of acres. The ""river of grass,"" as the Everglades is called, is 50 miles wide and 120 miles long. It flows from Lake Okeechobee into Florida Bay.
A large part of the river of grass is contained within the Everglades National Park. The park covers about 1.5 million acres (about the size of Delaware). Many plant and animal species, including alligators, panthers, egrets, and manatees live in the park.
An alligator suns itself in the Everglades. Manatees, many kinds of birds, and panthers can be found in these wetlands.
The Everglades Restoration Act will spend about $8 billion to restore the river of grass over the next 30 years. The act will be managed in part by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
One important part of the act calls for the removal of dams, dikes, and flood control gates. The Corps of Engineers began installing many of those devices in 1948 to control the flow of water in the Everglades. Those devices protect towns and farms from flooding and provide
By removing dams and closing canals, the Corps of Engineers will restore the flow of water in the river of grass to the way it was more than 100 years ago. That's when people first began to drain water from the Everglades.
The act will also improve water treatment plants. Those plants clean wastewater coming from farms or towns near the Everglades. The improved plants will allow less water pollution to flow into the Everglades. The Corps of Engineers will also build reservoirs, relocate roads, and shut off drainage canals.
The maps show (1) how water flowed through the Everglades before farms and towns began draining water from the Everglades, (2) how water now flows through the Everglades, and (3) how water may flow when the plan is completed.
Many people, from environmental groups to private citizens, applaud the act. ""This is as major a restoration as one would hope for,"" said Charles Lee, a spokesperson for the Florida Audubon Society.
Critics of the plan, however, say it does not go far enough toward restoring the wetlands. For example, the Everglades once covered 9 million acres, say officials from the Sierra Club, an organization that works to protect the environment. The Corps of Engineers drained much of that land so it could be used as farmland and to build houses. More of that land should be returned to the way it used to be before the 20th century, Sierra Club officials have said.
Whatever disagreements people may have, all agree that the restoration of the Everglades will take a long time and a lot of hard work. Once the act becomes law, said Stuart Applebaum of the Corps of Engineers, it will be time to ""roll up our sleeves [and get to work] for the next 30 years.""

143,217,"An Iowa class heads into high-tech tests.
Every student in class has a remote control, and the kids are clicking away at the screen. But they aren't changing channels. They're taking a test! Terry Rex's fourth graders at Wings Park Elementary School in Oelwein, Iowa, are using a new kind of classroom technology. Instead of writing with pencils on exam papers, the students use remote controls to take tests.
""It's more fun,"" Courtney Ricchio, 9, told
""I don't have to write, and my hand doesn't get tired."" The remote controls are part of the Classroom Performance System (CPS). When students use CPS to take a test, the questions appear on an electronic screen. Students key in their answers on the remote-control response pad.
Rex is one of the first teachers in Iowa to use CPS. His students use the technology for more than taking tests. They also play learning games with the system. Sam Myott, 9, says his favorite CPS activity is a football game. ""It's a math game with multiplication and subtraction,"" he told
""Since it's on the computer, it's more fun than a worksheet on your desk.""
Some teachers think using CPS to grade a test is more
or a better use of time, than grading a written test. The computer keeps track of the students' answers and prints out their grades at the end of the day. The computer also reports which questions the class found most difficult to answer, so Rex can review them with the group.
Classrooms across the country are trying out new teaching gadgets.
Sixth graders Marina Gagliano and Kerry O'Conner of Wellwood Middle School in Fayetteville, New York, label parts of a microscope on an interactive whiteboard. The whiteboard allows students to use their fingers to click and tap answers on the projected image.
Fourth and fifth graders at Elton Hills Elementary School in Rochester, Minnesota, are on the move. Their classrooms have no chairs! Tiny desks hold high-tech gadgets, such as laptops and iPods, with different lessons. Researchers say this setup may be healthier for students than sitting at desks all day.

144,648,"Coins were available for buying and selling at the World's Fair of Money.
Collectible coins and currency worth about $1 billion were on display at the World's Fair of Money. The fair was held this August in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
During the five-day event, money was displayed for looking at, buying, and selling. Some coins were worth as little as half a cent. Other coins were worth millions.
The event drew thousands of coin lovers from around the world. That's not surprising--coin collecting is one of the world's most popular hobbies.
, or a way to make money in the future. Most collectors, however, are not in it for the money. They participate in the hobby because of each coin's story. One coin expert referred to money as ""history that you can hold in your hand.""
Among the fair's most valuable coins were two Liberty Head nickels. The nickels were worth between $2 million and $3 million each.
A 1794 coin couldn't be missed at the fair either. Experts say the coin, believed to be the first silver dollar in the United States, is worth about $10 million.
Coin hobbyists point out that just because a coin is old doesn't necessarily mean it's valuable. A coin's worth depends on how many exist, on how many people want it, and on its condition.
Coin collectors are used to paying more for a coin than its original value. They say their hobby is worth every penny.
Each day, the government prints 37 million bills, worth about $696 million.
About 18 tons of ink per day go into printing those bills.
If you had $10 billion and you spent $1 every second of every day, you would go broke in 317 years.

145,331,"Many people think that the new millennium began on January 1, 2000. But they're wrong. The new millennium actually begins January 1, 2001. That's because the calendar we use doesn't have a year zero. Our present calendar actually began with the year 1.
A year may be only 365 days, but a lot can happen in such a short time. Below are just a few of the many important events that took place this past year.
It was a tough summer for many people in the western United States. Wildfires burned about 7 million acres of land--six times the size of the Grand Canyon National Park. The fires forced thousands of people to leave their homes. Many people returned home and found charred rubble.
Recovery is already under way in most burned areas. In Utah, officials from one park are using a helicopter to spread grass seeds over wide areas.
The United States was the top medal winner at the 2000 Olympic Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. The United States took home a total of 97 medals, 39 of which were gold.
There were some spectacular events in this year's Summer Games. One of the highlights was the victory of U.S. wrestler Rulon Gardner (left) over Russian Alexander Karelin. Gardner beat Karelin, who had not lost a match in 13 years, by 1 point.
received its first long-term guests in November. The station, which is being built with help from 16 nations, was first put in orbit in 1998.
According to NASA (the U.S. space agency), the station should be completed by 2006 and will weigh more than 1 million pounds. Scientists will stay in the
to conduct long-term experiments that cannot be done on Earth.
Terrorism struck Americans on October 12 when a bomb ripped a huge hole in the side of the Navy destroyer USS
. The ship was docked in Aden. Yemen, a country in the Middle East.
U.S. officials said that the attack occurred when two men in a rubber boat exploded a bomb next to one side of the
. The blast killed 17 sailors and injured dozens of others. Another ship carried the
to the United States, where it will be rebuilt.
More than 97 million people voted for president of the United States on Tuesday, November 7. Most political experts had predicted that the race would be close, but no one knew that it would be as close as it turned out to be.
On the day after the election, Vice President Al Gore had slightly more votes than Texas Governor George W. Bush had. But the vote in Florida was so close that the state had to recount all 6 million votes cast in that state. The race was so close that no one knew who had actually won the election long after the polls closed.

146,719,"There is good news for rhinos. Wildlife experts recently discovered the tracks of 13 Sumatran rhinos in Borneo, an island in Southeast Asia. The number thrilled scientists because the animals are on the verge of extinction.
Sumatran rhinos have been hunted illegally for their horns, which are prized in traditional Asian medicine. Wildlife groups are working to stop illegal hunting and protect the endangered creatures. The Sumatran rhino is one of three species of endangered Asian rhinos left in the wild.
True or false? There are eight times as many Indian rhinos as Sumatran rhinos.

147,54,"In the summer of 2004, Olivia Till, a student at Courtland Elementary School in Virginia, cut off a foot of her light brown hair. She donated her ponytail to Locks of Love. The Florida-based organization provides wigs to children who have lost their hair because of illness. Some children have lost their hair from cancer treatments.
Olivia, then a fourth grader, felt proud of herself for making the donation, but she wanted to do more. So she asked her principal, Sherri Steele, if she could organize a schoolwide cut-a-thon for the program.
Her principal liked the idea so much that she decided to donate her own hair as well. ""I've never had short hair in my life, so this was a personal challenge for me,"" Steele told
This past spring, a group of 29 students and teachers cut off their hair for donation to Locks of Love. Now a fifth grader, Olivia is planning to hold a second cut-athon in her school in December. She hopes her hair is long enough for another donation. What's her advice to others? ""Start something in your school or your community,"" Olivia told

148,180,"You've probably heard the old saying, ""An apple a day keeps the doctor away."" If a scientist has his way, in the near future, apples and other fruits and vegetables will help keep millions of kids worldwide healthier than ever.
Scientist Charles Arntzen wants to alter fruits and vegetables so that they will contain a
to fight diseases. A vaccine helps a person's body fight diseases. Vaccinations have helped eliminate many diseases in the the United States and other countries.
Each year, however, 15 million kids worldwide die from diseases, including hepatitis, cholera, and diarrhea, Arntzen said. Most of the children who get those diseases live in the poorest countries in the world, mainly in Asia, Africa, and South America.
Arntzen says it's impossible to send a doctor to vaccinate kids in every village in the world. Even if doctors could go to every village, many poor people couldn't afford to pay for the vaccinations.
That's why scientists are working on ways to change fruit and vegetable seeds. They want to make vaccines part of the plants, explained Arntzen. If the scientists are successful, people in poor countries could use the seeds to grow food that would protect them from some diseases. That way, an apple a day would not only keep the doctor away, but would keep deadly diseases away as well.

149,25,"When you read a newspaper, do you usually open it to the comics section? Many people do! That's because those cartoons are funny.
The cartoons in the comics section may make you laugh, but another type of cartoon will also make you think. It's called an
. An editorial cartoon expresses an opinion about specific people or events in the news.
Lately, many editorial cartoonists have been focusing on the presidential candidates and the election. Artist Gary Markstein created two political illustrations to express his opinions about this year's election.
The economy is one of the main issues in this year's presidential election. (The economy refers to the way a country runs its jobs and industries.) The economy is like the weather--sometimes it's good, and other times it's bad. Political polls show that many people ""vote with their pocketbook."" That is, they vote based on how the economy is doing.
to make his point about the economy. Symbols are objects that represent other things. One cartoon shows two weather maps labeled ""Economy."" George W. Bush stands in front of a weather map covered with smiling faces. John Kerry holds an umbrella as he stands in front of a map with bad-weather symbols.
A forecaster is someone who predicts the weather. Why does the artist depict Bush and Kerry as weather forecasters?
What point is the cartoonist making about the candidates and the economy?
How do the symbols help convey the message? What do the suns represent? What do the hail and thunderstorm clouds represent?
Do you think the cartoonist prefers one candidate over the other? Why or why not?
What dirt are the presidential candidates digging up about each other? Some people think election campaigning is a messy business. In one cartoon, Markstein draws attention to negative campaigning and
between candidates. In politics, mudslinging refers to speaking negatively about another person or opposing party.
To make his point, the artist shows two men talking about dirt for sale. One man says to the other, ""The Bush and Kerry campaigns each ordered 2 tons...""
Why might the Bush and Kerry campaigns be ordering mud?
What message do you think the cartoonist is sending about the election campaign?
When Gary Markstein was in the fourth grade, he dreamed of being a cartoonist and having his own comic strip. He even put out a humor magazine with a friend that lasted for one issue.
Today, Markstein's audience is much larger. He draws cartoons for the
Markstein draws five cartoons a week that focus on politics and sports. To get ideas, he reads several newspapers each morning. ""Coming up with a good idea is the hardest and most challenging part, but it's also the most rewarding,"" he told
What's the best part of his job? ""I get paid to play!"" said Markstein. ""I draw on a different topic every day. I think it's the best job in the world!""
If you think you'd like to be an editorial cartoonist, Markstein has some tips:
Draw well and write well. (Yes, there is writing in most cartoons!)
Read the newspaper to learn what is going on in the world.
Be creative, use your imagination, and have a good sense of humor!

Fifth graders at Carolina International School (CIS) have a goal this Earth Dayto throw away as little trash as possible during lunch. To get their message across, students will encourage their peers to recycle. ""I celebrate Earth Day every day,"" Nirvanna Madho, 10, told
. ""I really don't throw anything away.""
Participating in a zero-waste lunch is just one of many ways students at the school in Harrisburg, North Carolina, work to better the environment. Each April, the school organizes an Earth Day event. Students rotate through stations set up across the school's 36-acre campus, which includes forests and
Wetlands are moisture-rich lowland areas such as swamps or marshes. Students take part in hands-on environmental activities from testing water quality to checking out the latest models of battery-operated cars.
This year, Earth Day at CIS kicks off a season of change. The school is preparing to go ""green"" with a major construction project, set to begin early next year. Being green means protecting the world and its resources. The school's Earthfriendly makeover will include outdoor
or sun-powered, lighting and rooftop gardens. A water recycling system and other features to protect natural resources will also be built. The lobby will include a flat-panel touch screen on which students can watch how energy is being
""It's very important to educate children about environmental issues,"" says principal Deanna Duncan. ""If we don't take care of [Earth], there isn't another one.""
CIS is just one of hundreds of schools in the United States that are going green. A
is built with recycled and environmentally friendly materials. Green schools are designed to use less energy than traditional school buildings.
The majority of the energy supply in the United States comes from the burning of
such as oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels were formed from the remains of prehistoric animals and plants. People use fossil fuels when they drive their cars, heat their homes, and power farms, factories, and cities.
Though people depend on fossil fuels, those energy sources have their drawbacks. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air and releases gases that contribute to global warmingthe gradual rise in Earth's average temperature.
Hoover Dam generates clean energy by using water to spin turbines.
Fossil fuels are gradually being used up. To conserve them, scientists are looking to
sources. Renewable energy is power from sources that can't be used up and do not pollute the environment. Water, wind, and solar power are types of renewable energy.
President George W. Bush announced an energy plan that calls on lawmakers to ensure that ecofriendly fuels are developed and made easily available to Americans. Gas is a fossil fuel used in cars, and the price to fill up a gas tank is rising. Gas costs about $3 a gallon in some parts of the United States.
At CIS, students are excited for construction to begin on their new school building. ""I think the school is going to be a lot better,"" Drew Barsody, 10, told
""I'm looking forward to seeing the solar panels.""
These wind turbines convert wind into electricity.
Here are some common environmentally friendly energy alternatives.
Solar Power: Solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat and electricity. California and Arizona are two states that use solar power. One drawback of solar power is that energy can't be collected if the sun isn't shining.
Energy produced from windmills is used to generate electricity. The amount of electricity generated from wind has been growing in recent years, tripling since 1998 in the United States. Electricity is produced from wind in 30 states, including California, Texas, and Iowa.
is one of the oldest sources of energy. Hydropower often comes from dams or waterfalls. Of all renewable energy sources, it is most often used to generate electricity. In 2004, it accounted for 7 percent of all the electricity generated in the United States.
Ethanol is a clean-burning fuel that can power cars. It is created from several sources, such as corn crops. Typically, a small amount of ethanol is combined with gasoline to fuel vehicles. That helps decrease the fuel's cost and harmful emissions.
Turning off the lights when you leave a room is one way to conserve energy. What are some other ways to save energy?

151,361,"The Heat Is On: Will Global Warming Affect Animals?
Polar bears in Alaska are having trouble catching one of their main meals--ringed seals. To get to the seals, the bears often walk across islands of ice floating in the water.
Ice throughout Alaska is melting earlier and faster in the spring than it did several years ago. So polar bears don't have as much time to catch seals before the ice melts. As a result, polar bears are catching fewer seals.
Ice along Alaska's coast is melting because the temperature is higher worldwide. In the last 100 years, Earth's temperature has risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit.
. Global warming is changing the environment worldwide. As a result, many plants and animals are being affected, say scientists from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
As temperatures rise, more and more animals will have to
, or move, in order to survive, said scientist Jay Malcolm of the WWF.
Many plants and animals that can't adjust or migrate will not survive the rise in temperature, said WWF scientists. In some areas of the world, the WWF says, as many as two in ten species of plants and animals will die out by the year 2100.
Here are some examples of how global warming is affecting some animals in North America.
The numbers on the map show where each animal can be found.
The black guillemot (GIL-uh-maht) is a bird that lives on an island off Alaska's coast. It eats Arctic cod, a fish that lives in water under ice. Rising temperatures have caused much of the ice to melt. The Arctic cod has moved to other parts of the sea where water is still covered with ice. The guillemot no longer has enough fish to eat.
The American bistort is a plant that lives in Mount Rainier National Park. The Edith's checkerspot butterfly drinks nectar from bistort flowers. The warming temperatures have caused the butterflies to hatch earlier, before the flowers bloom, so the butterflies don't have enough food right after they hatch.
Global warming is actually helping some animals.
The Mexican vole lives in areas with warm temperatures. It is spreading northward into Arizona and Colorado because of the rise in temperatures there.
For years, red fire ants lived in the warm southern part of the United States. Today, because of rising temperatures, they are spreading northward.
Scientists have learned that global warming is already affecting Earth. ""We should not expect the effects of global warming to take place 50 years in the future,"" said scientist Rafe Sagarin. ""It's happening right now.""
Scientists agree that Earth has been getting warmer for the last 100 years. They don't agree on
Gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming. Carbon dioxide in the air traps heat from the sun, causing Earth's temperature to rise.
Volcanoes and forest fires release carbon dioxide into the air. Some scientists blame the rise in temperature on volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and other natural events.
Other scientists blame human actions for the rise in temperature. They say Earth has always had volcanoes and forest fires, so why is Earth warming now? Those scientists say the carbon dioxide from automobiles and factories is causing the recent increase in global warming.

152,249,"What is putting important world landmarks at risk?
Florida Everglades National Park covers more than 100,000 acres of swampland in southern Florida.
What do the Florida Everglades, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, and Kathmandu, Nepal, have in common? More than you might think!
."") World Heritage Sites are protected because they have special environmental, historic, or cultural value.
That isnt the only thing the landmarks share. Experts say the Everglades, the Great Barrier Reef, and Kathmandu are in trouble and should be closed off by 2020.
are endangering the landmarks, warns a new report by the Centre for Future Studies (CFS). Global warming is the gradual rise in Earths average temperature.
""The combined impact of too many tourists stomping all over these important sites plus climate change is having a severe [effect],"" Susi Moser, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told
The last nine years were the hottest since scientists began tracking Earths temperature in 1861. Some scientists say global warming will create more
or powerful, hurricanes. Researchers predict that the heat will cause glaciers in the Antarctic to melt. That will cause ocean levels to rise.
Those changes could destroy the Everglades, the CFS report says. Stronger hurricanes could threaten the areas plant and animal species, including American crocodiles and manatees. Rising seawater could flood the swampy region.
Its important to protect the 2,358-square-mile landmark, Jan Michael Jacobson, director of the Everglades Institute, told
""The Everglades primarily is valuable because it is a unique habitat,"" he said.
The historic temples of Kathmandu, Nepal, were built between 1300 and 1800. They draw millions of tourists each year.
The Great Barrier Reef and Kathmandu are facing a different threattourists. The Great Barrier Reef attracts about 1.8 million tourists a year, who pump billions of dollars into Australias economy. Visitors can also damage the delicate system of coral reefs.
Tourists are endangering Kathmandu, too, CFS officials say. The valley is in the shadow of Mount Everest, the worlds tallest mountain. The report warns that skiers and climbers hoping to tackle Mount Everest and other Himalayan peaks may harm Kathmandus ancient temples.
The effects of global warming are already being felt. More than 150 countries are working to stop the rising temperatures. They have
emissions. Those gases contribute to global warming.
As for the Great Barrier Reef and Kathmandu, the CFS report recommends limiting the number of tourists allowed to visit the sites. But some people say that visiting endangered landmarks could encourage tourists to fight for their protection.
Many cars and factories burn fossil fuels. That releases greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the air. Those gases form a layer and trap the suns heat close to Earth.
That process is called the greenhouse effect. The layer of gases acts as a window in a greenhouse doesit lets in heat but doesnt let much out. The result is global warming, a worldwide rise in average temperature.
There are 788 World Heritage Sites, but becoming one is not easy. Landmarks must meet one of 10 requirements. For instance, a site must represent a unique culture or a significant period in history. Independent groups
or examine, each landmark. Then an international committee, which is part of the United Nations, votes on the new sites. The Great Wall of China and the Statue of Liberty are included on the list.

153,517,"Meet a monkey with a Mohawk! Scientists recently discovered the unusual-looking creature with spiked hair in the mountains of Tanzania, a country located in East Africa. It is Africa's first new
or type, of monkey to be identified in 20 years.
The long-tailed, tree-dwelling monkey is a highland mangabey (MANG-guh-bee). It is covered with brownish-gray fur and has an off-white belly and tail. The new monkey makes an odd ""honk-bark"" call.
This latest discovery has surprised scientists. ""The chances of finding a large, noisy monkey that no one has ever scientifically described before makes this a rare event indeed,"" says scientist Trevor Jones.
Highland mangabeys are shy creatures. Their shyness makes them difficult to spot. That might explain why scientists were unaware that the species had existed. Another reason is that the monkeys live high in the forest
Scientists are working hard to protect the highland mangabey's environment. It is estimated that fewer than 1,000 of the monkeys live in the wild. Scientists say the discovery shows that there is still a lot to learn about Africa.

154,392,"In many ways, David Bocchichio is a typical teacher. He works long hours, and students say he is always available to help. But he has given more than time and knowledge. He recently gave one of his kidneys to the mother of three of his students.
Evelyn Arroyo is the mother of three girls who were students at Hockanum Elementary School in East Hartford, Connecticut, where Bocchichio teaches. Last year, Bocchichio learned from Arroyo's daughters, Leslie, Juanita, and Iris, that their mother was sick with kidney disease.
The diagram shows some of the organs in the human body. The diagram shows the kidneys in front of other body organs so you can see them. The kidneys are actually behin these organs.
The kidneys filter waste from the body and make urine. Although a person has two kidneys, he or she needs only one to stay alive. People who have diseased kidneys may need a
to stay alive. In a kidney transplant operation, doctors remove the diseased kidney and replace it with a working kidney.
In the United States, many people suffer from kidney disease. According to Arroyo's doctor, David Hull, more than 47,000 people are waiting for kidney transplants. For many of those people, finding a kidney is a problem.
Some of Evelyn Arroyo's relatives offered a kidney, but their kidneys did not match the tissue that made up Arroyo's kidneys. Arroyo's family feared she might die before a matching kidney was found.
That's when Bocchichio volunteered one of his kidneys, which matched Arroyo's tissue. During the operations, which took place in January, doctors removed one of Bocchichio's kidneys and put it inside Arroyo.
After the operations, Arroyo told Bocchichio, ""I want to thank you again for this chance to live for my beautiful girls;... you're my angel.""
Word of the operations' success quickly spread through Hockanum Elementary School. ""I am very proud of what he has done,"" Principal Ismael A. Torres told

Toucans and other creatures hold on as their rain forest home dissappers.
fly among the forest. Emerald tree boas curl up on branches to stalk prey. Endangered jaguars slink through the thick brush in search of food. These are just a few of the thousands of animals that call the Amazon rain forest home.
A tropical rain forest is warm and has heavy rainfall. The Amazon, in South America, is the largest rain forest in the world.
Yet the Amazons future is grim. Farmers are rapidly destroying this lush landscape.
has been huge problem in the Amazon since the 1960s. Deforestation occurs when farmers and loggers cut down trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Until recently, scientists thought the rain forest was losing about 5,800 square miles a year. However, using the latest satellite technology, researchers have discovered that the Amazon is shrinking at about twice that rate.
Why should we worry about a rain forest that is thousands of miles from where we live? Deforestation reduces the rain forests
or the variety of plants and animals in a particular area. The Amazon is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant diversity. It is home to the biggest flower in the world, a bird-eating spider, and a monkey about the size of a toothbrush.
Scientists estimate that they have identified only a small number of all species that live in the rain forest. As loggers and farmers destroy the forest, animals and plants may become extinct before they are discovered.
Deforestation affects people too. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines we need come from the rain forest.
The Amazon is often called the ""lungs of the world."" Its trees clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans. Carbon dioxide is a
Greenhouse gases trap the suns heat close to Earth. Without the trees in the rain forest, the Earths climate would become much hotter.
Stopping the destruction of the rain forest is not an easy task. Brazils government recently created two national parks in the Amazon rain forest. The governments efforts placed 3.7 million acres of rain forest off-limits for development. The protected area is more than twice the size of Maryland.
Others think that this is not enough. ""The single most important factor contributing to forest loss is population growth in Brazil,"" scientist Jim Bowyer of the University of Michigan told
""People make the forest their home. All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive.""
Scientists estimate that if deforestation continues at its current rate, the rain forest may survive only another 40 to 50 years. ""We need to address the real causes of deforestation, like poverty and population growth,"" says Bowyer. ""Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest.""

156,23,"Did you know that the average child will spend more time in front of the television than at school this year? That's according to the TV-Turnoff Network.
Beginning April 21, millions of children and their families across the country will trade some TV time for other activities. They will zap off their television sets for an entire week.
April 21 through 27 is the ninth annual TV-Turnoff Week. ""The idea of the week is to encourage people to take a break from TV,"" said Frank Vespe of the TV-Turnoff Network. ""One of the things we learn is that TV is taking away from other things that we might do for fun.""
The goal of the week, according to its organizers, is to help kids discover other activities they enjoy. Then kids may make lasting changes in their lives.
Health experts warn that too much television can have negative effects on kids. Children who spend too much time watching television often get too little exercise. They also don't perform as well in school as do children who watch less TV.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
1. This is the ninth year of TV-Turnoff Week.
2. Many kids like to watch TV.
3. TV-Turnoff Week lets kids discover other activities they enjoy.
So think about what you might do if you zapped off your television set for an entire week. Would you read a book? Head outside to ride your bike? Play a board game with your mom or dad?
""The limit is your own imagination and creativity,"" said Vespe.

158,655,"February 27 was a sad day in the neighborhood. Fred Rogers, the beloved host of the children's television program
, lost a brief battle with stomach cancer. He died at age 74 at his home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
""He was so genuinely, genuinely kind, a wonderful person,"" said David Newell, who played Mr. McFeely on the show.
Fred Rogers touched generations of children. His show became public television's longest-running program. It was produced for more than 30 years-from 1968 to 2001-and continues to air in reruns.
On each show, Mr. Rogers welcomes viewers by taking off his jacket and shoes and putting on a cardigan sweater and sneakers. One of his cardigans hangs in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, in Washington, D.C.
A Presbyterian minister, Mr. Rogers taught kids the importance of self-worth with his trademark line, ""I like you just the way you are.""
Mr. Rogers didn't consider himself a TV star. ""I always thought I was a neighbor who just came in for a visit.""

159,661,"Take a time trip with tomorrows talking robots, dolphinlike boats, and more!
Thousands of kids recently had a sneak peek at the world of tomorrow. They experienced talking robots, underwater vehicles, and lifesize video games. These inventions were among the 150 creations at this years NextFest fair. The four-day festival was held in New York City, New York.
NextFest gave inventors a chance to unveil their latest creations. Many were right out of the lab. Others were still being developed. Here are a few of the high-tech gadgets that captured our attention.
Actroid is a robot designed to look and talk like a human.
Dont let this photo fool you! Actroid may look real, but she is actually a
or humanlike, robot. She was designed to greet and entertain people. When Actroid talks, she moves her hands and makes eye contact. Other versions of this robot are programmed to reply to hundreds of questions, such as ""What time is it?"" and ""Are you a real person?""
What is it like to live like a sea creature? The Bionic Dolphin gives people the chance to find out. The vehicle can cruise across the water at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour (mph) and then dive at least 10 feet. Its inventor, Thomas Rowe, designed the vehicle with wings to enable it to ""fly"" underwater as fast as 40 mph. ""The majority of my research was on dolphins, but where I got the most help was penguins and diving birds,"" Rowe told
The Bionic Dolphin was first designed for
or play. However, it may be used in the future to save whales entangled in nets. A larger version of the vehicle has been designed to rescue people lost at sea. ""It swallows them,"" says Rowe.
What combines music, rock climbing, and video games? Its a musical climbing wall called DigiWall. This climbing wall has interactive games based on speed, cooperation, and creativity. ""We wanted to do some kind of computer game where you are very physical,"" project leader Mats Liljedahl told
""We removed the computer screen, and instead we are using the lights and the grips."" The grips light up when they are touched.
Robonaut may help astronauts in future space missions. The robot is being designed by NASA, the U.S. space agency. The robot will ""perform tasks that up until now only astronauts could do,"" NASA engineer Roger Rovekamp told
Robonaut can operate on its own or be controlled by a human operator from Earth or in space. The operator would wear a special headset that displays live video from the cameras on the robots head. By wearing a glove with sensors, that person can control the actions of Robonauts fingers, which can hold tools as small as tweezers.
""I got to see some awesome exhibits,"" says
kid reporter Michaela Ritz. The 11-year-old was on the scene at NextFest. Along with checking out the latest gadgets, Michaela caught up with some inventors to learn more about their unique designs.
What was her favorite invention? Brainball! In this game, players wear headbands that monitor their stress levels by measuring brain waves. A computer directs a ball away from the player who is calmer.
""You needed to relax in order to get the ball into the opponents circle,"" says Michaela. ""It is a good game for relieving stress.""

160,257,"""A penny for your thoughts"" is something many people say to one another. Soon, however, the old saying may have to be changed to ""a nickel for your thoughts.""
Saying that a penny has ""virtually no value,"" Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona wants stores to stop using the penny. He has introduced a bill in Congress that would require stores to round prices to the nearest nickel.
Kolbe says that most people don't usually use their pennies. He says people just toss the coins aside.
Critics, however, disagree with Kolbe. They argue that if Kolbe's bill becomes law, people will pay more for many of the things they buy. The critics claim stores will round most of their prices up, not down.
The penny is the oldest currency authorized by the U.S. government. The government first minted the 1 cent coin in 1787. Since then, the U.S. Treasury Department has made more than 300 billion pennies.

161,668,"The planet's famous rings have changed in the past 25 years.
Cassini is studying Saturn and capturing pictures of its rings.
Scientists have uncovered some of Saturn's secrets. Researchers recently learned that the planet's famous rings have changed during the past 25 years. The information has been collected from tools aboard the
, or circling, the ringed planet last year.
is studying Saturn and capturing pictures of its rings. Its ring bands are named with the letters
. The rings, however, are not in alphabetical order. They were assigned a letter in the order in which they were discovered.
One of the most surprising finds is that parts of Saturn's innermost ringthe D ringhave grown dimmer since 1981. In addition, the D ring has moved 125 miles closer to Saturn.
What do these new discoveries mean? Scientists aren't sure, but hope the discoveries will reveal clues about the age of the rings around the sixth planet from the sun. ""I don't think Saturn's rings will disappear anytime soon, but this tells us how the rings are [changing] and how long they might last,"" says Linda Spilker, a scientist with the U.S. space agency, NASA.
Although Saturn's rings appear solid, they are actually made up of pieces of rock, ice, and dust. Those pieces vary from the size of tiny dust particles to the size of large mountains.
Scientists are also studying the shimmering rings to learn more about how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. They say that Saturn's rings are a model of the gas and dust that once surrounded the sunthe center of the solar system.
The image of Enceladus was taken by the
spacecraft. Enceladus is one of Saturn's 47 known moons. The red areas appear to be craters and ridges on the icy moon's surface.
Other images revealed water vapor escaping from cracks on the moon. Water vapor indicates that Saturn has an
, a layer of air that surrounds a planet.
Tiny Enceladus now joins Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa as places in the solar system that may have liquid water beneath their surfaces. Water is necessary for life to exist.

162,801,"A group of fourth graders witnessed firsthand proof that one person's junk is another person's treasure.
joined the students on their recent visit to the Garbage Museum in Stratford, Connecticut, where a giant, multicolored dinosaur molded out of garbage towered above them.
was sculpted out of a ton of trash! That is equal to 2,000 pounds of garbagethe amount of trash each person, on average, throws away each year. Philadelphia artist Leo Sewell scoured city dumps and created
out of old junk, from false teeth and license plates to toys, tires, and tennis rackets.
""I think the dinosaur is one of the coolest things I've ever seen,"" said fourth grader Jahkwe Aquart from Park City Magnet School in Bridgeport, Connecticut. His classmate Julie Pham, 9, agreed. ""Instead of throwing away our garbage, we can reuse it.""
was made out of a ton of trash, including false teeth, license plates, and tires.
That is exactly the point. ""The museum shows what happens to our trash, how we can reduce our trash, and what we can do instead of throwing our trash away,"" said museum director Sotoria Montanari.
Today, Americans create more garbage than ever before. In the early 1900s, most items were packed in containers that could be used again. Now, most of the food we buy, from cereal to milk, comes in boxes and cartons that can be thrown away.
So what happens to trash after it is tossed out? Some trash ends up in
. In a landfill, garbage gets buried between layers of soil. Because many states are running out of room for landfills, more and more garbage goes to
(or resource-recovery) plants. At these plants, garbage is burned and converted into electricity that people use to power their lights, TVs, and video games.
Plastic bottles can be recycled at centers like this one.
Garbage is a form of solid waste. The Garbage Museum and its recycling plant, which are run by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, provide visitors with ideas to cut down on solid waste. One way is to
, or make less, trashby throwing away fewer napkins when you eat, for instance. Another way is to
, or find new uses for, old items. Paper bags, for example, can be reused to make book covers or wrap gifts.
People also help decrease their solid wastes when they
. Recycling refers to putting old objects, such as glass, plastic bottles, newspapers, and aluminum cans through a special process so they can be used again. (See ""
Recycling has many benefits. Did you know that recycled plastic soft-drink bottles can be made into park benches, carpeting, and backpacks? The more people recycle, the less garbage ends up in landfills or waste-to-energy plants.
, or materials from Earth. To make an aluminum can from scratch, for example, the metal needs to be mined from the ground. That process harms the land and pollutes the air and water. Making aluminum cans from recycled cans uses 95 percent less energy and protects Earth's natural resources. In fact, the energy saved each year from recycled cans could light Washington, D.C., for nearly four years!
What are some other ways you can protect natural resources?
As part of their visit, the fourth graders got a look at the museum's recycling center. Here, they discovered that one
, or bundle, of recycled newspapers can save 17 trees! The message seems to have stuck with 9-year-old Arron Smith. ""When you recycle, you save trees and animals' homes.""
Did you ever wonder what happens to the aluminum cans you recycle?
watched a recycling center in action at the Garbage Museum.
Trucks drop off aluminum cans that are mixed with massive loads of plastic bottles and glass. The trash travels along conveyor belts to be sorted and separated.
Machines compress aluminum cans into giant bales.
The bales are sold to companies that turn the recycled cans into something usable. From recycled aluminum cans, more cans are made. When you buy recycled products, you ""close the loop.""
Each American throws away about 5 pounds of garbage each day. Earth Day, April 22, reminds people how important it is to reduce waste. Here are some ways:
Carry a lunch box instead of a paper lunch bag, and pack food in reusable containers.
Use both sides of a sheet of paper.
Donate old clothing and toys to a charity.
pile using food scraps, leaves, and grass clippings. Composting is nature's way of recycling. Plants and other wastes
, or rot, and nourish the soil.

163,650,"The meat-eating shark is one of the most feared creatures in the ocean. Now, the shark has reason to be afraid. Scientists have recently reported that the number of sharks in the North Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico has declined by half in the past 15 years.
, or kinds, of sharks live in the waters around the world. The researchers found that populations of some of the best-known sharks, including hammerheads and great whites, have been affected. The hammerhead suffered the steepest drop-an 89 percent decrease. The number of great white sharks declined by 79 percent.
According to scientists, the dramatic drop in shark populations is due to overfishing. The shark population is also threatened because sharks develop slowly and do not reproduce as quickly as other types of fish.
, or unwanted catch, in nets meant for tuna and swordfish. Some scientists think that tighter laws on fishing could protect sharks. For example, some sharks
, or move to another place, along set paths at certain times of the year. Some scientists say that preventing fishing during those times might help protect sharks from being accidentally killed.
Another risk to sharks are the people who kill them for their fins, which are used to make shark-fin soup. The United States prohibits that practice.
The decline in the shark population has scientists worried. All plants and animals in the ocean depend on one another for food. The link between them is called the
Sharks are predators at the top of the food chain. A predator is an animal that survives by eating other animals. Sharks hunt, or prey upon, other animals such as seals and tuna. Seals and tuna eat smaller fish. Those smaller fish feed on tiny fish and ocean plants.
""Sharks are adapted to being the predators, not the prey,"" said one scientist. Scientists say that if sharks are wiped out, it would negatively impact other marine life in the food chain.
What do you think should be done to protect sharks? Discuss in class. Then let us know in the Write On section of
The food chain links plants and animals together. They depend on one another for food. The ocean food chain begins with sea plants called phytoplankton. Tiny animals called zooplankton eat the phytoplankton. A small fish, such as a herring, eats the zooplankton. A bigger fish, such as a tuna, eats the herring.

164,112,"What's purple and gold, wears sneakers, has horns and a tail, and weighs several hundred pounds? A statue of a cow, of course!
People in several U.S. cities are being treated to herds of cow sculptures. The sculptures are part of Cows on Parade.
Cows on Parade started in Switzerland in 1998. A U.S. businessman saw the cows and brought the idea to the United States in 1999. This year, about 1,000 cows are on display in several U.S. cities.
Each cow is made of fiberglass and was decorated by a local artist, including some kids. The cows will be left on display until October.

165,706,"For years, scientists have known about a huge hole in a layer of Earth's atmosphere. It's called the ozone hole. It is located above Antarctica. This year, the hole did something surprising. It split in two!
Earth's atmosphere is made of several layers. Ozone is a gas that makes up one of those layers. That layer stretches from 6 miles to 30 miles above Earth's surface.
Ozone is an important gas. It protects life on Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. Without ozone, life couldn't exist. The dangerous solar rays are called ultraviolet rays, or UV rays. UV rays can cause sunburn and skin cancer.
The pie chart shows the two most abundant gases in Earth""s atmosphere.
Scientists first noticed the ozone hole in the 1970s. Since then, each year, the hole has opened above Antarctica for a few months in the fall. The largest hole formed in 2000. It was three times larger than the United States. This year, unusually severe storms caused the hole to split, say scientists.
Cold temperatures in the atmosphere over Antarctica and chemical pollution cause the ozone hole. Chemicals that used to be in aerosol cans, air conditioners, and refrigerators made the pollution. To protect the atmosphere, people stopped using those dangerous chemicals in the mid-1990s.
Although the chemicals are no longer used, they stay in the atmosphere for a long time. Scientists say the ozone hole will continue to form for a long time. But it should start getting smaller.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
1. Ozone protects Earth from dangerous solar rays.
2. The largest ozone hole formed in 2000.

166,125,"Lack of Zzzs Can Lead to Injuries
Fourth grader Annie Inglese knows how important it is to get the right amount of sleep each night. ""If I don't get enough sleep,"" she says, ""I have trouble getting up in the morning.""
Sleep experts say that kids who do not get a good night's sleep on a regular basis put their safety at risk. Delaying bedtime for other activities can lead to accidents, such as falling off a bike or getting hurt on the playground.
In addition to preventing injuries, children who get enough sleep on a regular basis tend to get better grades and be in a better mood. ""Sleep is just as important as nutrition and exercise in our overall health,"" says Dr. Carl Hunt, a sleep expert with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Estimates show about 1 out of every 4 adults does not get enough sleep. Sleep experts think that number may be just as high for kids. According to the NIH, children ages 7 to 11 need at least nine hours of sleep each night.
Most kids and families today have busy schedules that can keep them from getting enough sleep. Plus, watching television, chatting on the Internet, and playing video games all compete with valuable sleep time.
Going to bed at the same time each night will help you get a good night's sleep. If you have trouble falling asleep, Dr. Hunt advises you to unwind with quiet time. Reading or listening to soothing music can help bring on sleep.

167,725,"Take me out to the... art museum? Yes, you've heard right! Baseball is being honored with a new art exhibit. The exhibit, ""The Perfect Game: America Looks at Baseball,"" celebrates our national pastime. It is being shown at the American Folk Art Museum in New York City.
To enter the exhibit, visitors walk through a turnstile similar to one they would find at a baseball stadium. Inside, more than 100 objects from 1840 through the present are on display. The exhibit includes scorecards, baseball cards, bats, painted baseballs, artwork, and even an autographed quilt among its many items.
""It's baseball history and trivia,"" Elizabeth Warren told
when describing the exhibit she organized. ""It combines baseball and art.""
Warren says that Jackie Robinson is depicted on many objects, more than any other baseball player. In 1947, Jackie Robinson made history. He became the first African American baseball player in the major leagues when he joined the Dodgers. At that time, the Dodgers were located in Brooklyn. Today, they are in Los Angeles.
""Jackie Robinson was a hero both on and off the field,"" said Warren. ""He's such a great role model.""
The exhibit runs through February 1, 2004

168,203,"The Mayon volcano in the Philippines has roared dangerously to life. A
is an opening in Earths surface through which molten rock, ash, and other materials blast out. Volcanoes erupt because of a buildup of heat and pressure deep within Earth. Volcanoes occur where Earths plates push together or pull apart.
For weeks, Mayon has threatened thousands of people who live near the volcano. Repeated eruptions of hot ash and fiery lava have destroyed crops and forests. Experts warn that more violent eruptions could happen at any time.
Mayon is the most active volcano in the Philippines. Scientists consider a volcano active if it has erupted within the last 10,000 years. A dormant volcano is ""sleeping"" but is expected to erupt in the future. An extinct volcano is not expected to erupt again.
Why might a volcano not erupt for years and years?

169,759,"Standing on a cliff, a sharpshooter carefully aimed his rifle at a Mexican gray wolf. Bulls-eye! The wolf went down. A short time later, he shot a second wolf.
The wolves, however, weren't injured. The sharpshooter had shot special darts at them. The darts contained a drug that put the wolves to sleep.
U.S. government officials picked up the sleeping wolves. They planned to move the wolves to an area far away from people.
The two wolves are part of a program to bring wolves back to Arizona and New Mexico. Until about 1900, the Mexican gray wolf lived in both states. Some of the wolves ate cattle and attacked people. People hunted the wolves because they thought the animals were dangerous. By 1950, few wolves were left in the area.
The U.S. government has brought wolves back to those states. But ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico say wolves are causing problems again.
What's the scariest animal? Is it a grizzly bear, a shark, or a wolf? Or is it something else? Believe it or not, deer are more dangerous.
Deer may seem harmless, but they can cause a lot of trouble. Deer often wander onto busy roads. When they do, they can cause car accidents. In 2001, deer caused 26,000 car accidents. A year earlier, they caused 83 human fatalities.
Ranchers say the wolves that the sharpshooters hit with darts killed 19 calves. The ranchers fear that the wolves might attack people as well.
""I can handle the bears and the mountain lions and the bobcats,"" said one rancher. When you see [those animals], they take off. They're scared of you. These wolves, they're not scared. And that's what scares me.""
The ranchers say wolves cannot be reintroduced to their area because too many people live there now. ""You can't turn back the clock,"" one person said.

171,147,"Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will take a look at where the two candidates for president stand on important
, or problems facing the country. This week's issue is the
President Bush went to war in Iraq because, he said, the country's dictator, Saddam Hussein, had harmful, illegal weapons. Bush claimed that Iraq and its weapons threatened the United States and other nations. Bush says that the world is safer now that Saddam has been removed from power. His goal is to rebuild Iraq with its own government and establish peace there.
Senator Kerry supported a law that allowed the United States to go to war in Iraq. Since then, he has criticized Bush's handling of the war. Kerry said that Bush misled the nation by claiming that Iraq had harmful, illegal weapons. To date, none have been found.

172,191,"One polar bear spent part of the summer feeling a bit off-color. The 14-year-old bears snowy white fur briefly turned purple after she was given medicine to treat a skin problem.
The bear, named Pelusa, lives at a zoo in Argentina--a country in South America. When Pelusa changed shades, visitors flocked to the zoo to see her purple coat. That must have been a ""berry"" strange site!

173,683,"Lily Thorpe is showing kids that they really can make a difference in politics even though they may not be old enough to vote yet. The 11-year-old from Grand Junction, Colorado, recently started an organization called Kids Campaign.
""Kids weren't getting enough of a say in politics,"" Lily told
. ""Grown-ups who vote are making the decision for us. Kids can have a voice.""
. Political action committees bring awareness of various causes to elected officials. In Lily's case, Kids Campaign focuses on bringing children's issues to the attention of politicians.
Kids Campaign grew out of a concern that Lily had about her school library. She noticed that many of her school library's books and encyclopedias were outdated. To help schools in Colorado get the education funds and supplies they need, Lily founded Kids Campaign.
In the name of kids everywhere, Lily is making her voice heard and is hoping that politicians are listening. She is busy meeting politicians and speaking with them about kids' causes.
Lily has some advice for grown-ups. She encourages them to talk to kids about their voting choices. That way, she says, it helps make voting ""a family decision.""

, someone who designs and builds buildings, bridges, and other structures. But recently Simon traded in his old job for a new one--as a dinosaur hunter.
Simon, who says he loves dinosaurs, started a new business called Dinosaur Safaris. He takes people on dinosaur digs in Wyoming. Simon hopes that he can earn money with his company. ""If I could make a living doing this,"" he said, ""that'd be awesome.""
Simon is not the only fossil hunter who has given up another job in the hope of making a living finding fossils. Other people have started businesses in which they look for fossils. All of them hope to make a big find, which might mean big bucks. A

175,472,"Experts hope 2006 will be the year the world is polio-free.
Will polio be declared a disease of the past?
World health groups are fighting a war
with a crippling and sometimes deadly diseasepolio. Their efforts are paying off. Polio has been wiped out in 10 African countries, according to a recent report.
Since mid-2003, nearly 200 children in those 10 western and central African countries were
for life, but no new cases have been reported since last June. When people are paralyzed, they are unable to move different parts of their bodies and may be unable to walk.
The disease raced across Africa and into Asia after people in Nigeria refused the polio
mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think well get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told
She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria.""
Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly
disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havent been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims.
With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world. On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government approved the use of a vaccine that stopped people from getting the disease. Jonas Salk was the doctor who invented the first polio vaccine.
A boy in Africa receives an oral polio vaccine from a WHO (World Health Organization) worker.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world thanks to Salk, it still threatens children in Africa and Asia. Major efforts were recently under way to
or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been
Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door.
To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November.
After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Its uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives.""
Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization.
Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why?
Jonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.
From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Roosevelts death, Salks vaccine was declared officially safe.
In October 2005for the first time in 26 years in the United Statesfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnt at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.

176,41,"Recently, historians found an old well in Jamestown, Virginia.
Historians believe that colonists from England dug the well nearly 400 years ago. Shortly after the well was completed, it dried up. The colonists then used the well as a dump.
The historians have found a piece of old armor in the well. Studying the armor and other ""garbage"" from the well will help us learn about life in early Jamestown.
The history of Jamestown begins in England. On December 20, 1606, three ships sailed from England. The ships were bound for Virginia. After the colonists on the ships landed in Virginia, they built a fort. The colonists arrived in North America 14 years before the Pilgrims.
Most of the colonists came to Virginia to search for treasure. Most did not know how to grow crops to feed themselves. They became so hungry that they ate dogs, rats, and snakes.
Eventually, more people settled in Jamestown. They turned the fort into a town. The colonists began to grow and sell crops. The small fort became the first permanent English settlement in North America.
The ""garbage"" from the well is helping historians better understand how the colonists lived.
""When one stands at Jamestown today, it is hard to imagine how much hope, regret, fear, hatred, hunger, pain, and death were experienced at this place,"" historian Ivor Noel Hume wrote of the fort's earliest colonists.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
The settlers at Jamestown were often hungry.

occurs when harmful substances are released into the air, water, or land. Water gets polluted from sewage, factories, and chemicals. Pollution harms the plants and animals that live in the water. It also makes drinking water unsafe.
The theme of this year's Earth Day is ""Water for Life."" More than 1 billion people around the world do not have clean drinking water. Many children and their families will test the quality of their local water resources on Earth Day.
found underground. Coal, oil, and natural gas are examples of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago.
The burning of fossil fuels pollutes the air and water. Many scientists think that contributes to the overheating of the Earth.
The Earth Day Network wants people to rely more on clean sources of energy that don't pollute the environment. Some of those sources include sun, wind, and hydrogen power. For example, scientists are experimenting with hydrogen-powered cars that do not release harmful exhausts into the air the way today's gasoline-powered cars do.

As of June, about 39 million Hispanic Americans are living in the United States. That number marks a jump from the 2000 census count. At that time, Hispanic Americans numbered about 35 million. Today, the total population of the United States is estimated at more than 288 million people.
Currently, 1 out of every 6 kids in this country is Hispanic. Officials estimate that by 2020, 1 out of 4 children will be Hispanic American.
Hispanic Americans have influenced food, music, and customs in the United States. Hispanic Heritage Month marks a time for Americans to celebrate the traditions and history of Hispanic people. It takes place from September 15 to October 15.
People in communities around the country will celebrate the month with festivals. Many students will recognize the month by learning about the important roles Hispanic people have played in our countrys history.
Ellen Ochoa, the first Hispanic American astronaut, told
that to understand the history of the United States, people should learn about the contributions of different groups, including Hispanic Americans.
People sometimes refer to the United States as a ""melting pot."" That phrase means that people from many different countries have settled here. People of Hispanic heritage, along with people from other cultures, help make the United States strong.
From science to sports, people of Hispanic heritage have contributed to the history of the United States. Take a look at some of these well-known people.
Dr. Novello was born in Puerto Rico. In 1990, she became the first Hispanic American to serve as the U.S. surgeon general. That is the doctor who leads our country on health issues. She worked to improve healthcare for Americans, especially children, women, and minorities.
Gary Soto is an award-winning Hispanic American author. He writes fiction and poetry for adults and children. His writing is based on his experiences growing up as a Mexican American in California. His books, including
Baseball in April and Other Stories and Taking Sides
, are popular with many young readers.
In 1990, Ellen Ochoa became the first Hispanic American woman astronaut when she was accepted into NASAs training program. Ochoa, whose fathers parents were from Mexico, flew her first space shuttle mission in 1993. Since then she has clocked more than 720 hours in flight.
Why is celebrating a variety of cultures important?

Step aside, Power Rangers. There's a new group of heroes in town--
. The three girls--Buttercup, Blossom, and Bubbles--are crime-fighting girls on their own TV show.
The trio of tots is very popular. ""They're special,"" said Laura Fodora, age 12. ""Superheroes are [usually] for boys, and this is for girls."" But believe it or not, more boys than girls actually watch the show.
Today is Friday the 13th. The fear of the number 13 is known as

Powerpuff mania has also hit stores. Kids are buying all kinds of merchandise related to the TV show. You've probably seen pens, pencils, lunch boxes, and backpacks with the Powerpuff Girls on them.

By the end of the year, stores hope to sell more than $200 million worth of Powerpuff stuff to kids and their parents. But the powerful Powerpuff Girls aren't stopping there. A movie is planned for 2002.

180,651,"Fall is here, and lots of boys and girls are hitting the football field. Playing football can be lots of fun, but it can also be dangerous. Kids need to play safely to make sure they have fun and do not get hurt.
Most kids who play football get minor bruises and scrapes. Some injure their knees and even break bones. Others get head concussions. But a 10-year-old girl died on September 2. Doctors said a football injury probably caused the fatality.
Taylor Davison, who lived in Illinois, liked to play football. She was the only girl who played in a football league of 400 players.
Taylor played full-contact football. During a practice in August, she complained of a headache and fell down. Three days later, she died. Doctors said she died as a result of a severe blow to the head, possibly caused by a tackle.
Doctors do not know how many child athletes are injured on the playing field each year. ""There is a serious lack of data about what types of injuries are occurring, said Dr. Reginald Washington, a doctor of sports medicine.
Although not enough is known about sports-related injuries among children, Washington and other doctors say kids and coaches can follow certain safety tips. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh give this advice:
Coaches should receive first-aid training. They should also be trained to recognize whether a child athlete has a severe head injury.
Leagues should have rules that require kids to take time off from playing after they have suffered an injury-especially a head injury.
To make sure they are safe, kids should always wear the proper safety equipment when playing any sport.

181,225,"Why is one of America's most historic areas endangered?
One of the most historic regions in the United States is in trouble. The 175-mile-long area of land stretches through Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
The area is home to more American history than any other slice of land in the country, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. George Washington built his estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison also built their homes in that state. The region at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains includes many battlefields from the Civil War (18611865).
As people construct new houses, roads, and buildings, they are destroying acres of history. Officials say the region has lost more than 150,000 acres of farmland in the past 20 years. That is an area slightly smaller than New York City.
To call attention to the problem, the Trust placed this region on the 2005 list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. The trust works to
""This is where the Civil War was fought,"" says Richard Moe, president of the trust. ""This is where our Founding Fathers lived. ... There are African American sites. There are Native American sites. Our whole nation's history is, in one way or the other, [in this area].""
The following places are in the region between Pennsylvania and Virginia that was added to this year's list of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in the United States.
In 1863, the Battle of Gettysburg was fought in and around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The battle was the turning point of the Civil War.
Monticello was the home of Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States.
Dobbin House was used as a ""station"" for hiding runaway slaves on their dangerous journey to freedom along the Underground Railroad.

184,489,"Going, Going, Gone! African Monkey Declared Extinct
In 1933, a discovery in Africa excited scientists around the world. They had found a
, or kind, of monkey that they had never seen before--the Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey. Now, only 77 years after it was found, that monkey is extinct, scientists recently announced.
No one has seen a Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey for more than 20 years. In 1988, scientists declared the monkey an endangered species. For the last seven years, scientists searched for the monkey in Ghana and Cte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), two countries in western Africa. They found no sign of the animal.
""If [the] red colobus were present near any of our survey routes, it is likely that we would have seen one,"" said scientist John Oates.
Scientists blame the animal's extinction on hunting and the destruction of the forests where it lived.
Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was the first primate --which includes monkeys and apes--to become extinct in nearly 300 years. But scientists say it will not be the last. They worry that many of the 600 other primate species may die out within the next 100 years. Twenty-five species may die out within ten to 20 years. More than 120 primate species may become extinct before the end of this century, said Ross MacPhee of New York City's American Museum of Natural History.
Endangered primates live in Africa, Asia, and South America. Many of those primates live in areas where people are poor and need to hunt for food to survive.
Scientists fear that unlimited hunting could kill off more primates. ""Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was eaten by people. The last ones probably went into someone's pot,"" said scientist John Terborgh.
MacPhee explained that the best way to help primates is to protect them and the areas where they live. ""As long as there are a few individuals, and as long as humans leave them alone, they'll come back [from near extinction].""

The United States is about to reach a huge milestone. The population will hit 300 million sometime in late October, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The estimate is based on a running total of births, deaths, and the number of people moving in and out of the country.

186,85,"Eileen Collins was the first female shuttle commander for NASA.
As a little girl, Eileen Collins dreamed of becoming an astronaut when she grew up. ""I wanted to fly the space shuttle,"" she said. ""When I was very young and first started reading about astronauts, there were no women astronauts.""
After many years of hard work in college, flight school, and the military, Collins's dream came true. She made history in 1995 as the first woman to pilot a space shuttle. In 1999, she made history again when she became the first female shuttle
for NASA, the U.S. space agency. A commander is someone who leads a crew.
Collins may enjoy the distinction of being the first female shuttle commander, but she hopes it's ""not for long!"" A
is an accomplishment that sets a person apart from others. Collins wants more women to follow in her footsteps. ""The young people are going to be the ones to take us on to more exciting adventures,"" she said.
NASA's space shuttles have been confined to Earth since February 1, 2003. On that tragic day, the space shuttle
exploded after a 16-day mission. All seven astronauts aboard were killed.
During liftoff, a piece had broken off
's fuel tank and smashed a hole in the wing's heat-resistant tiles. Those tiles protect the shuttle from the very high temperatures that the craft experiences when speeding back into Earth's atmosphere. The damage went undetected, and
After the accident, space travel seemed riskier than ever. Because of the dangers, some people wondered whether NASA's shuttles would return to space.
Now NASA officials say it's time. Collins will lead the historic return-to-flight mission. The mission is scheduled for May or June on the space shuttle
Although NASA's shuttles have been grounded, they haven't been collecting dust. In fact, Collins and her crew of six astronauts have been very involved in updates to the shuttles to prevent another disaster. (See ""
Collins and NASA officials are confident that the shuttle is safer than ever, and the crew is ready for the upcoming mission. ""It's time for us to go fly,"" said Collins. ""If [the shuttle] wasn't safe, I wouldn't get on it.""

through a slow somersault called a flip. This will be the first time this
, or move, will be done. The flip will help the crew check for any damage to the heat-resistant tiles.
The mission's success will be measured on how the safety improvements made to
work. Collins views a successful, safe mission as a chance to prove to the world that NASA has reduced the risk of space travel.
To Collins and the crew, there is more than success at stake. They believe the mission will honor the lost astronauts of
. ""It's their legacy we're continuing,"" said a crew member.
NASA has been working to make the shuttle safer. New inspection tools and cameras have been installed on
. Changes have been made in the fuel tank design to make sure that no parts fall off during the launch.
Once in space, the astronauts will control a robotic arm called a boom from inside the shuttle. A camera at the end of the boom will look for damage on the shuttle's underside and wings. If damage is detected, the astronauts can attempt to repair it or wait to be rescued at the International Space Station.
Given the dangers of space travel, should the shuttle program continue? Why or why not?

187,710,"Alhaji Babah Sawane was only 10 years old when a rebel group kidnapped him in his African country of Sierra Leone. Taken from his family, he was forced to learn how to fire a rifle. He fought in an army for the next two and a half years.
Peacekeepers from the United Nations (U.N.) helped to free Alhaji. In 2001, he addressed the U.N., asking that organization to help children around the world who are forced to fight in war zones.
""We ask this body on behalf of Sierra Leone to do all they can to bring our sad story to an end,"" he said. ""We want to be able to move about freely in all parts of the country.""
Sierra Leone is just one of an estimated 41 countries around the world that use child soldiers. While the most offenses occur in Africa and Asia, the problem also exists in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East.
Most children who become soldiers come from very poor countries. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers estimates that 300,000 children are fighting as soldiers. In some countries, boys and girls as young as 8 years old are being recruited, or called upon, to fight.
Protecting children in war and conflict zones has become a top job for the United Nations. And the U.N. has made significant progress. In a report issued in December 2002, the U.N. named 28 governments and armed groups that use children to fight their battles.
International law prohibits countries from using children who are younger than 15 years old in combat. However, several U.N. conventions condemn, or do not approve of, having anyone under 18 serve as a soldier. If a country recruits child soldiers, it is violating, or breaking the rule of, international agreements.
Why us it important for governments around the world to protect children?
The U.N. wants to save children like Alhaji Babah Sawane from suffering. The report sends a strong message to governments everywhere: They will be held accountable for their actions.

189,62,"1805 - Surveyors discover the Old Man
1905 - People realize the face is breaking apart.
1915 - Crews work to repair the face.
1928 - Surrounding land becomes a state forest and park.
1945 - Old Man becomes New Hampshires state symbol.
1960 - More efforts are made to protect
2002 - the Old Man from collapsing.
One of New Hampshires most famous faces recently became history. In May, the Old Man of the Mountain crumbled to the ground.
The Old Man, of course, wasnt a person but a rock formation that nature carved out thousands of years ago. With its pointed nose, sharp chin, and heavy forehead, the mountainside looked like the profile of an old mans face. A
is a side view of a face.
Located on Cannon Mountain, the Old Man was a popular tourist spot and a favorite among the people of New Hampshire. In fact, the jagged rock face was considered the state symbol. It appeared on state quarters, road signs, and many souvenirs.
The famous landmark stretched 40 feet high and 25 feet wide. Long concerned that it would collapse, officials made several efforts to save the mountain face. However, the heavy snow and strong winds of this past winter finally caused the cliff to collapse.
Now a special state committee has been set up to decide if the stone profile should be replaced with a man-made face. ""He was part of our history, and he can still be a part of our history if we rebuild him,"" said a New Hampshire man who recalled learning about the famous face in the fourth grade.
Do you think the Old Man should be rebuilt? Why or why not?
However, other people dont necessarily feel the same way. ""Mother Nature put him there, and Mother Nature took him,"" said one committee member. ""To put it back up, to rebuild, wouldnt be the same.""

Tom Lawson, a truck driver, was cruising on Interstate 8 in Arizona recently when he saw a ""green light with a kind of orange tail going [through the] sky.""
People more than 100 miles away saw the bright light. Most observers didn't know what had caused the flash. Some thought they had seen a strange new airplane or even a flying saucer.
Frank So, an astronomer, is fairly sure he knows what caused the flash. ""From the description, it sounds like a very bright meteor,"" said So, who works at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. California.
is a rock from space that people see as a streak of light as it hurtles through Earth's atmosphere. A meteor is also called a shooting star. About 100 million meteors pass through Earth's atmosphere each year.

Does thinking about spiders and their hairy bodies, long legs, and sticky webs make your skin crawl? Many people shiver at the thought of spiders.
That is not the case for Rich Bradley, a real-life Spider-Man. He can't get enough of the creepy crawlers. Bradley is an
(ah-rak-NAH-luh-jist). That is a scientist who studies spiders. Bradley has spent the last 10 years identifying and studying spiders in his home state of Ohio.
, or types, of spiders living in the Buckeye State. He and his team of volunteers have a sharp eye when it comes to collecting the creatures indoors and outdoors. ""They move really fast,"" he told
Scientists say about 3,500 species of spiders live in North America, and nearly 35,000 live worldwide. Spiders live in different places, including gardens, water, deserts, and caves.
Many people think spiders are insects, but they are actually
(ah-RAK-nidz). Ticks and scorpions are also arachnids.
Along with fangs and eight hairy legs, a spider has two body parts--a head and an abdomen. The abdomen contains
, organs that produce silk. A spider uses its silk for many purposes, including weaving webs, protecting its eggs, and catching food.
A spider uses its silk to weave a web.
, or hunters that eat other animals. They dine mostly on insects. Some larger spiders also eat lizards, frogs, and even snakes.
To capture their food, some spiders spin webs. Other types of spiders chase down their
, or poison, from their fangs helps paralyze their food.
Although the hairy creatures spook many people, there isn't much reason to be afraid of spiders. ""Most spiders are not very dangerous,"" said Bradley.
In fact, most are timid creatures that are unable to give humans more than a harmless bite. Although spider venom is deadly to insects, it often has little effect on humans because of our larger size.
Spiders may have a bad reputation for being scary, but they are important to us. Bradley hopes his work shatters some
about spiders. (A myth is a false idea that many people believe is true.)
Spiders eat mosquitoes and other insects that harm farmers' crops and carry diseases. Bradley's research is teaching scientists more about how spiders help control
, or communities of plants and animals. If spiders didn't exist, there would be a lot more insects!
""Spiders are your friends,"" Bradley said. ""They make our life more pleasant.""
Get caught up on some different types of spiders. Spiders come in all shapes and sizes. Crab spiders, jumping spiders, and orb weavers have made Rich Bradley's Ohio count. Find out more about them and other spiders.
Can you guess how this spider got its name? It may not live in the ocean, but it looks like a crab. The crab spider lives on flowers. It can match its body color to the flower's color. That allows it to sneak up on insects.
What a leap! The jumping spider can jump between 10 and 40 inches. To catch an insect, this hunting spider sneaks up on its prey and pounces.
The trap-door spider lives in a tunnel. The spider, common in the southwestern United States, lines the tunnel with silk and fashions a door made of silk and dirt. It peeks out of the slightly open door and grabs passing insects.
The tarantula is a large, hairy spider found mainly in warm regions, including the southwestern United States. Although the tarantula's bite is painful, it is not very poisonous to humans. Tarantulas hunt insects, lizards, mice, toads, and frogs.
E. B. White's famous spider Charlotte was an orb weaver. The orb-weaving spider spins a wheel-shaped web. When an insect flies into the web, the spider races toward its meal.

192,507,"Many people can learn a lesson in good sportsmanship from a Florida Little League team. After losing the Little League World Series to Japan in late August, Florida players didn't sulk. Instead, they were all smiles as they joined Japan's players at the end of the game to celebrate.
""We're number one in the United States, and that's fine with me,"" one Florida player told the
newspaper. ""I felt happy for them,"" he said, referring to the players from the winning team.
A team from Japan has won the Little League World Series three times in the last five years. This year, a team from Tokyo beat Boynton Beach, Florida, 10-1.
The championship game was played in Pennsylvania in front of 41,000 stadium fans. Neither team scored until the fourth inning when Japan brought home eight runs, which included a
. A grand slam is when a batter hits a home run with the bases loaded. Florida scored its first, and only, run in the fifth inning.
Boynton Beach was one of eight teams from Florida to make it to the Little League World Series. However, no Florida team has won the title game yet.
Little League Baseball began in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, in 1939, with 45 boys playing on three teams.
""It's been fun,"" another Florida player told the
. ""I don't care that we lost. We had a blast here.""

193,385,"Rosa's paws are big, her nose is wet, and her coat is fluffy. But she doesn't live a dog's life. The 9-year-old shepherd is a land mine-detection dog.Rosa's nose has sniffed out some of the world's 50 million
. Land mines are explosive devices left in the ground from wars.A land mine can explode if someone touches it, killing or injuring the person. Children often mistake the land mines for toys.
Now Rosa's job is to teach U.S. children about the dangers of land mines so they can help fight the problem. I recently caught up with the clever canine at Paradise Valley Elementary School, located in Casper, Wyoming.I watched as Rosa did her job sniffing out some fake land mines. ""She's cool,"" gushed fifth grader Josh Yelton.
Rosa's visit kicked off the Children Against Land Mines Program, also known as CHAMPS. The goal of the program is to raise money to buy, train, and transport mine-sniffing dogs.Wyoming students raised $5,000 in quarters in just a few short weeks, and adults chipped in an additional $8,000. The money will help sponsor a new dog.
A dog's sense of smell and smarts make it the best land-mine locator. In fact, a team of six humans can search about 120 square feet of land in a day. A team of six dogs can search up to 3,000 square feet in a day's time.
The pooch paid for by the Wyoming students will be named Wyoming. That dog will help find buried land mines in Sri Lanka, a country off the southern coast of India.
Land mines not only injure and kill many people, but they also
, or stop, people from moving around freely. For example, the lush fields of Sri Lanka should be filled with crops. Instead, many fields lie unplanted. Farmers are afraid that mines litter their fields. Wyoming's job will be to help get rid of those land mines.
A Sri Lanka government official told me what a huge effect Wyoming and other mine-sniffing dogs will make in his country.
He said, ""The best part of the CHAMPS program will be when all the land mines have been removed.""
In what other ways do dogs help humans?

194,482,"Cleaning up the environment is in the bag for one student.
For years, Samantha Goldfeld, 11, and her family have carried their own reusable cloth bags to the grocery store. ""My family is saving almost 800 disposable bags each year,"" the sixth grader from Scottsdale, Arizona, told
""Then we got to thinking about what that number would look like if everyone carried cloth bags instead of using paper or plastic.""
More than 500 billion plastic shopping bags are used each year worldwide. Plastic bags pollute city streets, jam recycling machines, and harm animals that get caught in the bags or ingest them. Plus,
are needed to manufacture plastic bags. Nonrenewable sources cannot be replaced.
Now Samantha has the chance to teach others about the benefits of reusable cloth bags. Samantha belongs to the community service group, Roots and Shoots, which will take part in National and Global Youth Service Day. Founded in 1986, the annual project is the largest service event in the world. From April 20 to 22, millions of young people across the globe will participate in volunteer projects, ranging from recycling to tutoring young children.
To encourage more people to use reusable cloth bags, Samantha and other Roots and Shoots members will host an information session. They plan to talk about the benefits of reusable cloth bags and provide tips for reducing plastic bag use.
Samantha is looking forward to the service event. ""Doing community service makes a difference for the environment, animals, and people,"" she says. ""Together we can make a huge difference for our planet.""

195,61,"Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, homeland security has become an important issue for many people.
This week Grade 4 looks at where the two major candidates for president stand on
. Both candidates recognize that the world has changed since the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Each candidate has his own plan to make the United States more secure and keep its citizens safe.
President Bush's antiterrorism program has included removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and restoring freedom to the country. He has also worked to stop terrorist groups in Afghanistan.
In October 2001, shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush signed the Patriot Act. The law gives the government more power to investigate suspected terrorists. President Bush believes that the law should be renewed when it comes up for review in 2005.
Bush also created the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 to keep our airports, borders, and ports safe from attacks. He says that he has worked to improve national security at airports through increased screening and advanced equipment.
Senator Kerry promises to continue to track and stop potential terrorists. He voted for both the Patriot Act and the Department of Homeland Security.
Kerry supports the Patriot Act's renewal in 2005 if some changes are made to it. He argues that certain sections of the Patriot Act violate citizens' rights. Some of those parts include allowing the government to wiretap phone conversations and search business and library records.
If elected, Kerry has a plan to protect the country's borders, ports, and airports. He also says that he will work to give police officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel the information and equipment they need to perform their jobs safely and effectively.

196,349,"Would you spend a month in a small room with 2,700 scorpions? That's what a woman from Malaysia did recently. Malaysia is a country in Southeast Asia.
Malena Hassan, age 24, set a record by living with a roomful of scorpions, which are poisonous, for 30 days.
During her monthlong ordeal, Hassan was stung seven times and as a result, suffered from a high fever.

197,528,"Steroid scandal blocks slugger from Hall of Fame.
Two star athletes will join the National Baseball Hall of Fame this summerCal Ripken Jr. and Tony Gwynn. Former St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire, however, will have to wait for admission.
McGwire didn't come close to receiving the 75 percent of the votes required for a player to be elected. This is the first year McGwire was
or qualified, for the honor. (To be on the ballot, an athlete must be retired for at least five years.)
when he broke a major-league record with 70 home runs in the 1998 season. Steroids are drugs that build up muscles to increase strength. During his career, McGwire hit 583 home runs, the seventh highest of all time. Before joining the Cardinals, he played first base for the Oakland Athletics.
Retired Baltimore Orioles shortstop Ripken and San Diego Padres outfielder Gwynn have never been suspected of using steroids. They are admired by many baseball fans for their fairness and honesty. Both played their entire careers on one team (see ""
""). In July, the pair will be
or admitted, into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.
McGwire has never openly admitted to steroid use. However, during a hearing before the U.S. Congress in 2005, he did not deny using the muscle-building drugs. That testimony has led many people to believe that McGwire did use steroids. In 2002, Major League Baseball banned the use of the drugs, which are
After learning he was not voted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, McGwire defended his baseball career. ""I had an absolutely wonderful career that I'm very proud of,"" he told the
newspaper of California State University, Fullerton. McGwire added that he wasn't in control of getting into the Hall of Fame. ""I was in control of hitting the ball.""
Check out the stats for the two newest members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.
Ripken grew up near Baltimore, Maryland, where he played pro baseball throughout his 21-year career. He was a two-time American League Most Valuable Player and set a record for playing the most games in a row: 2,632.
Gwynn grew up in California, where he played basketball and baseball. He decided to play baseball professionally and became one of the sport's best hitters. During his 20-year career, he led the National League in batting average eight times.

198,348,"As firefighters battle the flames, how do some fires help Mother Nature?
Whoosh! Within seconds, a spark sets off large flames. The flames of a wildfire tear through a forest, destroying thousands of acres of trees and brush and threatening the homes of people and animals.
From California to Colorado and from Alaska to Arizona, firefighters have been battling thousands of wildfires this year. Wildfire season began in June and will last through November. So far, the flames have destroyed more than 3 million acres in the United Statesan area about the size of New Jersey!
The states in red show where the most wildfires have occurred this year.
Most wildfires are started naturally, either by lightning or from the sun's heat. Others are accidentally started by careless humans who leave campfires burning.
Hot, dry weather has caused most of this season's wildfires to spread. ""This year is unique,"" Rose Davis, an official at the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center, told
. Davis explained that the Northwest is suffering a
. A drought is a long period of dry weather with little rain. In the Southwest, heavy rains in the spring caused a lot of new grass to grow. The new grass burns quickly when it dries out.
Firefighters have been fighting the scorching flames from the ground and the air. Specially trained firefighters called
parachute from planes or helicopters to reach
fires. Because smoke jumpers leap into out-of-the-way areas, they carry enough food and water with them to survive for several days.
Although wildfires can be very dangerous, they are not all bad. In areas where few people live, officials monitor the wildfires. Sometimes, officials allow them to burn because the fires help the environment and keep forests healthy. ""If fires are going to spread to people's homes and property, we have to put them out,"" smoke jumper Lori Messenger told
Wildfires are like nature's housekeeperand forests come back to life after fires. ""Fire is a natural part of our forests,"" says Messenger. ""The fires kill the less healthy, diseased trees. They clean out the brush to make space for animals to graze on the new grass that grows.""
Some plants also need heat from a fire to help them release their seeds, which grow into new plants after a fire. Fire is nature's way of recycling dead plants into the soil. The dead plants help return nutrients to the soil.
Although some animals die, many creatures have ways of protecting themselves. Large animals, such as deer, moose, and buffalo, head to safety. Small animals, such as snakes, toads, and mice, burrow in the ground.
""It's important to realize that fires are an important part of what happens in a forest,"" says Messenger. ""It's a complicated balance, and people who manage the forest have to make good decisions about what fires will be fought and what fires will be left to burn.""
What qualities do you think a person needs to be a smoke jumper?
A fire requires three ingredients to burnheat, fuel, and oxygen. The combination of those three building blocks is referred to as the fire triangle.

Our classroom play celebrates Philadelphia's hometown hero. Discover how his hard work helped to improve the lives of all Americans.
Honor the 300th birthday of one of our countrys greatest thinkers, inventors, and statesmen with our classroom play.
Each morning, Benjamin Franklin asked himself, ""What good shall I do today?"" And that is how he lived his life.
His can-do attitude launched him into the history books as one of Americas most famous citizens. Ben was a printer, a writer, an inventor, a community leader, and a founder of our nation.
Ben was born in a cottage in Boston on January 17, 1706. He attended school only between the ages of 8 and 10. Bens education was cut short because his family was poor and needed him to work.
His love of learning, however, stayed with him throughout his life. Ben read all the time. He often went without food to buy books! At 12, he began his lifelong love of printing.
In honor of the 300th anniversary of Bens birth, our three-act play looks at some key events in the life of this great American. Find out how his good deeds helped shape the history of our country.
ACT 1: Ben the Young Man, Boston, 1718-1723
Bens older brother, James, owns a printing press that publishes a very popular newspaper,
In 1718, Bens father decides that 12-year-old Ben should work for James.
At that time, Ben signs a document promising he will work for his brother until he is 21, without pay. In return, his brother is to provide Ben with food and clothes.
Ben likes to read and is a good editor and proofreader. Over the next few years, he learns all about printingand even begins writing letters to the newspaper under a different name. Thanks to Bens sense of humor and clever writing in those letters,
becomes one of the most-read newspapers in Boston.
James finds out that the letters are from his brother and he becomes jealous of Ben. James is furious and vows never to publish any of Bens writing again. He also finds fault with Bens work, even though Ben rarely makes errors.
I know I am a better printer than he is.
You cant leave! You have to work for me until you are 21!
Youll never find a job in this city! Youll come crawling back to me.
But Ben never comes back to his brother. Instead, he leaves in the early morning and runs away to New York City, in hopes of finding work as a printer. After not finding a job there, he heads to New Jersey where he boards a boat to Philadelphia.
The journey is three days long, and Ben is dirty, hungry, and penniless. But Philadelphia is a lively city, and Ben loves it.
ACT 2: Ben the Community Leader, Philadelphia, 1723-1740s
After arriving in Philadelphia, Ben works to establish himself as a printer. In 1728, he opens a printing shop and begins publishing his own newspaper,
A few years later, he also publishes
The book includes weather forecasts, recipes, and jokes. It also contains some of Bens sayings, such as ""Well done is better than well said."" The almanac becomes a best seller and makes Ben wealthy.
Although Ben works to better himself,it is also important to him to help the community. He considers Philadelphia his hometown and works to make life in the city better.
Ben starts projects to pave and sweep Philadelphias streets. He redesigns the citys streetlights so that roads are safe at night.
Ben also helps set up the first public library, hospital, and volunteer fire department. At this time, most houses in Philadelphia are made of wood and stand side by side. When a fire breaks out, it can destroy an entire neighborhood.
Extra! Extra! Fire destroys row houses on Market Street!
We need to train men to fight fires so that this doesnt keep happening.
Ben persuades more than 30 men to form the Union Fire Company.
We nominate Ben as our fire chief.
Ben is appointed fire chief. He makes sure that firefighters are trained to put out fires and rescue people.

The Union Fire Company meets once a month to discuss fire prevention. Ben also publishes fire prevention tips in his newspaper.
Bens ideas for Philadelphia help shape how fire departments, hospitals, libraries, and post offices work in other cities.
ACT 3: Ben the Statesman, Philadelphia, 1776
Along with his work in Philadelphia, Ben helps change the course of American history.
At the time, America is made up of 13 Colonies ruled by Britain. England has passed many laws that the Colonists think are unfair.
Ben works to mend the relationship between the Colonies and Britains ruler, King George III.
Despite his efforts, the Colonies decide to break away from Britain. They fight Britain in the Revolutionary War (1775-1783).
Ben is appointed to the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence. This document frees the Colonies from Britains rule.
We have to decide who should write the Declaration of Independence.
I wont. Many people disagree with my opinions.
I cant. I am not a writer.
I am unsure about independence from Britain.
You must write this very important document. Your writing style is perfect.
When Thomas Jefferson finishes his draft, he shows it to Ben.
Ive made small changes. For example, you wrote, sacred and undeniable, and I changed that phrase to make it stronger.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.
On July 4, a group of representatives from the 13 Colonies approve the Declaration of Independence and some people sign the document.
This for King George, so he can read it without his glasses.
On August 2, Ben and others also sign the document. They know they are risking everything for freedom from Britain.
Seven years later, in 1783, Ben negotiates the treaty that ends the Revolutionary War. In 1787, at age 81, he signs the U.S. Constitution.
Ben Franklin dies on April 17, 1790, at the age of 84. He is buried in Philadelphia. In honor of the 300th anniversary of his birth, people across the country will celebrate the life of this remarkable man.
If you could award a medal to Ben Franklin for one of his achievements, which accomplishment would it be? Why?

If you have access to a computer, you can log on to the Internet to find information and go to places without ever leaving home.
The Net also has some sites that aren't so nice. Many stories in the news lately have been about kids who have gotten into trouble because they weren't careful about using the Net.
The number of kids who use the Net has exploded in the past few years. According to studies by eMarketer, an Internet company that studies who uses the Net, the number of U.S. kids between ages 5 and 13 going online at home will grow from 11 million in 1999 to 22 million in 2003.
Not all kids are surfing the Internet safely. Many kids are giving out information that they shouldn't reveal on the Net, such as their real last names, addresses, and phone numbers. Some kids have online conversations with people who mean them harm or could get them into trouble.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), you can have fun on the Net without putting yourself at risk if you stick to the following rules. The FBI says:
meet someone or have him or her visit you without your parents' permission.
your parents if you get an e-mail that makes you feel uncomfortable.

201,789,"Richard Rodriguez recently set a new world's record for riding a roller coaster. He rode a coaster for 2,000 bone-rattling hours. That's about 22,655 miles.
To set the record, Rodriguez (front) rode a roller coaster at Blackpool Pleasure Beach, an amusement park in England, for 22 hours a day for 90 days. After setting the record, Rodriguez said, ""It was a small step for me, but a giant roller coaster ride for mankind.""
Setting records for riding roller coasters isn't new to Rodriguez. He set his first record in 1977, when he rode a coaster for 103 hours and 55 minutes. He has broken that record many times in the last 23 years.

202,326,"Many schools across the country are closed on November 11 to observe Veterans Day. This holiday is set aside to honor people who have served the United States in war.
According to the Pentagon, 150,000 American troops served in the war against Iraq, and 130,000 troops remain overseas. The Pentagon houses the four branches of the U.S. military, which include the Army, Marines, Navy, and Air Force.
On November 11, many ceremonies will take place to thank the members of the U.S. military who helped remove Saddam Hussein from power. They will also remember veterans who served in other U.S. wars.
Master Sergeant Emma Krouser served in the 3rd Infantry Division that led the assault on Baghdad. She described her experience in Iraq this summer.
""The people were waving flags... and giving soldiers the thumbs-up sign,"" Krouser told
. ""It really made me appreciate the freedoms we take for granted in this country.""

203,734,"Some call his journey remarkable. Others call it just plain crazy. For Christopher Swain, it was the swim of a lifetime.
Swain recently made history as the first person to swim the entire length of the Columbia River. In July 2003, the Oregon man ended a yearlong journey to raise awareness about pollution in that river. His 1,243-mile trip began in Canada and ended where the river meets the ocean-the Pacific Ocean.
Why did he do it? ""Every waterway needs a champion,"" Swain told
. ""I learned as much as I could about the river so I could see what I could do to clean it up.""
In 1805, explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were journeying west to find a passage to the Pacific Ocean. At that time, they described the Columbia River as clear, free flowing, and teeming with, or full of, salmon.
The Columbia River has changed since the days of Lewis and Clark's journey. Today, it is ravaged by
, or damage, the air, water, or land. Chemicals and waste from factories and towns contribute to water pollution. The pollution has caused a drop in the river's salmon population.
that have been built along the river mean the Columbia no longer flows freely. The dams are water barriers that provide electricity, control flooding, and carry water to farms.
The pollution in the river inspired Swain to take action. Wearing out seven wetsuits along the way and battling several colds, Swain braved water temperatures as low as 38 degrees. Followed by a boat, he swam between 5 and 25 miles a day through the polluted water.
""The Columbia River is a contaminated beauty,"" Swain told
. ""It runs through some of the most majestic landscapes on Earth.""
Despite the pollution, Swain is hopeful about the future of the river. During his journey, he spoke with nearly 13,000 people, including 8,000 schoolchildren, about keeping the river clean.
""With all the affection for the river, we have a chance to turn the [pollution problem] around,"" Swain said. ""Kids know that they want clean water.""
Earlier last year, Swain received the International Earth Day Award for protecting the Columbia River. And he hasn't finished making a splash yet! Later this year, he plans to swim in Lake Champlain, which borders Vermont and New York, the Hudson River in New York, and the Charles River in Boston.
How will Swain celebrate Earth Day on April 22? ""I will be in an East Coast waterway on Earth Day,"" he promised.
Each year, people celebrate Earth Day on April 22. They participate in community activities and care for the environment.
This year, the Earth Day theme is ""Water for Life."" Here are some ways experts say that kids can help protect water:
You can conserve water by turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth.
Organize a beach or river cleanup. Beach garbage, such as plastic rings, can get tangled around sea creatures and injure or harm them.
Make sure to put trash in its proper place-not in the water or down a drain.
What does Swain mean when he refers to the river as a ""contaminated beauty""?

206,209,"Pilots follow monarchs on the move from Canada to Mexico.
Each fall, the skies between eastern Canada and the mountains of central Mexico fill with orange-and-black monarch butterflies. Along their journey, millions of butterflies fight fierce winds and flee predators. Once they reach their destination, monarchs cover trees with their bright, shimmering wings.
This year, the monarchs will not be flying alone. Butterfly lovers are accompanying them on their 3,415-mile journey. They are riding in a light aircraft called an
Their aircraft is painted to resemble the orange, black, and white wings of the monarch.
or move from one place to another. Beginning in early August, the butterflies head south for the winter months.
Most monarchs travel from Canada to Mexico. Others travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north. They are the only insects to make such a long round-trip migration.
Mexican pilot Francisco Gutierrez and a crew of other pilots from Canada and the United States departed from Quebec, Canada, on August 15. The group plans to arrive in Mexico on November 2.
The crew hopes to raise awareness about the monarchs' fragile habitats. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning the forests that protect the butterflies from rain and cold.
No one has ever followed the butterflies in the air for their entire journey. Doing so can teach scientists how the winged insects deal with wind patterns and difficult weather. Gutierrez says, ""It's going to be an adventure.""

207,107,"Did you ever open a bag of cookies and wonder why they were broken into so many pieces? Scientists now know why. Contrary to popular belief, it has nothing to do with the way the cookies were packaged, loaded on shelves, or transported from the store to your home.
According to scientists in England, cookies pick up moisture as they cool after coming out of the oven. The moisture causes the cookies to expand and contract, which results in cracks. The cracks cause cookies to easily break when they're moved or packaged.

208,533,"After nearly two decades of rest, a sleeping giant has started to awaken. Mount St. Helens in Washington state is showing signs of life and has left scientists scrambling to determine if it will blow its top.
""Volcanoes are just like people--they're awake and active, and they go to sleep,""
. A volcanologist is a scientist who studies volcanoes.
In September, Mount St. Helens began blowing large
, or clouds of steam, thousands of feet into the air. The 8,364-foot mountain is not the only restless volcano in the country. Scientists are also paying close attention to awakened volcanoes in Alaska and Hawaii.

Steam blasts from a crater on Mount St. Helens in October 2004.
Volcanoes can remain quiet for years and then erupt violently, sometimes without warning. Using the latest technology, scientists hope to better
Mount St. Helens is located in Washington.
Scientists say Mount St. Helens is one of the most closely monitored volcanoes and the most active volcano in the lower 48 states. Mount St. Helens is also among 13 active volcanoes that are located in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. That range is home to several powerful volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier and Mount Hood.
Although scientists say a large eruption at Mount St. Helens is unlikely, they are cautious because of the volcano's history. Officials have sealed off a 5-mile area around the volcano.
Mount St. Helens erupted with tremendous force in May 1980, blowing more than 1,300 feet off its top and killing 57 people. The blast destroyed thousands of acres of forest and scattered ash for thousands of miles. Mount St. Helens continued to rumble until 1986 but has been quiet since that time.
How can scientists tell when a volcano will awaken from its slumber? ""We measure earthquake activity, changes in the mountain, and volcanic gases,"" said Driedger.
Although scientists can't tell exactly when or with what force a volcano will blow its top, they rely on advanced equipment to help them predict eruptions. Special devices called
are installed around volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens to detect earthquakes. Earthquakes always strike before a volcano erupts.
Volcanoes are mountains where hot, liquid rock called magma deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure can cause magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the crater at the top of the volcano and vents, or cracks, along its side. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called lava. Once lava cools, it hardens into rock.
Scientists use special global positioning instruments to measure movements on the slopes of the mountain--a clue to the buildup of
. Magma is red-hot molten rock located inside the volcano. It is called
when it pours out of the volcano.
As magma rises, volcanoes release carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Sensors on helicopters test the air for gases that signal rising magma. ""The gases are like telegrams that tell us what's going on inside the volcano,"" said Driedger.
More than 500 million people around the world live near active volcanoes. Monitoring volcanoes is a dangerous job, but scientists take precautions to stay safe.
""By watching volcanoes, we learn how they work,"" said Driedger. ""The more we know, the better prepared we can be to save property and lives.""
Besides volcanoes, what natural disasters are hard for scientists to predict? Why?

209,151,"or the NBA playoffs? The TV-Turnoff Network wants you to do just thatand imagine what you can do instead of watching TV.
As a result, the theme of TV-Turnoff Week is ""Imagine."" The celebration takes place from April 24 to April 30. During the weeklong event, TV-Turnoff officials hope to raise awareness about the harmful effects of too much television.
Each American watches, on average, more than four hours of television per day, according to RealVision and the TV-Turnoff Network. In fact, kids spend more time in front of the television (1,023 hours per year) than in school (900 hours per year)!
Experts say that too much time in front of the TV can have a negative effect on children. Kids dont do as well in school and dont get enough exercise to stay in shape.
Robert Kesten, executive director of the TV-Turnoff Network, hopes that kids will turn off the television and get involved with other interests. ""Turning off the television allows children to see the real world,"" Kesten told
""We think kids will be surprised with the new discoveries they will make if they choose to shut off the TV for a week.""

1. This is an extract from the Anthony Shea Community School newsletter:
During the past three years, mobile phones have become more and more popular. Growing numbers of our students bring them to school, and parents encourage this as they can stay in touch with their children and know they are safe. However, many of our students keep their phone on during the day which can disturb lessons. A number of phone thefts have also occurred recently, both in and out of school. I would like to call a meeting to discuss this issue with staff, parents and students. I don't want to ban them, but we must agree on how they can be used sensibly and safely.
Write a speech to be given at this meeting analysing the advantages and disadvantages of allowing mobiles in school and suggest how they can be used sensibly and safely.
2. Read this extract, which considers the issue of horror movies:
As a parent, I have constant battles over TV and films. My children feel they should be allowed to watch whatever they want, no matter how violent, gory or creepy. They say it's just entertainment, and that it has no effect on them. I don't agree! Many of the films are rated 18, and my oldest is 14. I'm afraid my kids will become more aggressive and uncaring towards people, or that they might end up seeing something which really disturbs them.
Write an article for your school magazine commenting on why horror movies are popular with teenagers and explaining the advantages and disadvantages of parents banning them at home.

212,482,"A sentence is made up of words put together to do a certain job.
Let's take a look at what those pieces are and how they fit together to make a sentence.
First, we have words. Words are the smallest meaningful bits of sense.
Each of these words does a different job.
is a verb - it tells us what happens in a sentence.
is a noun - it names things in a sentence.
is an adjective - it gives us more detail about a noun.
We put words together to make a
A phrase is a short, single piece of information:
We use phrases to make a clause.
A clause is a larger word group that includes a little more information. It consists at least two phrases - one is a noun phrase known as the subject, and the other is the verb.
In this clause, the noun phrase is
This now takes us to the sentence.
If we put a capital letter at the beginning of the clause we've used, and a full stop at the end, we have a sentence.
. A simple sentence consists of one clause that has a subject and a verb. A simple sentence puts across one simple idea.
A complex sentence is used to put across more
ideas. A complex sentence contains one main clause that can make sense on its own, and one or more minor clauses that are linked to it.
The main clause is the 'big dog barked' because it has a subject and a verb and makes sense by itself.
The minor clause is 'When I arrived'. Although it is a clause with a subject and a verb, it doesn't make sense on its own, it needs a main clause.
We can add more minor clauses to make a more complex sentence.
We can even split the main clause with a minor clause and still have a complex sentence.

213,31,"> Inequalities and Simultaneous Equations - Algebra
You can solve simultaneous equations by adding or subtracting the two equations from each other.
Add the two equations together and you will find that the y disappears:
3x + 2x + y - y = 9 + 1
6 - 5 = 1 (which is correct)
To make the 3x's disappear we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
3x - 3x + 2y - (-y) = 8 - 5
6 - 1 = 5 (which is correct)
So the solution is x = 2, y = 1

Let's look at two examples to see the difference between heat and temperature.
A swimming pool at 30C is at a lower temperature than a cup of tea at 80C. But the swimming pool contains more water, so it stores more thermal energy than the cup of tea.
To boil water we must increase its temperature to 100C. It takes longer to boil a large beaker of water than a small beaker because the large beaker contains more water and needs more thermal energy to reach 100C.

Explore, imagine and entertain - Ending short-stories
The other problem some writers have is ending the story. It doesn't matter if it's a happy ending or not, but it has to make sense. There are lots of ways of ending, such as:
, where we have to wait until the final moment until we know. For instance, the spy who manages to stop the bomb two seconds before it explodes.
, where we are fairly sure about something, but in the final part everything changes. For example, we then learn that this is a fake bomb, and the real one is hidden somewhere else and will explode in five minutes.
, where the story stops, but we aren't sure what has actually happened at the end. For instance, the bomb is defused and everyone is safe. But then an army commander reports the theft of another bomb... only this time twice as powerful.
However, there are two endings to avoid:
, where a bomb will inevitably explode and as it does, the narrator wakes up - it was all a dream. Some English teachers don't mind this sort of thing, but others hate it. You have been warned.
, where the secret agent suddenly stops worrying about the bomb, retires, and goes off to play golf. This is even worse, and no-one likes it because the ending has nothing to do with the story.
Whatever kind of story you write, decide on your ending and include it in your plan.
Writing that explores, imagines or entertains depends on being creative. You need to experiment a little and not be frightened to try something new.

220,77,"We often make judgments as to whether an event will take place, and use words to describe how probable that event is. For example, we might say that it is likely that the sun will come up tomorrow, or that it is impossible to find somebody who is more than 3m tall.
Probabilities can be written as fractions, decimals or percentages.
You can also use a probability scale, starting at 0 (impossible) and ending at 1 (certain).
Here are some events placed on the probability scale.

Ivan Pavlov (1849 to 1936) was a Russian scientist who investigated conditioning. He discovered that dogs produced extra saliva when they were offered food. This is a natural response to a stimulus - food makes a dog's mouth water. The saliva produced is needed to start digesting food and to make swallowing food easier.
Pavlov noticed that they also did this when the person who fed them came into the room, even if the person had not brought any food. Pavlov went on to ring a bell at the start of feeding time, and eventually the dogs produced extra saliva when they heard the bell, before any food was brought in.
A dog salivating when it hears a bell is not a natural response. They would not do this without being conditioned to do so. The behaviour has been learned. It's called a
People and animals can be conditioned to avoid certain things. For example, grazing animals get an unpleasant electric shock when they touch an electric fence. They eventually avoid the fence, even when it is turned off.
Is it instinct or conditioning that makes you study science?

Mercury is the only metal that is liquid at standard room temperature and pressure
Mercury is the only liquid metal at room temperature.
These are iron, cobalt and nickel. Steel is a mixture of elements but mostly iron, so it is also magnetic. The other metals are not magnetic.
You may have to match the use of a metal with a property that makes it suitable for that use. For example, copper is used for electrical wiring because it is a good conductor of electricity, not because it is a good conductor of heat.

Graphs - Plotting ax + by = c
Tables work well when you're plotting graphs of the form y = mx + c, but what happens when the equation isn't in this form?
Plot the graph of 2y - 4x = 3
in the form y = mx + c. You need to rearrange the equation into a form with just the y value on the left of the equation.
So add 4x to both sides to give
To find y divide both sides by 2 to give
Now that you have found the equation in terms of y, you can plot the graph using the usual method.

227,374,"Now consider the following extract. Read through it carefully and note down three things you think it tells us about the main character. Once you've done this, compare your ideas against ours.
Stanley didn't have many friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.
What does this extract show us about the main character?
Stanley is another big male, but it is clear that the writer wants us to react differently to him than we did to Jim Wellings in the earlier extract.
Stanley is a lonely boy, because he ""didn't have many friends at home"". He is bullied and teased, even by adults. The fact that the teacher causes him ""embarrassment"" by showing him up in front of the class proves that he feels uncomfortable about his weight.

Energy transfer and storage - Energy basics
Energy can be stored or transferred from place to place in different ways. Let's look at some examples.
things have kinetic energy. The heavier a thing is and the faster it moves the more kinetic energy it has. All moving things have kinetic energy, even very large things, like planets, and very small ones, like atoms.
A vibrating drum and a plucked guitar string transfer energy to the air as
. Kinetic energy from the moving air molecules transfers the sound energy to your eardrum.
Thermal energy is what we call energy that comes from
. A cup of hot tea has thermal energy in the form of kinetic energy from its particles. Some of this energy is transferred to the particles in cold milk, which you pour in to make the tea cooler.
release energy. For example, when an explosive goes off, chemical energy stored in it is transferred to the surroundings as
energy in moving charges in wires. For example, electrical energy is transferred to the surroundings by the lamp as
energy because of its position above the ground and the pull of gravity. This energy is called
. This is the energy it would release if it fell. As the rock falls to the ground, the gravitational potential energy is transferred as kinetic energy.

Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.
For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.
By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.
You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:
Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:
In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:
To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:
Divide both sides by 2, to give:
a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7
b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7
When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers.
For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7.
7 + 5 does equal 12, so your answer is correct.

Magnets and electric current - Bar magnets
Before we look at electromagnets let's recap
magnets. This means that their magnetism is there all the time and cannot be turned on or off. They have two poles:
The north pole is normally shown as
Magnets are made from magnetic materials. These are metals that can be magnetised or will be attracted to a magnet. Most materials are not magnetic, but
is mostly iron, so steel is magnetic too.
If you bring two bar magnets together, there are two things that can happen:
if you bring a north pole and a south pole together, they
if you bring two north poles together, or two south poles together, they
and the magnets push each other away.
We say that unlike poles attract, and like poles repel.
How can you test if a piece of metal is a magnet. Seeing if it sticks to a magnet is not a good test, because unmagnetised iron, steel, cobalt and nickel objects will be attracted to either pole of a magnet.
So you can't test for what it is attracted to. But you can test what it repels:
You can only show that an object is a magnet if it repels a known magnet.

232,101,"Try out these example questions about relative frequency.
Q1. 100 people were asked whether they were left-handed. Four people answered 'yes'. What is the relative frequency of 'left-handed'?
Q2. A white counter was taken from a bag of different coloured counters, and then replaced. The relative frequency of getting a white counter was found to be 0.3. If the bag contained 20 counters, estimate the number of white counters.
A1. The relative frequency is 4/100 =

233,127,"There are two main types of language: literal and figurative.
Literal language is explicit, obvious, out in the open and plainly stated. It is a major part of non-fiction texts, but can also be found in fiction.
Figurative language infers or suggests things rather than stating them. Figurative language can give a text more richness and depth. It is often found in fiction texts and autobiographies, but can also be found in non-fiction.

> The rock cycle - Metamorphic rocks
Metamorphic rocks are the third type we'll look at. They formed from other rocks that are changed because of heat or pressure.
Earth movements can cause rocks to be deeply buried or squeezed. As a result, the rocks are
. They do not melt, but the minerals they contain are changed chemically, forming
Sometimes, metamorphic rocks are formed when rocks are close to some molten magma, and so get heated up.
Metamorphic rocks may form from rocks heated by magma
Remember that metamorphic rocks are not made from melting rock. (Rocks that do melt form igneous rocks instead.)
When a metamorphic rock is formed under pressure, its crystals become arranged in layers.
, which is formed from shale, is like this. Slate is useful for making roof tiles because its layers can be split into separate flat sheets.
is another example of a metamorphic rock. It is formed from limestone.
Metamorphic rocks sometimes contain fossils if they were formed from a sedimentary rock, but the fossils are usually squashed out of shape.

239,16,"Pythagoras' Theorem states that for all right-angled triangles,
'The square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides'
. (The hypotenuse is the longest side and it's always opposite the right angle)
the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides.
and angle A is a right angle.
Pythagoras' Theorem only works for right-angled triangles, so you can use it to test whether a triangle has a right angle.
Which of the following triangles is right-angled?

244,535,"> Linear sequences - Finding the nth term
Linear sequences - Finding the nth term
Sometimes, rather than finding the next number in a linear sequence, you want to find the 41
Writing out 41 or 110 numbers takes a long time, so you can use a general rule.
To find the value of any term in a sequence, use the n
1st = 5 (5  1); 2nd = 10 (5  2); 3rd = 15 (5  3)
term is 5  n or 5n
term, work out 5  10 = 50. To find the 7
term, work out 5  7 = 35
term is 5  41 = 205 and the 110
term is 5  110 = 550
term of this sequence: 2, 4, 6, ... ?
term = 20. To work this out, n = 10, so 2n = 2  10 = 20

247,229,"should introduce the subject. The writer wants to catch the reader's attention and hint at what is to come. If the beginning is poor, the reader could lose interest quickly and stop reading.
section presents the main ideas, thoughts, actions and so on. These will often be presented in stages or with several twists and turns of argument.
generally sums up the piece of text, or makes a final point, or brings a conclusion to a story.
It can add to your marks in a test if you show a plan of how you are going to answer a long question.
A writer will usually plan not only what they are going to write, but also how they are going to write it. For example, how would a writer plan a magazine article about the benefits of health and fitness?
Imagine you are writing a plan for a magazine article about fitness and health.
Beginning: do people need to be fit?
Health angle  unfit people can need more health care
Ending: get fit and eat healthy food and you will benefit
This is an example of quite a straightforward plan. Each box contains a summary of a paragraph and they are organised in a way that steers the reader through a journey. Obviously, the more complex the issue, argument, story, and so on, the more complex the plan will be.

The weathering of rocks by chemicals is called chemical weathering. Rainwater is naturally slightly acidic because
from the air dissolves in it. Minerals in rocks may react with the rainwater, causing the rock to be weathered.
Some types of rock are easily weathered by chemicals. For example,
are made of a mineral called calcium carbonate. When acidic rainwater falls on limestone or chalk, a chemical reaction happens. New soluble substances are formed in the reaction. These are washed away and the rock is weathered.
Chemical weathering can hollow out caves form and make cliffs fall away.
are hard rocks that are weathered only slowly. Still some of their minerals do react with the acids in rainwater to form new, weaker substances that crumble and fall away.
When fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas are burned,
escape into the air. These dissolve in the water in the clouds and make the rainwater more acidic than normal. When this happens, we call the rain '
Acid rain makes chemical weathering happen more quickly. Buildings and statues made from rock are damaged as a result. This is worse when the rock is limestone rather than granite. Acid rain also kills trees and fish.

Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts
A salt is always made when an acid is neutralised by a base. But the exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used.
The name of a salt has two parts:
the first part comes from the metal in the base used
the second part comes from the acid that was used
Where does the name potassium nitrate come from?
These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt:
How can we make copper sulfate? The first part of the name is 'copper', so we need a base containing copper. We could use copper oxide or copper carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'sulfate', so we need to use sulfuric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
copper sulfate + water + carbon dioixde
How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
sodium chloride + water + carbon dioxide
It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced.

252,164,"The beginning, or opening, is one of the most important sections of your writing. It should grab the reader's attention and make them want to read on. For instance, which is the best beginning for a ghost story?
a) The house was built in 1975. It was a typical semi-detached, but it did have quite an impressive front door. Most of the windows were double glazed and the garden was quite neat.
b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.
There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.
So you need to think about TAP (text, audience and purpose) and make a good start to your writing. You should try to 'set a context', which is like setting the scene. So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on.
a) The subject I am going to write about today is why the local park should not be closed.
b) Have you ever stopped to wonder how many hundreds of people make regular use of our Memorial Park?
a) It is unlikely that newspaper readers who enjoy all the things that our park has to offer will want it to disappear forever under tons of concrete.
b) 'Ashfield Park will be ruined,' claim protestors who held a meeting last night to organise opposition to the council's plans for a car park.
It should be clear that the ""b"" versions are better - they fit the style and show that the writer has used TAP to make their writing work. Remember - you need to make it interesting right from the start.

forces. These forces act in the opposite direction to the movement. Friction makes it harder for things to move.
friction between our shoes and the floor stop us from slipping
friction between tyres and the road stop cars from skidding
friction between the brakes and wheel help bikes and cars slow down
Frictional forces are much smaller on smooth surfaces than on rough surfaces, which is why we slide on ice.
Friction can also be unhelpful. If you don't lubricate your bike regularly with oil, the friction in the chain and axles increases. Your bike will be noisy and difficult to pedal.
When there is a lot of friction between moving parts, energy is lost to the surroundings as
. Think of what happens when you rub your hands together quickly. The friction warms them up.
as they move. Air resistance is caused by the frictional forces of the air against the vehicle. The faster the vehicle moves, the bigger the air resistance becomes. The top speed of a vehicle is reached when the force from the cyclist or engine is balanced by air resistance.
Racing cyclists crouch down low on their bikes to
the air resistance on them. This helps them to cycle faster. They also wear streamlined helmets. These have special, smooth shapes that allow the air to flow over the cyclist more easily.
Modern cars are also streamlined. Their smooth shapes make the air resistance smaller, which allows them to travel further on the same amount of fuel.

259,89,"> Measures of average - The mode
The mode is the only average that can have more than one value.
When finding the mode, it helps to order the numbers first.
Find the mode of each of the following sets of numbers:
a) 3, 7, 1, 3, 4, 8, 3
b) 2, 7, 2, 1, 4, 7, 3
a) Start by placing the numbers in order:
1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 8
The number 3 occurs most often so the mode is
b) Start by placing the numbers in order:
1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 7
The numbers 2 and 7 occur more often than all other numbers so the modes are
In this frequency table, the mode is the value with the highest frequency:
In this example the modal shoe size is 7, because more people take size 7 than any other size.

Diet, drugs and health - Digestion and enzymes
Our teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. Enzymes are needed so that this break-down happens quickly enough to be useful.
Take care - enzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients:
. Carbohydrase enzymes break down starch into sugars.
The saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough, the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet.
. Protease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. Digestion of proteins in the stomach is helped by
, which is strong hydrochloric acid. This also kills harmful micro-organisms that may be in the food.
Lipase enzymes break down fat into fatty acids and glycerol. Digestion of fat in the
, made in the liver. Bile breaks the fat into small droplets that are easier for the lipase enzymes to work on.
are already small enough to be absorbed by the body without being broken down, so they are not digested.
, which is why it cannot be absorbed by the body.

Compounds and mixtures - Atoms and molecules
Remember that an element is one type of atom, like carbon, gold or chlorine. We will look at three ways that atoms can exist.
The atoms of some elements do not join up with other atoms. They stay as
The element helium is like this. Helium is an unreactive gas. Helium atoms do not join up with each other or any other element.
element join together we get a molecule of that element.
Oxygen is like this. Two oxygen atoms join together to make an oxyen molecule. Most of the oxygen in the air is in this form. Hydrogen and chlorine also have molecules with two atoms.
Some elements have molecules with more than two atoms. Sulfur atoms can make molecules of eight atoms joined together.
A compound is made when atoms of
This means that compounds will always exist as molecules, not separate atoms. The diagrams show some molecules of common compounds.

This is an extract from an instruction text:
First, place the sugar and butter in a mixing bowl. Use a wooden spoon or electric mixer to beat them together until the mixture is smooth and light. Add the eggs and carefully beat them into the sugar and butter mixture...
Here are some clues to help you recognise an instruction text:
It instructs the reader, giving clear guidance about how to do something.
It can use bullet points, pictures and diagrams, to make the information clear.
It will use imperative verbs (bossy verbs), which tell you what to do - for example ""make"",""add"" and ""stick!"".
Explanation texts have a lot in common with information texts. They explain things in more detail. Many textbooks and reference books are explanation texts.
Here is an example of explanation text:

264,27,". For example, when you push open a door you have to apply a force to the door. You also have to apply a force to pull open a drawer.
You cannot see a force but often you can see what it does. Forces can change the speed of something, the direction it is moving in or its shape. For example, an elastic band gets longer if you pull it.
A force meter is used to measure forces.
. Force meters contain a spring connected to a metal hook. The spring stretches when a force is applied to the hook. The bigger the force applied, the longer the spring stretches and the bigger the reading.
The unit of force is called the
. So 100 N is a bigger force than 5 N.

265,79,"The following table shows the times of the buses from Cambridge to Duxford and Whittlesford:
a) I want to go to the Duxford Imperial War Museum. Which bus should I catch from Cambridge?
b) The 0805 from Cambridge is running 6 minutes late. What time does it reach Pampisford?
c) If I arrive in Sawston at 0932, what time do I leave Cambridge?
d) How long does the journey from Great Shelford to Duxford Wheatsheaf take?
a) The only bus which goes to the Imperial War Museum leaves Cambridge at 0835.
b) The 0805 usually arrives in Pampisford at 0838. So if it's running 6 minutes late it will arrive at 0844.
d) The bus leaves Great Shelford at 0722 and arrives at Duxford Wheatsheaf at 0745. So it takes 23 minutes.

267,149,"Antibiotics are medicines used by doctors when harmful microbes have made you ill. They are substances that harm bacteria. Some antibiotics stop the bacteria reproducing and others kill the bacteria directly.
Antibiotics are helpful to treat diseases caused by bacteria, such as tuberculosis and food poisoning. They do not harm viruses, so antibiotics cannot treat diseases such as colds and flu, which are caused by viruses.
Antibiotics only work against bacteria, not viruses
When you are infected by a microbe, it takes time for your body to start fighting the infection. It does this by making enough white blood cells with the correct antibody. During this time, you continue to feel unwell.
You begin to recover when enough antibodies have been produced. After the microbes have been killed, the amount of antibodies goes down again. But some of the white blood cells that produce the correct antibody remain in your blood.
infection by the same microbe, your body makes the correct antibodies much faster, because of the white blood cells that remain from when you had the first infection. The microbe doesn't get a chance to make you ill this time, and we say that you are
to the microbe and the disease it causes.
Check your understanding of this by studying the animation.
Immunisation is a process that doctors use to make people immune from certain illnesses, even before they have been infected. It involves you receiving an injection containing a
Vaccines contain a dead or weak form of the disease-causing microbe, or some of its antigens. In response to the vaccine your immune system produces white blood cells with the correct antibody to kill the microbe, so you become immune without falling ill.
You are likely to have been immunised against several microbes, viruses and bacteria, including the ones that cause diphtheria, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, meningitis, measles, mumps and tuberculosis. Girls are also immunised against rubella.
Vaccination works against diseases caused by both bacteria and viruses.

Compounds and mixtures - The reactivity series
Magnesium burns very brightly when heated in air
Some metals are very unreactive. That means they do not easily take part in chemical reactions. For example platinum does not react with oxygen in the air, even if it is heated in a Bunsen burner flame.
Some metals are very reactive. They easily take part in chemical reactions to make new substances.
Magnesium is like this. If it is heated in a Bunsen burner, it ignites and burns with a brilliant white flame.
The reactivity series for some common metals
Other metals may be more reactive than magnesium, or in between magnesium and platinum. If we put the metals in order of their reactivity, from most reactive down to least reactive, we get a list called the
If you want to learn the reactivity series, you could try making up a mnemonic or silly sentence to help. Here's one - can you do better?

Life processes - The respiratory system and ventilation
The human respiratory system contains the organs that allow us to get the oxygen we need and to remove the waste carbon dioxide we don't need. It contains these parts:
tubes leading from the lungs to the mouth and nose
various structures in the chest that allow air to move in and out of the lungs.

Movements of the ribs, rib muscles and diaphragm allow air into and out of the lungs. Take care - this is called
, not respiration. When we breathe in, we inhale. When we breathe out, we exhale.
Air passes between the lungs and the outside of the body through the
. The trachea divides into two bronchi, with one bronchus for each lung.
Each bronchus divides further in the lungs into smaller tubes called bronchioles. At the end of each bronchiole, there is a group of tiny air sacs. These air sacs have bulges called

, remember that any term that contained the same letter can be combined by adding and subtracting.
3g + 2k + 5g + 4k - g
= 3g + 5g - g + 2k + 4k
Like terms with powers can be added or subtracted but only if the powers are the same.
x is not the same as x
, so they cannot be added together.
Rearrange the expression so that like terms are next to each other:
+ 3x - 2x + 5 - 1
People usually write the expression with the 'x
' term first, then the 'x' term and finally the number term.
To get the answer, rearrange the expression:
+ 2x - 4x + 5 - 3

276,154,"> Inform, explain and describe - Describing
When you describe, you need to give lots of detail and make the words interesting for others to read. For example, if you wanted to describe your home, you wouldn't just write lots of facts, like this:
My house was built in 1972 of red brick with a pitched concrete tiled roof. The house was extended in 2003 with a small UPVC conservatory and an adjoining patio area of approximately 8 square metres...
This gives lots of facts, but these are the types of facts that someone buying a house might need. Most people would find a description like this boring. So what should you do?
The first thing is to think about what you want to show other people. Do you want to concentrate on the roof tiles or the types of bricks used? Or do you want to tell them about the fence panel your brother broke when he was chasing you last summer?
You could also write about the time Stephanie threw a tennis ball and it got stuck in the guttering - it's still there - and when it rains really hard the gutter overflows. You might even have a gnome in the front garden, which your grandad bought - it looks stupid, but you won't move it in case you offend him.
Each of these details is far more interesting than roof tiles or measurements. So, when you are describing something, think of drawing a picture or taking a photograph. You focus on a certain point, write a paragraph about it, then move to the next point and the next.

282,245,"They have got to pay back the money they borrowed.
Jamie needs to give far more explanation. He should use business terms and show he understands what fixed costs are.
They have to pay Ashley's father each month, as well as the loan from the bank. They may have other costs, like the cleaning materials they buy to run their business.
Morag started her answer quite well, mentioning both loans which, as fixed costs, have to be repaid. The cleaning materials, however, form part of the variable, rather than the fixed costs.
Costs which have to be paid, regardless of the level of output, are called fixed costs. Martin and Ashley have the fixed costs of repaying Ashley's dad 50 a month, and they probably pay bank interest on the loan. Their pay is a fixed cost. They might want to consider paying themselves piece rate, to help their business survive. The road tax and insurance on the van are fixed costs they have to pay. They have already bought the van, so this is a sunk cost, and no longer a fixed cost they have to pay.
Rani's answer would probably get a A grade. She has answered the question well, and has shown she can use business terms like fixed costs. She has thought about the pay they only receive when they have the business, and correctly counted it as a fixed cost.

288,3160,"(Mishnah and Gemara collected together) describe different roles for men and women.
Traditionally women have a sacred role - they bear children, run the home and take responsibility for their childrens Jewish upbringing. The woman passes on Jewish values and it is because of the mothers Jewish faith (not the fathers) that a child is born Jewish.
While Jewish law excuses women from some religious duties (eg, they dont have to wear the
Fringes on the corners of the Tallit (prayer shawl).
Small leather boxes containing passages from the Torah, strapped to the forehead and arm for morning prayers on weekdays.
) there are some duties that women are obliged to carry out like the lighting the
is the day of spiritual renewal and rest commencing at sunset on Friday, terminating at nightfall on Saturday.)
. Men and women sit separately in Orthodox services and women cannot take an active part in this worship. Some Jewish women today accept these limitations, but they are as well-educated as men and choose to combine a career with family responsibilities.
Progressive Jews (which includes Jews of both liberal and reform traditions) think that this attitude is wrong and treat women equally in all respects, so they too can become rabbis (Jewish teacher) if they choose to do so.

293,3877,"Owen's anti-war sentiments contrast starkly with the work of other poets.
Owen makes clear to the reader that he is unconvinced by the rhetoric of previous poets who have declared the glory of dying in war. Poems such as Tennyson's
offer a final message of glory and bravery, with sacrifice for one's country a noble and desirable end. Wilfred Owen's poem
rejects 'The old Lie'. Owen experienced war, and so his poems are more closely reflective of the views of the serving soldiers.

Sometimes the instructions on the reading exam are in English - but be careful,they may not be as straightforward as they seem!
Read each situation carefully and think about what you actually need to know.
Read every choice all the way through. There might be a word or part of a word that you recognise.
Don't jump to conclusions! Sometimes a word like 'Oficina' can be used in a way that it isn't in English.
Don't panic if you don't know what a word means. Look through all the choices and eliminate the ones you know aren't the right answer.
Be careful! Sometimes the question tries to mislead you by offering you information you don't need.

296,165,"LEDCs face difficulties as they try to improve the conditions of their citizens. Many solutions have been proposed, with varying degrees of success, but poverty is still a daily reality for millions of people.
Factors that affect the economic gap between MEDCs and LEDCs.
such as the regime in power, relationships with other countries and old colonial ties will influence trading links. The current political regime in Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe is a major factor contributing to the low level of development.
such as susceptibility to floods, drought and other hazards can influence development. Frequent drought in the Sahel region of Africa is a huge obstacle in the way of development.
such as wealth generated through industry, agriculture or the availability of natural resources influences development. The UK is one of the world's most developed nations because these factors allowed it to industrialise during the Industrial Revolution.
 many LEDCs are in debt to MEDCs, which means they have to prioritise paying these off with interest before investing in development.

The story seems to be told from Nick's viewpoint. Although it is told in the third person - both characters are referred to as 'he' and 'she' - the story remains with Nick after Marjorie has left, so we get his reaction to the break-up, but not hers.
Nick has planned to break up with Marjorie, and has discussed it with Bill beforehand - Bill asks: ""Did she go alright?"" You could see Nick as being unfair, since he has planned this and still goes on the fishing trip with her.
Nick seems to be quite aggressive at times in the story: when responding to things Marjorie says, and picking arguments.
He does not have the courage to break up with her outright - he has to pick an argument first. It is Marjorie who asks the definitive question.
Earlier in the story, is Nick trying to break the idea to Marjorie gently when he comments that the fish will not ""strike"" - in other words, they will not commit, like him?
Hemingway only directly mentions what the characters are feeling once or twice. He uses the word 'afraid' to describe Nick's feelings when he is talking to Marjorie. What do you think he is afraid of?
After Marjorie has gone, Nick seems upset. He tells Bill the break-up went fine, but is described as ""lying, his face on the blanket"". The 'lying' is
- is it about the position of his body or the truth of his words?
She seems more inclined to romance, likening the broken down mill to a 'castle'.
She also tries to draw Nick into a shared past, referring to it as 'our ruin'.
Hemingway says she ""loved fishing. She loved fishing with Nick."" The repetition seems to put emphasis on his presence being important to her. Nick says he has taught her everything about fishing. She has learned about it for his sake.
Marjorie is perceptive. She tells Nick he does not have to 'talk silly', and asks him: ""What's really the matter?""
She is very calm and collected throughout the story. She acts with dignity even when being dumped, and when he is snapping at her. When he says that love is not 'fun' anymore, she does not argue or protest. She merely leaves in dignified silence.
Bill is Nick's friend. Hemingway uses him to show what Nick is feeling, instead of telling us directly.
Bill knows that Nick is upset. When Nick tells him to 'go away', Bill moves a little way away, but remains in calling distance.
At the end, Bill's attitude to the picnic basket and fishing rods is very relaxed and casual - highlighting the tension in Nick's behaviour towards both earlier in the story.

310,73,"Information technology has led to many changes in how we work, where we work and even when we work. It has had a dramatic effect on our working lives.
Until the mid-90s it was not possible to shop online. The closest alternative was shopping by phone.
The same was true for banking and all the host of Government and other services which now exist online.
electronic mail - a message written or typed on a computer and sent electronically rather than by post
an application that allows users to send instant messages (text) to one another
Instead of mobile phones there was a trend for CB (Citizen's Band) radio.
Documents could not be sent as email
a file that's 'attached' to an email is called an attachment
and were faxed instead (a paper document is digitised, sent down a phone line, and then printed at the other end).
The need to travel for essential services, eg banking, was far greater for those who lived outside town.
Today, customers expect even the smallest of businesses to have a professional, informative
a web page or group of web pages hosted on one web server and viewed in a web browser
. Businesses that have failed to embrace the advancement of communications and ICT have put themselves at a disadvantage.
It is now common for adverts to include a

address in addition to, or even instead of a phone number.
The introduction of information technology has caused some unemployment, for example:
Computer-controlled warehouses need only a handful of staff to operate them.
Computer-controlled robots are now common on production lines, replacing human workers.
The old skills of workers in the printing industry are now out-of-date.
Some jobs have disappeared as they can now be done automatically, eg marking multiple choice exam papers.
However, it is fair to say that the development of information technology has led to many new jobs such as computer technicians, programmers,

IT is more likely to have changed someone's work rather than led to them losing their job. People in certain professions have had to be retrained to make use of modern technology:
Travel agents book holidays by computer, not by phone or letter.
has meant that many bank staff now work by phone in front of a computer, instead of being in a branch, behind a counter.
De-skilling has taken place. Some jobs which needed a high level of skill in the past can now be done more easily. For example, print workers today can use
an application that allows text and images to be laid out on a page
used extensively in the automotive industry, aerospace industry, and in architectural design to draw 2D and 3D designs
rather than pencil and paper on a drawing board.
Products made with computers should be of a better quality than before. For example, car bodies are welded more accurately by robots than by humans.
Robots don't get tired so the quality of work is consistent.
Machines controlled by computer are more reliable than those controlled by humans.
Miniaturisation - many electrical items, such as mobile phones and video cameras have become much smaller due to developments in technology.
High street stores now find themselves competing with each other for business both on the high street and online.
opens the market to customers nationally and internationally
enables smaller companies to compete with larger companies
reduces in staffing and/or high street stores thereby reducing costs
provides the option to offer 24 hour shopping at minimum additional cost
- businesses once competing with the shop in the next town now find themselves competing on a global scale.
- with increased competition, local companies may have to reduce their work force.
- the move to e-commerce may not be a smooth one and will certainly require a degree of investment.
- if high street stores are closed in an effort to save money, customers who prefer to shop on the high street may not be comfortable buying online so may go elsewhere.
Now, both for companies and individuals, there is pressure to have Internet access to do everyday things such as submit orders or look up details in a catalogue. There are initiatives to make as many services available on the Internet as possible, including e-government, where government departments such as the Inland Revenue can be dealt with using secure
a web page or group of web pages hosted on one web server and viewed in a web browser
, means working from home using modern technology to keep in touch with your business. Jobs can be relocated to places where it is more attractive, more convenient or cheaper to live.
a global network connecting millions of computers
electronic mail - a message written or typed on a computer and sent electronically rather than by post
a technology used to digitise hard copies of documents, transfer them across the telephone network, and print them on receipt
Office running costs and overheads (rates, electricity, heating etc) can be reduced, which in turn may reduce the need for office space.
Travel-related problems may be reduced, ie staff being unable to get into work due to rail/road delays.
It may tempt better staff to come and work for the company.
Employers need to be able to trust their staff and be prepared to have less direct control over them.
work in a comfortable environment - their home
less human interaction - fewer opportunities to meet people, share ideas with etc.
more difficult to work as part of a team, especially if they're all office based
greater temptation to spend time on non-work-related activities
difficult to separate personal life from work
Video conferencing means using computers to provide a video-link between two or more people. Instead of just talking to someone by telephone, you are able to see them as well.
The following is needed to take part in a video conference call:
a microphone (most webcams have a microphone built-in)
a global network connecting millions of computers
a general term used to describe an application or a program
It is possible to buy a special video conferencing machine just for this purpose.
Meetings can take place without leaving the office.
Travel costs and the time taken to travel can be reduced significantly.
Meetings can be called instantly worldwide with little notice.
Delegates can still attend meetings even if they are physically unable to.
May not be as productive as a discussion around a table.

311,2621,"In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems look at the power the older generation have over the younger but 'We Remember' is from the older generation's point of view, Kid from that of the younger generation.
Robin in Kid has broken free from Batman and now has the upper hand; the child in the Duffy poem still feels downtrodden.
A feeling of potential conflict between a group of people. In an audience or reader, a sense of potential conflict, or a feeling of anxiety due to what may be about to happen.
between generations, both from the point of view of the older generation.
The young people in the Yeats poem seem to have a pleasant time of it; the child in We Remember seems very unhappy.
Both poems about the distance between parent and child, both from the point of view of the older generation.
Margaret's love for her child is clearly genuine - the parents 'love' in the Duffy poem rings hollow.

312,2813,"In your German exam you will have to show your reading skills. This exercise will help you understand an article where some students describe where they live.
Read these short descriptions, given by Claudia, Eva, Michael and Lars, of where they live. Don't worry if you don't understand every word at this stage.
Ich wohne seit vierzehn Jahren in Herborn. Ich fahre oft nach Gieen, aber ich bin immer froh, wenn ich von der Uni wieder nach Hause fahren kann. Es gibt zwar nicht sehr viel zu tun, aber das macht mir nichts aus. Ich brauche nur meine Freunde anzurufen und in zehn Minuten sitzen wir zusammen in einer der vielen Kneipen in der Altstadt und reden miteinander. Und nachher kann ich einfach nach Hause laufen.
Ich wohne in einer Wohnung in Offenburg, etwa fnf Gehminuten vom Bahnhof. Es gefllt mir dort, denn ich kann morgens im Stadtpark joggen. Ich habe daran gedacht, nach Freiburg zu ziehen, weil es dort viel mehr zu tun gibt, besonders was Sport betrifft. Aber da so viele Leute dort studieren wollen, sind die Lebenskosten viel hher und ich muss ein paar Jahre warten, bis ich dahinziehen kann.
Ich wohne immer noch bei meinen Eltern in Spiesen-Elversberg. Das liegt am Waldrand, etwa fnf Kilometer sdlich von Neunkirchen. Es ist ganz schn ruhig hier und man kann sich gut vom Schulstress erholen, aber abends und am Wochenende wird es mir langweilig. Meine Eltern sind super und fahren mich nach Neunkirchen zum Kino und holen mich oft sehr spt ab. Ich freue mich schon auf nchstes Jahr. Bis dann habe ich hoffentlich meinen Fhrerschein. Dann htte ich vor allem in Saarbrcken eine grere Auswahl an Filmen.
Seit fnf Jahren wohne ich auf dem Lande. Frher habe ich in Berlin gewohnt. Klar hat das Spa gemacht, in einer Weltstadt zu wohnen. Aber ich denke jetzt nie daran und auf dem Bauernhof habe ich alles, was ich brauche. Das geht allerdings nicht ohne Wagen und Telefon, denn hier gibt es so gut wie keine ffentlichen Verkehrsmittel.

314,7545,"Moniza Alvi: Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan
Moniza Alvi was born in Lahore in Pakistan, the daughter of a Pakistani father and an English mother. She moved to Hatfield in England when she was a few months old. She didn't revisit Pakistan until after the publication of her first book of poems - 'The Country over my Shoulder' - from which this poem comes.
Presents from My Aunts...was one of the first poems I wrote. When I wrote this poem, I hadn't actually been back to Pakistan. The girl in the poem would be me at about 13. The clothes seem to stick to her in an uncomfortable way, a bit like a kind of false skin, and she thinks things aren't straightforward for her.
I found it was important to write the Pakistan poems because I was getting in touch with my background. And maybe there's a bit of a message behind the poems about something I went through, that I want to maybe open a few doors if possible.

Prickly heat had me screaming on the way.
What is 'Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan' about?
The speaker in the poem, who is of mixed race, describes the gifts of clothes and jewellery sent to her in England by her Pakistani relatives.
She is drawn to the loveliness of these things, but feels awkward wearing them. She feels more comfortable in English clothes - denim and corduroy.
She contrasts the beautiful clothes and jewellery of India with boring English 'cardigans/from Marks and Spencer'.
She tries to remember what it was like for her family to travel to England.
Her knowledge of her birthplace, which she left as a baby, comes to her only through old photographs and newspaper reports.
She tries to imagine what that world might be like.
Loose trousers and tunic, traditionally worn by Pakistani women.
The traditional dress worn by women in India and some parts of Pakistan.
Asian clothing is often decorated in lots of tiny round mirrors.

Here are two lists of words that describe things to do with Pakistani culture and things associated with English culture.

What strikes you most strongly about the way the clothes from Pakistan are described in the first
A group of lines of poetry that make up a unit - like a paragraph in a piece of prose; a verse.
Why are English things referred to in such an ordinary way?
How does the England she knows contrast to the 'fractured land throbbing through newsprint' of Pakistan?
How else does life in England differ from life in Pakistan (especially for a woman)?
Does the girl feel that all the Pakistani objects 'fit' into an English way of life?
A visual representation of something; a mental picture; a persona that is presented to the world.
in a poem tends to carry a particular significance - it's the one our imagination is left with.
The speaker imagines herself 'there' in Lahore - somewhere she has been only in her thoughts.
However, she is 'of no fixed nationality'. This sounds a slightly threatening phrase (there's a similar one - 'of no fixed abode' - which is used in law courts when the defendant is homeless). Can you link this phrase with other words earlier in the poem?
The speaker imagines herself staring 'through fretwork' at the beautiful Shalimar Gardens. Why is this such an effective image to end on?
Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. 'Attitude' can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
How do you think this poem should be read?
In a confused voice, as if the girl cannot decide whether she is more Pakistani or English?
Wistfully, as if she regrets having lost her original culture?
Gratefully, as she thinks about the beautiful, exotic gifts?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
In an interview, Moniza Alvi has said:
Growing up, I felt that my origins were invisible, because there weren't many people to identify with in Hatfield at that time of a mixed race background or indeed from any other race, so I felt there was a bit of a blank drawn over that. I think I had a fairly typically English 1950s/1960s upbringing.
When I eventually went to Pakistan, I certainly didn't feel that was home, I'd never felt so English. But I never feel entirely at home in England, and, of course, I'm not part of the Asian community at all. And it feels a bit odd sometimes that because of the group of poems that I've written about my Asian background, I sometimes tend to be identified as a black writer. I tend to think of England as being very culturally mixed now.
But it's important to know where you come from, which is perhaps what I was lacking as a child. I think it's important to know what has gone into your making, even quite far back, I think it gives you a sense perhaps of richness.
Read this question carefully. It is similar to the type of question you will be asked in the exam
Choose two poems which deal in some way with the experience of migration, and show how this is explored in the imagery of the poems.
If you are ready to practise writing a full answer, you should spend 40 minutes on this, and write about two poems. In the exam itself, you will only have
Refer to anything you know about the
of the poem which helps you to understand the poems.
the poem is written, referring to particular words and phrases.
What do you think the poet has to say about the past, and the way it relates to the present?
If you would prefer to concentrate on just Moniza Alvi's poem at this stage, write for 20 minutes.
In writing about John Agard's poem, you could include short paragraphs about:
The poet's personal history, and how this links with the situation described in the poem.
The imagery of Pakistan and the imagery of England.
What the poem says about the girl's thoughts and feelings.
If you want to practise writing a full answer, you could also write about the poem by Sujata Bhatt, Grace Nichols, Fiona Farrell or Edward Kamau Brathwaite.
When writing about two poems, you should try to end by making a
between the two. In what ways are the poems similar - in the style of language, or in ideas? In what ways are they different?
The girl in the poem doesn't think much of the salwar kameez because it's old-fashioned. It says 'like at school, fashions changed'. She prefers denim and corduroy ('I longed for denim and corduroy'), so she can be more like her school friend, especially at weekends. When she first came to England she didn't want to, it says she was 'screaming all the way' (line 50) but now she quite likes it.
refers to details in the poem, which is important
but hasn't grasped what the poem is about
uses quotations, but takes the words out of context
The girl in the poem doesn't quite know what to think about the presents. The way she describes them makes them sound beautiful
but when she puts them on she doesn't feel right
I could never be as lovely as those clothes
She admires the way the clothes have little mirrors embroidered on them
the candidate understands that the girl is pulled both ways
doesn't quite connect to wider issues of identity
The girl in the poem doesn't quite know what to think about the presents. The way she describes them makes them sound beautiful
but also slightly dangerous, because the bangle 'drew blood', and she felt 'aflame' when she put them on. They make her feel 'alien in the sitting room', when your sitting room should be where you feel at home. The clothes remind her that she is 'half-English', which makes her feel uncomfortable. At the same time, she says the clothes are 'radiant in the wardrobe' - even though she isn't wearing them, they seem full of light and beauty compared with her other things. She is drawn to the rich colours, the same as she is drawn to her mother's jewellery and her parents' camel-skin lamp
marvel at the colours like stained glass
She realises that all this is part of her own family's past, and another side of her identity. At the end of the poem, she tries to imagine how it might have been if she'd lived in Lahore instead, and wonders would she have been more or less at home in the other half of her background?
develops the ideas more fully than the other two candidates
connects the clothes to broader feelings about identity

Pollution is the addition of substances to the environment that may be harmful to living organisms. Population growth and increases in the standard of living cause more waste to be produced. If this waste is not handled correctly, it leads to pollution. The most obvious form of pollution is often simply just litter on the ground, but pollution can affect the air and water too.
Most rubbish is buried in landfill sites and not all of it comprises safe materials. Even
common household items can contain toxic chemicals
such as poisonous metals. Many smoke alarms contain radioactive americium.
Industrial waste is also discharged onto the land
chemicals used to kill insects, weeds and micro-organisms that might damage crops
to improve their crops, but these can damage living things. Toxic chemicals can be washed from the land into rivers, lakes and seas.
Spilled crude oil causes a lot of harm to the environment, both sea and land
Water pollution is caused by the discharge of harmful substances into rivers, lakes and seas.
animals cannot survive in polluted water, so their presence or absence indicates the extent to which a body of water is polluted.

318,1546,"What is it? How do you know?
What type of publication do you think text 2 is? A comic? A newspaper? A magazine? A web page? A business document?
This one isn't so easy, so let's rule some things out...
: No. Comics are generally brightly coloured and full of cartoons. This isnt!
: No. Newspapers generally use narrow columns, black and white print and the pages are very full when you look at them.
: No. There are no giveaway clues such as 'click here', 'contact us', 'print this page' - so it cant be a web page.
: No. In a magazine, one would expect to see more writing and pictures on each page. This layout is too spacious.
: You are pretty close - text 2 comes from the Environment Agency. This is from the booklet the organisation would give to members of the public if they asked for information about what the Government is doing to protect and improve the environment.

Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.

321,768,"Carbon in the form of graphite is soft, slippery and easily broken. But very thin filaments of carbon are very stiff. These carbon fibres are useful for reinforcing other materials to make them tougher. They are embedded in strong plastics to make composite materials. These are usually very strong but lightweight, so they are used for skateboards, boat hulls and high performance sports equipment.
from 2006 about a 7000 mountain bike, made from carbon fibres and titanium, that weighs just 6 kg.
Kevlar is a very strong artificial fibre. It is woven to make a material that is used for light and flexible body armour. It is strong and tough because:

324,2967,"Like many female characters in the story, Justine is an orphan who cares for other people before herself.
She is brought up in the Frankenstein family home, and acts as their servant.
She is especially fond of Victor's youngest brother, William, and feels responsible when he is murdered by the Monster.
Justine is very beautiful. This beauty angers the Monster when it finds her sleeping, as it knows it will never be allowed to love anyone so attractive. The Monster then places the locket around her neck, knowing it will lead to her being put on trial for the murder.
She is bullied into confessing by a priest. Her calmness and virtue are emphasised and contrasted with the immorality of those who should know better - like Victor, the priest and the judge.

327,3857,"We often use formulas without even noticing. For example, we might convert miles to km by multiplying by 1.6, or find the circumference of a circle by multiplying pi by the diameter.
km = 1.6 x miles is an example of a formula.
We have already seen that km = 1.6 x miles and C =
 d are examples of formulas. There are many others that we use regularly in other subjects. Sometimes we have to construct our own formula:
A taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00. Write down a formula for the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles.
Travelling 1 mile would cost 2 + 50p.
Travelling 2 miles would cost 2 + 2 x 50p.
Travelling 3 miles would cost 2 + 3 x 50p.
So travelling for 'n' miles will cost 2 + n x 50p.
The formula is C = 2 + (n x 50p)
A rectangle has a width of x and a length of 2x.
Write down a formula for the perimeter (P) in terms of x.
P = 2x + x + 2x + x
Did you remember to include all 4 sides?
To recap, the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles, when a taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00 is:-
C = 2 + (n x 50p)
To find the cost of the taxi for a journey of 20 miles, replace 'n' with 20.
C = 2 + (20 x 50p)
What is the cost of hiring this taxi for 16 miles?
Remember that C = 2 + (16 x 50p)
The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.
r, so we divide both sides by 2
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c
Rearrange the formula to make 'c' the subject.
[To work this out: y = mx + c, so subtract mx from both sides.]

Electrically charged particles, formed when an atom or molecule gains or loses electrons.
An ionic compound occurs when a negative ion (an atom that has gained an electron) joins with a positive ion (an atom that has lost an electron). The ions swap electrons to achieve a full outer shell.
, while chloride ions have the formula Cl
. You need to show one sodium ion and one chloride ion. In the exam, make sure the dots and crosses are clear, but do not worry about colouring them.
, while oxide ions have the formula O
. You need to show one magnesium ion and one oxide ion.
. Chloride ions have the formula Cl
You need to show two chloride ions, because two chloride ions are needed to balance the charge on a calcium ion.

Alan Davie: 'To a Celtic Spirit, 1'
Alan Davie is a prominent Scottish artist well known for his work in a range of mediums including drawing, painting, and screenprinting.
He was born in 1920 and graduated from the Edinburgh Royal College of Art in 1940. After serving in World War II he began teaching in Edinburgh and in 1947 became a professional jazz musician.
In 1948 he took up a travelling art scholarship from the college and travelled throughout Europe in 1948-9. In Venice he met
, an influential art collector, who introduced him to
. Whilst exhibiting in New York in 1956 he befriended other artists including
Jackson Pollock, Willem De Kooning and Mark Rothko
His work continues to be widely exhibited across the USA and Europe.
and reflects the artist's love of jazz music, non-western cultural symbols, ancient religious and ethnic influences.
My ideas are intuitive and most ideas come from my thoughts. The art I create is no way expressive or impressionist, it just comes from an artist drive I have to keep on creating.
The work of art seems to be something thrown off, a by-product of the process of being and working. Art just happens, like falling in love.
When I am working, I am aware of a striving, a yearning, the making of many impossible attempts at a kind of transmutation  a searching for a formula for the magical conjuring of the unknowable. Many times the end seems just within reach, only to fly to pieces before me as I reach for it.
I paint because I have nothing, or I paint because I am full of ideas ... or I paint because after I last painted, something appeared miraculously out of it.
The titles are not necessarily directly linked to the image, they are more often terms I have to use to catalogue the artwork I have created.
Inside is a place of magic; resounding, surrounding, where big hanging works in progress are constantly being transformed and re-worked, making a shifting environment of developing moods, spaces, colours, forms, poetry fragments, script, signs and symbols, laughing, singing.

333,1598,"If you are mainly painting and drawing, you'll be expected to develop your knowledge and understanding of colour, form, tone, texture and shape.
You'll need to explore the results of painting on different surfaces, the qualities of different paints, and the effects of using different painting tools. For example, acrylic paint can be used to create flat surfaces of colour but if it's watered down sufficiently, it can be used to create washes of colour.

What is each painting about? What is each artist trying to represent or say?
How does the subject matter differ between the two paintings?
How has each artist used paint to show how they feel about their subject matter?
How have time and/or place influenced each artist?
Does it look like the artist has used a brush or palette knife to apply the paint?
Does the way in which each artist has used the paint affect the mood, atmosphere or the way it looks?
Does the size of either of the paintings affect the viewer?
What (painting) devices does Justin Mortimer use to show Mick Scarletts personality. How does he show his response to and feelings about him?
How does Robert Maclaurin show that the atmosphere and mood of a place is more important to him than the accurate recording of its details?

experiment with thick and thin areas to create textures
surface. By adding turpentine to the mix, you can make the paint thinner, more
and have a more matt finish. By adding oil (such as linseed or poppy oil) you make the paint thinner, more transparent and give it a more glossy finish. Adding wax will give a soft matt finish and make the paint thicker too.
Acrylic paint can be mixed with anything water based, such as water, soap, PVA glue and other water based paint. It can be applied thin or thick. You can try mixing in an acrylic medium to make the paint more transparent. This is useful for glazing effects and more subtle colouring.
Water colour and gouache paints are both water based, so like acrylic they can be mixed with anything water based.
experiment with the surface you are painting on
. Try wood, paper, card, glass or metal. Create a collage, cut into the surface, or tear the paper and rejoin it in a different way.
Surfaces can be changed in a variety of ways, scratched, roughened, made uneven or smoothed
. Try using sandpaper to remove some of the paint from previous painting and then paint onto it some more.
Try painting onto a wet surface, and a dry surface. Try painting over old painting once it's dry. You can be surprised how good the results can be.
Make use of a palette knife to discover new textures, or draw into the paint with the wrong end of your paintbrush. Try adding things such as glue, rice or sand onto, or into, the paint to build up or create a variety of interesting textures.
Try different sizes and shapes of brushes. Decorating brushes are a cheap alternative to large artist quality brushes. Try painting without brushes, using pieces of wood or plastic as scrapers, or bits of rag to apply the paint.
When you are experimenting have an idea in mind of what you want to achieve, and then see what techniques give you the most success.

explore a range of materials on which to draw

a collective name for images, video and audio
. Try drawing with wet media like watercolours, ink or watered-down acrylic paint. Try different mark-making materials from pencils to pastels, inks, pens, charcoal, sticks, matches. Try fine aquarelle pencils for subtle colour blending, or make a delicate wash by brushing over them with water.
Try using different types of eraser. Try using erasers to make marks and remove parts of the drawing. Putty rubbers are very soft and can be used to lighten shadows, to give delicate shading, by rubbing gently at areas you've already shaded. Try rubbing out an area and then drawing back into the mess that is left behind.

334,412,"Comets are balls of ice and dust in orbit around the Sun. The orbits of comets are different from those of planets - they are elliptical. A comet's orbit takes it very close to the Sun and then far away again. The time to complete an orbit varies - some comets take a few years, while others take millions of years to complete an orbit.
Comets have a range of different orbital periods and all leave a trail of debris behind them
Comets are often visible from Earth when they get close to the Sun, because the Sun's heat vaporises material from their surface, and this vapour forms a tail.
Asteroids are rocky objects, smaller than planets. Most of them are found in an 'asteroid belt', in orbit around the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. The minor planet Ceres is found here, too. Asteroids can crash into each other. When they do, they may break apart and their orbit may change.
The orbits of some asteroids cross the Earth's orbit. At various times during the Earth's history, asteroids have hit the Earth. When this happened, a tremendous amount of energy was released, throwing up billions of tonnes of dust. This blocked heat and light from the Sun, making the Earth very cold.
It is thought that it was the collision of an asteroid with the Earth that helped to drive the dinosaurs to extinction. Scientists worry that an asteroid could still hit the Earth and cause a global catastrophe.

describes the condition of the atmosphere. It might be sunny, hot, windy or cloudy, raining or snowing.
Temperature is how hot or cold something is, for example the atmosphere or the sea. Use a thermometer to see how many degrees Celsius/centigrade it is above or below freezing point (0 degrees C) .
Precipitation is the term given to moisture that falls from the air to the ground. In the UK, the most common form of precipitation is rain, but snow, hail, sleet, drizzle, fog, and mist are also precipitation.
Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. Air can only hold a certain amount of water before condensation and precipitation occurs. Humidity is measured as a percentage, relative to the saturation point where the air can hold no more water vapour (ie 100 % humidity).
Atmospheric pressure is the weight of air resting on the Earth's surface. Pressure is shown on a weather map with lines called isobars. Low pressure occurs when air is warm and rises. High pressure occurs when air becomes colder and sinks.
of the part of atmosphere (air) closest to the surface of the earth.
The weather is constantly changing as temperature and humidity change in the atmosphere. Landmasses, such as the British Isles, experience constantly changing weather conditions.
is the average weather conditions - temperature, pressure, precipitation and humidity - expected for a certain place. Climate is based on the average weather experienced over 30 years or more.
Climate refers to what is expected to happen in the atmosphere rather than the actual conditions. It is possible for the weather to be different from that suggested by the climate.
Climatic conditions in an area can be affected by the landscape, relief and activities taking place (both human and natural). Climate can alter over time and space.
Within a climatic region, the climate may vary from place to place - eg the top of a hill, the sunny side of a hill, the shaded side of a hill and the bottom of a hill. These areas with their small variations are called
The science of monitoring and studying the atmosphere and predicting its weather and climate is called
. People who study the weather and climate are known as meteorologists.
Climates are influenced by many factors, such as proximity to the equator or the poles and proximity to the sea, as well as things like ocean currents, atmospheric pressure belts and
The prevailing wind is the wind direction that occurs most often throughout the year, or occurs most often at this time of year, in a certain geographical region.

Temperatures drop the further an area is from the equator. Due to the curvature of the earth. In areas closer to the poles, sunlight has a larger area of atmosphere to pass through and the sun is at a lower angle in the sky. As a result, more energy is lost and temperatures are cooler.
In addition, the presence of ice and snow nearer the poles causes a higher
Albedo is a measure of how much sunlight a surface reflects.
. This means that more solar energy is reflected, also contributing to the cold.
Locations at a higher altitude have colder temperatures. Temperature usually decreases by 1 C for every 100m in altitude.
Oceans heat up and cool down much more slowly than land. This means that coastal locations tend to be cooler in summer and warmer in winter than places inland at the same latitude and altitude. Glasgow, for example, is at a similar latitude to Moscow, but is much milder.
. A warm ocean current called the
keeps Britain warmer and wetter than places in continental Europe.
The prevailing wind is the most frequent wind direction a location experiences. In Britain the prevailing wind is from the southwest, which brings warm, moist air from the Atlantic Ocean. This contributes to the frequent rainfall. When prevailing winds blow over land areas, it can contribute to creating desert climates.
The British Isles have variable weather that changes from day to day between different regions and within different regions. Consequently it is very difficult to predict or forecast the weather.
Britain has four distinct seasons of fairly equal length - spring, summer, autumn and winter. In winter it is colder and wetter and the days are shorter than in summer.
Different parts of the UK experience slightly different regional climates. These can be summarised as:
- cool summers, mild winters, heavy rain all year.
- cool summers, cold winters, steady rain all year.
- warm summers, mild winters, light rain all year, especially summer.
- warm summers, mild winters, heavy rain all year, especially winter.
The variability of weather and climate in different regions of the British Isles is due to the different air masses that meet over the Isles. Each air mass brings with them different characteristics, as shown in the map below.
Prevailing winds and climate zones in the UK
are greatest along the south coast of England (average of 1750 hours of sunshine per year) and are least in mountainous areas (average less then 1000 hours).
Scotland has shorter winter days and longer summer days than the rest of the UK, because it is further north. In the north of Scotland there are four more hours of daylight in mid-summer than in London.
On average it rains one in three days in the UK. However, rainfall varies greatly from region to region. It is generally wetter in the west than the east and wetter in the highlands than the lowlands. The wettest place is Snowdonia in Wales (average annual totals exceeding 3000 mm of rain a year), followed by the Highlands of Scotland, the Lake District, the Pennines and the moors of southwest England.
Parts of the east, such as East Anglia, receive less than 700 mm a year.
In most places in the UK it will rain twice as much in winter months as in summer months. Although in central and south-eastern England, and parts of southeast Scotland, July and August are often the wettest months of the year. In London and Birmingham it will thunder on average 15 days a year, compared to less than 10 elsewhere in the UK.
Average temperatures in UK are warmer at lower
Latitude is the distance a place is from the equator. Lines of latitude are lines on a map showing distance from the equator. Lower latitudes are nearer the equator, higher latitudes are further from the equator.
and colder at higher latitudes. They are also warmer at lower
Altitude is a measure of an area's height above sea level or ground level.
and colder at higher altitudes. Average yearly temperatures at low altitude vary from 7C in The Shetlands, in northern Scotland, to 11C on the southwest coast of England. The coldest (and highest) place is Ben Nevis - altitude: 1344m - where the average temperature is less than 0C.
The coldest months are January and February and the warmest are July and August. In summer Scotland will be about three degrees cooler than England. The average daily maximum temperature at Glasgow in July is 19C compared with 22C in London.
Scotland tends to be worse affected by severe weather than the rest of the UK. Snow is more common in highland regions than in lowland areas, so while snow might fall on the south west of England less than 10 days a year, it will fall on the peaks of the Cairngorm Mountains over 100 days a year.
Gale-force winds (winds of more than 34 knots or 17.2 metres per second) are most commonly caused by

travelling across the Atlantic Ocean. These depressions may pass close to or over Scotland, with Orkney and Shetland experiencing the strongest winds. Occasionally they can reach hurricane force, eg the storm in October 1987.
Climate graphs show average rainfall and temperatures typically experienced in a particular location. The temperature is shown on a line graph, and rainfall on a bar graph. They are usually represented on the same set of axes with the months of the year along the base.
Look at the shape of the graph. Is the temperature line steep or gentle? Does it change throughout the year and/or look almost flat?
Look for extremes  quote the highest and lowest temperature and rainfall and the month in which it occurs. Remember to quote units, eg Celsius or millimetres.
Can you identify the seasons when most rain or least rain falls? Or when the highest and lowest temperatures are experienced?
Work out the temperature range by subtracting the lowest figure from the highest figure.
Add the rainfall totals for each month together to work out the total annual rainfall.
Have a go at describing these climate graphs:

'I rise in the dawn, and I kneel and blow
Till the seed of the fire flicker and glow;
And then I must scrub and bake and sweep
Till stars are beginning to blink and peep;
And the young lie long and dream in their bed
Of the matching of ribbons for bosom and head,
And their day goes over in idleness,
And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress:
While I must work because I am old,
And the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold.'
The poem is about a hard-working, poor old woman who compares herself to the young women of the house who spend their days dreaming of love and worrying about their appearance. It is not clear whether these young women are her own children or the children of people she works for as a maid. The poem is written in the

describes the condition of the atmosphere. It might be sunny, hot, windy or cloudy, raining or snowing.
Temperature is how hot or cold something is, for example the atmosphere or the sea. Use a thermometer to see how many degrees Celsius/centigrade it is above or below freezing point (0 degrees C) .
Precipitation is the term given to moisture that falls from the air to the ground. In the UK, the most common form of precipitation is rain, but snow, hail, sleet, drizzle, fog, and mist are also precipitation.
Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. Air can only hold a certain amount of water before condensation and precipitation occurs. Humidity is measured as a percentage, relative to the saturation point where the air can hold no more water vapour (ie 100 % humidity).
Atmospheric pressure is the weight of air resting on the Earth's surface. Pressure is shown on a weather map with lines called isobars. Low pressure occurs when air is warm and rises. High pressure occurs when air becomes colder and sinks.

The weather is constantly changing as temperature and humidity change in the atmosphere. Landmasses, such as the British Isles, experience constantly changing weather conditions.
is the average weather conditions - temperature, pressure, precipitation and humidity - expected for a certain place. Climate is based on the average weather experienced over 30 years or more.
Climate refers to what is expected to happen in the atmosphere rather than the actual conditions. It is possible for the weather to be different from that suggested by the climate.
Climatic conditions in an area can be affected by the landscape, relief and activities taking place (both human and natural). Climate can alter over time and space.
Within a climatic region, the climate may vary from place to place - eg the top of a hill, the sunny side of a hill, the shaded side of a hill and the bottom of a hill. These areas with their small variations are called

342,2210,"Public health is about avoiding the spread of disease within a particular society - often through providing water to help people keep themselves, their animals and their surroundings clean. The Egyptians stressed the importance of cleanliness, but this was for
reasons, not in order to keep the population at large healthy.
Archaeologists have discovered that the Egyptians had simple baths and toilets. Egyptian men and women took great care over their
and appearance, and there is evidence that they used eye make-up that helped protect their eyes from diseases. They slept under mosquito nets.
, kept themselves scrupulously clean. They regularly washed themselves, their clothes and their cups.
The Egyptians didn't use cleanliness to ward off disease, however, but instead
a public health system in the modern sense of state-organised sewers, public hygiene or medical care.

344,4962,"In this Revision Bite we are going to look at standard index form and zero, negative and fractional powers.
Adding and subtracting numbers in standard index form:
Convert them into ordinary numbers, do the calculation, then change them back if you want the answer in standard form.
Multiplying and dividing numbers in standard form:
Here you can use the rules for multiplying and dividing powers. Remember these rules:
To multiply powers you add, eg, 10
To divide powers you subtract, eg, 10
Multiply 2 by 3 and add the powers of 10:
If not, remember that you should first work out 36  6, then work subtract the powers of 10 (because it is division), like this:
) = (36  6) x (10
In the previous pages, we only looked at positive whole number powers. We can also find zero, negative and fractional powers. The rules below apply to these powers.
Anything to the power 0 is equal to 1.
Have a quick game of 'Powers snap' to help get your head around all these rules.
