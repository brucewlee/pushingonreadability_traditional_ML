Grab your beach towel and sunglasses! Summer is just around the corner. It starts on June 21. For most kids, that means more time to play outside. Experts say that more injuries occur during summer. Follow these tips to make sure you have a safe summer.
Many kids will spend hours playing outside in the summer sun. Be careful, though. The suns rays can be harmful. They can cause damage to your skin and eyes.
If you are out in the sun, be sure to wear sunscreen. Experts say it should have a
(SPF) of 30 or higher. The SPF number lets you know how much the sunscreen protects your skin from the sun. Make sure you rub it in everywhere your skin is showing.
You should also wear a hat and sunglasses. They protect against the suns harmful rays. Better yet, play in the shade!
What is one way to beat the heat? Splash in a pool! Just be sure to follow water-safety rules. Always swim with a grown-up watching you. You should also swim with a buddy. A buddy can tell others if someone needs help. If you dont know how to swim, stay in the
end. Something that is shallow is not deep.
Biking and in-line skating are great ways to get exercise. To stay wheel safe, always wear a helmet. It protects your head and brain if you fall. If you are in-line skating, also wear wrist guards, elbow pads, and kneepads.
What other ways can you stay safe this summer?

Goats are doing their part to help prevent forest fires. Goats eat tall grass, weeds, and small branches. Those plants often spread forest fires in places such as California and Florida.
Many states are using goats to eat plants on mountains and in fields close to people's houses. By eating plants in those areas, the goats leave a clear patch of land. That way, if a fire starts in the forest, it will not be able to spread to where people live.
In 1999, there were about 94,000 forest fires in the United States.
Forest fires in 1999 burned nearly 9,500 square miles of land in the United States.
Most forest fires are started by people. People are sometimes careless with cigarettes and campfires.
Lightning is another cause of forest fires. When the forest is very dry and lightning strikes it, a fire can start.

In 1999, about 3? million kids were hurt while playing sports and using outdoor toys. Almost half of those kids got hurt while playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates.
The injured kids were probably not wearing safety gear. Without safety gear, playing with some toys can be very dangerous. Pads and guards protect parts of your body that could be hurt if you fall.
Most kids know that they should wear a helmet when they ride a bike. But kids should also wear helmets when they play with scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates. Kids can cut the chances of getting hurt in half by wearing protective gear.
Follow these safety tips when playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates:

In July, wildlife workers rescued African penguins from Robben Island. Robben Island is in the Atlantic Ocean near South Africa. Workers took 14,500 oily penguins to a wildlife center. Each penguin was carefully washed. It took two people about an hour to clean the oil from each of the birds!
Workers took the cleaned penguins to the east coast of South Africa. The penguins were set free in the ocean and swam back to Robben Island. While the penguins were swimming home, workers had time to clean up the spilled oil.
Workers put a special device on a few penguins. The device sent information to a computer. The computer showed exactly where each penguin was on its 560-mile swim home.
Did you know that there are 17 kinds of penguins? Here are just a few:
The emperor penguin is the largest of all penguins. It stands about 4 feet tall and can weigh up to 100 pounds.

Dancers wear special clothes at a powwow. The clothes are made by hand. As the dancers get older, they add pieces to the clothes. Some of the pieces are gifts from family and friends.
People sell arts and crafts at some powwows. The artists make each item by hand. The arts and crafts often include beadwork, baskets, and pottery.
Fry bread is often found at powwows. The bread is sometimes used to make special tacos. People put meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and hot peppers on top of the bread. Then they roll it up and eat it.

Cockroaches like to rest together in dark places. The scientists put the robots with a group of roaches. Soon, the robots and roaches were all resting together in a dark place.
Then the robots were placed in a light area. When the roaches saw the robots, they ended up resting in the light area too.
What did scientists learn from the study? A few cockroaches can change how the whole group behaves.

In a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear.
Scientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help.
Scientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled.
Scientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest.
The African elephant is the largest animal that lives on land. African elephants can weigh up to 16,000 pounds.
An elephant's trunk contains more than 40,000 muscles. The trunk is used to smell, breathe, touch, eat, drink, and bathe.

214,"2008 is the Chinese Year of the Rat.
February 7 is Chinese New Year! The celebration lasts 15 days. Each Chinese year is named after one of 12 animals. This is the Year of the Rat.
People prepare for the holiday before the actual day. They clean their homes and decorate them with flowers and poems. The poems are happy messages of good luck. People also put out bowls of tangerines, oranges, dried fruits, and candy to wish visitors a sweet new year.
On the first night of the celebration, families and friends gather for a special meal. Many people wear new red clothing. They eat foods such as dumplings, fish, and long noodles. Sweet, sticky rice cakes are a favorite treat.
The Chinese New Year celebration ends with the Lantern Festival. It includes music, dancing, and fireworks. Kids carry lanterns in a parade under the light of a full moon. The highlight of the parade is the dragon dance. Dancers carry a long dragon made of silk, paper, and bamboo through the streets. The dragon may stretch more than 100 feet!

202,"Hi! My Name is Pam Pollster. This is my pet parakeet, Polly. We live in Polling Place. Polly is a smart bird. In fact, she's so smart, she can count very high numbers. This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
. That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's as Easy as One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.
Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

The oil spill happened near San Cristbal and Santa Fe islands, in the eastern area of the Galpagos. Cleanup workers said the oil killed two pelicans and dirtied 40 others. Workers said some sea lions, birds, and tortoises also needed to be cleaned.
Oil can make animals sick if they swallow it. When oil covers an animal's fur or feathers, it can't swim, fly, or stay warm. If the oil is not cleaned off the animal, it could die.
The oil spill also harmed life in the water. Many sea plants, such as algae (AL-jee), were also damaged by the oil spill. Sea plants are an important food source for many Galpagos animals.
Days after the accident, however, the islands were spared further damage. Ocean currents took the oil out to sea, away from the islands.
What could be done to prevent such oil spills?

Astronauts are aiming for the moon again. This time, though, they plan to stay there. Astronauts hope to live and work on the moon by 2020, according to NASA. The U.S. space agency recently announced plans to build a base there.
At first, four-person crews will stay for a week. By 2024, they will be able to live there for as long as six months.
The base will most likely be built near the moon's north or south pole. The poles get the most sunlight. At those locations, the moon base would be able to use solar power. That is energy from the sun that can be used to create electricity.
The moon is the only place beyond Earth that humans have visited. At a distance of about 238,900 miles, the moon is Earth's closest space neighbor. So far, only 12 people have walked on the moon's dusty surface. Those astronauts traveled there on Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972.

Whats 23 feet long, as thick as a telephone pole, and slithering into a state near you? A Burmese python!

to, or originally from, the area. They might have started out as pets that were set free. Many pythons are native to Asia.
Today, there are tens of thousands of pythons in Florida. They may one day creep into almost one-third of the United States, scientists say.
They [can move] long distances in a short period of time, scientist Gordon Rodda told

. Those are groups of plants and animals that live in the same area. The snakes eat everything from birds to bobcats. They lie still until an animal comes near. Then the
strike. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals that often have scales.
U.S. officials are coming up with ways to stop the snakes. One idea is to
people from bringing pythons into the country. To ban is to prevent.
People in Florida move an 18-foot-long python to a safer home.
People who own pet snakes can help too, Rodda says. If you have a snake that gets too big for your home, take it to a zoo. We dont want to create a problem by [setting free] an animal we no longer want to take care of, says Rodda.
What makes giant snakes special? Wrap your head around these python facts to find out.
, or squeeze, prey? They loop their bodies around the prey and tighten their muscles to kill the animals. Then they swallow them.
Only alligators are tough enough to eat adult giant snakes. Dont feel bad for the snakes, though. They eat alligators!
Female pythons can lay up to 100 eggs at a time. The snakes stay on the eggs for two to three months to keep them warm until they hatch.
What are other ways U.S. officials could stop the snakes?

, or take away, recess. ""Recess is important so kids get a break from sitting at their desks,"" said one principal from Virginia. ""They get up and move. They can visit with their friends and have social time.""
Many experts say that having recess is worth the lost class time. Recess gives kids the chance to exercise. At recess, many students also learn how to play and work together with other students. Some studies even show a recess break can help improve test scores.
""If we had a longer school day, we would love to have recess,"" said one school official. ""But we have more math to teach and more reading to do, and something had to go.""
Exercise helps kids stay healthy. No recess break? Don't worry! You can get fit on your own time. Kids should exercise for an hour each day, say experts. Here are some ideas to get you moving:

Despite finishing in second place, MacArthur made good enough time to win two titles--the fastest woman and the youngest person ever to finish a solo around-the-world race.
During the Vendee Globe voyage, MacArthur had to make repairs to her boat without losing time. She averaged ten naps a day, sleeping a total of just six hours a day. Once she awoke just in time to steer away from a giant iceberg looming 50 feet in front of her!
Those difficulties were nothing compared to the one MacArthur said she faced at the finish line. ""My life is here, home is on board

When King was growing up in the South, African Americans did not have the same rights as white people. African Americans had to live in separate neighborhoods and send their kids to separate schools. Some African Americans were not allowed to vote.
Many Americans felt that such laws were unfair. When King was older, he gave speeches and led peaceful marches to try to change those laws. As a result of King's work,

Thats wrong, says the Institute of Medicine, which advises the nation on health issues. The group says that kid-friendly characters should promote only foods that are good for you.
The group recently reported that food ads on TV have astrong influence on what kids under the age of 12 eat. ""Our eating habits and preferences form early in our lives,"" the groups spokesperson, Christine Stencel, told
Advertisers know kids have spending power. ""American kids spend about $200 billion each year. Foods high in sugar and fat are among the top 10 items,"" says Stencel. ""Kids also influence what their parents buy.""

A calorie is a measure of the amount of energy a food can provide. The body needs food as fuel. However, people gain weight when they take in more calories than they use up through activity.
Millions of people in the United States are
or severely overweight. Being overweight can lead to serious health problems.
""The committee thinks it is time people should take steps to reduce the problem of obesity,"" says Stencel. ""That includes making changes in what foods are marketed to kids and how they are promoted.""
Foods that are high in nutrition help people stay healthy. Good choices:
foods with whole grains, such as whole-wheat breads and pastas
a variety of fruits and vegetables in a rainbow of colors
calcium-rich, nonfat or low-fat foods, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt
What are some other ways advertisers get kids to buy their products?

Some find Florida State University's mascot doesn't respect the real Chief Osceola.
That tradition takes place before every football game at Florida State University (FSU). The NCAA recently tried to end the tradition. The NCAA is the group that oversees college sports. It made a rule that sports teams can't use Native American names or
after the regular season. A mascot is a symbol that represents a sports team.
Some members of the Seminole tribe think the rule is unfair. They believe that FSU honors their traditions. Tribe members designed the mascot's costume, they say. They add that the student chosen as the mascot has to study the tribe's culture to earn that honor.
The NCAA decided to let FSU keep its tradition. However, the rule remains for at least 17 other schools.
Native Americans are the people who first settled in North and South America. Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today. Each tribe has its own history and culture.

The gorilla is one of the endangered animals living in the Congo Basin.
Scientists warn that more than half of the forest could disappear within 50 years. Some people illegally cut down trees and hunt wildlife to sell as meat. Many rain forest animals, like the lowland gorilla, are endangered because of illegal hunting.
Gorillas are plant eaters. They also like to eat insects, such as termites and ants. An adult male eats about 40 pounds of food each day!
Young gorillas love to play. They learn new skills by imitating adult gorillas.
Each gorilla has a unique nose print. Scientists can identify a gorilla by the shape of its nose.

When people think of lightning, they generally picture it as a single bolt. However, scientists have recently reported that one flash of lightning often strikes in more than one place. It is common for lightning to fork, or split, and strike in two or more places, scientists say.
Lightning is a flow of electricity. A flash of lightning can heat the air around it to up to 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun!
When lightning heats the air around it, the air expands and makes a loud crashing sound-thunder. If you hear thunder, you are within striking distance of lightning. ""Anytime you hear thunder, you should immediately move to a safe area,"" said scientist E. Philip Krider. Safe places include a school, house, or car.
While it is unusual for people to be struck by lightning, it does happen. According to the National Weather Service, lightning causes nearly 300 injuries and 100 deaths in the United States each year.

Whether you are outdoors or indoors during a thunderstorm, it is important to stay safe.
Try to find shelter in a car or building.
Avoid water, high places, and open spaces.
Do not use a corded telephone. Lightning can strike phone lines.
Avoid using the sink or shower. Lightning can travel through water pipes.
Why is it important for scientist to study lightning!

212,"Its the 200th anniversary of Lincolns birth.
For elementary school students in Idaho, it made cents to collect more than 300,000 pennies. Why? Abraham Lincoln appears on the coin, and the kids needed the money for a big birthday celebration in the 16th U.S. presidents honor.
Kids collect pennies and take part in class projects to remember Lincoln.
Lincoln was born 200 years ago, on Feb. 12, 1809. This month marks the
of his birth. A bicentennial is a 200th anniversary.
The students in Idaho raised money to help
, or move, a statue of Lincoln to a park near the Idaho Capitol. The project is one of hundreds of events across the country being held to celebrate Lincolns birthday.
In Washington, D.C., officials will honor Lincoln with a ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial. That is a special statue of the president. In other states, people will attend speeches and plays about the leader.
There are events being planned in all 50 states, David Early told
. He is a spokesperson for the group that has been planning the celebrations. [Lincoln] believed everyone should be treated the same.
Lincoln served as president during the Civil War (18611865). During that war, Southern states tried to break away from the country. They fought for their right to own slaves. Northern states were against owning slaves. Lincoln was also against slavery. In 1863, he signed the Emancipation Proclamation. It helped free most U.S. slaves.
Thats why third grader Morgan Squires, of Gooding, Idaho, was happy to collect pennies for the president.
[Lincoln] was a great leader, Morgan told
State Capitol, White House: Northwind; Cabin: Corbis
Abraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin in Kentucky. He moved to Illinois when he was a young man. There, he worked as a shop owner and a lawyer. Lincoln also served as a lawmaker for Illinois and the country.
In 1842, Lincoln married Mary Todd. Together they had four sons.
Lincoln became the 16th U.S. president in 1861. The Civil War started a few weeks later. Lincoln won reelection in 1864.
The war was coming to an end in April 1865. Lincoln was shot on April 14, while watching a play in Washington, D.C. He died the next day. Lincoln is buried in Springfield, Ill.

Linda's school was miles away from her home. She was not allowed to attend a whites-only school that was just a few blocks away.
Linda's parents and 12 other families sued the Kansas school system. The case was taken all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
On May 17, 1954, the Court ruled that it was unfair to have separate schools for black and white students.

That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.

So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Keep reading to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's As Easy As One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart (below).
So what's the result? Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

Move over, Spider-Man! Now you don't have to be a comic-book superhero to creep up walls. Scientists have recently invented a powerful tape. Someday, people may be able to use it to climb walls.
To make the tape, scientists studied gecko lizards. The little lizards are great climbers. They can cling to smooth walls and hang from glass ceilings.
What is the secret to the gecko's power? A gecko has millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of its feet. The hairs create a natural force between the gecko's feet and the wall.
Scientists modeled the new tape after the feet of geckos. The tape is covered with billions of tiny plastic hairs. ""It's like Velcro,"" said one scientist.
It will be a long time before the sticky tape is ready for people to use. One scientist believes it may be ready in five years. Until then, the little lizards are still the climbing champions!

, a huge sheet of moving ice.
""I never got used to these 4- or 5-foot crevasses that are hundreds of feet deep,"" said Weihenmayer. ""You had to jump across them. You have to be very careful when you land.""
For most climbers, jumping over a crevasse is hard enough. But for Weihenmayer, jumping over the cracks was particularly hard because he is blind.
Last spring, Erik Weihenmayer became the first blind climber to reach the peak of Mount Everest. He was part of a team of climbers that was sponsored by the National Federation of the Blind.
Mount Everest is 29,035 feet tall and sits on the border between Nepal and China, two countries in Asia. According to many climbers, Mount Everest is one of the hardest and deadliest mountains in the world to climb because of the mountain's height.
""There are a lot of things that can happen up there. You're not ever really sure that you're going to make it,"" Weihenmayer told
. Climbers can suffer from illnesses caused by many things, including the altitude.
sickness occurs when a climber does not get enough oxygen.
The team took more than two months to complete the climb. Weihenmayer spent much of his time moving the team's supplies up the mountain to a base camp, which was located at 17,600 feet. The time spent moving gear helped Erik Weihenmayer get used to the altitude. ""You're letting your body get used to the elevation, the air, the temperature,"" Weihenmayer said.
Weihenmayer, who had already climbed several of the world's highest peaks, had help getting up Mount Everest. ""[People] would walk ahead of me with a bell,"" he said. ""I tried to stay in their footsteps. I tried to stay [close] behind them so I could hear their steps, and I stepped into those places.""
For Weihenmayer, climbing Mount Everest was the toughest but most rewarding experience of his life. When he got to the top, Weihenmayer stopped to think about what he had done.
""I thought about the ground underneath me. I felt these cool flags [at the peak] that were up there in the breeze,"" Weihenmayer said. ""I thought about my family, friends, and about where I was.""
Mount Everest is located in Asia on the border between Nepal and China
May 29, 1953: Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay of Nepal are first to reach to the peak.
May 1, 1963: James Whittaker is the first American to reach the top.

735,"Kids say things on the Internet that they would never say face-to-face
When 13-year-old Katie recently went online, she couldn't believe that some classmates were making fun of her. The seventh grader from New Jersey discovered mean and hurtful comments written about her in an online Web journal.
""It was really offensive and upsetting to me because I knew everyone could see it online,"" Katie told
. ""There was nothing I could do to take it down.""
Katie's story is not unusual. She is one of the many victims of
. ""Cyberbullying is when a child torments, humiliates, or tries to frighten another child using interactive technology,"" online safety expert Parry Aftab told
Instead of teasing or picking on kids in the school yard, bullies have new territorycyberspace. The explosion in technology, such as computers, cell phones, and interactive games, gives bullies more places to do their dirty work.
Cyberbullies use e-mail, instant messages, text messages, and online journals to spread nasty rumors, post embarrassing photos, and tease other kids. Breaking into others' e-mail accounts and sending out mean messages to their buddy lists is a common practice for cyberbullies. Cyberbullies also run up other kids' cell phone bills with text messages. Some kids have even conducted online votes for the ugliest person in class.
For many kids like Katie, online bullying has become part of everyday life. Most cyberbullies are between the ages of 9 and 14. Studies show that about 55 percent of kids in grades 4 through 8 have had mean or hurtful remarks made to them online. ""Cyberbullying is a huge problem in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades,"" said Aftab.
Why is cyberbullying such a growing problem? For starters, kids spend a lot of time online at both home and at school. Nearly two-thirds of American kids have computers in their homes, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Online experts say being mean online is easier because computers give kids a sense of being
, or not being known. Kids say things on the Internet that they would never say face-to-face.
Some kids also don't realize that they're cyberbullies because they don't see the consequences of their actions. ""In face-to-face communication, we see when we've gone too far,"" she says. ""We lose all those visual cues online.""
To address the problem, more schools and communities are educating kids about online etiquette and are holding anti-bullying seminars. Aftab trains groups, called TweenAngels and TeenAngels, to become safe and responsible cybercitizens who share their knowledge with others.
TeenAngel Kendall, 12, experienced cyberbullying when kids at school blocked him out of gaming sites. His advice for dealing with a cyberbully: ""Don't be afraid to tell your parents, teachers, or whomever you trust the most.""
, or fight, cyberbullying, is to take a stand against it. ""The only way cyberbullying will stop is if kids protect each other,"" says Aftab. ""If you stand by and let someone else hurt someone, you're part of the problem. You need to be part of the solution.""
Online safety experts offer the following tips to protect yourself from cyberbullying:
Don't give out your passwords or any private information to anyone, even close friends.
Don't post any information online that you don't want others to read.
Don't answer a mean or threatening e-mail, block the person who sent you the offensive message, and tell a trusted adult. That person can help you take action.
Don't react to a mean message. Walk away from the computer and do something else that you enjoy for a few minutes.
Run your name through search engines, such as Google, to check whether there is information that you don't want on the Internet. Some search engines let you set up alerts that send you an e-mail if a new posting includes your name.
How is face-to-face communication similar to or different from sending a message by e-mail or IM?

Now Rosa's job is to teach U.S. children about the dangers of land mines so they can help fight the problem. I recently caught up with the clever canine at Paradise Valley Elementary School, located in Casper, Wyoming.I watched as Rosa did her job sniffing out some fake land mines. ""She's cool,"" gushed fifth grader Josh Yelton.
Rosa's visit kicked off the Children Against Land Mines Program, also known as CHAMPS. The goal of the program is to raise money to buy, train, and transport mine-sniffing dogs.Wyoming students raised $5,000 in quarters in just a few short weeks, and adults chipped in an additional $8,000. The money will help sponsor a new dog.
A dog's sense of smell and smarts make it the best land-mine locator. In fact, a team of six humans can search about 120 square feet of land in a day. A team of six dogs can search up to 3,000 square feet in a day's time.
The pooch paid for by the Wyoming students will be named Wyoming. That dog will help find buried land mines in Sri Lanka, a country off the southern coast of India.
Land mines not only injure and kill many people, but they also
, or stop, people from moving around freely. For example, the lush fields of Sri Lanka should be filled with crops. Instead, many fields lie unplanted. Farmers are afraid that mines litter their fields. Wyoming's job will be to help get rid of those land mines.
A Sri Lanka government official told me what a huge effect Wyoming and other mine-sniffing dogs will make in his country.
He said, ""The best part of the CHAMPS program will be when all the land mines have been removed.""
In what other ways do dogs help humans?

The NBA has brought back its old ball after trying out a new ball covered in synthetic material.
For the past few months, players had to use a ball covered with a synthetic, or human-made, material. Many players, including O'Neal, complained the plasticcoated basketball was a bad decision. They said the new ball didn't bounce as well as the leather ball. The new ball also cut their hands. ""The new ball is terrible,"" O'Neal, the Miami Heat center, says.
Scientists at the University of Texas at Arlington ran experiments comparing the synthetic and leather balls. The biggest difference they found was in the way the new ball absorbs moisture.
The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture than the leather ball does. That means the synthetic ball doesn't become heavier when it comes in contact with players' sweat. It also means the synthetic ball can become slippery because moisture stays on its surface, scientist Kaushik De, who helped conduct the study, told
The return of the leather ball has many NBA players jumping for joy. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us.""

Griswold, who is a radio traffic reporter by day, runs a ""bat hospital"" in her Connecticut home. While you wont find these little creatures stretched out on hospital beds, you might find one or two of them snuggling up to Griswold.
At her home, Griswold cares for bats that are sick, injured, or orphaned. She has taken care of bats with injuries, such as a broken wing, as well as babies that have lost their mothers.
She has also cared for bats that were stranded in the winter because they had forgotten to travel south during the colder months. With the help of a

But Griswold is no stranger to bats. She grew up on a farm where they were a common sight. So it was no surprise how quickly she took to an orphaned baby bat she found squeaking on the ground outside her house ten years ago. She took the bat in and fed it milk from a goat on her farm.
To her delight, the little creature survived the night. Today, the bat--which she named Poppy--still lives with her. She did not release Poppy back into the wild because it identifies more with humans than with bats.

Bats pollinate plants, spread seeds, and, most important, eat insects. ""There is no animal worldwide that eats more bugs at night than bats do,"" said Griswold, who is full of bat trivia.
However, the number of bats worldwide is in serious decline. They often lose their homes when people cut down trees.
But Griswolds message seems to be spreading. After she spoke to a Brownie troop, the members built bat houses in their town. The project turned into a community effort. ""The kids are making such a huge difference,"" she said.

Accepting the Nobel award for work in promoting peace will be Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank. It might seem strange that someone would receive a peace prize for founding a bank. But Yunus is no ordinary banker.
In 1983, Yunus founded Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, a country in Asia. The bank gives small loans to poor villagers, especially women. The Nobel Prize committee honored Yunus because ""peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty.""
In addition to celebrating progress toward peace, the Nobel committee gives awards for achievements in other areas, such as literature, physics, chemistry, and medicine. Each of the winners receives $1.4 million, a gold medal, and a diploma.
The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway. The other Nobel Prizes are given out in Stockholm, Sweden. Both countries are in Europe.
This year, all five of the science Nobels went to Americansthe first time that has happened since 1983. Scientist Roger Kornberg won the chemistry prize for his work on how people inherit diseases. In 1959, as a 12-year-old, Roger watched his father, Arthur Kornberg, win a Nobel Prize. The Kornbergs are the sixth father-and-son pair to have won Nobel Prizes.
Although Roger was stunned by his win, his father saw it coming. ""His work has been awesome,"" says his dad.
The Nobel Prizes were the brainchild of Alfred Bernhard Nobel (18331896) of Sweden, the inventor of dynamite. At the time of his death, Nobel left $9 million to fund the prizes that bear his name. The first annual Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901. The prizes are presented each year on December 10the anniversary of Nobels death.

At one time, the tiny moons were probably large rocks traveling through space. When they passed by Saturn, the planet's gravity pulled them in and captured them. The rocks have been orbiting the planet ever since. Over time, the large moons broke apart to form the smaller moons.

For years, Michael Newdow of California has fought to have the phrase removed from the pledge. He continually argues that because of the pledge's reference to God, his elementary school daughter should not have to listen to it recited daily.
Last year, the case did not make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Given the recent lower court's ruling, it is unclear whether the Supreme Court will now hear the controversial case.
Should the Pledge of Allegiance be banned from public schools because of the phrase ""under God""? Discuss in class. Then cast your vote at
According to the federal court, the phrase ""under God"" suggests that the government supports religion. That violates the First Amendment to the Constitution. That amendment guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and press. People often refer to part of this amendment as the separation of church and state.
Newdow provides the reverse argument for removing the reference to God from the pledge. He says, ""Imagine you send your kids to school every day, and the teachers [make] them stand up and say, ""We are one nation that denies God exists.""
The pledge represents a way for many Americans to express their
, or loyalty to the country. ""Our school board has long supported [the pledge] as an appropriate patriotic exercise for willing students,"" says Steven Ladd, the superintendent from one of the California school districts affected by the ruling.
Others point out that the Declaration of Independence and the national anthem contain religious references. Critics of the ruling argue that saying the pledge is

tell when you stay up late? Think again.
During a recent sleep study, teachers noticed that kids had more difficulty learning when they stayed up an hour or two past their bedtime. ""Getting [to sleep] on time is as important as getting [to school] on time,"" says Gahan Fallone, who helped conduct the research.
Scientists followed 74 students ages 6 to 12 from Rhode Island and Massachusetts for the three-week study. During that time, the researchers tracked the sleeping habits of students. Teachers, who werent told how long the kids slept or which week they stayed up late, rated the students performance in school.
The teachers could tell when students didnt get enough sleep. Students who slept eight hours or less a night were more forgetful, had more trouble paying attention, and had difficulty learning new lessons.
How much sleep do kids need? Health experts from the National Sleep Foundation recommend that students ages 7 to 10 get at least 10 hours of sleep a night.
Teachers and principals have long been aware that students who get enough sleep generally perform better in school, which leads to better grades. At Potter- Burns Elementary in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, school officials send notes home to parents asking them to make sure kids get enough shut-eye before the yearlyachievement tests. ""Definitely there is impact on students performances if they come to school tired,"" says the schools principal, John Haidemenos.

198,"""May I stay up just a little longer?"" That's the cry heard from kids every night in many U.S. households. That's because most kids don't want to go to bed.
Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks.
The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8? hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said.
Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said.
In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should.
Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school.
Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep.
Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' ""
If a kid loses one hour of sleep a night, how many hours of sleep does he or she lose in a week? A month? A year?

President Bush says that he has worked to reduce pollution. Earlier this year, he announced a plan to improve the country's water quality.
To help Americans breathe cleaner air, Bush started the Clear Skies program. It is designed to reduce the amount of air pollution from power plants.
President Bush has allowed companies to cut down trees in some national parks. He says that will help prevent the number of wildfires.
The president favors oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He says the new oil source will reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East and will lower the cost of gasoline. He also wants car companies to use hydrogen fuel cells, a clean energy source, to power vehicles.
Kerry wants to do more to keep our waterways free from pollution.
Senator Kerry does not think President Bush is doing a good job taking care of the environment. He says that Bush has not enforced many important pollution laws.
Kerry thinks more needs to be done to keep our waterways clean and free from pollution. He plans to make the air cleaner and launch new ways to protect the country's water supply.
If elected, Kerry proposes to give more money to national parks. He says that Bush has let companies cut down too many trees.
Kerry also opposes Bush's plan to drill for oil in Alaska. Kerry wants to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil by using new forms of energy. He also supports the making of more fuel-efficient vehicles.

360,"If you listen to music, you are probably like millions of other kids--you turn up the volume when you hear your favorite song. Listening to loud music may be fun, but a government study shows it may also be dangerous.
According to the study, which was paid for by the U.S. government, more than 5 million kids, ages 6 to 19, have suffered some hearing loss. That's more than one out of every ten kids. Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss.
Amanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. ""It was assumed in the past that children wouldn't have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage,"" Niskar said.
Niskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a ""problem for children,"" she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems.
Hearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems.
For example, hearing loss ""can influence [a] child's ability to learn in the classroom,"" Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions.
Niskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead.
Listen Up! This diagram shows the parts of your ear. Loud noises can damage the cochlea and cause hearing loss.

Peacekeepers from the United Nations (U.N.) helped to free Alhaji. In 2001, he addressed the U.N., asking that organization to help children around the world who are forced to fight in war zones.
""We ask this body on behalf of Sierra Leone to do all they can to bring our sad story to an end,"" he said. ""We want to be able to move about freely in all parts of the country.""
Sierra Leone is just one of an estimated 41 countries around the world that use child soldiers. While the most offenses occur in Africa and Asia, the problem also exists in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East.
Most children who become soldiers come from very poor countries. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers estimates that 300,000 children are fighting as soldiers. In some countries, boys and girls as young as 8 years old are being recruited, or called upon, to fight.
Protecting children in war and conflict zones has become a top job for the United Nations. And the U.N. has made significant progress. In a report issued in December 2002, the U.N. named 28 governments and armed groups that use children to fight their battles.
International law prohibits countries from using children who are younger than 15 years old in combat. However, several U.N. conventions condemn, or do not approve of, having anyone under 18 serve as a soldier. If a country recruits child soldiers, it is violating, or breaking the rule of, international agreements.
Why us it important for governments around the world to protect children?
The U.N. wants to save children like Alhaji Babah Sawane from suffering. The report sends a strong message to governments everywhere: They will be held accountable for their actions.

Such legends are important to native Hawaiians. Today, however, ancient gods are a part of a fiery debate in this land of spirits.
Mauna Kea is an extinct, or dead, volcano on the island of Hawaii. According to an ancient Hawaiian saying, Mauna Kea ""is the astonishing mountain that stands in the calm."" These days the 13,700-foot-high peak is anything but calm.
, scientists who study space, say the mountain peak is a perfect spot to place telescopes.
Currently, scientists use 13 telescopes in a special 11,000-acre area called the Science Reserve on Mauna Kea. Using those telescopes, scientists have made several important astronomical discoveries. The scientists who use the telescopes pay a fee to the University of Hawaii, which built the observatories.
The use of the mountain for scientific research, however, is the source of a debate between scientists and some native Hawaiians. Some Hawaiians believe that the top of Mauna Kea is sacred, or an important place to their religion. They believe that the peak is the home of the snow goddess Poli'ahu.

""We don't get a penny from Mauna Kea, and it's our land,"" said Jon Osorio, of the Center for Hawaiian Studies.
University officials say that a master plan, completed in June, addresses native Hawaiian concerns. The goals of the plan include educating people about Mauna Kea. It also states how many telescopes the university can build in the future.
According to observers, the debate will not end soon. A 1968 agreement gives the university control of the area until 2033. Until then, native Hawaiians will fight for what is theirs while scientists keep studying the skies.

Drumbeats echoed. Songs and cheers filled the air. Spirits soared. More than 20,000 Native Americans in traditional feather headdresses and clothing gathered in Washington, D.C., in late September.
They were there to celebrate the grand opening of the National Museum of the American Indian. The new museum is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It is located on the National Mall, near the U.S. Capitol.

, or came together, for the museum's opening. A six-day festival followed the opening ceremony. The festival featured Native American dancing, music, foods, and storytelling.
The museum is dedicated to the life, culture, and traditions of Native Americans. It tells the stories and struggles of tribes throughout North, South, and Central America.
Ten-year-old Jessica Lovato, from the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe in New Mexico, joined the celebration. To her, visiting the museum was ""a great learning experience!""
Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, Edward S. Curtis Collection, [reproduction number, LC-USZ62-130198]
Native American artifacts, such as these baskets, will be on display at the National Museum of the American Indian.
A wealthy New Yorker named George Gustav Heye collected most of the new museum's items throughout the early 1900s. He was interested in Native American culture and traditions.
There are about 800,000 Native American objects included in the museum's collection. The museum plans to display about 8,000 artifacts at a time.
The 4 million people who are expected to visit each year won't just find ancient objects--although there are plenty of them to see. Officials say the new museum also teaches people about Native Americans in modern times. Along with ancient pieces, such as beadwork, pottery, and carvings, visitors will also find newer ones, such as modern art and beaded sneakers.
The museum has been a work in progress for 16 years. Twenty-four Native American tribes helped build and plan the museum. They even reviewed the traditional dishes served in the museum's caf.
Symbolism abounds in the five-story building, which is made of limestone from Minnesota. The building's curved exterior resembles rocks shaped by wind and water over thousands of years.
In honor of many types of Native American dwellings, the museum's entrance faces east, in the direction of the rising sun. Inside, an electronic welcome sign greets visitors in 150 Native American languages.
Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today, each with its own culture. Native Americans have lived in North, South, and Central America for more than 20,000 years. When European explorers first arrived in North America, they thought they had landed in the East Indies. Those are islands located near Asia. That is why the explorers called the people living in the Americas ""Indians.""
To many Native Americans, the new museum has been a long time coming. ""[It is] long overdue,"" said Lawrence Small, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
Now that it is officially open, Native Americans hope the new museum keeps their culture alive. ""This will be a good education tool for everyone that wants to learn about the Indian people,"" a Cherokee woman told
. ""Our languages are still here. Our culture is still here.""
Why is the new museum an important part of Native American history?

as she watched heavy rains and high winds rip through her hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana. The 9-year-old had been getting ready to start fourth grade. Her brother, Terren, had arranged his school supplies in his backpack to prepare for his first day of second grade. But Hurricane Katrina prevented schools in New Orleans from opening.
When New Orleans flooded, Tenisha and her family headed 350 miles west to Houston, Texas. They spent five days in a Houston hotel until a local family provided them with shelter. Now Tenisha and her brother are getting used to a new school in Houston. ""I've started making new friends already,"" Tenisha told
Tenisha and Terren are not alone. An estimated 372,000 children from Louisiana and Mississippi have found themselves in new schools, since the hurricane caused damage and flooding in those states. Schools from Maine to California have embraced students like Tenisha and Terren with hugs, smiles, and welcome signs.
Schools in Texas expect to enroll as many as 60,000 new kids. Houston schools alone enrolled almost 2,000 students in the few days following the devastating hurricane.
Two schools in Houston that had closed last spring have reopened. The two schools are now devoted entirely to
children. An evacuee is a person forced to move from a place of danger. School principals are also hiring hundreds of new teachersmany are evacuees from Louisiana and Mississippi.
Being the new kid at school is never easy. Experts say that it's even harder for children
because of the hurricane. Displaced people have been forced to flee from their homes.
Students who have left their homes have to
or get used to, new schools, teachers, and friends, say officials. Schools also play an important role in helping kids from the stricken areas cope with the disaster of Katrina.
Tenisha and Terren are adjusting well to their new schoolMacGregor Music and Science Magnet School in Houston. So far, MacGregor has accepted more than 12 displaced students. ""We want each one of the new children to feel this is home for them,"" the school's principal, Patsy Brown, told
Students at MacGregor have welcomed the new faces. ""We want to make our new classmates feel good because we know they've gone through so much,"" fourth grader James McKethen told
James's sister, third grader Tiye McKethen, agrees. ""It's cool to have new friends. And they get to have fun in a new school and stay in a safe place.""
After just two days, Tenisha and Terren were settling in at MacGregor. ""Our new school is great!"" Tenisha told
But the siblings know that life has changed. Despite the warm welcome, Terren misses playing basketball with his friends in New Orleans. Tenisha, too, misses her old teachers. What's next for the family? They will likely settle down in Texas. Tenisha says, ""I want to stay in Houston.""
I live in Desoto, a town outside Dallas, Texas. My school district has taken in roughly 188 students from New Orleans. I must hand it to the kids; they are adapting pretty fast. It is cool because our school is doing everything to make the new students feel at home. We call it ""Southern hospitality.""
I have seen many acts of kindnesswhether it's letting a kid from New Orleans go to the front of the lunch line or giving a new student a personal tour of the school.
I wonder if I could be as strong if my city went through a disaster such as Katrina. What happens to New Orleans from here, we don't know. But what we do know is that we need to appreciate our family and friends. We need to be thankful for the things that we have because we do not know what tomorrow will bring.
Christopher Ray Clark is a sixth grader from the DallasFort Worth area. He and his family have been volunteering to help Katrina evacuees.

582,"Tourists Put Pressure on World's Monuments and Parks
Some of the World's most important monuments and parks are being loved to death. Many sites around the world are in bad shape because of a recent sharp increase in the number of tourists worldwide. The causes of damage range from everyday wear and tear to pollution to
, or the destruction of property on purpose.
Each year, hundreds of millions of tourists visit special places around the world. In fact, according to the World Tourism Organization, by the end of this year about 668 million people will have made tourist trips. By 2020, the organization said, that number may more than double, to 1.5 billion tourists!
The problem is that a large number of visitors can damage a monument or park. The thousands of cars and buses that carry tourists to a site create air pollution. Air pollution can discolor and damage monuments made of stone and other materials. Huge numbers of tourists also cause garbage to pile up. And sometimes tourists take pieces of monuments away with them as souvenirs.
These are some of the special places that are suffering from too much attention:
. These are two of the biggest national parks in the United States. Millions of tourists each year crowd into these areas. As a result, air pollution, garbage, and other damage have marred these awesome sites.
. Located in Peru, a country in South America, Machu Picchu is the site of an ancient city in the Andes Mountains. A people called the Incas built the city almost 600 years ago for Incan royalty. Garbage tossed aside by tourists, as well as air and water pollution, are now problems at Machu Picchu.
. The Parthenon is a temple that was built almost 2,500 years ago in Athens, a city in the European country of Greece. Air pollution has pitted and discolored the marble that the beautiful building is made of.
. Located near the town of Dunhuang, in north-central China, these caves are covered with delicate paintings and carvings. However, the breath of the 300,000 visitors who pass through the 492 caves each year is damaging the artwork, which is between 700 and 1,700 years old.
To help preserve such important places, new rules are being written by organizations such as UNESCO, which is a part of the United Nations. UNESCO is working with governments worldwide to limit the number of tourists who visit some special sites.
UNESCO is also working to educate sightseers about how to avoid damaging the places they visit. As one student who works with UNESCO said, ""You have to protect the past to reach tomorrow.""
If you are visiting a monument or national park, here are a few rules the U.S. Park Service says you should always follow:
If you are camping, take your trash and leftover food out with you when you leave.
When visiting a monument, don't touch sculptures, paintings, or other artwork.
Leave any artifacts, plants, stones, or other things where they are.
If you see someone damaging a monument or throwing garbage on the ground in a park, tell a park ranger or another park official.

Scientists are trying to solve a mystery: Where is Christopher Columbus buried? The Dominican Republic-an island in Central America-also claims to have the remains of this famous explorer.
In 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain and arrived in North America. He made four trips altogether. Before he died in 1506, he asked to be buried on the island that is today the Dominican Republic. It is part of the area he explored on his third and fourth trips.
When Spain lost control of the island, his body was moved. Spanish officials think it was taken to the island of Cuba before possibly being moved back to Spain. However, the Dominican Republic says the Spanish travelers took the wrong remains. By testing the bones, Spanish scientists hope to get to the truth of the matter.

Rats have always lived in cities. The rodents live off food and waste that people throw away. Recently, however, rat populations have grown because many communities don't have the money to pay for rat-control programs, said Jerry Hershovitz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Such programs keep rat populations down.
Rats can carry diseases that can make people seriously ill, so controlling the rat population is important.
The solution to the rat problem is to limit their food supply, say experts. For example, people in cities should use garbage cans that rats cannot get into.

Until recently, scientists didn't know what happened to the Maya. Now they may have found the answer hidden in an ancient staircase. They found the staircase in Dos Pilas, Guatemala. Dos Pilas was an ancient Maya city. Winds from a hurricane uncovered the staircase.
Scientists studied carvings on the steps. The carvings are called

Scientists translated the hieroglyphs. The writing shows that the Maya disappeared after a brutal war.
During the long war, the people living in two Maya cities fought one another. The people of Tikal, in Guatemala, battled the people of Calakmul, in Mexico. The rulers of each city wanted to control the entire area.
Dos Pilas was located south of both cities. Dos Pilas had been founded by the ruler of Tikal as a military outpost. The brother of Tikal's ruler ran the outpost.
At one point in the war, Calakmul took control of Dos Pilas. Calakmul's warriors spared the life of the ruler of Dos Pilas, so he changed sides. He attacked and defeated his brother in Tikal.
""This was not part of a struggle between two brothers, but part of a world war,"" said historian Arthur A. Demarest.
After Dos Pilas defeated Tikal, the brutal war between Tikal and Calakmul got worse. Eventually Tikal regained its former strength and ""roared back and crushed Calakmul,"" Demarest said.
The fighting between the two cities continued for years. The constant warfare weakened both cities.
The war also weakened the Maya civilization, which began to crumble. Today, only ruins of ancient buildings remain as evidence that the Maya once ruled the area.

or smaller earthquakes. The quakes sent people running from their homes in search of safety.
""We all just fled as quickly as we could,"" an Indonesian worker told reporters. The worker was in the seaside town of Padang when the ground began to move. Padang is just a few miles southwest of the
of the earthquake. The epicenter is the area above the underground point where the earthquake begins.
Many people living near the ocean ran for higher ground during the tremors. They feared that the earthquake would trigger giant waves similar to the devastating tsunami that hit southern Asia and eastern Africa in 2004. That disaster was caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake in the Indian Ocean off Sumatra. Fortunately, the March earthquake was not powerful enough to cause a similar disaster.
The earthquake was strong enough to topple buildings inland. The town of Solok suffered the most damage. Hospitals there ran out of beds for injured people. Cots were set up for patients being treated for cuts and broken bones.
The islands that make up Indonesia are located along the
That is an area along the edge of the Pacific Ocean where Earth's tectonic plates push against each other, often causing earthquakes and volcanoes. In parts of Indonesia, an average of five earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 5 occur each year.

136,"Latest Finds at La Brea Tar Pits
A saber-toothed cat leaps from behind a bush. It moves toward the side of a stream. It's a hot day, and the cat is thirsty. What the cat doesn't see is the shallow pool of liquid asphalt that is covered by a thin layer of sand. As the cat nears the stream, it steps into the sticky black asphalt.
The bones from about 2,000 saber-toothed cats have been pulled from La Brea.
Soon, all four paws are stuck in the muck, and the cat is trapped. Struggling to get free, the cat becomes covered in the asphalt. Several days pass, and the cat, still stuck in the asphalt, dies of starvation.
Now, 35,000 years later, that sandy streamside spot is known as the La Brea (BRAY-ah) tar pits in Los Angeles, California. Last month, scientists finished their annual dig at La Brea's Pit 91.
The scientists unearthed nearly 1,000 fossils and spent time studying those fossils. ""The information we captured will tell us more about what life was like in this area 35,000 years ago than we've ever known before,"" said scientist Chris Shaw. By studying the fossils pulled from the tar pits, scientists are learning more about how Earth's environment has changed through time.
Shaw has been working at the La Brea site for nearly 30 years. ""My favorite part of the job is when I'm actually in the pit digging,"" Shaw told
. He added that he has become used to being covered in dirt and asphalt. ""It's like working in a big sandbox.""
Shaw spends much of his time at the George C. Page Museum in Los Angeles overseeing the huge collection of fossils pulled from La Brea. The museum holds thousands of fossils of prehistoric animals that died in the tar pit.
Some of the animals that fell into La Brea include woolly mammoths, bison, horses, ground sloths, western camels, and llamas. Many of the fossils that have been collected are from about 25,000 to 35,000 years ago.
During that time, Earth was cooler and was just coming out of one of many ice ages.
During ice ages, when Earth's temperature cooled, great sheets of ice, called
, formed at Earth's poles and over huge areas of land.
Digging at Pit 91 has stopped until May 2001. In the meantime, Shaw and other scientists will study the many fossils they have pulled from La Brea.
After 30 years, Shaw still loves his work. ""The coolest thing about doing fieldwork,"" Shaw said, ""is realizing that the fossil you're touching has not seen the light of day for about 30,000 years.""

200,"Scientists recently discovered three previously unknown species of mouse lemurs. The find is important, because the numbers of lemurs left in the wild is dwindling.
Scientists found the lemurs on Madagascar, an island nation off the southeast coast of Africa. Madagascar is home to more than 30 species of lemurs. Most lemurs are the size of small rodents, but some can grow to be as large as a medium-sized dog. Lemurs are usually
animals, which means they mostly sleep during the day and come out at night.
The discovery surprised scientists. ""It's incredibly rare to discover a new species of primate, let alone three new species,"" said Steven Goodman of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.
Lemurs live only in the island nations of Madagascar and Comoros.
The smallest lemur weighs about 1 ounce.
The newly discovered species live only in the rain forests along Madagascar's west coast. They weigh a few ounces and eat beetles, fruits, and plants.
All lemurs on Madagascar are in trouble, however. Scientists fear that lemurs are in danger of becoming extinct.
One threat is from people cutting down the trees in which lemurs live. The trees are being cleared to create farmland. Another threat to lemurs comes from hunters who are trapping the primates for food.
To protect lemurs and the rain forests in which they live, wildlife officials in Madagascar have set up special parks and nature reserves. Loggers and hunters cannot cut down the trees or hunt the animals in the nature reserves.
Scientists hope that the special areas are large enough to protect all the species of lemurs that are living today. Scientists are especially concerned because there may be undiscovered species that need protection. ""So many areas of Madagascar haven't been [explored],"" said Dean Gibson of the Duke University Primate Center. ""I think there are more [species] to find.""

Jaguars and anteaters in northern South America can rest easy. A section of the Amazon rain forest as big as Illinois was recently placed under government protection. The land in Brazil links to protected areas in other South American countries, including Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana.
In total, these protected forests cover nearly 58,000 square miles. The land also contains more than 25 percent of the world's

Environmentalists from the group Conservation International say this area of the northern Amazon has more

or types, of plants and animals than any other place in the world.
Since 1970, more than 232,000 square miles of the Amazon rain forest have been destroyed. That is nearly the size of Texas! The destruction has endangered many animal species. Experts predict that the continued
or clearing of trees, at this rate would endanger the entire region by 2050.
Officials were especially concerned about preserving the forests. Part of the area is believed to contain more than half of all bird, animal, and plant species found in the Amazon. Many endangered animals, including the giant Amazon otter, make their homes there. Under the government's plan, those parts of the Amazon will be off-limits to the public.
""If any tropical rain forest on Earth remains intact a century from now, it will be this portion of [the northern Amazon],"" says Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International.
The Amazon rain forest is the world's largest tropical rain forest. It covers about 2 million square milesroughly two-thirds the size of the United States. The map shows the location of the Amazon rain forest and its newly protected areas.

Last month, workers in Oklahoma loaded about a dozen pieces of historic Route 66 onto trucks. Each of the 3,000-pound pieces then made a 1,400-mile trip to Washington, D.C., where they will become part of an exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
Route 66 has been called the ""Main Street of America."" It once stretched 2,400 miles, from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California. The road connected eight states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
In the 1920s, engineer Cyrus Stevens Avery of Tulsa, Oklahoma, envisioned a road connecting the Midwest and the Pacific Ocean. During the 1930s, Route 66 was completed and was soon lined with hundreds of businesses.
The road became so popular that it inspired a 1960s TV show,

In the past few decades, however, Route 66 has fallen into disrepair, and parts of the old route have been dug up. Today, drivers use faster superhighways to get where they were going.
Even though fewer people drive on Route 66 now, many people still think of the road as the Main Street of America. That's why the National Museum of American History wants to include the road in its new exhibit, ""America on the Move."" The exhibit is scheduled to open in 2003.

CIS is just one of hundreds of schools in the United States that are going green. A
is built with recycled and environmentally friendly materials. Green schools are designed to use less energy than traditional school buildings.
The majority of the energy supply in the United States comes from the burning of
such as oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels were formed from the remains of prehistoric animals and plants. People use fossil fuels when they drive their cars, heat their homes, and power farms, factories, and cities.
Though people depend on fossil fuels, those energy sources have their drawbacks. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air and releases gases that contribute to global warmingthe gradual rise in Earth's average temperature.
Hoover Dam generates clean energy by using water to spin turbines.
Fossil fuels are gradually being used up. To conserve them, scientists are looking to
sources. Renewable energy is power from sources that can't be used up and do not pollute the environment. Water, wind, and solar power are types of renewable energy.
President George W. Bush announced an energy plan that calls on lawmakers to ensure that ecofriendly fuels are developed and made easily available to Americans. Gas is a fossil fuel used in cars, and the price to fill up a gas tank is rising. Gas costs about $3 a gallon in some parts of the United States.
At CIS, students are excited for construction to begin on their new school building. ""I think the school is going to be a lot better,"" Drew Barsody, 10, told
""I'm looking forward to seeing the solar panels.""
These wind turbines convert wind into electricity.
Here are some common environmentally friendly energy alternatives.
Solar Power: Solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat and electricity. California and Arizona are two states that use solar power. One drawback of solar power is that energy can't be collected if the sun isn't shining.
Energy produced from windmills is used to generate electricity. The amount of electricity generated from wind has been growing in recent years, tripling since 1998 in the United States. Electricity is produced from wind in 30 states, including California, Texas, and Iowa.
is one of the oldest sources of energy. Hydropower often comes from dams or waterfalls. Of all renewable energy sources, it is most often used to generate electricity. In 2004, it accounted for 7 percent of all the electricity generated in the United States.
Ethanol is a clean-burning fuel that can power cars. It is created from several sources, such as corn crops. Typically, a small amount of ethanol is combined with gasoline to fuel vehicles. That helps decrease the fuel's cost and harmful emissions.
Turning off the lights when you leave a room is one way to conserve energy. What are some other ways to save energy?

361,"The Heat Is On: Will Global Warming Affect Animals?
Polar bears in Alaska are having trouble catching one of their main meals--ringed seals. To get to the seals, the bears often walk across islands of ice floating in the water.
Ice throughout Alaska is melting earlier and faster in the spring than it did several years ago. So polar bears don't have as much time to catch seals before the ice melts. As a result, polar bears are catching fewer seals.
Ice along Alaska's coast is melting because the temperature is higher worldwide. In the last 100 years, Earth's temperature has risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit.
. Global warming is changing the environment worldwide. As a result, many plants and animals are being affected, say scientists from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
As temperatures rise, more and more animals will have to
, or move, in order to survive, said scientist Jay Malcolm of the WWF.
Many plants and animals that can't adjust or migrate will not survive the rise in temperature, said WWF scientists. In some areas of the world, the WWF says, as many as two in ten species of plants and animals will die out by the year 2100.
Here are some examples of how global warming is affecting some animals in North America.
The numbers on the map show where each animal can be found.
The black guillemot (GIL-uh-maht) is a bird that lives on an island off Alaska's coast. It eats Arctic cod, a fish that lives in water under ice. Rising temperatures have caused much of the ice to melt. The Arctic cod has moved to other parts of the sea where water is still covered with ice. The guillemot no longer has enough fish to eat.
The American bistort is a plant that lives in Mount Rainier National Park. The Edith's checkerspot butterfly drinks nectar from bistort flowers. The warming temperatures have caused the butterflies to hatch earlier, before the flowers bloom, so the butterflies don't have enough food right after they hatch.
Global warming is actually helping some animals.
The Mexican vole lives in areas with warm temperatures. It is spreading northward into Arizona and Colorado because of the rise in temperatures there.
For years, red fire ants lived in the warm southern part of the United States. Today, because of rising temperatures, they are spreading northward.
Scientists have learned that global warming is already affecting Earth. ""We should not expect the effects of global warming to take place 50 years in the future,"" said scientist Rafe Sagarin. ""It's happening right now.""
Scientists agree that Earth has been getting warmer for the last 100 years. They don't agree on
Gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming. Carbon dioxide in the air traps heat from the sun, causing Earth's temperature to rise.
Volcanoes and forest fires release carbon dioxide into the air. Some scientists blame the rise in temperature on volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and other natural events.
Other scientists blame human actions for the rise in temperature. They say Earth has always had volcanoes and forest fires, so why is Earth warming now? Those scientists say the carbon dioxide from automobiles and factories is causing the recent increase in global warming.

Earth's atmosphere is made of several layers. Ozone is a gas that makes up one of those layers. That layer stretches from 6 miles to 30 miles above Earth's surface.
Ozone is an important gas. It protects life on Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. Without ozone, life couldn't exist. The dangerous solar rays are called ultraviolet rays, or UV rays. UV rays can cause sunburn and skin cancer.
The pie chart shows the two most abundant gases in Earth""s atmosphere.
Scientists first noticed the ozone hole in the 1970s. Since then, each year, the hole has opened above Antarctica for a few months in the fall. The largest hole formed in 2000. It was three times larger than the United States. This year, unusually severe storms caused the hole to split, say scientists.
Cold temperatures in the atmosphere over Antarctica and chemical pollution cause the ozone hole. Chemicals that used to be in aerosol cans, air conditioners, and refrigerators made the pollution. To protect the atmosphere, people stopped using those dangerous chemicals in the mid-1990s.
Although the chemicals are no longer used, they stay in the atmosphere for a long time. Scientists say the ozone hole will continue to form for a long time. But it should start getting smaller.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.

President George W. Bush recently recognized the heroic efforts Americans have made in the wake of this tragedy. In a speech on September 18, Bush said: ""Out of our tears and sadness, we saw the best of America. We saw a great country rise up to help. Tens of millions of dollars and thousands of hours and tons of food and clothing have all been donated to help rebuild shattered lives.""
By flying flags and holding vigils, millions of Americans shared the president's sentiments. ""As Americans, there is a bond between us, no matter how far away we are from one another,"" said Karen Bogart of Pasadena, California.
In the aftermath of the attacks, thousands of heroes offered to help. Those heroes were the volunteers, firefighters, police officers, and emergency crews at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Many of those heroes traveled thousands of miles to help out at ""ground zero,"" the site of the World Trade Center collapse, in New York City. ""We've had fire departments from Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and so many other places help us,"" said New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In addition to their usual jobs, rescue workers looked for pets trapped in deserted apartments or injured in the attacks. Many people who live near the World Trade Center in New York City had to leave their apartments quickly and were not allowed to return--even for their pets.
""Sometimes the owners feel so guilty that they abandoned their pets,"" said Jennifer Olsen of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ""But it is so gratifying to see them when they reunite with their pets after all this time.""
The rescued animals included cats, dogs, birds, and even a
, a kind of lizard. To get to the gecko, named Little Dude, rescue workers had to climb stairs to the 39th floor of a building. Despite that obstacle, Little Dude was reunited with its owner.
Whether rescue workers cleared rubble, looked for and helped survivors, or retrieved lost pets, their heroic efforts made all Americans proud to be Americans. Recently, President Bush also spoke of national pride. ""As president of this great land, nothing made me more proud.""

If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
The study warns that ocean life is being wiped out because of overfishing and pollution.
Global warming (a rise in Earth's temperatures) and habitat loss are also to blame for the decline in seafood.
Although the world's sea life is in serious danger, it's not too late to reverse the problem, says the study's lead author, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. The researchers have called for measures to protect current fish populations, such as reducing large-scale fishing and pollution. ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we don't change things,"" Worm told reporters.
The loss of ocean life will cause more than just a shortage of seafood. It could spell disaster for ecosystems too. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that work together as a unit to live. A declining fish population would cause a disaster up and down the food chain. Larger animals, such as seals and dolphins, depend on fish for food. Without enough fish to eat, those animals would be in trouble.

257,"""A penny for your thoughts"" is something many people say to one another. Soon, however, the old saying may have to be changed to ""a nickel for your thoughts.""
Saying that a penny has ""virtually no value,"" Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona wants stores to stop using the penny. He has introduced a bill in Congress that would require stores to round prices to the nearest nickel.
Kolbe says that most people don't usually use their pennies. He says people just toss the coins aside.
Critics, however, disagree with Kolbe. They argue that if Kolbe's bill becomes law, people will pay more for many of the things they buy. The critics claim stores will round most of their prices up, not down.
The penny is the oldest currency authorized by the U.S. government. The government first minted the 1 cent coin in 1787. Since then, the U.S. Treasury Department has made more than 300 billion pennies.

322,"Scientists are going ape over orangutans (o-RANG-oo-tanz). They are working to help save these endangered tree dwellers before they disappear from the wild.
In recent years, the red-haired apes have found themselves out on a limb. Wildlife experts warn that they may die out, or become
, within the next 20 years. Scientists estimate that only 30,000 orangutans are left in the wild.
Today, orangutans can be found only in tropical rain forests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, in Southeast Asia. They are
creatures, which means they eat, sleep, and travel mainly in trees.
To search for food, orangutans swing from branch to branch. They like to dine on leaves, flowers, bark, and sometimes insects.
""Orangutans spend most of their time in the trees and won't cross open grounds, so the only way they can [move]... is through the trees,"" said one wildlife expert. ""We need to maintain these forest [areas] so that orangutan populations of the future have the opportunity to continue to survive.""
What is causing the numbers of orangutans to decrease at an alarming rate? The main reason is the destruction of their rain forest
Humans pose the greatest threat to orangutans for a number of reasons, say experts. People cut down trees for lumber. This illegal logging is destroying much of the animals' homes. Many countries, including the United States, buy the lumber. It is often used in shelves, picture frames, and floors.
Forest fires and farming are also to blame. As forests are cleared to make way for plantations, orangu-tans lose parts of their habitat.
In addition, orangutans have fallen victim to the recent boom in the illegal pet trade. People steal baby orangutans from the forest to sell them as pets.
To help bring these animals back from the brink of extinction, wildlife groups are working to protect orangutans and stop illegal logging. The government in the area is also involved in the effort to help orangutans. Police go into national parks to prevent illegal loggers from cutting down trees.
""Help is needed to save these amazing creatures,"" orangutan expert Cheryl Knott told
. ""If we can save the rain forest for orangutans, we can save it for other animals as well.""
The average life span for orangutans is about 50 years. Experts hope that orangutans born today will still be swinging through the trees at that age.
The orangutan got its name--which means ""person of the forest""--for a reason. Orangutans are remarkably intelligent. In the wild, scientists have spotted these clever creatures using sticks as tools to open fruit. Orangutans have been observed using large leaves as umbrellas to shelter themselves from heavy rains. Sometimes, the apes even use leaves as cups, from which they drink water.
Are there any endangered animals in the area where you live? What can people do to help them?

452,"Right now, 53 million kids--more kids than ever before--are in school in the United States. So many kids are now attending school that many communities don't have enough schools for all of them. To solve that problem, some communities are sending kids to school in old stores, car dealerships, and malls!
The number of kids in school is increasing. In 15 years, eight million more kids than today will attend U.S. schools. Educators wonder what to do with all those kids. ""We need to figure out where we will put these children and who will teach them,"" said Richard Riley, U.S. Secretary of Education.
Educators say 10 million additional teachers will be needed to teach those kids.
Mesa, Arizona, is typical of many communities that have more kids than school space. Mesa has 84 schools and 550 classroom trailers parked around those schools. And still there isn't enough room for all the school-age kids.
To solve its space problem, officials in Mesa are building new schools. The community is also recycling old stores into schools.
This year, 700 elementary students in Mesa are attending the new Pedro Guerrero School, which used to be a supermarket. Where families once shopped for vegetables, kids now learn reading, history, science, and math.
Cassandra Fernandez attends the new school. The fifth grader's mother, who used to shop at the store, was worried when she heard that the city planned to turn it into a school. ""I thought, how are they going to make that [store] into a school?"" she said. Cassandra's mother, however, now likes the school and all the new equipment in it.
Mesa isn't the only community that has recycled old buildings into schools. Schools in Georgia, New Jersey, Ohio, and other states are also recycling schools. Recycling old buildings into schools is less expensive and takes less time than building new schools. Recycling schools also helps the environment by leaving space for trees.

In 2002, President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act. This education law provides states with government money so they can help improve their school systems.
The law is meant to ensure that schools are doing enough to help students who are struggling learners. Bush says that the law helps students perform better in reading and math. Under the law, schools are required to measure students' progress through testing. Schools in which many students don't perform well on the tests have two years to improve. Otherwise, students have the option to transfer to different schools.
Senator Kerry voted for the No Child Left Behind Act. If elected, he will continue to support this law. However, Kerry wants the government to give states more money to enforce the education law and make sure schools receive the money they need.
In addition, Kerry proposes to increase the number of high school graduates. To do that, he plans to reduce class sizes and break up large, failing high schools. He also wants to begin a program in which college students mentor (help) middle school students plan for their futures.

691,"Many kids think cell phones are cool. The portable phones come in fun colors and let you chat with friends anytime and anywhere. For many kids, owning the right cell phone is just as important as wearing the coolest sneakers or latest style of jeans.
Even though cell phones are a hot fad, some scientists are ringing an alarm about them. The scientists say that cell phones might pose a health threat.
In the United States, more than 90 million people use cell phones. Many of those people are kids. For kids, cell phones are about more than phone calls, says Anne Charlton of the University of Manchester in England. ""It's all about the cool factor,"" Charlton said. She added that a cell phone is not just about making calls, it's also a fashion statement.
Most cell phone users don't think about the health risks the phones might pose. Some scientists warn that cell phones give off radiation that might be harmful to users. One recent study shows that cell phone radiation might increase a person's chance of getting some kinds of cancer.
Other medical experts say cell phones don't pose a health threat. They point to studies that have not found any link between phone use and cancer.
Scientists say that people can protect themselves from cell phone radiation. One way is to use a headset instead of talking directly into a cell phone. Or, for an even simpler solution, people can make shorter calls.
When the first cell phones were sold, they all had the same ring. Today, most cell phones can be made to ring one of several different tones. But at least one cell phone manufacturer plans to change that.
Nokia plans to start making phones that play pop tunes when they ring. Users could choose tunes by the Spice Girls, Enrique Iglesias, Lenny Kravitz, and many other artists.
By choosing pop tunes instead of the standard ringing sound, cell phone users can program their phones to match their personalities and moods, explained a company spokesperson.

28,"A baby emperor penguin stays warm under its parent.
Temperatures are on the rise in Antartica. What does that mean for emperor penguins and other wildlife?
Emperor penguins and other Antarctic wildlife ""feel the heat"" as their icy home melts away.
In the hit documentary March of the Penguins,
emperor penguins make an amazing journey. They cross the vast continent of Antarctica, a frozen area that surrounds the South Pole. The penguins leave their ocean homes and cross the ice on a dangerous trip. They are blinded by blizzards and toppled over by strong winds. But each winter, they do this to lay their eggs and raise their chicks.
That cycle of life may be in trouble though. Scientists have discovered an alarming rise in temperatures around Antarctica. ""The region at the peninsula has warmed up about 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 40 to 50 years,"" Wayne Trivelpiece, a scientist who studies Antarctica, told Weekly Reader.
A recent study also shows that the ocean near the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed since the 1960s. A
is a stretch of land surrounded on three sides by water. A change in temperature could spell trouble for penguins, whales, seals, and other creatures at the South Pole.
Although researchers are certain about the increase in temperatures, they are still unsure about the cause. Many scientists blame
the gradual rise in Earths average temperature.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth. Temperatures there rarely reach above freezing. Although it is too cold for humans to permanently live there, many animals swim in the icy waters surrounding the continent. Penguins, for example, waddle across the ice and dive into the cold ocean waters in search of food. They eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called
In warmer water, however, krill have trouble surviving. ""Warming temperatures have led to a decline in sea ice,"" says Trivelpiece. ""Sea ice holds the food that krill need to survive. Without the ice, there is less food for krill and without the krill, the penguins are not surviving.""
These changes could upset the balance of the food chain and endanger larger animals and birds. A loss of penguins could leave leopard seals and whales hungry. (See
.) ""A very small change in temperature [can] completely change the whole food chain,"" says Trivelpiece.
Its not just emperor penguins and other creatures that may be in trouble. People who live thousands of miles away may be affected by melting ice.
As glaciers and sheets of ice melt, they add to the worlds sea level. When ice on land falls into the ocean and melts, it raises the water level. It is like dropping ice cubes into a glass of water. A 4-foot increase in global sea level would drown low-lying coastal areas.
The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air. Those gases collect in a layer and trap the heat from the sun. The process is called the
because the layer of gases is like the windows in a greenhouse. Too much of those gases in the air causes temperatures to rise. That is known as

Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are used to power cars, heat homes, and create electricity.(See
Some heat from greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is necessary. Without them, Earth would be too cold to support life. But burning fossil fuels can release too much carbon dioxide into the air, which can cause temperatures to rise.
Scientists are working to persuade governments to reduce their use of greenhouse gases. Experts say that if greenhouse gases continue to gather in the air, temperatures will likely be higher by 2100 than any time in human history. ""Our research teaches us a lesson that even a small change in the environment can have a big effect,"" says Trivelpiece.
What are some ways that people can reduce their use of fossil fuels?
is a system of animals and plants in an area that depend on one another for food. At the top of the Antarctic food chain are large animals, such as whales. They eat seals, which eat penguins. Penguins munch on tiny shrimplike animals called krill. Krill eat tiny ocean plants called phytoplankton. A loss of smaller animals in the food chain could leave larger animals hungry.

120,"There's good news for manatees. For some time, manatees have been in danger of dying out. Now some scientists in Florida say the number of manatees has increased and the sea mammals should no longer be considered endangered.
Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.
Is it important to save manatees and other endangered plants and animals? Discuss in class and let us know at

232,"The Liberty Bell no longer rings today. During the move, wireless technology will be attached to the bell.
The Liberty Bell is about to get a new home. This fall, it will move from its current location at Liberty Bell Pavilion in Philadelphia to a new building down the street.
Why the change of address? It is part of improvements being made to the area where the bell now hangs.
Moving the bell, which weighs 2,080 pounds, could be tricky. Movers want to make sure that no additional harm is done to the bell's famous crack.
During the move, scientists will attach wireless technology to the bell. That technology will sound an alarm if strain from the move causes the crack to enlarge. Earlier this year, scientists conducted a test using wireless technology, and the crack did not appear to change.
""The bell is fragile because of the way it was [made],"" said one historian. The bell was built mostly of copper.
In 1752, the bell was brought to Philadelphia from England. The bell was rung to mark special events. It became a symbol of freedom in the United States. It was rung to call people to the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence on July 8, 1776. That document was signed on July 4, 1776.
This is not the first time the Liberty Bell has moved. From 1885 to 1915, the Liberty Bell traveled across the country, taking part in several World's Fair exhibits. During those years, it visited more than 400 cities and towns, including New Orleans, St. Louis, and San Francisco.
The last time the Liberty Bell changed location was in 1976.
At that time, it was taken from Independence Hall to its current nearby home. Many people consider Independence Hall the birthplace of the United States. Both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were signed there.
The Liberty Bell cracked the first time it was rung in 1752. However, the bell was rebuilt twice in its early years. The Liberty Bell cracked again sometime between 1817 and 1846. How it cracked remains a mystery. According to one report, its famous split occurred in February 1846 while it was ringing to celebrate George Washington's birthday.

34,"Five California condors died last summer in Arizona's arid backcountry.
A condor's wingspan is 9.5 feet across. That's about as wide as two kids lying down head to toe.
Wildlife experts say the condors did not die from the heat. Instead, the experts believe the huge birds died from lead poisoning. They say the condors had swallowed lead shotgun pellets.
, which means they eat the remains of dead animals. The condors probably ate the remains of an animal that had been shot by a hunter. As they ate the dead animal's flesh, the birds ate the deadly pellets.
If swallowed, lead can make an animal sick or cause death. Lead stops the body from making red blood cells. It can also damage an animal's organs, including the brain and liver.
The five poisoned birds were among 35 condors that have been released in Arizona since 1996. The release program has cost millions of dollars.
After the dead condors were found, wildlife experts recaptured and tested the 16 birds left in the Arizona group. All the birds were healthy and were soon released.
Members of the Peregrine Fund have been releasing and watching the condors set free in Arizona. Jeff Cilek, of the Peregrine Fund, told
that saving California condors is important. ""Condors are good for the environment. They [eat] dead animals,"" Cilek said.
California condors are among the world's largest birds. A hundred years ago, the birds were found in many parts of the United States. Today, the condor is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's list of endangered species. That means the number of California condors is so low they all could disappear someday.
Why are scavengers an important part of the food chain?
Peregrine Fund officials say there are 150 California condors left on Earth. Forty-eight of those birds are living in the wild; the rest are in zoos.
Although the loss of five birds is a ""serious setback,"" Cilek said his group is looking to the future. Peregrine Fund officials recently announced plans to release 12 more California condors in Arizona this winter.

is a person who takes the law into his or her own hands. So if a bullied student feels a school isn't helping, that student may act out against others, he said.
Bullying may be one of the causes behind some of the recent shootings in U.S. schools, according to Stephens. Kids at Santana High School, in Santee, California, said bullying may have a part in a recent shooting there.
Santee student Charles ""Andy"" Williams, age 15, is accused of killing two boys and wounding 13 other people at Santana High School on March 5. According to schoolmates, in addition to having other personal problems, Williams had been bullied and teased.
School safety experts say everyone in a school, as well as parents, must work together to make sure no kids are disrespected or treated cruelly.
To stop bullying, some schools have organized
. A peer mediation group allows students who have problems getting along to work the problems out with the help of peers and teachers.
Other schools have sent students and teachers forms asking questions about such problems as bullying and teasing. The answers from the forms help school leaders and parents become more aware of kids' problems and figure out ways to solve them.
Finally, Stephens suggests that there are steps a student who is bullied can take. ""Make it clear that you don't like being bullied and then walk away and tell an adult,"" Stephens said.
Ronald Stephens, of the National Center for School Safety, gives these three tips to remember if you are ever bullied:
If a person is bullying you, tell the person in a firm, loud voice that you don't like what they are doing. Then...
Find an adult (teacher, parent, coach) and tell that adult what happened.

472,"Experts hope 2006 will be the year the world is polio-free.
Will polio be declared a disease of the past?
World health groups are fighting a war
with a crippling and sometimes deadly diseasepolio. Their efforts are paying off. Polio has been wiped out in 10 African countries, according to a recent report.
Since mid-2003, nearly 200 children in those 10 western and central African countries were
for life, but no new cases have been reported since last June. When people are paralyzed, they are unable to move different parts of their bodies and may be unable to walk.
The disease raced across Africa and into Asia after people in Nigeria refused the polio
mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think well get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told
She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria.""
Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly
disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havent been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims.
With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world. On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government approved the use of a vaccine that stopped people from getting the disease. Jonas Salk was the doctor who invented the first polio vaccine.
A boy in Africa receives an oral polio vaccine from a WHO (World Health Organization) worker.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world thanks to Salk, it still threatens children in Africa and Asia. Major efforts were recently under way to
or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been
Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door.
To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November.
After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Its uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives.""
Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization.
Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why?
Jonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.
From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Roosevelts death, Salks vaccine was declared officially safe.
In October 2005for the first time in 26 years in the United Statesfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnt at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.

About 40 years ago, the number of bald eagles in the United States was declining rapidly. Today, however, the bald eagle is returning to the skies. Wildlife officials hope to remove the bird from the list of threatened species by the end of the year.
In the early 1700s, bald eagles were a common sight. There were about half a million of those birds living in the United States.
Over time, their population fell dramatically. In the early 1960s, very few bald eagles remained.
What caused the number to drop? Hunting and the use of harmful chemicals sprayed on crops were largely to blame. Those chemicals poisoned the birds and their eggs.
Pollution also contributed to the problem. Bald eagles often became sick after eating fish from polluted waters.

Although some threats still exist, the future looks hopeful for bald eagles. Today, there are about 20,000 bald eagles living in the United States. Thanks to laws that helped protect bald eagles and banned harmful chemicals, the birds are making a comeback.
, or protection, efforts have helped their survival. ""There is no doubt that it is the single best conservation story the United States has had,"" bald eagle expert Bryan Watts told
In 1782, the bald eagle was made the national bird of the United States. The nation's founders chose the bird because it symbolized freedom, strength, and courage. At the time, some people disagreed about the choice for the national bird. Benjamin Franklin, for example, thought the turkey would make a better choice because it was ""a much more respectable bird.""

After studying a few other space objects, the spacecraft settled into orbit around Eros on February 14, 2000. During the following year, the craft took more than 160,000 photos of the potato-shaped asteroid.
completed its mission orbiting Eros, NASA scientists decided to try to land the car-sized spacecraft on the asteroid. If the craft succeeded,
would become the first craft to land on an asteroid. Scientists knew that the odds were against a safe landing, but they thought it was worth trying. ""Chances [were] less than 1 percent for [
] to land intact,"" said scientist Helen Worth.
NASA scientists on Earth guided the spacecraft toward the surface of Eros by remote control. Descending at 4 miles per hour, the spacecraft landed after bouncing once.
Thinking that the spacecraft had crashed, scientists were surprised to learn that it was sending information from the asteroid's surface. ""It's working, and we are getting good information,"" said NASA scientist Jacob Trombka shortly after the landing. As a result of the successful landing, NASA continued the mission for an additional ten days.
Scientists already know that most asteroids orbit the sun between Mars and Jupiter in an area called the

About 350 near-Earth asteroids have been found. Scientists carefully map the orbits of those asteroids. They say those asteroids will not hit Earth anytime soon. However, one might hit someday, scientists say.
There may be another 1,000 near-Earth asteroids scientists haven't discovered. Scientists worry that one of the unknown asteroids might threaten Earth. Scientists will use the information they gathered from Eros to protect Earth from asteroids that come too close to the third rock from the sun.
Eros is about twice the length of Manhattan, New York.
Eros orbits the sun once every 21 months.
Eros has so little gravity that a baseball hit on its surface would fly into space.
A person weighing 200 pounds on Earth would weigh 2 ounces on Eros.
The daytime temperature on Eros is about 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
The nighttime temperature on Eros is about -238 degrees Fahrenheit.

610,"History in the Making: Japan Invades Hong Kong
War broke out between China and Japan in 1937. An undeclared war was fought until 1941, when China, as well as the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, declared war on Japan, Germany, and Italy. In 1941, Japan invaded the British colony of Hong Kong, which is part of present-day China. Connie interviewed her grandfather, Locksley Siu, who was in Hong Kong during the Japanese invasion.
How old were you when World War II began?
World War II in Hong Kong was from 1941 to 1945. The Japanese army occupied the former British colony when I was 11 years old.
Where did you live, and did you have a car?
Altogether, eight people lived in [an] apartment of 500 square feet. Our apartment was in Wan Chai, on Hong Kong Island. Most people did not have cars. My dad had an old bicycle.
Did you still go to school during the Japanese occupation?
Yes, I continued to go to school for the first year. Later the school was closed because the school ran out of money. During the occupation, students were required to learn Japanese. Japanese teachers taught us Japanese.
Did you have enough food to eat every day?
No, we did not have enough food. We only ate vegetables, beans, and potatoes, but no rice at all. Meat was very costly and in short supply. When we were really hungry, we drank water. Sometimes we had to pick up grass and leaves from trees to eat.
How did the Japanese soldiers treat the Chinese people?
They were rude, and they hated Chinese people. We had to salute the Japanese soldiers when they passed by. Otherwise they would kick [us] in the back.
How was life affected by the occupation?
There was little freedom. The Japanese forbade people to go out after 11 at night. There was no traffic during the curfew. There was a lack of electricity for lighting; instead, we used candles. The only entertainment at night was the radio. The Japanese government took all Hong Kong dollars away. The Japanese government forced us to use Japanese yen. Roads such as Queen's Road and King's Road were changed to Japanese names.
Do you have any comments about the occupation?
More than 60 years after [the end of] World War II, there are still many people  who live in fear, hunger, and poverty because of wars. I hope that you will think more of those less fortunate.
I learned that there was little freedom under the occupation. I should be grateful that I live in a country where I am not forced to do things that I don't want to do. I'm going to do something for the less fortunate, just as my grandpa told me.

: You should let a cut breathe.
: Contrary to popular belief, cuts do not need to breathe. ""The open cut or scrape should be covered,"" said skin expert Dr. Amy Harned. According to Dr. Harned, it's important to wash the wound first. Then, apply an antibiotic ointment and cover the cut with a bandage. Leaving a cut uncovered can allow germs to infect it.
: Eating carrots will improve your eyesight.
: Carrots are rich in vitamin A, which helps keep your eyes healthy. According to eye expert Dr. Timothy Wingert, ""Eating carrots will not improve your eyesight. But eating carrots is part of a well-balanced diet. Carrots have nutrients that help your eyes to function properly."" Carrots also make a tasty snack.
: You can hurt your eyes by sitting too close to the TV.
: There is some truth to this advice. According to Dr. Wingert, sitting too close to the television for long periods of time makes eyes tired and can cause eyestrain. ""Generally, it is more comfortable on your eyes to view the television from at least 5 feet from the screen,"" he says. So, back up from that television or, better yet, turn it off!

During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote the poem that later became the national anthem.
On September 13, 1814, Key watched British ships bomb Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. The next morning, he spotted the American flag still flying over the fort. The sight inspired him to write the poem. In 1931, Congress made it the national anthem.
Here is the first verse of the four-verse song:

What so proudly we hailed at the twilights last
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through

456,"On New Year's Day 2001, Irene Alexander and 2,538 other people gathered at Mount Vernon, George Washington's home in Virginia. They came to honor the slaves who had worked there. On New Year's Day 200 years earlier, 123 of George Washington's slaves had been freed.
Washington's widow, Martha, freed her husband's slaves on January 1, 1801. Martha was carrying out the wishes of the country's first president, who had died on December 14, 1799. In his will he had requested that his slaves be freed after his wife's death.
During the ceremony, Alexander, a descendant of a slave who worked at Mount Vernon, told visitors, ""I hope you all feel, as I do, a sense of joy, a sense of sadness but also a sense of hope that the contributions of good people will always be remembered.""
Jennifer Saxon, a spokesperson for Mount Vernon, told
that Mount Vernon couldn't have prospered without slave labor. ""Slaves did most of the work,"" she said.
When Washington was born, many Americans owned slaves. Those people used slaves to plant crops and perform many other duties. Most people thought slavery was OK. When Washington was 11 years old, his father died and left him ten slaves.
During the American Revolution, which began in 1775, some people began to think that slavery was wrong and should be ended. Washington was one of those people. He vowed never to buy another slave.
In his will, Washington wrote that all his slaves should be freed. ""Upon the [death] of my wife,"" he wrote, ""it is my...desire that all the slaves which I hold in my own right shall receive their freedom.""
To make sure Washington's wishes were carried out, Martha freed his slaves in 1801, a year before she died. Martha, however, kept the slaves she owned when she freed her husband's slaves.
Even though Washington freed the slaves he owned, slavery remained legal in some states for another 64 years, until 1865. Slavery did not end in the United States until after the Civil War ended it.

That is exactly the point. ""The museum shows what happens to our trash, how we can reduce our trash, and what we can do instead of throwing our trash away,"" said museum director Sotoria Montanari.
Today, Americans create more garbage than ever before. In the early 1900s, most items were packed in containers that could be used again. Now, most of the food we buy, from cereal to milk, comes in boxes and cartons that can be thrown away.
So what happens to trash after it is tossed out? Some trash ends up in

(or resource-recovery) plants. At these plants, garbage is burned and converted into electricity that people use to power their lights, TVs, and video games.
Plastic bottles can be recycled at centers like this one.
Garbage is a form of solid waste. The Garbage Museum and its recycling plant, which are run by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, provide visitors with ideas to cut down on solid waste. One way is to

Making aluminum cans from recycled cans uses 95 percent less energy and protects Earth's natural resources. In fact, the energy saved each year from recycled cans could light Washington, D.C., for nearly four years!

Trucks drop off aluminum cans that are mixed with massive loads of plastic bottles and glass. The trash travels along conveyor belts to be sorted and separated.
Machines compress aluminum cans into giant bales.
The bales are sold to companies that turn the recycled cans into something usable. From recycled aluminum cans, more cans are made. When you buy recycled products, you ""close the loop.""
Each American throws away about 5 pounds of garbage each day. Earth Day, April 22, reminds people how important it is to reduce waste. Here are some ways:
Carry a lunch box instead of a paper lunch bag, and pack food in reusable containers.

Why has this Las Vegas district and many others eliminated, or

The students in Clark County have a 30-minute lunch period. They have to squeeze playground minutes into that half-hour block. They no longer get an additional 15- to 20-minute recess.
Many teachers, parents, and students disagree with the decision to ban recess. Education experts often say that recess is an important part of the school day.
Those experts say that the benefits of recess outweigh the lost class time. Recess gives students the opportunity to take a break, exercise, and socialize with their friends. At recess, many students learn how to cooperate and play with other students. In addition, some studies show a recess break can help improve test scores.

The toothbrush emerged as the number-one invention that Americans can't live without. Following closely in second place was the car.

The toothbrush has a long history, dating back to the 15th century. According to the American Dental Association, the first toothbrush was invented in 1498. To make the brush, a Chinese emperor placed hog bristles in a bone handle.
In 1938, nylon bristles replaced pig bristles. Dentists today are eager to remind people that while the toothbrush has taken the throne as king of the invention list, it still needs its handy sidekick-dental floss.

People in several U.S. cities are being treated to herds of cow sculptures. The sculptures are part of Cows on Parade.
Cows on Parade started in Switzerland in 1998. A U.S. businessman saw the cows and brought the idea to the United States in 1999. This year, about 1,000 cows are on display in several U.S. cities.
Each cow is made of fiberglass and was decorated by a local artist, including some kids. The cows will be left on display until October.

317,"Do you get good grades? Do you talk to your parents about what's happening at school and about things you and your friends are doing after school?
A recent study shows that how kids answer those questions tells a lot about whether they are headed for trouble. The study says kids who spend their free time aimlessly often get into trouble.
The study, called the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, was funded by the federal government. More than 90,000 kids between the ages of 12 and 18 took part in the study. Those kids attended 134 different U.S. schools. The study followed them from 1994 to 2000.
About half of the kids in the study said they were not involved in dangerous activities. But 25 percent said they had tried a cigarette, 26 percent said they had picked up a gun, and 47 percent said they had tried alcohol.
The study found that kids who spend their free time hanging out with nothing to do, who get poor grades, or who don't talk with their parents are eight times more likely to take part in unhealthful activities later on, such as smoking cigarettes or trying drugs.
Kids who hang out with friends who drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or have tried drugs are likely to do what their friends are doing, said Robert Blum. Blum is one of the doctors who conducted the study. In other words, kids tend to act like their friends, Blum said.
""How young people do at school and what they do with their free time are the most important [ways of predicting] risky behavior,"" said Blum.
Kids should get involved in interesting activities, Blum advised. Instead of hanging out with kids who are already trying what the study calls ""high-risk activities,"" Blum said that kids should play sports, read, talk with parents, or do homework.
The National Longitudinal Study finds that kids who are involved in activities usually don't get into trouble. Here's a story written by a
kid reporter about a few kids who know how to spend their time:
There are a lot of good kids. I know three of them who live in my hometown, Lockport, Illinois.
Amanda Clemmons and Heather Grein are best friends. Recently, they celebrated their birthdays together.
The two girls invited about 60 kids to a birthday party. The girls, however, asked their friends to bring pet supplies instead of presents. Their guests brought leashes, paper towels, pet food, treats, kitty litter, and toys to the party. Amanda and Heather then donated the pet supplies to the TLC Animal Shelter in Homer Township.

409,"More bears are alive and well, but are they ready to come off the endangered species list?
The bears are back after being on the brink of extinction in and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is located in the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana.
Now the U.S. government may remove the grizzly from its list of endangered species in this area. ""The future of the Yellowstone grizzly bears is bright,"" says Chris Servheen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
That wasnt always the case. The numbers of grizzlies began to shrink in the early 1900s largely because ranchers hunted the animals and farmers destroyed their
By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears still lived in the Yellowstone area. That year, the grizzly was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which offers special protection to animals facing extinction. Today, wildlife experts estimate that more than 600 bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone.
Grizzly bears live in other parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as well as Washington state and will remain on the list in those areas. Grizzlies in Alaska, which number about 30,000, have never been on the list because that population is healthy.
Its Not Time Yet Not everyone thinks its a good decision to remove grizzlies from the list. Some wildlife officials fear that if the bear is removed from the list, its habitat around Yellowstone could be used for logging, oil drilling, and development. Others worry that the bears will be hunted again. ""We would love to see the grizzly bear delisted, but its not ready,"" says wildlife supporter Louisa Wilcox. ""If you want to protect bears for future generations, you have to protect the habitat they need. This plan doesnt do it.""
Should grizzlies no longer be listed as an endangered species? Why or why not?
The grizzlys return isnt the only species success story. Take a look at some other animals that are being saved, thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists.
In 1963, only 417 pairs of bald eagles nested in the United States. There are now more than 6,400 pairs, and the national symbol may soon be removed from the list of endangered species.
Hawaiians used to hunt this reptile for dinner. Now they swim alongside the turtles near some islands. The number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400 a year. There were only 67 in 1973.
Pollution and habitat loss have made it hard for sea otters to stay afloat. In 1938, there were only several hundred otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500.

is anything that you see in the sky and cannot identify. Usually, even the most mysterious UFOs are eventually explained.
Experts say the UFO seen in October was most likely a meteor, or space rock streaking through Earth's atmosphere. Other UFO sightings, however, remain a mystery.
For years, the U.S government has been studying UFO sightings. Much of the information that the government has gathered on UFOs is top-secret.
Now a new group wants the government to tell everyone what it knows about UFOs. The group is called the Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFI).
""It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the real nature of this phenomenon,"" said John Podesta. Podesta is a former White House official and a CFI member.
The members of CFI asked the government to release information about specific UFO sightings. One such sighting happened in December 1965.
On that cold night, people in western Pennsylvania saw a bright light streak through the sky. The light looked liked it crashed behind some hills.
The mysterious object might have been a rock from space. A space rock that crashes into Earth is called a meteorite. However, several witnesses claimed that soldiers searched the area where the object ""crashed."" They say the soldiers loaded a car-sized object onto a truck, placed a tarp over the object, and drove it away-never to be seen again.
The members of CFI claim that the U.S. government has never released information about the sighting and the object. ""We can't come up with a reason why this information is being withheld. The government won't even acknowledge that the incident took place, but we know that it did,"" said one CFI member.
For now, the exact nature of some UFOs remains a mystery. CFI members hope that the answer lies in secret government papers. They say they are only searching for the truth and they want everyone to know the truth.

Volcanoes can remain quiet for years and then erupt violently, sometimes without warning. Using the latest technology, scientists hope to better
Mount St. Helens is located in Washington.
Scientists say Mount St. Helens is one of the most closely monitored volcanoes and the most active volcano in the lower 48 states. Mount St. Helens is also among 13 active volcanoes that are located in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. That range is home to several powerful volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier and Mount Hood.
Although scientists say a large eruption at Mount St. Helens is unlikely, they are cautious because of the volcano's history. Officials have sealed off a 5-mile area around the volcano.
Mount St. Helens erupted with tremendous force in May 1980, blowing more than 1,300 feet off its top and killing 57 people. The blast destroyed thousands of acres of forest and scattered ash for thousands of miles. Mount St. Helens continued to rumble until 1986 but has been quiet since that time.
How can scientists tell when a volcano will awaken from its slumber? ""We measure earthquake activity, changes in the mountain, and volcanic gases,"" said Driedger.
Although scientists can't tell exactly when or with what force a volcano will blow its top, they rely on advanced equipment to help them predict eruptions. Special devices called
are installed around volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens to detect earthquakes. Earthquakes always strike before a volcano erupts.
Volcanoes are mountains where hot, liquid rock called magma deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure can cause magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the crater at the top of the volcano and vents, or cracks, along its side. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called lava. Once lava cools, it hardens into rock.
Scientists use special global positioning instruments to measure movements on the slopes of the mountain--a clue to the buildup of
. Magma is red-hot molten rock located inside the volcano. It is called
when it pours out of the volcano.
As magma rises, volcanoes release carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Sensors on helicopters test the air for gases that signal rising magma. ""The gases are like telegrams that tell us what's going on inside the volcano,"" said Driedger.
More than 500 million people around the world live near active volcanoes. Monitoring volcanoes is a dangerous job, but scientists take precautions to stay safe.
""By watching volcanoes, we learn how they work,"" said Driedger. ""The more we know, the better prepared we can be to save property and lives.""
Besides volcanoes, what natural disasters are hard for scientists to predict? Why?

Wind gusts that raged across the Midwest reached 90 miles per hour in five states, according to the National Weather Services Storm Prediction Center. One gust clocked in at 107 miles per hour in Kansas.
Tornadoes can strike in any month in any part of the world. In the United States, peak activity for tornado season is from April through July.
scientists who study weathersay the series of 113 damaging storms that tore through the Midwest will beat the recent record for the number of tornadoes on a single day in March. The previous record was 69 on March 13, 1990. ""For this early in the year, its a heck of a deal,"" says weather expert Joe Schaefer. ""What happens after that is anybodys guess.""
After the thunderstorms caused the series of deadly twisters, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for Michigan and Indiana. If a

for an area, a tornado has been spotted. In the case of a tornado warning, people should seek safe shelter immediately.
The National Weather Service also employs storm spotters to help predict where and when a tornado will strike. The trained volunteers are positioned before a storm hits to report what they see developing in the sky. Their reports confirm what weather forecasters see on their radar screens.
For many, there is no escaping the tornadoes wrath. ""It was over before you knew it,"" Greg Kospar of Bentonville, Arkansas, told reporters after the storm. ""The house is gone.""
The strength of a tornado and its potential to cause damage are rated using the Fujita scale, with 0 being the weakest and 5 being the strongest. A new tornado rating system is scheduled to go into effect early next year.

Fourth grader Annie Inglese knows how important it is to get the right amount of sleep each night. ""If I don't get enough sleep,"" she says, ""I have trouble getting up in the morning.""
Sleep experts say that kids who do not get a good night's sleep on a regular basis put their safety at risk. Delaying bedtime for other activities can lead to accidents, such as falling off a bike or getting hurt on the playground.
In addition to preventing injuries, children who get enough sleep on a regular basis tend to get better grades and be in a better mood. ""Sleep is just as important as nutrition and exercise in our overall health,"" says Dr. Carl Hunt, a sleep expert with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Estimates show about 1 out of every 4 adults does not get enough sleep. Sleep experts think that number may be just as high for kids. According to the NIH, children ages 7 to 11 need at least nine hours of sleep each night.
Most kids and families today have busy schedules that can keep them from getting enough sleep. Plus, watching television, chatting on the Internet, and playing video games all compete with valuable sleep time.
Going to bed at the same time each night will help you get a good night's sleep. If you have trouble falling asleep, Dr. Hunt advises you to unwind with quiet time. Reading or listening to soothing music can help bring on sleep.

The four Harry Potter books, by J.K. Rowling, are popular all over the world. More than 35 million copies have been sold. They have also been translated into 30 languages.
Although many kids say they love reading about Harry, some critics say the books aren't good for kids.
Many teachers say that their students don't read enough. So teachers are thrilled that many kids spend their free time reading Harry Potter books. Educators say reading helps kids do better in school. ""I know my kids aren't missing out on their reading,"" said Gillian Williams, an elementary school principal in New York City.

605,"Soaring high above California's coastline stand the magnificent redwood trees. Redwoods are the world's tallest known trees and are also some of the oldest. Some scientists are concerned about a disease that is threatening the ancient giants. It is called sudden oak death.
The disease has scientists alarmed. First identified in 1995, sudden oak death has spread along hundreds of miles of California's coastline and jumped into southern Oregon. In addition to attacking oak trees, it has spread to redwoods, Douglas firs, and other types of trees and shrubs. One of the worst outbreaks of the disease has occurred at California's Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park.
Scientists recently discovered the organism responsible for the disease. It is a fungus that causes oozing red blobs to grow on diseased oak trees. On younger redwoods, it dries up leaves and kills sprouts. According to scientists, redwoods are hosts for the disease. A host is an organism on or in which another organism lives.
The disease first showed up in rhododendron plants in the Netherlands in 1993. Scientists are concerned because the spread of the disease could pose a threat to the redwoods' ecosystem, an environment where plants and animals coexist. Scientist David Rizzo said that anytime you have a strange organism, there is cause for concern.
Coastal redwoods can grow upwards of 360 feet. Some are taller than the Statue of Liberty, which stands about 300 feet.
The diameter of redwoods can measure about 20 feet.
Named California's state tree, the redwood can live more than 2,000 years.
In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Muir Woods a national monument dedicated to protecting and preserving the mighty redwoods.
In 1904, a fungus from Asia began killing chestnut trees in New York. Over the next 50 years, the disease killed about 3.5 billion trees and almost wiped out an entire species. Scientists want to prevent this from happening in California or elsewhere in the United States.
Studies show this disease spreads rapidly during the wet months of spring. The coming months could be vital in tracking the disease. Current weather forecasts predict that this spring will be rainier than the last two springs. ""We have to get familiar with the symptoms and the treatments,"" said another scientist, ""because we don't know how much farther it will spread.""

273,"Huskies along the trail during start day, March 1998.
And they're off! Teams of specially trained dogs are racing to the finish line across one of the toughest terrains in the world.
Along a jagged trail of snow and ice, the teams battle Alaska's below-zero temperatures. They are competing in the Iditarod (igh-DIT-ah-rod) Trail Sled Dog Race, which kicked off on March 6.
The Iditarod is the longest sled dog race in the world. This year, about 90 sled dog teams are running the roughly 1,110-mile route.
The race, now in its 32nd year, starts in the city of Anchorage and ends in the city of Nome. The stretch of land the teams must cross is almost equal to the distance from New York City to Miami.
A team of 12 to 16 dogs tow each sled. It can take more than two weeks for teams to complete the race. In 2002, a record holder completed the race in 8 days, 22 hours, 46 minutes, and 2 seconds.
guide and care for the dogs. Mushers must stop at all 26 checkpoints along the trail. There, animal doctors, called
, check the health of each dog.
During their journey, mushers set up camp to make sure the dogs get enough food, water, and rest. The mushers and dogs are required to stop for at least one 24-hour period and two 8-hour periods.
Not surprisingly, dog mushing is Alaska's state sport. Before mushing became a popular sport, dog teams served as an important form of transportation.
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, miners discovered gold in Alaska. Thousands of people traveled there for the gold rush.
During that time, sled dogs helped people get from place to place and transported gold, mail, and supplies. ""Dog teams were important to settling Alaska during this time,"" race director Joanne Potts told
In 1925, sled dogs in Anchorage delivered lifesaving medicine to sick children in Nome. The Iditarod teams follow the same route. The race

Experiencing this year's race up close is fourth-grade teacher Jeff Peterson, from Minnesota. Peterson, who was selected as the 2004 Teacher on the Trail, is reporting on the race.
that the race is as much about the people, culture, and landscape of Alaska as it is about the dogs. ""I've been interested in the Iditarod since I was a kid,"" he said. ""To experience this race firsthand is like a dream come true.""
In January 1959, Alaska became the 49th state. More than twice the size of Texas, Alaska is the largest state.
Alaska's nickname is ""The Last Frontier"" because much of the land is wilderness that remains unsettled.
Mount McKinley, in Alaska, is the tallest mountain in North America.
In 1867, the United States bought Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million, or about 2 cents per acre.
Contrary to popular belief, Alaska is not one giant icebox! In some parts of the state, summer temperatures can reach into the 80s.

Decimals - Place value and ordering decimals
We use a decimal point to separate units from parts of a whole (like tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc).
0.1 is a tenth, 1/10 of a unit
0.01 is a hundredth, 1/100 of a unit
0.001 is a thousandth. 1/1000 of a unit
In 52.13, the value of the figure 1 is 1/10 , and the value of the figure 3 is 3/100.
When ordering numbers, always compare the left digits first.
Eg Which is greater, 2.301 or 2.32?
Both numbers have two units and three tenths, but 2.301 has no hundredths, whereas 2.32 has two hundredths. Therefore, 2.32 is greater than 2.301.
Another way to look at it is to add a zero to the end of 2.32 (this doesn't change its value as it's after the decimal point).
The two numbers are now 2.320 and 2.301 and it is quite easy to see that 2.320 is bigger (just as 2 320 is bigger than 2 301).
Q1. In the number 3.546, what is the value of the figure 4?
Q2. Place the following numbers in order, smallest first: 3.2, 3.197, 3.02, 3.19
A1. The value of the figure 4 is 4/100.
A2. Did you get 3.02, 3.19, 3.197, 3.2?
All the numbers have three units, so start by comparing the tenths. 3.02 has no tenths, 3.197 and 3.19 have one tenth, and 3.2 has two tenths. Therefore, 3.02 is the smallest and 3.2 is the largest.
You could also write the numbers as 3.020, 3.190, 3.197 and 3.200 and compare them.

Diet, drugs and health - Digestion and enzymes
Our teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. Enzymes are needed so that this break-down happens quickly enough to be useful.
Take care - enzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients:
. Carbohydrase enzymes break down starch into sugars.
The saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough, the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet.
. Protease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. Digestion of proteins in the stomach is helped by
, which is strong hydrochloric acid. This also kills harmful micro-organisms that may be in the food.
Lipase enzymes break down fat into fatty acids and glycerol. Digestion of fat in the

The rock cycle - Erosion and transport
Weathering and erosion are often confused, so be careful when answering questions about them.
is the movement of the broken pieces away from the site of weathering.
For example, a basalt cliff may be weathered by freeze-thaw, a type of physical weathering. This means that pieces of the cliff may break away.
Erosion happens when these pieces of rock fall away down the cliff.
In the photograph you can see a basalt cliff. At the bottom there are heaps of rocks, caused by weathering then erosion.
Rivers and streams can move pieces of rock. This is called
. Fast flowing rivers can transport large rocks, but slow moving rivers can only transport tiny pieces of rock.
As the pieces of rock are carried along by the water, they bash against each other and the river bed. They gradually wear away because of this. They become smaller and more rounded.

473,"Writing the speech is only half the task - the next part is presenting it.
The idea of presenting a speech might make you nervous but some people make speeches every day as part of their jobs. Think about your teachers - they regularly stand up before you and present to the class.
You might notice that some teachers are more interesting to listen to than others. It is not necessarily what they say that keeps you interested, but often how they say it. What do your teachers do to keep your attention? Make a list then compare it with the tips below.
Your listeners will switch off if they can't hear you. Use a loud and clear voice, and if you're unsure if your audience can hear you at the back - just ask ""Can you hear me at the back?""
If you speak too quickly, you won't be clear. If you speak too slowly, your audience is likely to go to sleep. Vary your pace for effect and use dramatic pauses where appropriate.
If you speak like a robot, in the same boring tone, your audience will quickly drift off. Speak naturally and use the pitch of your voice to show your emotions.
You don't have to gurn at your audience! But if you don't look like you're interested in what you have to say, your audience won't be either.
Again, keep it natural, but if you stand like a statue, you won't be very interesting to watch or listen to. On the other hand, too much arm flapping and leg hopping will distract your audience from the point you're trying to make.
Use them, but use them effectively. They need to be big enough to see, interesting to look at and relevant to what you are talking about. Don't be tempted to make a big poster to hide behind!
Choose words that are interesting, descriptive and appropriate to your audience. Don't baffle your audience with jargon or slang or lots of big words that are too difficult for anyone else to understand.
If it's appropriate to your audience and task, try to use Standard English. You don't have to be too formal or put on a silly accent, just speak in a way that is easy for everyone to understand.
Most people feel nervous about speaking formally in front of other people. Here are some tips to help you conquer your nerves:
Write your speech out in full and read it several times - this will help you gain confidence in the content.
Prepare small cards with key points of your speech. By now you should be familiar with your speech so these points will help you keep to your structure. Avoid the temptation to read your speech in full - the idea is to test your speaking skills, not your reading skills!
Practice your performance before the real thing. Try practicing at home on your own, and then in front of family or friends. If you have visual aids, be sure to practice using them.
On the day, take a deep breath, smile and try to enjoy it.
Improve your public speaking and maybe you'll be TV Presenter one day. But it's not all bad!
Talk your way out of trouble using your English skills.

Prospero has Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian in his power. He has them imprisoned, with other survivors (except Trinculo and Stephano who are still with Caliban) in a trance, by his cave.
He tells Ariel to fetch them to him. He says that although it would be understandable if he took revenge on them, he would forgive them if they were sorry for what they had done to him.
He also tells Ariel that he will soon be free, and tells him he will miss him.
Ariel leaves to fetch the group. Prospero, alone, declares that he will give up his magic, break his magic staff and throw his magic books into the sea as soon as this business is over.
When Ariel brings the men back, Prospero places them in a magic circle. After telling them off for the wrong things they have done, he releases them from his spell, so they can now wake up. In order that they will recognise him as they awaken, Prospero sends Ariel to fetch his Duke's clothing and sword.
The men slowly start to come to their senses. They recognise Prospero, but are amazed to see him in such a strange place.
Alonso is very ashamed of what he has done.

One way of finding out whether you have been over-charged is to estimate what the total amount should be. Round the different prices into easier numbers - 9.99 is approximately 10, 1.49 is approximately 1.50 and 8.99 is approximately 9 - and you can do the calculation quickly in your head.
10 + 1.50 + 9 = 20.50
This is almost 3 less than the cashier asked for, so obviously you have been over-charged.

a) Shout the loudest to make sure that everyone hears what you have to say.
b) Seize the opportunity for a nap - no one will notice as they're all too busy arguing.

a) Point at her and burst out laughing.
b) Feel glad that everyone is staring at her and not you.
c) Help her by asking her a question about what she's already said.
3. You've prepared an individual talk on your hobby for homework. Someone else in the class has just given their talk on exactly the same subject. Do you:
a) Just read out what you had written in your notes. You weren't listening to the person who was just speaking, anyway.
b) Screw up your notes and lock yourself in the toilet until the bell rings.
c) Refer back to some of the things the other student said as you go along.
4. Your teacher puts you into pairs and asks you to improvise a missing scene from the play you've been reading. Do you:
a) Say as much as you can to fill the two minute slot you've been given. It doesn't matter if it's irrelevant and it doesn't matter if your partner doesn't get a chance to speak.
b) Allow your partner to do all the talking and keep your reactions to a minimum.
c) Swallow your sense of panic, listen carefully to what your partner says and try and react accordingly, taking turns so that the improvisation makes sense and is balanced.

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to argue
The key thing about writing an argument is that you present both sides and come to a clear conclusion. It's not like arguing with one of your friends, when you just say what you think. Instead, when you write an argument you have to show you are reasonable and can consider the different sides.
The following article has appeared in your local paper:
Ashfield Park is threatened with closure next month as a local business has applied for planning permission to turn the area into a car park. Local residents have begun a fierce campaign to save the park, which is a popular walking spot for young children and the elderly, as well as home to the War Memorial and many wildlife species.
Write to your local paper, arguing that the park should be preserved.
It would not be enough to write that you want the park to be saved - it might be how you feel, but it wouldn't be an argument..
It wouldn't even be enough if you wrote about all the good things in the park. That would be
as you haven't thought about any other views.
A good argument presents both the good and bad aspects of keeping the park. For instance, the park might protect nature, but cost a lot to keep clean. It might be a good place to walk, but few people actually go there. An argument depends on bringing these ideas together. Use connectives, like ""because"" or ""however"" or ""although"". These words give your argument a logical structure and help make the contrasts clear.
Once you have worked through these ideas, you come to your conclusion - saying whether they should keep the park or not.

In a television series, you get several episodes, one after the other. A series circuit is similar. You get several components one after the other.
If you follow the circuit diagram from one side of the cell to the other, you should pass through all the different components, one after the other, without any branches.
If you put more lamps into a series circuit, the lamps will be dimmer than before.
In a series circuit, if a lamp breaks or a component is disconnected, the circuit is broken and all the components stop working.
Series circuits are useful if you want a warning that one of the components in the circuit has failed. They also use less wiring than parallel circuits.
In parallel circuits different components are connected on different branches of the wire. If you follow the circuit diagram from one side of the cell to the other, you can only pass through all the different components if you follow all the
In a parallel circuit, if a lamp breaks or a component is disconnected from one parallel wire, the components on different branches

Red Mount Chapel is on a mound on ""The Walks"" in the park.
Red Mount Chapel is a superb example of the Gothic style in architecture and even boasts its own musical ghost!
Built in 1485 at the time of Henry VII, the first Tudor king, it was a stopping-off place for pilgrims on their way to Walsingham via the port of King's Lynn. Octagonal in shape, it is very small, and had three floors. The top floor is a chapel with fan tracery much like that in Cambridge's King's College.
Underneath the chapel building there is reputed to be a long tunnel (not unusual), running to Castle Rising - a distance of 18km/12 miles (very unusual). An unfortunate, drunken fiddler once decided to explore the dark passageway with his instrument, his dog and his pint! He never reached the end of the tunnel, wherever it went, but his spirit remains and can be heard on occasions playing his tunes and singing, accompanied by the whining of his poor dog!
writing of the heading and unusual font catches our attention.
writing is used for the subheadings, which list the location details.
These details are separated from the rest of the text so they are easy to follow.
The most interesting fact, about the haunting, is mentioned first, and kept in a short paragraph of its own.
An image of the haunted tunnel is used to draw the reader's attention.

Before we look at food chains we will go over the way green plants capture energy from the Sun to make food. This is the start of all the food chains we will look at.
Animals eat food to get their energy. But green plants don't. Instead they make their own food, glucose, in a process called photosynthesis. We say that plants can photosynthesise.
These are the things that plants need for photosynthesis:
These are the things that plants make by photosynthesis:
We can show photosynthesis in a word equation, where light energy is shown in brackets because it is not a substance:
carbon dioxide + water (+ light energy)
Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves, and water from the ground through their roots. Light energy comes from the sun.
The oxygen produced is released into the air from the leaves. The glucose produced can be turned into other substances, such as starch, which is used as a store of energy. This energy can be released by
Photosynthesis takes place inside plant cells in small things called
. Chloroplasts contain a green substance called chlorophyll. This absorbs the light energy needed to make photosynthesis happen. Plants can only photosynthesise in the light.

You need to find 20% of 60.
1% of 60 is 60  100 = 0.6
So 20% of 60 is 0.6  20 = 12
Find x% of a quantity by multiplying that quantity by x/100

Presentations are sometimes less formal than speeches, and you'll probably be asked to present in groups rather than on your own. Use the tips on the previous page to make your performance strong.
Here are some extra tips for group presentations:
Organise the presentation fairly between each group member - ensure that everyone gets their chance to present. If you're shy, don't hide behind your group - you need to take part too!
A group presention needs to come across as a team effort - be careful not to allow over enthusiastic members to dominate.
Work together - if one person is speaking, another person can point to relevant visual aids.
You may be asked to find a poem or an extract from a story to read aloud to your class. Here are some tips to help you with reading aloud:
If you can choose a text you are familiar with this will probably boost your confidence.
Practise your reading using gestures and movement, and don't be tempted to hide behind your book.
Try to look up from your reading several times and make eye contact with your audience.
Vary your pitch and tone and make it relevant to your subject matter. If you're reading something spooky, try to reflect this in your voice. If you're reading a conversation between two characters, attempt to distinguish their voices.

Notice that the total amount of energy transferred to the surroundings is the same as the amount of electrical energy. We say that the energy has been conserved. Energy is always conserved, it is never ""lost"" or ""wasted"", although some energy transfers are useful and some are not.

Food chains - Getting carbon dioxide, light and water
Remember that the equation for photosynthesis is:
carbon dioxide + water (+ light energy)
Let's see how plants get the carbon dioxide and water they need for this process.
Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves. The carbon dioxide
through small holes in the underside of the leaf called stomata. (One of these holes is called a stoma. The plural is stomata.)
The lower part of the leaf has loose-fitting cells, to allow carbon dioxide to reach the other cells in the leaf. This also allow the oxygen produced in photosynthesis to leave the leaf easily.
A leaf usually has a large surface area, so that it can absorb a lot of light. Its top surface is protected from water loss, disease and weather damage by a waxy layer.
The upper part of the leaf is where the light falls, and it contains a type of cell called a
. This is adapted to absorb a lot of light. It has lots of chloroplasts and is shaped like a tall box.
Turgid plant that's watered regularly and a flacid plant without enough water.
Plants get the water they need for photosynthesis through their roots.
The roots have a type of cell called a root hair cell - these project out from the root into the soil. Roots have a big surface area and thin walls, which allow water to pass into them easily.
Note that root cells do not contain chloroplasts, as they are normally in the dark and cannot photosynthesise.
The water absorbed by the root hair cells passes through the plant in
tubes, and eventually reachers the leaves. If a plant does not absorb enough water, it will wilt or go floppy. Without water it may also not photosynthesise quickly enough, and it may die.

The extract below is from a leaflet about passive smoking.
. Passive smoking is breathing in other people's tobacco smoke. Other people's tobacco smoke is sometimes called environmental tobacco smoke.
. Only 15% of the smoke from a cigarette is inhaled by the smoker - the rest goes into the surrounding air and other people can breathe it in. Breathing air which contains tobacco smoke can be bad for your health. This is because the tiny particles and gases in tobacco smoke contain over 4000 chemicals, many of which are harmful - at least 60 are known to cause cancer. The gases also contain carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas that comes out of car exhausts.
Q. What is the effect on my health?
. Breathing other people's smoke is uncomfortable and can cause:
nose, throat and chest irritation and breathing difficulties
From a Health Development Agency Passive Smoking Information Leaflet
The following questions will draw on all the skills you have revised so far. Note down your answers then compare them with ours.
Q1. What, according to the leaflet, is ""passive smoking""?
Q2. How much of the smoke from one cigarette is inhaled by the smoker?
Q3. Name one effect that passive smoking can have on our health, according to the extract.
Q4. Who do you think is the target audience for the leaflet?
Q5. Give one reason why you think this.
Q6. Look at the second answer that the writer has given in the leaflet: the one beginning ""Only 15% of the smoke..."". Explain two ways in which the writer has used language to persuade the reader that passive smoking is dangerous.
Q7. Why has the writer phrased each heading as a question?
Q8. Explain two ways in which the writer has used layout to make the text more effective.
A1. Passive smoking is 'breathing in other people's tobacco smoke'.
A2. 15% is inhaled by the smoker.
A3. Coughing. (You could name any of the effects listed in the bullet points.)
A4. The target audience could be teenagers, or a broad audience. It is the reason that you give in the next answer that is more important.
A5. Reasons are: the language used is quite simple; sentences are mainly quite short and simple, many only contain one or two ideas; the information is broken up into short sections; the headings make the information easy to follow. All these would make the text accessible for many readers, including young people.
A6. There are three main ways: the simple statement that it is 'bad for your health'; the fact that tobacco smoke contains 'over 4000 chemicals', many of which are harmful; the mention of carbon monoxide which is 'poisonous'.
A7. The headings are phrased as questions to draw the reader into the text.
A8. Layout has been used in several different ways: the 'Q' and 'A' format is eyecatching; the short paragraphs are easy to follow; the bullet points at the end of the extract make the facts easy to read.

- it's suggested, but not openly stated. Implicit meaning can be harder to figure out than explicit meaning. Writers like to be clever and draw you into their text. It's up to you to make your mind up about a setting, in just the same way that it's up to you what to make of a new place you visit. Writers often use language in clever ways to build up a sense of atmosphere and setting.
Take a look at the following extract from Robert Westall's novel, 'Urn Burial'. Ralph has been captured by an alien race...
This was the worst nightmare yet. He was standing with his back pressed against a smooth wall cold as ice. The cold nibbled at his buttocks and legs; it ran up and down the knobbles of his spine, making him shiver; it invaded his lungs so he could hardly breathe; he felt he had been shivering a long time.
In the extract, the writer intends to create a very creepy, sinister atmosphere. The way that he describes Ralph's imprisonment makes it sound very unpleasant. He is ""pressed"" against a wall that is ""cold as ice"" and the cold is creeping into every part of his body, making him shiver. Ralph also feels as if he can ""hardly breathe"" because of the cold.
. The simile; ""a smooth wall cold as ice"", helps the reader relate to Ralph as they will know what ice feels like. The writer also uses personification; the cold ""nibbled"" at Ralph, it ""ran up and down"" his back and ""invaded"" his lungs. This makes the cold sound as if it were alive, running over and into Ralph, trying to eat away at him. This adds to the feeling that he has been overpowered and is in danger.

Romeo and his friends have left the Capulets' party. Romeo has run away from his friends. Mercutio has been shouting rude jokes because he thinks that Romeo has gone off with Rosaline. Mercutio and Benvolio finally give up looking for him and go home.
The second set extract begins with Romeo hiding from Mercutio and Benvolio in Juliet's garden. Romeo thinks to himself that Mercutio can never understand how he feels because he has never been in love.
""He jests at scars that never felt a wound""
He watches Juliet as she stands on her balcony thinking out loud. He thinks that she is like the sun
Romeo uses lots of words and images that relate to light when he describes Juliet.: 'sun', 'stars' 'brightness'.
and that the moon is jealous of her because she is so beautiful. He says that her eyes are like two stars that are so bright that they would stop night-time from being dark if they were in heaven, and the birds would sing because they would think that night was day.
Romeo uses more words and images to do with light to describe Juliet.
He idolises her and compares her to an angel.
When Romeo says that Juliet is like an angel from heaven, on the one hand, he is saying how lovely she is. On the other hand, you could say that he doesn't really see her as a flesh and blood person. He idolises her. Do you believe that he can really love her when he doesn't actually know anything about her? Or do you believe in love at first sight?
Juliet, not realising that Romeo is hiding in her garden, imagines what she would say to Romeo if he were there. She says out loud that she wishes he wasn't a Montague, but says that it doesn't really matter because she loves him anyway, and hopes that he loves her. After all, a name is just a word; it doesn't really mean that much.
If we used another word for a rose instead of the word 'rose', eg 'poo', the rose would still be a rose, it wouldn't smell like poo just because we used that word. In the same way, Romeo is still lovely even though his name is Montague.
When Juliet is thinking these things aloud on her balcony, she doesn't know that anyone else is watching. Have you ever practiced saying something to someone, even though you know that you would never be brave enough to say it?
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet
When Romeo replies, Juliet nearly jumps out of her skin.
""My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself""
When Romeo calls her 'dear saint', Juliet realizes who he is. Romeo called her 'dear saint' at the party.
Juliet is very worried for Romeo's safety; he is a Montague on Capulet property. Romeo uses very poetic and exaggerated language to describe how he managed to climb over the walls.
Romeo has been quite brave and perhaps foolish to break into Juliet's garden. He likes to takes risks and doesn't think clearly about the seriousness of his actions. He uses poetic language to exaggerate his bravery.
He declares that he'd rather die than live never having the opportunity to love Juliet.
Juliet admits that she is embarrassed that Romeo heard the things that she was saying about him. She asks him if he loves her too, but she doesn't give him the chance to answer.
Juliet is worried that she has shown herself to be too keen on Romeo. In Shakespeare's day, nice girls weren't supposed to show that they were interested in boys.
Juliet's speech is very long! Is she nervous or embarrassed? Is she a chatterbox? Is she so excited about her new love that she can't stop talking about it?
Romeo begins to use poetic language about the moon to describe how much he loves her, but Juliet won't let him finish.
Time - Juliet won't let Romeo finish his sentences! Poor Romeo! We already know how much he loves to speak! Juliet's mind is working very quickly. She is excited, but also worried about how suddenly they have fallen in love.
She says that if he swears by the moon, he might turn out to be just as changeable as the moon (the moon changes its shape throughout the month).
She worries that they have fallen in love so quickly.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.
She tries to say goodnight, but she is excited and passionate about her feelings for Romeo and can't seem to stop talking about it.
""My bounty is as boundless as the sea.
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite""
Juliet's use of imagery seems more heartfelt than Romeo's: her love is as deep as the sea, and the sea never runs out. That's passion!
Juliet's Nurse shouts to her from inside the house. Juliet asks Romeo to wait. As she goes into her bedroom, Romeo thinks to himself that their love seems like a dream.
Love - Is this true love? How could it have happened so quickly? Do you believe in 'love at first sight'? Remember, that same evening that he met and fell in love with Juliet, Romeo was moping about saying that he would never love anyone as much as he loved Rosaline! Romeo might argue though that he didn't really know what true love was until he met Juliet.
Juliet comes back out onto the balcony and tells Romeo that if he is serious about her, she will send a messenger out to him tomorrow to find out where and what time they will get married!
Time - events happen very quickly in this play. In less than a week, Romeo and Juliet fall in love, get married and die.
She says goodnight to him as her Nurse impatiently tells her to come inside.
Romeo finds it hard to say goodnight to her.
Romeo said that he was in love with Rosaline in the first extract. Less than a day later, he claims to be in love with Juliet. Has he really thought about the consequences of marrying Juliet. Perhaps, when you are in love, nothing else matters. What do you think?
Romeo uses lots of words and images that relate to light when he describes Juliet.: 'sun', 'stars' 'brightness'.

Graphs - Plotting y = ax + b using tables
To plot a graph, you need to find some coordinates that satisfy the equation of the graph.
Plot the graph of y = 2x + 1
We need to choose values for x and see what value of y they give.
y = (2  -2) + 1 = -3
y = (2  0) + 1 = 1
y = (2  2) + 1 = 5
You can show this in a table:

Individuals of the same species can reproduce to make more individuals of the same species. Two individuals belonging to different species cannot normally reproduce together. If they do, their offspring is usually infertile and unable to reproduce.
For example animals called ligers are produced when a male lion and a female tiger reproduce. But a liger cannot have offspring. This means that lions and tigers are different species.
All people are human. They belong to the same species. Your friends and classmates may have different eye colour and hair colour. Some will be boys and some will be girls. Some will be tall and some will be shorter. The presence of differences between living things of the same species is called variation.
Variation between different species is always greater than the variation within a species.

Ducklings will follow the first moving object they meet after hatching. They become socially attached to this object and treat it as their mother.
Imprinting lets young animals recognise their mother from a young age. They can follow her for food and protection.
Imprinting is useful if the first moving object they see really is their mother. But ducklings will imprint on people, balls and even cardboard boxes if these happen to be the first things they see.
Geese, chicks, and other baby birds that can walk around shortly after hatching, also show imprinting behaviour. Konrad Lorenz (1903 to 1989) was an Austrian scientist who studied animal behaviour.
He discovered that if he reared geese from when they hatched, they became imprinted on him. They followed him around and preferred to be near him even when they had grown into adult geese. Lorenz won the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine because of his experiments on animal behaviour.

164,"The beginning, or opening, is one of the most important sections of your writing. It should grab the reader's attention and make them want to read on. For instance, which is the best beginning for a ghost story?
a) The house was built in 1975. It was a typical semi-detached, but it did have quite an impressive front door. Most of the windows were double glazed and the garden was quite neat.
b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.
There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.
So you need to think about TAP (text, audience and purpose) and make a good start to your writing. You should try to 'set a context', which is like setting the scene. So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on.
a) The subject I am going to write about today is why the local park should not be closed.
b) Have you ever stopped to wonder how many hundreds of people make regular use of our Memorial Park?
a) It is unlikely that newspaper readers who enjoy all the things that our park has to offer will want it to disappear forever under tons of concrete.
b) 'Ashfield Park will be ruined,' claim protestors who held a meeting last night to organise opposition to the council's plans for a car park.
It should be clear that the ""b"" versions are better - they fit the style and show that the writer has used TAP to make their writing work. Remember - you need to make it interesting right from the start.

Different planets take different amounts of time to make one complete turn, so they have different lengths of day.
The Sun lights up one half of the Earth, and the other half is in shadow. As the Earth spins we move from shadow to light and back to shadow and so on. It is daytime in the UK when our part of the planet is in the lit by the Sun. And it is night-time in the UK when our part of the planet is facing away from the Sun.
During the day, the Sun appears to move through the sky. Remember that this happens because the Earth is spinning on its axis. In the UK if we look south and follow the path of Sun in the sky during the day, it looks like this:
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west
. That's because the Earth is spinning towards to the east, so we see the Sun first appear there at the start of the day. The Sun 'rises' in the east and 'sets' in the west.

Stanley didn't have many friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.
What does this extract show us about the main character?
Stanley is another big male, but it is clear that the writer wants us to react differently to him than we did to Jim Wellings in the earlier extract.
Stanley is a lonely boy, because he ""didn't have many friends at home"". He is bullied and teased, even by adults. The fact that the teacher causes him ""embarrassment"" by showing him up in front of the class proves that he feels uncomfortable about his weight.

This gives lots of facts, but these are the types of facts that someone buying a house might need. Most people would find a description like this boring. So what should you do?
The first thing is to think about what you want to show other people. Do you want to concentrate on the roof tiles or the types of bricks used? Or do you want to tell them about the fence panel your brother broke when he was chasing you last summer?
You could also write about the time Stephanie threw a tennis ball and it got stuck in the guttering - it's still there - and when it rains really hard the gutter overflows. You might even have a gnome in the front garden, which your grandad bought - it looks stupid, but you won't move it in case you offend him.
Each of these details is far more interesting than roof tiles or measurements. So, when you are describing something, think of drawing a picture or taking a photograph. You focus on a certain point, write a paragraph about it, then move to the next point and the next.

There are millions of species on our planet. It would be difficult if we just tried to describe and name each one individually. Although species can be very different from each other, many of them have similar features that allow us to put them into groups.
In the eighteenth century Carl Linnaeus started the modern system of putting species of organism into certain groups and giving them scientific names. Each species is given a name using Latin words, so that the same name can be used all over the world.
For example, the scientific name for human beings is 'homo sapiens'. Putting different species into different groups according to their features is called

The prevailing wind is the most frequent wind direction a location experiences. In Britain the prevailing wind is from the southwest, which brings warm, moist air from the Atlantic Ocean. This contributes to the frequent rainfall. When prevailing winds blow over land areas, it can contribute to creating desert climates.
The British Isles have variable weather that changes from day to day between different regions and within different regions. Consequently it is very difficult to predict or forecast the weather.
Britain has four distinct seasons of fairly equal length - spring, summer, autumn and winter. In winter it is colder and wetter and the days are shorter than in summer.
Different parts of the UK experience slightly different regional climates. These can be summarised as:
- cool summers, mild winters, heavy rain all year.
- cool summers, cold winters, steady rain all year.
- warm summers, mild winters, light rain all year, especially summer.
- warm summers, mild winters, heavy rain all year, especially winter.
The variability of weather and climate in different regions of the British Isles is due to the different air masses that meet over the Isles. Each air mass brings with them different characteristics, as shown in the map below.
Prevailing winds and climate zones in the UK
are greatest along the south coast of England (average of 1750 hours of sunshine per year) and are least in mountainous areas (average less then 1000 hours).
Scotland has shorter winter days and longer summer days than the rest of the UK, because it is further north. In the north of Scotland there are four more hours of daylight in mid-summer than in London.
On average it rains one in three days in the UK. However, rainfall varies greatly from region to region. It is generally wetter in the west than the east and wetter in the highlands than the lowlands. The wettest place is Snowdonia in Wales (average annual totals exceeding 3000 mm of rain a year), followed by the Highlands of Scotland, the Lake District, the Pennines and the moors of southwest England.
Parts of the east, such as East Anglia, receive less than 700 mm a year.
In most places in the UK it will rain twice as much in winter months as in summer months. Although in central and south-eastern England, and parts of southeast Scotland, July and August are often the wettest months of the year. In London and Birmingham it will thunder on average 15 days a year, compared to less than 10 elsewhere in the UK.

The coldest months are January and February and the warmest are July and August. In summer Scotland will be about three degrees cooler than England. The average daily maximum temperature at Glasgow in July is 19C compared with 22C in London.
Scotland tends to be worse affected by severe weather than the rest of the UK. Snow is more common in highland regions than in lowland areas, so while snow might fall on the south west of England less than 10 days a year, it will fall on the peaks of the Cairngorm Mountains over 100 days a year.

Read these short descriptions, given by Claudia, Eva, Michael and Lars, of where they live. Don't worry if you don't understand every word at this stage.
Ich wohne seit vierzehn Jahren in Herborn. Ich fahre oft nach Gieen, aber ich bin immer froh, wenn ich von der Uni wieder nach Hause fahren kann. Es gibt zwar nicht sehr viel zu tun, aber das macht mir nichts aus. Ich brauche nur meine Freunde anzurufen und in zehn Minuten sitzen wir zusammen in einer der vielen Kneipen in der Altstadt und reden miteinander. Und nachher kann ich einfach nach Hause laufen.
Ich wohne in einer Wohnung in Offenburg, etwa fnf Gehminuten vom Bahnhof. Es gefllt mir dort, denn ich kann morgens im Stadtpark joggen. Ich habe daran gedacht, nach Freiburg zu ziehen, weil es dort viel mehr zu tun gibt, besonders was Sport betrifft. Aber da so viele Leute dort studieren wollen, sind die Lebenskosten viel hher und ich muss ein paar Jahre warten, bis ich dahinziehen kann.
Ich wohne immer noch bei meinen Eltern in Spiesen-Elversberg. Das liegt am Waldrand, etwa fnf Kilometer sdlich von Neunkirchen. Es ist ganz schn ruhig hier und man kann sich gut vom Schulstress erholen, aber abends und am Wochenende wird es mir langweilig. Meine Eltern sind super und fahren mich nach Neunkirchen zum Kino und holen mich oft sehr spt ab. Ich freue mich schon auf nchstes Jahr. Bis dann habe ich hoffentlich meinen Fhrerschein. Dann htte ich vor allem in Saarbrcken eine grere Auswahl an Filmen.
Seit fnf Jahren wohne ich auf dem Lande. Frher habe ich in Berlin gewohnt. Klar hat das Spa gemacht, in einer Weltstadt zu wohnen. Aber ich denke jetzt nie daran und auf dem Bauernhof habe ich alles, was ich brauche. Das geht allerdings nicht ohne Wagen und Telefon, denn hier gibt es so gut wie keine ffentlichen Verkehrsmittel.

 at first, railways used stationary steam engines to wind wagons up banks. Then in 1800, Trevithick invented the steam-powered locomotive. The first steam-powered boat was built in 1802. This had significant effects, not only on industry and agriculture and the transport of goods, but on the transport of people and their mobility and social lives (eg holidays at the seaside).
 the steam engines used coal, so industry was located on the coalfields.
 steam engines were expensive, so mainly large firms could afford them. The steam engines allowed large-scale production.
 the steam engines never flagged or stopped, so this required significant changes in the way people worked. There was now no requirement for workers to be strong or skilled and, if a person was big, it could now be a disadvantage. The steam-powered machine did all the work, so children replaced men as the key workers in industry.

Coal is an example of a fossil fuel
The fossil fuels include coal, natural gas and the products from the fractional distillation of crude oil, such as petrol and diesel. When any fossil fuel is burned, one of the combustion products is carbon dioxide.

Global warming refers to the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's surface. In the last 100 years it is believed to have risen by 0.6 degrees C. There are estimates that in the next 100 years, the global temperatures could rise by as much as 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.
One way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air is to burn
fossil fuels. Unfortunately, we depend on the burning of fossil fuels for heating, electricity generation and transport. If we are to burn less fossil fuels, we will need alternatives for these essential activities.
Clouds of smoke and other combustion products are emitted from chimneys
Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.

removing sulfur from natural gas and fuel oil
removing sulfur dioxide from the flue gases emitted by coal-burning power stations
Coal-powered stations give off solid particulates. These can also be removed from the flue gases.
Atmospheric pollution caused by the exhaust gases given out by motor vehicles can be reduced by:

5869,"Jane is excited about returning to Thornfield and Mr Rochester, even though she believes he is married to Blanche Ingram. It is obvious when they meet that Rochester is delighted to see her, too.
What follows is ""a fortnight of dubious calm"", in which Jane expects to hear about the marriage but nothing is said.
On midsummer eve, Jane goes into the garden after Adele has gone to bed. She finds Mr Rochester there. The scene is described in extraordinary detail, as it moves to his proposal.
He is perhaps teasing or testing Jane as he talks of her having to move on, claiming to have found her a new position in Ireland. Eventually, however, he proposes, revealing that any chance of a relationship with Blanche ended when he pretended to have less money than she considered acceptable.
Rochester talks frequently of what he is doing as being wrong, but claims his love and care for Jane will atone for it. As readers, we think there could be something sinister behind this. However, Jane does not pick up on more than his emotion as they go into the house.
Jane is blissfully happy, but still aware that Mrs Fairfax seems shocked. So she asks Mr Rochester to speak to her the following day. Her congratulations, when they come, seem very subdued, fuelling our suspicions.
Jane decides she will not abandon her previous path. She refuses expensive gifts and spends a lot of time with Adele. Mr Rochester is eager to be with her, but allows her to dictate terms in this way in the four weeks leading up to the wedding.
Then we hear of a very bizarre episode. Mr Rochester has had to go away. When he returns, Jane describes having been woken by someone in her room. She describes the woman in hideous terms, and explains that her wedding veil was ripped in two, so it could not have been a dream. Mr Rochester encourages her to continue to blame Grace, and insists she shares Adele's room the night before the wedding.
The wedding morning arrives. Mr Rochester is possessed by tension and a desire that everything should be done quickly. Even Jane is encouraged to hurry.
There are no family present at the wedding. Perhaps for this reason, Jane notices two men, apparently waiting for the ceremony, enter the church before them.
When the priest asks if there is any impediment to the marriage, one of the men, Mr Briggs - a lawyer - explains that Rochester is already married to the sister of Mr Mason, who comes forward at this point.
Clearly, there can be no marriage. Mr Rochester takes them back to Thornfield to see his wife, Bertha, a dangerous lunatic, and Grace, her keeper. Bertha attacks Mr Rochester, but he is able to restrain her. Even though
The crime of marrying one person while still being married to another.
is a serious crime, it becomes easy to understand what drove him.
Before Briggs and Mason depart, we learn that it was a chance connection between Jane's uncle in Madeira and Mr Mason that brought Briggs and Mason to stop the marriage. We also learn that Jane's uncle is on his death-bed.
Jane spends a long time numb with shock at what has happened. She eventually meets with Mr Rochester and he tries everything in his power to keep her with him. He explains how he was trapped by his family into the marriage, and how he spent time in Europe seeking, in vain, some kind of escape.
He asks Jane to come away with him, but she is controlled by conscience and cannot allow herself to be loved by a married man. She knows she cannot stay with him and keep her resolution, so says she will leave.

1137,"A theme is a subject or idea that keeps appearing in the text. You usually find more than one theme in a story. They help to hold the story together, and often encourage us to think more about the plot, and what lies beyond it
""You're so innocent, you didn't realise. You're too trusting, too kind, you don't know what these people can be like.""
The narrator wishes her daughter was still innocent like a young child. She is shocked and disgusted at the evidence she finds of her growing experience.
The mother also feels guilty and ashamed of her own sexual experience before marriage, and has kept it a secret. This relates to the narrator's obsession with purity.
The word 'white' is often mentioned. And cleanliness is important to her, too.
The daughter, by contrast, is seen as 'dirty', lying 'on a pile of filth', living the most sordid life the narrator can imagine.
What is interesting about these contrasting ideas is that we realise things are not always what they seem. The narrator seems to have high moral standards, but when she was young she broke the rules, too.
""I had to help with the housework but my brother did nothing.""
The narrator seems to have different standards for men and women:
It's OK for men to use bad language, but not women.
Fathers are in charge, and might be strict if you do not abide by the rules.
Men do not like to talk about emotions.
Women should keep the house tidy and learn to cook.
Women should not say how they feel. They should also avoid being rude.
When a man loses his temper, a woman should accept this and not defend herself.
Women who try to make themselves look attractive are 'tarts'.
Girls who are curious about sex before marriage are 'dirty'.
Which of these points do you agree or disagree with?
You may think it is no wonder the daughter ran away. You might also comment that these expectations belong to a different era to the modern day.
""Rows of high heels, all of them too small for her, she was so vain, all of them moulded to the shape of her feet.""
The narrator wants to control her daughter, but finds that she cannot do this.
The narrator feels the need to control her emotions. She finds this increasingly difficult as the story progresses.
The daughter displays a lack of control: she loses her temper, drinks alcohol, binges on food, and does not want to wait until marriage before having sex.
The narrator's mother displayed a lack of control, too: she was ""plump"", said things without thinking, and had rows of shoes that were too small for her - but wore them anyway, rather than sensible shoes.
The narrator finds comfort in the fact that she can lock up the shoes, tie them together, make them clean, and keep them safe and warm in bed.
""They're best in here with me I think, safe and warm in bed. Tucked up tight.""
The narrator could not live up to her father's expectations.
Her daughter is not living up to her expectations.
The narrator is sad that she was not close to her mother.
She recognises the distance between herself and her daughter's generation.
She wishes her daughter was still a baby. She is frightened by the signs that her daughter is growing up.
She admits: ""I didn't really know you at all.""

3441,"Shakespeare creates dramatic effect by switching a lot from one event to another. The switches tend to involve two things: a switch from one group of characters to another, and a change of mood, like switching from tragedy to humour.
For instance, the wedding scene is a terrible ordeal for Hero. It should have been the most important day in her life, and was almost as important to her father, but things go tragically wrong. Leonato wants to disown Hero, Beatrice wants to eat Claudio's ""heart in the market place"", and Benedick leaves to challenge his best friend to a duel. Things could not get any worse. However, Shakespeare suddenly switches the mood completely.

trained dogs to expect food whenever he rang a bell. The dogs eventually produced saliva when they heard the bell ring.
The dog salivates naturally when given food.
Pavlov rings a bell every time the dog eats.
After much repetition the dog salivates when the bell rings, even when there is no food.
. The dogs were conditioned to salivate when the bell rang.
A ringing bell does not normally cause salivation in dogs. However, when the ringing bell becomes a secondary stimulus, it does cause salivation, even though the dog will not be able to eat the bell as food.
This is now called a conditioned reflex. In a conditioned reflex the final response (salivation) has no direct connection with the stimulus (ringing bell).
Predators mistake the hoverfly for a wasp due to similar markings
For example, birds will not eat caterpillars with bright colouring because they are conditioned to think of bright colours as poisonous. Some caterpillars use this to their advantage. Their bright colours protect them, even though they are not poisonous.
How often have you run away from a harmless hoverfly because it has the same markings as a wasp?
a reflex response. It does this by sending an impulse along a motor neuron of the reflex arc. This enables us, for example, to hold onto a hot dinner plate when normally we would drop it.

Music that has no chordal accompaniment, where different instruments or parts play or sing the same notes is described as in
Here is an example of unison: a male choir singing a traditional Armenian hymn.
This literally means 'sounding together'. Homophonic music is played in block chords. Sometimes, homophonic music is called chordal music, it means the same thing.
Here is an example of music with a homophonic texture, written by Henry VIII.
This literally means 'different sounds or voices'. Polyphonic music has parts that weave in and out of each other. Sometimes this is called contrapuntal music - it means the same thing.
Polyphonic music may contain an element of imitation, where one voice or instrument copies what has just been played by another. (Think of a roundsong like
Listen to this example of music that has a polyphonic texture, from JS Bach's
A fugue is a special type of polyphonic texture. Fugues always begin with a tune that is played on a solo instrument/voice or by instruments/voices in unison. This tune is then played by all the other instruments or voices in turn but not necessarily at the same pitch.
Here is an example of a fugue. Notice how the solo starts the fugue tune and then the other voices join in one at a time.
A capella music is always for voices. It describes vocal music that has no instrumental accompaniment.
A capella music can be polyphonic, homophonic or unison - so you might see a piece of music described as 'homophonic a capella' or 'polyphonic a capella'.
The words 'a capella' in Italian mean 'In the style of the chapel'. This is because early music for the church was for unaccompanied voices.
Listen to this example of a capella singing - yodelling from Gabon in Africa.
This is a melody which can be sung or played on an instrument, with an accompaniment. A song with piano accompaniment falls into this category.
Here is an example of melody and accompaniment:
This texture is when a solo is heard which is immediately answered by another tune played or sung by a group. It is used a lot in popular music, jazz music and music from other cultures.
Here is an example of a call-and-response song from Latin America
Listen to this extract of music by Mozart that only uses the words 'Kyrie Eleison' and 'Christe Eleison' and comment on the textures voices and instruments you hear.
: The music starts with just one instrument and one voice. The other voices and instruments then join in one at a time. At the end, all the instruments and voices play their own tune starting at different times.
Talvin has obviously heard that the voices have tunes starting at different times, but has not gone into enough detail about it. He didn't mention any instruments or voices by name and couldn't mention any of the textures by name either.
: The music starts with just the trombones and the bass voice. This type of texture is called 'unison'. The alto voice then joins in making the texture weave in and out. The voices sing Kyrie Eleison. A high voice then comes in singing a tune to the words 'Christe Eleison' which adds to the weaving style. There are timpani and strings in this piece. At the end, all the voices are weaving in and out of each other.
This is a good answer by Sarah. She has named one texture, unison. She heard that the music was 'weaving' but didn't use the proper word 'polyphonic'. She has also correctly identified one voice and an instrument.
: The music begins with the trombones and bass voices in unison. The voices sing the words 'Kyrie Eleison'. The alto voices then join in with faster notes singing the words 'Christe Eleison'. The texture is now polyphonic. The Soprano voices then sing the 1st tune (that the basses sang at first) to the words 'Kyrie Eleison' while the tenor voices sing the tune that the altos sang earlier to the words 'Christe Eleison'. The texture is still polyphonic. Timpani are heard to add emphasis to the bass part. Towards the end, all the voices sing both tunes to both sets of words in a polyphonic texture. Overall, the music has two tunes. The style is a fugue, where the tunes overlap each other.
Geeta has used the proper words to describe the textures and the voices/instruments used in this excerpt. She spotted that each set of words 'Kyrie Eleison' and 'Christe Eleison' has its own tune. Finally, she correctly identified the piece of music as being a fugue.

In the extract from Karimah's work journal, shown below, you will see how she has explained her work to others. This was a statement she included with her exhibition of coursework. Along with her other notes and explanations, she was able to help others understand how she had developed her ideas and work.

My art exhibition shows a series of artwork that I have created which all deal with my journey from Nigeria to England. During the term, I have created a series of art pieces that concentrate on the theme of 'Identity'. In the art pieces, I explore the journey that I have made from Nigeria to live in England. The reason that I have focused on this subject under the title of 'Identity' is because, the journey I have made was a life changing journey and it is a significant part of my identity.
I first started exploring this journey by creating self portraits, this was to develop my skills and ideas in art to help me to become more advanced. I then planned and created a collage of Africa. This collage shows the journey that I made to England from Nigeria, through symbols, colours and pictures used to represent the contrasting countries. The main elements that I included in my collage work is that England has a cool calm atmosphere and climate whilst Nigeria is hot and roars with excitement and noise. Nigeria has a beautiful collection of exotic animals that run wild and free, whilst in England the animals are locked up in a zoo. The environment in England is clean and fresh but in Nigeria, it is dirty and humid. I chose to show my journey this way because it is an effective way of showing the striking difference between England and Nigeria.
After the first collage I realised that collage is my strongest point in art and I began to produce a series of mixed media pieces that featured collage. 'Tree of Life' is a piece where I used a symbol of a tree to represent my life growing out of a symbol of Africa. In 'The first self portrait collage' I used maps to show the physical part of my journey. 'The second self portrait collage', is a piece where I used the different flags of England and Nigeria to show my journey and the comparison between England and Nigeria.
I have linked my theme of 'Identity', with numerous artists because they have all been exploring a similar theme to me. Gerard Quenum is an African artist who uses dolls to symbolise identity, Richard Long, an artist who expresses his journeys through photographs, Louise Bourgeois who deals with her identity by using memories of her childhood, Frida Khalo a Mexican artist who uses powerful images to show her identity and Henri Matisse who uses his knowledge of African art and refines it into a simpler form in his pieces of art. I have been to the National Gallery, the Tate Modern, the October Gallery, the Century City exhibition and the library to learn about artists that may have connections with my theme.
I have been exploring my cultural and family background through family photographs. This is because the photographs prompt ideas for units of work and they tell different stories through the atmosphere or pose in the picture.
The journey in the art pieces is presented in mixed styles of aboriginal art and African art. I do this to experiment with the different ways of presenting my journey to viewers and to give a variation in the techniques and arts styles that I use.
My progress whilst creating units of artwork has improved dramatically compared to the beginning of term where I was unable to develop and explore ideas. Overall, I am pleased with the way that I have managed to link all my units of artwork together all under the topic of 'Identity'. I have improved my art skills from the beginning of the term, when I had very little art skills. I am glad that I can now expand and explore ideas, compared to when I first started art and I could not develop an idea because of lack of experience and knowledge of art.

If A is the point (1, 1) and B is the point (4, 5), what is the length of the line segment AB?
It is not easy to picture this without drawing a sketch. Have a look at the diagram below:
A has an x-coordinate of 1. B has an x-coordinate of 4. So, to get from A to B, we move along 3 units.
A has a y-coordinate of 1. B has a y-coordinate of 5. So, to get from A to B, we move up 4 units.
We have created a right-angled triangle. So to find the length of AB we use Pythagoras theorem.

Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.

- does your school have a swimming pool, Astroturf pitch, sports hall or tennis courts?
- what sports activity does your school have outside of PE lessons?
- are they positive? Do they have favourite sports? What if your favourite isnt the same as theirs?
- are you introduced to clubs in the area?
Your school's links with local clubs can affect your participation
Role models such as David Beckham, Tanni Grey-Thompson and Kelly Holmes have had a huge influence on participation in recent years.
Women are now accepted as managers, officials and club directors although this was not always the case.
Some sports, such as squash, have declined in popularity whilst womens football and extreme sports are booming. Media coverage of sport affects participation levels. So does the rising concern about safety which has stopped a lot of 'free play' on the streets and in parks.

The first attempt in Britain to improve roads started in 1663. This was when the Turnpike Trust was set up. The trusts had one simple aim:
to charge people to use newly improved roads
and then the money raised from the tolls was used to pay for the upkeep of the roads.
who were sometimes more interested in making a profit than maintaining the good condition of roads for their customers. The businessmen had to get an Act of Parliament passed to build their turnpike and had to employ professional road surveyors, treasurers and reputable road engineers.
A carriage passes through the toll gate while engineers survey the road
As you can see from the illustration, the road engineers built
gates across the entrance of the roads
and then toll keepers collected tolls from people using the roads. People were charged different tolls depending on the method of transport they were using. This money was then meant to be used to maintain the roads.
Some trusts did maintain their roads and

For example, during the Rebecca Riots in Wales (1842-44) rioters dressed as women burned down toll keepers' cottages and tollgates in protest at road tolls.

Moniza Alvi: Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan
Moniza Alvi was born in Lahore in Pakistan, the daughter of a Pakistani father and an English mother. She moved to Hatfield in England when she was a few months old. She didn't revisit Pakistan until after the publication of her first book of poems - 'The Country over my Shoulder' - from which this poem comes.
Presents from My Aunts...was one of the first poems I wrote. When I wrote this poem, I hadn't actually been back to Pakistan. The girl in the poem would be me at about 13. The clothes seem to stick to her in an uncomfortable way, a bit like a kind of false skin, and she thinks things aren't straightforward for her.
I found it was important to write the Pakistan poems because I was getting in touch with my background. And maybe there's a bit of a message behind the poems about something I went through, that I want to maybe open a few doors if possible.

point is when a firm begins to make a profit. It will make a loss if it produces and sells output below this level.
The breakeven point for a firm is when total costs equals total revenue. Expenditure and income are the same and the firm makes neither a profit or a loss. If the firm can sell at production levels above this point, it will be making a profit. If sales fall below this point, it will be making a loss. Establishing the breakeven point helps a firm to plan the levels of production it needs to be profitable.
Before you can calculate the breakeven point, you need to identify the firm's costs. These include:
Renting an office block is part of a company's fixed costs
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
are constant and do not change however many goods are produced. They include rent and insurance.
Wages paid to employees are part of a company's variable costs
These change according to output eg raw materials.
include raw materials and wages. You need to calculate the variable costs per unit. These costs increase in direct proportion to the number of units produced.
By adding the firm's variable costs and fixed costs you can work out the
Fixed costs plus variable costs make total costs.
The firm's variable costs are added to the fixed costs and these make the total costs.
You need to establish how many units are to be produced.
You need to know the selling price of the units.
Once you have the above information, you can begin to calculate the breakeven point. You do this either by using a chart or an equation.
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
These change according to output eg raw materials.
You may find it helpful to work through the
Here is how to work out the breakeven point, using the example of a firm manufacturing compact discs. You can assume the firm has the following costs:
You first construct a chart with output (units) on the horizontal (x) axis, and costs and revenue on the vertical (y) axis. On to this, you plot a horizontal fixed costs line (it is horizontal because fixed costs don't changewith output).
Then you plot a variable cost line from this point, which will, in effect, be the total costs line. This is because the fixed cost added to the variable cost gives the total cost. To do this, you multiply:
variable cost per unit  number of units
In this example of the CD manufacturing firm, you can assume that the variable cost per unit is 2 and there are 2 000 units = 4,000
Once you have done this, you are ready to plot the
The value of sales at a given output ie sales price multiplied by output.
sales price  number of units (output)
If the sales price is 6.00 and 2.000 items were to be manufactured, the calculation is:
6.00  2,000 = 12,000 total revenue
Where the total revenue line crosses the total costs line is the breakeven point (ie costs and revenue are the same). Everything below this point is produced at a loss, and everything above it is produced at a profit.
Fixed costs: 10,000, Variable costs: 2 per unit, Sales price: 6 per unit
If you read downwards, it tells you how many units you need to produce and sell at this price to breakeven: 2,500 CDs
If you read across, it tells you how much money you must spend before you recover your outlay: 15,000
As with any calculation, it is easy to make a mistake. There are two simple equations you can use to double-check your answer. You can calculate the breakeven point in:
Either way, the result should be the same.
For the breakeven point in costs/revenue, you then multiply the breakeven point in units, which you have just calculated, by the sales price.
If you look at the breakeven chart, you will see this is the correct answer.
Breakeven analysis is a favourite exam topic. In an exam, you could be asked to complete a breakeven chart. With these two equations, you'll be able to double check your calculations, get them right and improve your marks.
Use the example of the CD manufacturer above and plot your own chart with the same costs, but this time with a different total revenue line:
You should have calculated a breakeven point of 2,000 units and a costs revenue of 14,000.
If you have made a mistake, calculate the breakeven point in units, and then in costs/revenue again and double check your calculations again.

For example, iron ore is used to make iron and steel. Copper is easily extracted, but ores rich in copper are becoming more difficult to find.

Use your knowledge of Spanish-speaking countries. For example, if you hear someone was on holiday in Madrid, it is unlikely they spent time on the beach.
Don't just listen to the words. The tone of someone's voice may also be helpful - for example in telling you if they are making a statement or asking a question.

A manufacturing company's production department will need to consider the quality and quantity of a product in relation to cost. If a firm wants to make a profit, it has to know what it is spending as well as what it is earning. Here are some of the costs it needs to know to do this:
Now look at each of these costs in more detail:
These costs do not change however many units of a product are made. Factory rent, insurance premiums and administration salaries stay the same, whether the factory is working at full capacity or producing nothing. The owner of the business may have taken out a loan to buy equipment or refurbish a building. The loan will have to be repaid whether or not the business has customers.

The amount spent on producing one extra unit. It is the increase in total cost when one more unit is produced.

A company produces compact discs. It has produced 99 CDs and the total costs have amounted to 999. If the total costs increase to 1,000 when the hundredth CD is made the marginal cost of the last CD is 1.00.
The firm knows that now each CD should cost only 1.00 or less to produce. As the cost per unit usually decreases with a rise in output, it should become cheaper to produce each one. The firm may be able to offer a more competitive price to customers.
The example of the CD shows the benefits of economies of scale, where mass production results in a lower unit cost. The reason is that the fixed costs do not change and are spread across a greater level of output.
The amount spent on producing each unit of output. It is calculated by dividing the total level of cost by the level of output.
helps a firm to monitor its progress, and makes it easier to set prices. It is calculated by dividing total cost by total output.
Using the example of the compact disc firm above:
This might seem expensive, but if the firm produces another hundred units at a marginal cost of 1.00 per CD, its average cost will fall radically:
The firm can use this information to decide whether it is worth accepting a new order for goods.
The examiner will want to see that you understand what the different costs are, how they are calculated, and why it is important for a firm to work them out. You will be expected to apply your understanding to a real life situation.
A company will always incur costs, no matter how efficient it is. Wages,

Read the case study and answer the question below
Martin and Ashley started their window cleaning business with 1,500 they borrowed from Ashley's dad, and a 550 bank loan. They used the money to buy a second hand van and cleaning equipment. Ashley's dad doesn't charge any interest. They pay him back 50 a month. They also have to pay the bank 50 a month over two years. They don't get many bookings in winter when the weather is bad. Martin and Ashley aim to pay themselves 50 a month each.
What costs do Martin and Ashley have to meet even when they have no customers? (10 marks)
When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page.
They have got to pay back the money they borrowed.
Jamie needs to give far more explanation. He should use business terms and show he understands what fixed costs are.
They have to pay Ashley's father each month, as well as the loan from the bank. They may have other costs, like the cleaning materials they buy to run their business.
Morag started her answer quite well, mentioning both loans which, as fixed costs, have to be repaid. The cleaning materials, however, form part of the variable, rather than the fixed costs.
Costs which have to be paid, regardless of the level of output, are called fixed costs. Martin and Ashley have the fixed costs of repaying Ashley's dad 50 a month, and they probably pay bank interest on the loan. Their pay is a fixed cost. They might want to consider paying themselves piece rate, to help their business survive. The road tax and insurance on the van are fixed costs they have to pay. They have already bought the van, so this is a sunk cost, and no longer a fixed cost they have to pay.
Rani's answer would probably get a A grade. She has answered the question well, and has shown she can use business terms like fixed costs. She has thought about the pay they only receive when they have the business, and correctly counted it as a fixed cost.

6792,"Fabrics usually need to be washed, bleached and dyed, before they are suitable for making into textile products. Often they need to be printed as well, using either block-printing or screen-printing techniques. Garments are assembled using various joining techniques including sewing, fusing and heat-sealing. Finishing is a process which improves the appearance, handle and performance of fabrics; while pressing is used to shape and stabilise fabrics.

Before dyeing and printing the fabric is prepared by washing, bleaching and
treating cotton yarn with an alkali to improve its strength, lustre and receptivity to dye.
In industrial production fabric is dyed by continuous or batch dyeing:
, the fabric passes through a dye bath. The fabric is then squeezed between rollers to spread the dye evenly and remove excess dye. Continuous dyeing is used for colours that do not need to change too quickly with fashion.
, fabrics are produced without dye. They are then dyed to order in large batches according to the colours required. Batch dyeing is used for colours that need to change frequently with fashion.
Fabrics are printed by block or screen printing:

Fusing by hand is used to join Vilene to fabric to make it stable and strong. It is also used to reinforce and strengthen fabrics for garments, bags and accessories; and allows hems to be turned up without stitching.
In a factory there are two types of machine used for fusing: a flat-bed press is used to join short fabric lengths for batch production; a conveyor press is used for fusing long fabric lengths for mass production.

2154,"Species gradually evolve by a process of natural selection. The individuals in any population with the inherited features best suited to the environment in which they live are most likely to survive and reproduce. When they do, they pass on the genetic information for these features to their offspring.
Over time, a species can change its appearance and may even become a new species, unable to reproduce successfully with individuals of the original species.
Selective breeding, also called artificial selection, involves people taking charge of selection to produce new 'varieties' of various species. A variety is a type of a particular species that is different in some clear way from other varieties of that species.
For example, pedigree dogs come in lots of different varieties (or breeds) - they may be different colours and sizes, but they are all still dogs.

Suppose you wanted a variety of cow that produced a lot of milk. This is what you could do:
choose or select the cows in your herd that produce the most milk
select the offspring that produce the most milk
keep repeating the process of selection and breeding until you achieve your goal
The key here is to identify the feature you want, and only breed from the individuals that have that feature. Here are some examples of what selective breeding can produce:
hens that lay big eggs of a particular colour
tomato plants that produce lots of tomatoes
crops that are resistant to certain plant diseases

3123,"Decay is an essential life process, which helps to digest food and recycle materials. Bacteria and fungi are the main groups of decomposer. They release enzymes to break down compounds, so that they can absorb the nutrients. We can preserve our food, for example by freezing or canning, to remove the conditions needed for decay to occur.
Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another.
Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
Intensive farming practices include growing high-yield crops, using fertilisers and pesticides and keeping animals indoors. Food production is increased but there are unwelcome side effects.
Organic farming bans chemical inputs and has a less harmful effect on the environment but often produces less, more expensive food.
Hydroponics is the production of food using nutrient-rich solution rather than soil.
Leaves enable photosynthesis to happen. Photosynthesis is the process by which leaves absorb light and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrate (food) for plants to grow. Leaves are adapted to perform their function eg they have a large surface area to absorb sunlight.
Plants use minerals from the soil to build the complex molecules they need to survive and grow. Poor plant growth may be due to a deficiency of one or more minerals. Tests can be done to establish which mineral is deficient or a general purpose NPK fertiliser added.
Plants have two different types of 'transport' tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots.
The element carbon is the present in all living organisms. It's recycled through various processes, which are described in the carbon cycle.
Nitrogen is essential for the formation of amino acids to make proteins. The nitrogen cycle describes the ways in which nitrogen is recycled.
Osmosis is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low water concentration through a partially permeable membrane. Osmosis takes place in all living cells.
Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis through their root hair cells. Plants use water for several vital processes including photosynthesis and transporting minerals.
All substances are made from atoms. Each atom is made of a nucleus - containing protons and neutrons - surrounded by electrons.
The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. The elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in ascending order of atomic number.
The mass number of an atom is the total of protons plus neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and hence different mass numbers) are called isotopes of that element.
A covalent bond is formed between non metal atoms, which combine together by sharing electrons. Covalent compounds have no free electrons and no ions so they don't conduct electricity.
The Periodic Table is an arrangement of the elements in order of atomic number. Elements in the same vertical column are in the same group or family and have similar chemical properties.
Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid using electricity. When ionic compounds are molten or dissolved in water the ions are free to move.
When sulfuric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen is produced at the cathode (negative electrode) and oxygen at the anode (positive electrode). Aluminium is extracted from the mineral bauxite using the process of electrolysis.
All matter is made of atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements, and each one has a symbol. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other.
When atoms of different elements join together they make a compound. Compounds are represented by formulae that show how many atoms of each element are in the compound. Formulae can be worked out from the charge of the ions that make up the compound.
Chemical reactions can be written down as balanced chemical equations.
The Group 1 elements in the Periodic Table are known as the alkali metals. They include lithium, sodium and potassium, which all react vigorously with air and water.
The reactivity of the alkali metals increases down the group. Flame tests are used to identify alkali metal ions in compounds.
The Group 7 elements are also known as the halogens. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, which all have seven electrons in their outer shell.
In a displacement reaction a less reactive element is
Ionic bonding occurs between positive and negative ions, which attract each other and bind together to form ionic compounds. For example, sodium chloride consists of Na
Each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions held in place by electrostatic attraction and forming an ionic crystal lattice. The ions in a crystal lattice are very strongly bonded - a high temperature is required to melt the crystal.
The physical properties of different metals make them useful for different purposes. For example, aluminium conducts heat, which makes it a useful material for making saucepans and gold is shiny, which makes it an attractive material for jewellery.
Metal particles are held together by strong metallic bonds, which is why they have high melting and boiling points. The loose electrons in metals can all move together through the metal  creating an electric current.
The elements in the middle section of the Periodic Table are the transition elements. They're all metals with typical metallic properties eg conducting heat and electricity. They often form coloured compounds.
Transition metal carbonates undergo thermal decomposition - a reaction in which a substance is broken down into at least two other substances by heat.
Transition metal hydroxides are insoluble in water. They can be precipitated out of a transitional metal compound solution using sodium hydroxide solution.

3802,"Sea water contains a number of dissolved salts. When these salts dissolve in water, the ions separate. Sea water therefore contains a mixture of ions. The most common ions in sea water are shown in the table:
It is possible to deduce from the table which salts dissolved to form the mixture of ions:
When sodium chloride dissolves it forms sodium ions and chloride ions.
When magnesium chloride dissolves it forms magnesium and chloride ions.
When magnesium sulfate dissolves if forms magnesium ions and sulfate ions.
When potassium chloride dissolves it forms potassium ions and chloride ions.
When potassium bromide dissolves it forms potassium ions and bromide ions.
You can use the charge on the ions shown in the table to work out the formulae of the ionic compounds.
. For the charges to cancel out in the neutral salt sodium chloride, they must be in a ration of 1:1. So the formula of sodium chloride is NaCl.
. For the charges to cancel out in the neutral salt magnesium chloride, they must be in a ration of 1:2. So the formula of magnesium chloride is MgCl

1822,"You should know some of the factors affecting the stopping distance of a car.
It takes a certain amount of time for a driver to react to a hazard and start applying the brakes. During this time, the car is still moving. The faster the car is travelling, the greater this thinking distance will be.
The thinking distance will also increase if the driver's reactions are slower because they are:
The braking distance is the distance the car travels from where the brakes are first applied to where the car stops. If the braking force is too great, the tyres may not grip the road sufficiently and the car may skid. The faster the car is travelling, the greater the braking distance will be.
The braking distance will also increase if:
The weather conditions are poor, such as an icy or wet road.

4397,"There is no physical description of any of the characters. There is very little direct description of their feelings either, because Hemingway prefers to let us read between the lines.
The story seems to be told from Nick's viewpoint. Although it is told in the third person - both characters are referred to as 'he' and 'she' - the story remains with Nick after Marjorie has left, so we get his reaction to the break-up, but not hers.
Nick has planned to break up with Marjorie, and has discussed it with Bill beforehand - Bill asks: ""Did she go alright?"" You could see Nick as being unfair, since he has planned this and still goes on the fishing trip with her.
Nick seems to be quite aggressive at times in the story: when responding to things Marjorie says, and picking arguments.
He does not have the courage to break up with her outright - he has to pick an argument first. It is Marjorie who asks the definitive question.
Earlier in the story, is Nick trying to break the idea to Marjorie gently when he comments that the fish will not ""strike"" - in other words, they will not commit, like him?
Hemingway only directly mentions what the characters are feeling once or twice. He uses the word 'afraid' to describe Nick's feelings when he is talking to Marjorie. What do you think he is afraid of?
After Marjorie has gone, Nick seems upset. He tells Bill the break-up went fine, but is described as ""lying, his face on the blanket"". The 'lying' is
- is it about the position of his body or the truth of his words?
She seems more inclined to romance, likening the broken down mill to a 'castle'.
She also tries to draw Nick into a shared past, referring to it as 'our ruin'.
Hemingway says she ""loved fishing. She loved fishing with Nick."" The repetition seems to put emphasis on his presence being important to her. Nick says he has taught her everything about fishing. She has learned about it for his sake.
Marjorie is perceptive. She tells Nick he does not have to 'talk silly', and asks him: ""What's really the matter?""
She is very calm and collected throughout the story. She acts with dignity even when being dumped, and when he is snapping at her. When he says that love is not 'fun' anymore, she does not argue or protest. She merely leaves in dignified silence.
Bill is Nick's friend. Hemingway uses him to show what Nick is feeling, instead of telling us directly.
Bill knows that Nick is upset. When Nick tells him to 'go away', Bill moves a little way away, but remains in calling distance.
At the end, Bill's attitude to the picnic basket and fishing rods is very relaxed and casual - highlighting the tension in Nick's behaviour towards both earlier in the story.

Floods can cause damage to homes and possessions as well as disruption to communications. However, flooding can also have positive impacts on an area.
Flooding deposits fine silt (alluvium) onto the floodplain, making it very fertile and excellent for agriculture. People living on or near floodplains may rely upon regular flooding to help support their farming and therefore provide food.

2476,"will ask you to look at the relationships between the characters, their feelings or problems. You could also be asked to write about how characters are presented by Doris Lessing, the writer, or the methods she uses. Whatever you are asked to do, make sure you read the question very carefully and spend some time planning your answer.
One important thing to remember is that these questions might look very different but they often cover very similar ground. For instance, if you are going to write about the old man, you need to show how the writer presents him. Or if you are writing about the problems a character faces, you should also look at their relationships with other characters in the story.
The other thing to remember is that there are a lot of different ways to answer the same question. You do not have to include things in a fixed order.
It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters and themes.
It is also useful to include a personal reaction. This shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied someone else's ideas. For instance, you might feel sympathetic to the old man's situation, or feel he has no right to try to control Alice as he does.
In addition, try to include short quotes in your answer. The previous sections have plenty of examples, like using in a single word:
When he lets the pigeon escape he smiles 'proudly' at his granddaughter.
You can also use a short phrase, such as:
She stares, does 'not smile' and is 'wide-eyed, and pale' with 'tears shivering off her face.
Many people make the mistake of regurgitating numerous sentences, or even complete paragraphs, from the story. There is no need for this. It wastes time and does not provide a focus to your answer. Instead, look for a specific point and the exact word or words to illustrate it. Next, we will look at an example these techniques.
The old man is clearly the main focus of
. He is the first character we meet, and the one we know most about. For instance, we find out he lives with his daughter and her family, and how important his pigeons are to him.
Lessing also writes the story mainly from his point of view. For instance, we are told his thoughts, such as thinking about how his other granddaughters were 'transformed' by marriage and became 'serious young matrons' rather than girls who doted on their grandfather. In this way, the old man is shown to be rather selfish - he is thinking more about himself than the happiness of others in his family. This is most clearly shown when he asks his daughter about Alice and if they can 'keep her a bit longer'.
This is a good start - it keeps to the point and does not waste time retelling the entire story. It also includes short examples to make each point clearer.
The word 'keeping' might strike us as rather odd, because it is usually reserved for animals, not your children or grandchildren. However, Lessing draws several comparisons between particular characters and animals, in particular the pigeons. I especially liked the old man's fingers 'curling like claws into his palms', because it made me think he was becoming just like his birds. It also indicates that his quiet rage is building up as he starts to speak to Alice.
Alice seems to be the one the old man loves the most, but also despises. At times he is very rude to her, even calling her an 'impudent little bit of rubbish'. Yet it is obvious to me that he loves her deeply and can hardly bear to see her leave. For instance, he almost instantly regrets being rude to her, and starts to cry when he learns she is going to marry Steven.
Lessing seems to use contrasts like this throughout the story. For example, the behaviour of the old man and Lucy is very effectively portrayed. The old man is angry, stamps his feet and shouts like a child, while his daughter is able to humour him, and even 'croons' like one of his pigeons to calm him down.
This is only the start of the task. There is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction. It continues to treat each point fairly briefly, but manages to refer to the plot, language, relationships and themes. It also includes some of the writer's personal thoughts, giving a wide-ranging and detailed discussion of how the old man is presented in the story.

5266,"A lot of everyday items are made from polymers. Many of these polymers are not biodegradable - microbes cannot digest them and they take a long time to break down. Polymers are usually disposed of by burying them in landfill sites or burning them in incinerators. These methods of disposal cause environmental problems, and waste valuable resources.
The properties of polymers depend on the structure and bonding found in their molecules. Smart materials such as Gore-Tex have more useful properties than other polymers.
Polymers are large molecules formed from many identical smaller molecules (monomers).
. Addition polymers are formed from alkenes. For example:
ethene can polymerise to form polyethene, which is also called polythene
a typical use of polythene is for a plastic shopping bag or plastic bottle
a typical use of polystyrene is for insulation and protective packaging
Some polymers are not made from alkene monomers. These are called condensation polymers. Nylon and polyesters are like this. They can be drawn into very fine fibres and woven into cloth for clothing. Often, natural fibres such as cotton are mixed with nylon or polyester fibres to make a soft but hard-wearing cloth.
One of the useful properties of polymers is that they are unreactive, so they are suitable for storing food and chemicals safely. Unfortunately, this property makes it difficult to dispose of polymers. They are often buried in landfill sites or incinerated - burned.
Waste polymers are disposed of in landfill sites. This uses up valuable land, and suitable sites often fill up quickly.
Polymers release a lot of heat energy when they burn. This energy can be used to heat homes or generate electricity. But there are problems with incineration. Carbon dioxide is produced, which adds to global warming. Toxic gases are also produced, unless the polymers are incinerated at high temperatures.
Polymers have recycling symbols like this one for PVC to show what they are
Many polymers can be recycled. This reduces disposal problems and the amount of crude oil used. But first the different polymers must be separated from each other. This can be difficult and expensive.
Most polymers, including poly(ethene) and poly(propene), are not biodegradable. This means microorganisms cannot break them down, so they may last for many years in rubbish dumps. However, it is possible to include chemicals that cause the polymer to break down more quickly. Carrier bags and refuse bags made from degradable polymers are already available.
Nylon has some desirable properties. It does not let ultraviolet light pass through it, and it is:
Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.
Gore-Tex has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.
Teflon is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.
Gore-Tex fabric is a sandwich of materials
Structure and properties of polymers - higher
Strong covalent bonds join atoms to each other in individual polymer molecules. Weak intermolecular forces attract polymer molecules towards each other. The properties of solid materials like polymers depend on:
the strength of the forces between these molecules
A polymer will melt when the intermolecular forces are overcome. The stronger the forces, the more energy is needed to break them, and the higher the materials melting point.
Many polymers, such as poly(ethene), contain long molecules that lie side by side. These can uncoil and slide past each other, making the material flexible. Long polymer chains have stronger forces of attraction than shorter ones: they make stronger materials.
Cross-linking is where the polymer chains are chemically joined together in places, by covalent bonds. The polymer molecules cannot slide over each other so easily. This makes materials tougher and less flexible, and they cannot be easily stretched. Cross-linking also gives materials high melting points.
Vulcanised rubber has cross-links. Its polymer molecules are cross-linked by sulfur atoms. It is tough but flexible, and used for making tyres.

There are two key pieces of evidence for Big Bang theory. Theses are
You may have noticed that when an ambulance or police car goes past, its siren is high-pitched as it comes towards you, then becomes low-pitched as it goes away. This effect, where there is a change in frequency and wavelength, is called the Doppler effect. It happens with any wave source that moves relative to an observer.
This happens with light too. Our sun contains helium. We know this because there are black lines in the spectrum of the light from the sun, where helium has absorbed light. These lines form the absorption spectrum for helium.
When we look at the spectrum of a distant star, the absorption spectrum is there, but the pattern of lines has moved towards the red end of the spectrum, as you can see below.
This is called red shift. It is a change in frequency of the position of the lines.
Astronomers have found that the further from us a star is the more its light is red shifted. This tells us that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and that the further a galaxy is the faster it is moving away. Since we cannot assume that we have a special place in the universe this is evidence for a generally expanding universe. It suggests that everything is moving away from everything else. The Big Bang theory says that this expansion started billions of years ago with an explosion.
Scientists discovered that there are microwaves coming from every direction in space. Big Bang theory says this is energy created at the beginning of the universe, just after the Big Bang, and that has been travelling through space ever since.
A satellite called COBE has mapped the background microwave radiation of the universe as we see it. Big Bang theorists are still working on the interpretation of this evidence.
A summary of some of the evidence of the Big Bang and its interpretation
The light from other galaxies is red-shifted.
The other galaxies are moving away from us.
The further away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.
The most likely explanation is that the whole universe is expanding. This supports the theory that the start of the universe could have been from a single explosion.
The relatively uniform background radiation is the remains of energy created just after the Big Bang.

Traditionally women have a sacred role - they bear children, run the home and take responsibility for their childrens Jewish upbringing. The woman passes on Jewish values and it is because of the mothers Jewish faith (not the fathers) that a child is born Jewish.
While Jewish law excuses women from some religious duties (eg, they dont have to wear the

Progressive Jews (which includes Jews of both liberal and reform traditions) think that this attitude is wrong and treat women equally in all respects, so they too can become rabbis (Jewish teacher) if they choose to do so.

4239,"Memory is improved through repetition. If we repeat things, especially over a long period of time, we are much more likely to remember them using our long-term memory.
A strong stimulus - including colour, light, smell or sound - also helps us to remember things.
For example, which of these are you more likely to remember?
Incident 1: The sound of a car, braking suddenly, to avoid a cat crossing the road.
Incident 2: Your mother asking you to pick up a loaf of bread on your way home.
You are more likely to remember Incident 1, as the stimulus is stronger.
We are more likely to remember information if we can either see or make a pattern out of it.

245,"They have got to pay back the money they borrowed.
Jamie needs to give far more explanation. He should use business terms and show he understands what fixed costs are.
They have to pay Ashley's father each month, as well as the loan from the bank. They may have other costs, like the cleaning materials they buy to run their business.
Morag started her answer quite well, mentioning both loans which, as fixed costs, have to be repaid. The cleaning materials, however, form part of the variable, rather than the fixed costs.
Costs which have to be paid, regardless of the level of output, are called fixed costs. Martin and Ashley have the fixed costs of repaying Ashley's dad 50 a month, and they probably pay bank interest on the loan. Their pay is a fixed cost. They might want to consider paying themselves piece rate, to help their business survive. The road tax and insurance on the van are fixed costs they have to pay. They have already bought the van, so this is a sunk cost, and no longer a fixed cost they have to pay.
Rani's answer would probably get a A grade. She has answered the question well, and has shown she can use business terms like fixed costs. She has thought about the pay they only receive when they have the business, and correctly counted it as a fixed cost.

3485,"There are four main types of industrial production -
production - which have progressively larger scales of operation. ICT is now important in virtually every type of commercial design and production, with different types of computer-control of design and making processes grouped together as
Computer Aided Design - a system which helps the user produce accurate drawings.
The different production methods may have different design requirements, but most commercial designers have three roles: a
relating to the performance of a product - its 'fitness for purpose'
relating to shape, style, colour, pattern and other aspects of a product's visual appeal
role and an organisational role. Designers need to be aware of the standards and conventions which regulate industrial design practices.
There are four main types of industrial production methods:
is when only one product is made at a time. As every product is different, one-off production is labour intensive. Products may be made by hand or a combination of hand and machine methods.
is when a small quantity of identical products are made - from two up to about 100. Batch production may also use a lot of labour, but jigs and templates are used to aid production. Batches of the product can be made as often as required. Often the machines can be easily changed to produce a batch of a different product.
production is when hundreds of identical products are made, usually on a production line. Mass production often involves the assembly of a number of sub-assemblies of individual components. Some parts may be bought from other companies. There is usually some automation of tasks (eg by using
the use of computers to control cutting and shaping machines. CNC for short
machines) and this enables a smaller number of workers to ouput more products.
production is when many thousands of copies of identical products are made. The difference between this and mass production is that the production line is kept running 24 hours a day, seven days a week to maximise production and eliminate the extra costs of starting and stopping the production process. The process is highly automated and few workers are required.
Computer-aided design and making are nowadays commonplace in industry. ICT is most often used in mass production, as computer control makes it possible to produce many identical items very quickly. But ICT is also useful in small batch and even one-off work, as computer control also enables complicated shapes to be produced more accurately than by hand.
The box summarises the many roles of ICT in industry:
Data can be stored electronically and retrieved easily.
Designs can be modelled on-screen and viewed from any angle.
Reaction to outside forces, such as wind flow and pressure can be modelled.
""Zoom"" facilities can allow for the whole product or one detail to be easily seen.
Libraries of standard components can be stored electronically and integrated into new designs.
Control sequences can be simulated before working on the actual material.
CNC (Computer Numerical Control) manufacturing is usually more accurate.
You need to know and understand a number of terms used to describe aspects of ICT in design and production. They are:
Different production methods - eg, one-off, batch, and mass or continuous production - have somewhat different design requirements, related to the differences between types of product, client expectation, and the scale of operation. In particular there are differences in the relationship between the designer and the
person or organisation that wants a product manufactured - eg a retailer.
, who gives the designer his or her brief.
individual. Individual products may be made by hand or a combination of hand and machine methods. As every product is different, one-off production is labour intensive.
production the designer is frequently the maker as well. The client is usually the end-user of the product, and will have high expectations about the quality of the product. The designer will nearly always have a direct relationship with the client, so it is essential that the designer is fully conversant with the end-user's requirements.
production method for making a small quantity (between two and about 100) identical products.
production the process of designing is more formalised, but the number of people involved may still be quite small. The client may be the user, but is more likely to be another company who sell the product. The designer will not necessarily have any contact with the end-user of the product.

production method for making many thousands of identical products. The difference between this and mass production is that the production line is kept running 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
flow production the processes of designing and manufacturing are much more formal. Making of changes can become slower. There is little or no contact between the designer and the client. The designer is therefore dependent on other people feeding back the end-users' views.

Market research is the gathering of data or information concerning consumer opinions about a product or service

direct mail (ads sent out in the form of leaflets, mail shots, emails and texts)
Industrial design and manufacturing processes of products must conform with the following
formal rules adopted by Parliament and enforced by government

, designed to protect consumers from inferior, misleading or unsafe goods and services:
law which protects consumers where the following are not acting in their interest: monopolies, where businesses have 25 percent of the market, mergers, where two companies plan to join together, and rogue traders, where the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) will take action against persistent offenders. In 2003 the Enterprise Act replaced the Fair Trading Act.
law which protects the public by: prohibiting the manufacture and supply of unsafe goods, making the maker or seller of defective products pay for damage it causes and allows councils to seize or suspend the sale unsafe goods.
law which makes it an offence for a trader to make false or misleading statements about goods or services. The Act carries criminal penalties and is enforced by local authorities' Trading Standards Officers.

2494,"We have already looked at one aspect of language - in the section on
we saw how you could use short quotations as evidence.
We might want to say Don John is an aggressive and angry character. We can then support this view by looking at his language. He says that if he had a mouth he ""would bite"", and that he only has his unhappiness to make use of.
Here we are using two ways to provide evidence: words that are directly from the play are put in quotation marks, for example, ""I am a plain-dealing villain."" The second way is to describe what is said in your own words, for instance, Don John plans to stop Claudio's marriage to Hero. It is often good to combine these methods, perhaps quoting just one word from the play. For instance, Don John despises Claudio and calls him a ""start-up"" (an 'upstart' in modern English).
The one thing you should avoid is using a long quotation. Many students write out whole chunks of the play. This is just like retelling the story - there is no reason for it, and you will not get any marks for it.

5878,"Club dance music of the late 20th and 21st centuries has many different forms, including drum and bass, hip-hop, garage, R and B, trip-hop, house, rave, techno, ambient and europop. You won't have to know all the differences between these styles, but you will need to be able to pick out the main musical elements and comment on the use of technology in GCSE questions.
Club dance music always makes use of technology. In particular :
: where a pattern, usually in the bass or drum part, is repeated constantly.
: where a voice or a sound clip has been processed by a computer to distort it.
, an echo effect on the voice, and
, where the voice is given a synthesised effect.
: a DJ technique where the hand is put on the vinyl disc and moved backwards and forwards on the turntable.
: This is a process on the computer where fast notes are automatically put into time by shifting the note to the nearest (usually) semiquaver. The effect of this is that the music is always completely in time with the beat.
: Where each part of the music (bass, drums, main vocal etc.) is recorded on its own track. It means, for example, that a singer can perform the main vocal and later perform the backing vocal as well (overdubbing).

Video conferencing means using computers to provide a video-link between two or more people. Instead of just talking to someone by telephone, you are able to see them as well.
The following is needed to take part in a video conference call:
a microphone (most webcams have a microphone built-in)
a global network connecting millions of computers
a general term used to describe an application or a program
It is possible to buy a special video conferencing machine just for this purpose.
Meetings can take place without leaving the office.
Travel costs and the time taken to travel can be reduced significantly.
Meetings can be called instantly worldwide with little notice.
Delegates can still attend meetings even if they are physically unable to.
May not be as productive as a discussion around a table.
Confidential documents may need to be viewed and signed in person.
There will always be times when you need to be able to meet face to face.

2826,"Compare your answer with the hints below:
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Both poems are about water when it is dangerous. Clarke describes a near-drowning while Heaney describes the savage sea in a storm.
In Clarke's poem the water seems to subtly hide its dangers (e.g. satiny mud blooms in cloudiness) but Heaney recognises its force and violence - the flung spray hits the very windows.
Clarke uses the image of water to question our powers of memory, whereas Heaney uses it to show the power of nature.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Like Heaney, Whitman describes a violent storm at sea.
Like Clarke, however, Whitman hints at the supernatural. His references to demoniac laughter and the savage trinity seem on the surface more threatening than the fairytale references in Clarke's poem.
We question the endings of both poems. We wonder about the dim weird forms that Whitman sees and about the lost things that Clarke imagines drowned in the lake.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Yet for Clare, the water is innocent. It is part of the beauty of summer as it supports the wildlife: marsh marigolds and water lilies, moor hens and insects. Clarke also suggests the beauty of the water (e.g. long green silk), but for her it could be hiding something potentially sinister, while for Clare it is simply the clear lake.
The sonnet form suggests Clare's love of the water, while Clarke's use of alternating stanzas and half rhyme suggests an uncertainty. She cannot be sure what is under the water; she cannot be sure of her memory.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

In your presentation exam you should speak for about one minute in Irish on a topic you have prepared, then you will be asked questions in Irish about what you have said. You are usually allowed to take a prompt card into the exam with you with five brief points on it and as many pictures as you like, to help you remember what to say.
A good way to structure your presentation so you include a variety of tenses plus an opinion is to start with

3430,"Website designs vary from basic ones set up by users as a hobby to sophisticated designs that represent large international companies. Before designing a website, you should take a look at other websites to help you decide how your webpages should look.
You should also read the project brief carefully. Make sure you do exactly what the examiners want. There is no point in doing any more - if they say five pages, only do five pages.
Normally, on a website there is a title bar at the top, a menu on the left and then the main information appears in the big space on the right.
Stick to a simple, clear page layout
Try to avoid flashy things like sound, scrolling banners and animated text/graphics. These might look 'cool' to you, but, unless they are really suitable for the purpose and audience, they are more likely to lose you marks than earn you marks.
The examiners will be looking for a consistent house style throughout each publication you produce.
A good example of this can be seen on the BBC GCSE Bitesize website. GCSE Bitesize uses the same font, sizes and layout throughout the site. This gives a much more professional impression than constantly chopping and changing between different pages.
Ideally, you should come up with a few ideas for fonts, layouts and colour schemes and then test them on members of your target audience. Remember to include details of this testing when writing your reviews and evaluations. Always remember the publication has to appeal to your target audience!
Have consistent left-hand navigation on each page.
Don't have too much text on one page - people don't like scrolling down pages.
Break text up using bullet points, short paragraphs and tables. It's more difficult to read text on screen than it is on paper.
Keep graphics to a minimum. Graphics increase the page weight and increase the time pages take to download.
Take a look at the image below. It's a classic example of a badly designed website! Make sure you avoid using garish colours and patterned backgrounds.
Bright colours and poor quality photographs are not very attractive
Here are some important rules to stick to when writing text for a website:
Stick to a single font colour and size on your website. Try to stick to black text on a white or light-coloured background.
Arial size 12 is easy to read on websites. Try not to use a smaller sized font.
Remember the intended audience. Always test your website on users.
Do not use underlining on webpages. Users will think it is a hyperlink and get confused when it doesn't link to another website.
Keep it simple. Be consistent across the whole website.
Webpages need file names. This allows you and visitors to your website to identify each webpage.
There are several rules you need to stick to when naming webpage files.
Use correct file extension names, eg .htm .html or .shtml.
Do not use symbols, eg + & % in file names.
Do no put spaces in your file or folder name. Use either dashes (-) or underscores (_)
Name your files sensibly. Video_intro.shtml, video_movie.shtm are easier to identify than page1.shtml, page2.shtml etc.
Webpage file names should mean something to you and the user
Keep html, image, flash and other media files in separate folders.
Put images in a folder called images, put audio files in a folder called audio.
There should be an index.shtml file in the site folder.
Do not create folders that contain too many or too few files.
All screen-based publications are likely to need some images. The things to keep in mind when selecting images are:
For the current eportfolio, you are only allowed to use jpg, png, gif and tif. You may need to use a graphics package to convert the graphic to a suitable format.
If they are copyright images, you will actually lose marks for putting them in (you could email the person who holds the copyright, but this can take months to sort out).
If not, use a graphics package to re-size or crop them. Editing inside Powerpoint or a website package is likely to spoil the way the graphic appears.
Have you updated your list of sources?
Each time you add a graphic to a publication, you should update your list of sources.
Can you use some of your own graphics?
It's a good idea to create some graphics. This could be with a digital camera or by doing some original artwork on the computer.
How much memory do the graphics take up?
Remember your eportfolio has a maximum size so keep an eye on individual graphics to make sure they are not too big.
At all times, make sure the graphic is suitable for the intended audience and purpose.
Before creating a website, make sure you know the difference between relative and absolute links.
These point to where the file you want to link to is saved. For example, Jeff is saving his files on his school network. He has a file called intro.html for which the absolute link is:
Look at the image below to see the folders in which intro.html sits.
The problem with absolute links is that the examiner will not have access to your schools server. When your folder and files are copied across to the exam boards server, any absolute links will not work.
For example, Jeff hands in his folder called
to the examiner. In this folder is another folder called
. The examiner, therefore, has access to everything stored within the jeffd201 folder. Now look at the absolute link again - everything that has been handed into the examiner is in bold:
The part that is not in bold represents the school's server, which the examiner
Therefore, you must use relative hyperlinks (the part in bold) when linking your webpages together.
As you have read above, an example of a relative link in Jeff's folder is:
This hyperlink just describes where the file (intro.html) is relative to the current file  in this case, in a subfolder called webpages.
Relative links make it easier to type hyperlinks  youre less likely to make errors. Files can be moved from a local system (your school server) to another server (the examination board).
Remember that the examiner will not have access to your school server. Never refer to the server, or absolute address when you use hyperlinks.
Now look at the image below taken from the examiner's computer. Notice how Jeff's files and folders have been copied on to the exam board's server.
The absolute link for Jeff's file has now changed to:
But notice how the relative link is still the same:
It is crucial to thoroughly test your presentations and websites, as well as all the publications you produce.
First, check that all the links work. It is best to copy the website or presentation onto another device (like a memory stick or CD) and try it out away from the school network - this will show if you have used absolute hyperlinks by mistake. All the links must work before you submit your work for marking and moderation.
Secondly, test your publication with members of the target audience.
Listen carefully and improve your publication accordingly.
One good way of doing this is to prepare a checklist for the reviewer to fill in. Include questions like:
Was the information at the right level?
Finally, write the results of your tests in the review section of your eportfolio. Remember to say how well your publication meets the needs of the audience and include ideas on how it can be improved.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a computer language. HTML is used to make webpages. Many software packages such as Dreamweaver and Homesite allow you to build webpages and save them as html files.
The websites listed below offer HTML tutorials and advice for building your first website.
Practise your HTML in this online text editor with examples and tutorials.
This site is a bit patronising but is a good source of basic information
Images on websites can improve the look and style of the page. However, you must be careful to save images in the correct format.
The two main formats for web images are gif and jpg.
These are used for images that have only a few colours, such as line drawings, text and logos.
Images with few colours should be saved as a gif file
These are used for images or photographs that include details and more colours.
If you save a photo or graphic in the incorrect format, how the image looks will be affected. Look at the images below. When the fish photo is saved in a gif format, colours and details are lost.
When the bitesize graphic is saved incorrectly as a jpg, unwanted colours appear and the looks less sharp. Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Cropping allows you to select the part of the image you want to show. It's likely that you may take a photograph or find an image that is too big and you only want to use one part of the image.
To crop an image, you can use image editing software such as Word, Photoshop or Paintshop.
1. Crop this image to include only the penguin.

2. Select the crop tool in a picture editing package.
3. Use the crop tool to outline the part of the image you want to keep. Adjust the size of the area to be cropped by dragging on the boxes on the selection border.
