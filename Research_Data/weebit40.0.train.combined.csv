0,338,"Animals that are too old to perform in zoos or circuses now have special places to live. They can live in retirement homes. Both Nevada and California have special places for retired animals. The animals have plenty of room to run and play. The animals have pools to swim in and trees to climb. Volunteers take care of the animals.
All kinds of animals live in the retirement homes. At one home, an ostrich and a buffalo spend lots of time together!

1,510,"Goats are helping to prevent forest fires.
Goats are doing their part to help prevent forest fires. Goats eat tall grass, weeds, and small branches. Those plants often spread forest fires in places such as California and Florida.
Many states are using goats to eat plants on mountains and in fields close to people's houses. By eating plants in those areas, the goats leave a clear patch of land. That way, if a fire starts in the forest, it will not be able to spread to where people live.
In 1999, there were about 94,000 forest fires in the United States.
Forest fires in 1999 burned nearly 9,500 square miles of land in the United States.
Most forest fires are started by people. People are sometimes careless with cigarettes and campfires.
Lightning is another cause of forest fires. When the forest is very dry and lightning strikes it, a fire can start.

3,20,"Tornado season has started in the United States. A
is a powerful, spinning wind. It is also known as a twister.
Most tornadoes last fewer than 15 minutes. During that time, a twister can travel across a large area of land and destroy everything in its path.
The strong winds in some tornadoes reach speeds of up to 300 miles per hour. Those winds can toss cars and other objects high into the air.
Tornadoes can happen any time of the year. However, they are most common from March through July.
A tornado can destroy homes and trees.
Most tornadoes start as thunderstorms. During those storms, heavy rain and lightning are common. Large
, or ball-shaped pieces of ice, may also fall.
Large thunderstorm clouds appear in the sky. The clouds become dark. Thunder can be heard.
Warm and cold air meet. Air rises from the ground to the clouds. If the rising air starts to spin, a funnel-shaped cloud can form.
The funnel-shaped cloud spins faster. When the bottom of the cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.
As the tornado travels across the ground, it picks up anything in its way.

How might Native Americans give thanks today?
Thanksgiving is about more than the food.
Joseph Bruchac (JB) is a Native American writer and storyteller.

My family gathers for a big meal. We say a few words in our native language of Abenaki around the table to express our thanks.
What does Thanksgiving mean to Native Americans?
Native people give thanks for all things. Different groups have many thanksgiving festivals during the year.
Native Americans were one of the first to have a fall harvest festival. Squanto and other Native Americans taught the Pilgrims how to survive in a new land. The Pilgrims shared their first harvest with the Native Americans.

7,381,"Stay safe while having a super summer.
Grab your beach towel and sunglasses! Summer is just around the corner. It starts on June 21. For most kids, that means more time to play outside. Experts say that more injuries occur during summer. Follow these tips to make sure you have a safe summer.
Many kids will spend hours playing outside in the summer sun. Be careful, though. The suns rays can be harmful. They can cause damage to your skin and eyes.
If you are out in the sun, be sure to wear sunscreen. Experts say it should have a
(SPF) of 30 or higher. The SPF number lets you know how much the sunscreen protects your skin from the sun. Make sure you rub it in everywhere your skin is showing.
You should also wear a hat and sunglasses. They protect against the suns harmful rays. Better yet, play in the shade!
What is one way to beat the heat? Splash in a pool! Just be sure to follow water-safety rules. Always swim with a grown-up watching you. You should also swim with a buddy. A buddy can tell others if someone needs help. If you dont know how to swim, stay in the
end. Something that is shallow is not deep.
Biking and in-line skating are great ways to get exercise. To stay wheel safe, always wear a helmet. It protects your head and brain if you fall. If you are in-line skating, also wear wrist guards, elbow pads, and kneepads.
What other ways can you stay safe this summer?

8,400,"Many kids love listening to music on their MP3 players. However, portable music players may not be good for the ears. Health experts say the music players may lead to hearing loss. Why? They send loud sounds straight into the ears. Hearing loss is also more likely if you listen to loud music for hours at a time.
Experts say kids need to give their ears a rest. They warn that at least 12 out of 100 children are at risk of losing some of their hearing.
How do you know if your music is too loud? If you are wearing your earphones, you should be able to hear someone talking to you from a few feet away.
You can also ask friends if they can hear the music from your earphones. If they say yes, turn it down!
What else can you do to protect your hearing?

10,542,"Scientists have identified a new dinosaur. It is the smallest dinosaur yet to be found in North America. The dinosaur was smaller than a house cat.
This drawing shows what the tiny dinosaur may have looked like.
The tiny dinosaur had very sharp claws and teeth. It was a carnivore. Scientists say it most likely hunted insects and small animals.
The dinosaurs fossils were actually found almost 30 years ago. They were put in a drawer for safekeeping. A scientist took the fossils out a few years ago. He decided to study them. That led him to make the discovery.

21,52,"Lava is flowing out of a volcano in Hawaii. The volcano is named Kilauea (kee-lah-WAY-ah). It is one of the worlds most active volcanoes. It has been erupting for more than 25 years!
Scientists are keeping a close watch on Kilauea. They want to make sure people living nearby are safe.
The lava from Kilauea goes into the Pacific Ocean. The lava cools. Then, it hardens into rock. The rock forms new land over time.
Many people visit Kilauea each year. This is one of the few places in the world where you can get really close to an actively erupting volcano, says scientist Jim Kauahikaua (koh-wah-hee-KOH-wah). Its really cool.

22,83,"Deitte (DEE-et) Curry's dog was having trouble breathing. Doctors said the 12-year-old dog was sick. The dog had a weak heart and needed an operation. Doctors put a
in the dog's heart. A pacemaker is a small device that helps the heart beat evenly.
The dog's pacemaker came from a woman who had died. She wanted her pacemaker to help an animal. A pacemaker cannot be used again in a person, but a pacemaker can be used again in an animal.
The dog is healthy now that it has the pacemaker. ""He's as good as new,"" Deitte said. ""He's a puppy all over again!""

23,256,"Do you have a fire escape plan?
That is the theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week. It lasts from October 7 to 13. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) plans the week to teach kids and their families about fire safety.
The NFPA wants to sound the alarm about the need for a home fire escape plan. They want people across the country to practice their fire escape plans this month. The group is calling the project the Great American Fire Drill.
Only one out of four Americans has planned and practiced a fire escape plan, says the NFPA. ""It's important for everyone in your family to know how to escape in case of a fire,"" says NFPA spokesperson Judy Comoletti.

24,114,"What do birds and people have in common? Dreaming, scientists say. People often dream of events that happened during the day. Scientists say birds dream about singing.
Scientists attached a special device to the head of a bird called the zebra finch. Scientists watched how the bird's brain acted while it was singing. Then they watched how the bird's brain behaved while it slept. The bird's brain acted the same way!
Scientists say the zebra finch probably dreams about singing in order to remember its songs.

25,376,"Every penny counts at Frankton Elementary School in Frankton, Indiana. Next month, students will take part in a contest called Jar Wars. Kids will drop money into jars. The grade that raises the most money will win a pizza party.
All the money will be donated to help save tropical rain forests. Why? People are cutting down rain forest trees to make room for farms and roads. Many plants and animals are in danger of dying out.
Last year, the school raised $891. This year, the goal is to raise even more.
Teacher Ken Kakasuleff came up with the idea for Jar Wars 16 years ago. He says, Earth is our home. We feel proud to protect it.

26,356,"Winter is a baby bottlenose dolphin who lost her tail in an accident. Scientists want to help her by giving her a
(prahs-THEE-suss). That is a human-made part to replace a missing body part.
In spite of her injury, Winter behaves like a can-do dolphin. She has learned to swim without her tail, by moving from side to side. If the new tail works, she will be able to move up and down in the water, the way other dolphins swim.
""Theres never been a dolphin like her,"" says Dana Zucker, an officer of the Clearwater Aquarium in Florida, where Winter lives.

. An orchard has rows and rows of apple trees. The trees change during each of the four seasons of the year.
During winter, apple trees rest. By winter, they have lost their leaves. Their branches are
in the fall. That means they are fully grown. The apples are ready to be picked and eaten.

, or grow flowers. When the flowers fall off, small apples begin to grow.

. Follow the steps below to learn how a sheet of metal becomes a pile of new coins.
 Large sheets of metal go through a machine that punches out circle shapes called
. The blanks are heated to make them soft. Then they are put in machines where they are washed, dried, and polished.
 The blanks go through another machine that raises a tiny rim around the edge on each side. The rim protects the coins design. It also makes the coins easier to stack on top of one another.
. It presses both sides of each blank with pictures, words, and numbers.
 Workers check the design on each coin. A machine called a
makes sure each coin is the right shape. If a coin is not perfect, it does not leave the U.S. Mint.
drops the coins into large cloth bags. The bags are taken to banks, where people get the shiny, new coins!
Why must each coin be perfect before it leaves the U.S. Mint?

35,260,"Cockroaches are not social insects, but they do live in groups. Scientists wanted to learn more about how cockroaches make group decisions. To do that, they created tiny robots that smelled like real roaches.
Cockroaches like to rest together in dark places. The scientists put the robots with a group of roaches. Soon, the robots and roaches were all resting together in a dark place.
Then the robots were placed in a light area. When the roaches saw the robots, they ended up resting in the light area too.
What did scientists learn from the study? A few cockroaches can change how the whole group behaves.
The robotic cockroaches did not look like real insects. However, the real roaches did not notice. That is because scientists made sure that the robots smelled like roaches.

36,189,"You probably know that cigarette smoking makes people sick. But did you know that smoking hurts the environment?
Sometimes people drop cigarette butts on the ground. Many beaches in the United States are littered with cigarette butts. When beach cleanups are held, cigarette butts are picked up more often than any other kind of trash.
Cigarette butts can be dangerous. Cigarettes have hundreds of poisons in them. Scientists worry that the poisons could pollute the ocean water.
Cigarette butts can also harm animals. Seabirds will try to eat cigarette butts. The birds think the butts are food. The butts get stuck in the birds' stomachs and make them sick.
Every day, about 3,000 kids start smoking.
The average age a kid starts smoking is 13.
About 46 million adults in the United States smoke.
Smoking-related illnesses kill about 500,000 people each year.
Smoking one cigarette takes about seven minutes off the smoker's life.
On November 16, kids across the United States will scream their lungs out. That's when the Great American SmokeScream will happen. The kids will tell people not to smoke.
You need healthy lungs to breathe and to scream loudly. Keep your lungs healthy by not smoking. Use your healthy lungs to tell other people not to smoke.

40,186,"Should Native American names and mascots be allowed in college sports?
Football fans cheer as a student rides a horse down the field. The student is dressed as Chief Osceola, a famous leader of the Seminole tribe. In one hand, the student holds a flaming spear. As he throws it into the ground, the crowd goes wild.
Some find Florida State University's mascot doesn't respect the real Chief Osceola.
That tradition takes place before every football game at Florida State University (FSU). The NCAA recently tried to end the tradition. The NCAA is the group that oversees college sports. It made a rule that sports teams can't use Native American names or
after the regular season. A mascot is a symbol that represents a sports team.
Some members of the Seminole tribe think the rule is unfair. They believe that FSU honors their traditions. Tribe members designed the mascot's costume, they say. They add that the student chosen as the mascot has to study the tribe's culture to earn that honor.
The NCAA decided to let FSU keep its tradition. However, the rule remains for at least 17 other schools.
Native Americans are the people who first settled in North and South America. Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today. Each tribe has its own history and culture.
Other Native Americans say that teams that use Native American mascots do not honor their culture. They think using those mascots supports
A stereotype is an idea that a group of people is alike in a certain way. It may be untrue or only partly true.
""It is not respectful to parade around in war paint and feathers,"" John Sanchez told
. Sanchez is a member of the Yaqui/Apache tribe. ""This is not honoring; it is making fun of.""
Do you think Native American team names and mascots should be allowed? Why or why not?

41,403,"Sure, scooters can be fun to ride, but Jessica Liddicoat has an idea to make them even better. The third grader from Tucson, Ariz., wants to add a kite and a drink holder!
The young inventor and her classmates are building toys for a school project. First, the students visited a local toy shop to learn what makes a good toy. Then, they came up with their own ideas for toys. Next, students drew

42,653,"Sure, you've heard of horseshoes, but what about dog shoes? This spring, some hounds will be sporting new doggy footwear, but it's not a fashion statement.

, or stop, the animals from being injured. Police say the dogs cut their paws on broken glass during missions. The Dsseldorf unit includes German and Belgian shepherds.
""I'm not sure they like [wearing the shoes], but they'll have to get used to it,"" says police spokesperson Andre Hartwich.
Police will train the pooches to wear the shoes so the animals are protected. ""Now we just have to teach the dogs how to tie their shoes,"" jokes Hartwich.

43,270,"The world's tallest living man recently saved the lives of two sick dolphins. The dolphins swallowed plastic from their pool at an aquarium in China.
Veterinarians, or animal doctors, couldn't figure out how to remove the plastic. Surgery would have hurt the dolphins too much. The doctors had the idea to ask for help from Bao Xishun from Mongolia. Bao is 7 feet 9 inches tall. His arms are about 3? feet long!

44,626,"U.S. cities jump on the bicycle path.
A bicycle boom is headed to a city near you! More Americans than ever are hitting the road on two-wheelers.
About 1.7 million U.S. residents use bicycles as their
or main, way to get around. The number of riders has nearly doubled since 2000. That is according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The spike in bikes may be thanks to the work of U.S. cities. From San Francisco to Boston, cities are becoming more bicycle-friendly. Some towns are adding more bike lanes. That makes
easier for cyclists. To commute is to travel regularly from one place to another, such as school or work.
Officials are adding more bike lanes in Washington, D.C.
the length of traffic lights. To alter is to change. That helps riders stay safe. Longer lights give them more time to cross busy streets. The nations capital also has a bike-sharing program. Riders can borrow bicycles at one location. Then they can return them in another part of town.
U.S. officials hope the new projects mean people will use their bicycles more and their cars less. Fewer cars on the road can help cut pollution. Thats because driving cars gives off harmful gases.
Riding bicycles helps more than just the environment, though. Cycling is a great way for people to stay active and fit, explains Meghan Cahill. She is a spokesperson for the League of American Bicyclists.
Cities will continue to increase their bike-friendliness, she told
Officials realize that bicycle-friendly cities [have] healthier and happier citizens.
Take a spin around the map to learn about some U.S. cycling programs.
Note: Alaska and Hawaii are not shown.
A program in Portland donates bicycles to people who cannot afford to buy their own.
More than 30 schools in Boulder encourage students to walk or cycle to school along safe paths.
Houston has set up 345 miles of bike paths so that people can cycle to school and work.
Lawmakers are working to add more bicycle lanes in New York City and the rest of the state.
What are some other ways people commute to school or work?

45,318,"Rosa Parks is arrested and fingerprinted again in February 1956 for breaking segregation laws.
Fifty years ago, the courageous act of Rosa Parks changed history.
For years, Rosa Parks stood up to unfair laws against black people. Then on December 1, 1955, she changed the history of the United States forever. Rosa Parks was riding a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and was told to give up her seat to a white passenger. When she refused, she was arrested and taken to jail.
At that time, states in the South were
by law. The law kept black people from having the same rights as white people. Black people were forced to sit in the back of city buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, water fountains, and other public facilities.
After Parks was arrested, thousands of people refused to ride the city buses in Montgomery. The
was led by Martin Luther King Jr. and lasted for more than a year. It was a success. In 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the bus segregation law was illegal.
December 1 marks the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest for not giving up her seat. On that day, people across the United States will honor this important time in history.
Special events will take place in Montgomery, where the equal rights movement began. As part of the day's events, hundreds of kids will march to remember the bus boycott.
""Never again should we foster hate or distrust based on one's skin color,"" says event spokesperson Kenneth Mullinax. The children will march ""as a pledge to treat everyone with equal love,"" he told
""Rosa Parks's not giving up her seat on the bus shows how important it is to stand up for what we believe in,"" says Mullinax.
Today, people can step aboard the bus that Rosa Parks made famous. It is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan. The bus has been restored to look as it did in 1955.
Why should people stand up for what they believe in?

46,335,"Asian elephants are running out of space and time. Their
or the place where they usually live, has been shrinking. Scientists warn that Asian elephants could disappear if nothing is done to help them.
In Asia, humans and elephants are fighting over land. The forests where many elephants live are being cut down by loggers. The land that elephants live on is also being turned into farms. Many elephants have been killed when they cross into farms looking for food.
Scientists say the fight for land between elephants and humans is hurting both sides. Elephants kill around 300 people each year in India. In the last ten years, the elephant population in Vietnam has dropped from about 2,000 to fewer than 100.
Scientists for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) say there are about 35,000 to 50,000 Asian elephants left in the wild. That is a
or drop, from the 100,000 Asian elephants that were in the wild in 1900.
The map shows Asian countries. Elephants in these countries, scientists warn, are in danger of becoming extinct, or dying out.
11 feet tall at the shoulder (male)
9 to 10 feet tall at the shoulder (male)
9 feet tall at the shoulder (female)
8 feet tall at the shoulder (female)
Most males have tusks. If present, female tusks are small.
The WWF is an organization that works to save endangered animals. According to a recent WWF report, many Asian elephants are being killed for their meat, skin, and ivory tusks.
Elizabeth Kemf, a WWF scientist, says that world governments should set aside land for Asian elephants. Efforts to save the Asian elephants are important, she says, because the elephants belong ""not only to Asia, but all the world's people.""
More people live in Asia than on any other continent. How might that affect the Asian elephant population?

How will you celebrate Earth Day on April 22? Thousands of kids and adults around the world will make a splash by taking part in a program called ""Dive Into Earth Day."" They will clean up beaches, help scientists count fish, and learn about ways to protect Earth's waters.
, ""We need to protect our oceans."" Trash thrown on beaches can end up in the ocean and injure or kill marine life. Animals such as fish and sea turtles often mistake trash for food and choke on these items.

50,212,"Its the 200th anniversary of Lincolns birth.
For elementary school students in Idaho, it made cents to collect more than 300,000 pennies. Why? Abraham Lincoln appears on the coin, and the kids needed the money for a big birthday celebration in the 16th U.S. presidents honor.
Kids collect pennies and take part in class projects to remember Lincoln.
Lincoln was born 200 years ago, on Feb. 12, 1809. This month marks the
of his birth. A bicentennial is a 200th anniversary.
The students in Idaho raised money to help
, or move, a statue of Lincoln to a park near the Idaho Capitol. The project is one of hundreds of events across the country being held to celebrate Lincolns birthday.
In Washington, D.C., officials will honor Lincoln with a ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial. That is a special statue of the president. In other states, people will attend speeches and plays about the leader.
There are events being planned in all 50 states, David Early told
. He is a spokesperson for the group that has been planning the celebrations. [Lincoln] believed everyone should be treated the same.
Lincoln served as president during the Civil War (18611865). During that war, Southern states tried to break away from the country. They fought for their right to own slaves. Northern states were against owning slaves. Lincoln was also against slavery. In 1863, he signed the Emancipation Proclamation. It helped free most U.S. slaves.
Thats why third grader Morgan Squires, of Gooding, Idaho, was happy to collect pennies for the president.
[Lincoln] was a great leader, Morgan told
State Capitol, White House: Northwind; Cabin: Corbis
Abraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin in Kentucky. He moved to Illinois when he was a young man. There, he worked as a shop owner and a lawyer. Lincoln also served as a lawmaker for Illinois and the country.
In 1842, Lincoln married Mary Todd. Together they had four sons.
Lincoln became the 16th U.S. president in 1861. The Civil War started a few weeks later. Lincoln won reelection in 1864.
The war was coming to an end in April 1865. Lincoln was shot on April 14, while watching a play in Washington, D.C. He died the next day. Lincoln is buried in Springfield, Ill.

51,328,"The world's largest volcano appears to be coming back to life. Scientists are keeping a close watch on it. If the volcano erupts, it could destroy nearby towns.
A giant volcano on the island of Hawaii is beginning to show signs of life, scientists say. The volcano is called
Mauna Loa is Hawaiian for ""Long Mountain."" It is the largest volcano on Earth. The volcano makes up half of the island of Hawaii. Hawaii is one of the islands that make up the state of Hawaii.
Recently, scientists have noticed changes in Mauna Loa. The top of the volcano is growing slightly. Magma is rising into the giant volcano.
is hot, liquid rock beneath Earth's surface.
The last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984. A river of
flowed from the volcano for three weeks. Lava is magma flowing out of a volcano. The lava can reach temperatures of nearly 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit. Lava can burn everything in its path.
Since 1984, many more people have moved to areas around Mauna Loa. They have built homes on the volcano's slopes. If the volcano erupts now, hot lava could destroy those homes.
For now, people should not worry too much about an eruption, experts say. ""We're at a stage where it's months to years, rather than days to weeks"" before the next eruption, said scientist Peter Cervelli. Until then, scientists will continue to keep track of changes in the volcano. They hope to give people lots of warning about future eruptions.
Mauna Loa is a shield volcano. Shield volcanoes form from lava flows. When lava cools, it hardens. The lava builds up and forms a low mountain.
Why is it important for scientists to study volcanoes?

53,422,"On Veterans Day, November 11, Americans honor U.S. veterans. Veterans are men and women who served as soldiers for our country. Veterans Day celebrations include speeches, ceremonies, and parades.
This year is the 50th anniversary of the Korean War. The Korean War started when North Korea invaded South Korea. Both countries are in Asia. Many ceremonies will honor veterans of the Korean War. Those veterans helped South Korea fight the war between 1950 and 1953.
Special Veterans Day services will be held at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. Many U.S. veterans are buried in that cemetery. People are also making plans for ceremonies in cities and towns all across the country. Many people will attend those services to honor our American veterans.

54,221,"Your used wrappers and empty boxes could be more than just garbage. The items could help people in need. Inventor Max Wallack can prove it.
The 12-year-old student from Massachusetts recently invented the Home Dome. It is a small

Maxs invention helped him win the grand prize in the Trash to Treasure contest. That is a nationwide contest for kids. It is organized by the PBS television program
As part of his prize, the inventor met some designers. Together, they built a
of the Home Dome. A prototype is a model.
Max has wanted to help homeless people since he was a little kid. He hopes they can use his creation. I always thought of ways to help the [homeless], he told

55,525,"Should peanut butter be kicked out of school?
When Sam Roffwarg was 18 months old, someone on an airplane gave him a snack pack of peanuts. Sam ate a few of the nuts. Suddenly, he was throwing up and gasping for air because he couldnt breathe.
It turned out that Sam, now 8, has a peanut
. An allergy is a bad reaction to something. Today, the third grader from Jackson, Miss., is careful about what he eats. I always read the ingredients, Sam told
Staying away from peanuts is hard when Sam goes to school, though. When other kids eat peanut butter, Sam has to be sure not to sit near them. Just touching a peanut could make him sick. A
, or strong, allergic reaction could be life threatening.
To protect kids, some schools are limiting or banning peanuts. A survey of about 1,200 school districts found that 18 percent of schools had some type of peanut ban in 2007.
Some officials say the bans are needed to protect kids with allergies. About 400,000 school-age children have peanut allergies, and experts say that number is growing.
Still, most kids are not allergic to peanuts. Some people say banning peanuts is not fair. Plus, they say, keeping track of what every kid eats is impossible. You just cant monitor whats in every persons lunch pail, says Janet Mitchell, a school district representative in Georgia.
Food is not the only thing that can cause allergic reactions. Here is a
, or close-up, look at some other
, or things that may set off allergies.
Tiny dust mites live in the dust found on furniture and in carpets. They are invisible to the naked eye, but they cause asthma and breathing problems for some people.
This allergen is often found in moist, damp areas, such as basements and bathrooms. Mold gives off a type of
, or germ, that can trigger allergy symptoms.
Plants create pollen. It is carried through the air by wind and travels into peoples noses. That can cause people allergic to pollen to sneeze and their eyes to tear.
Should schools limit or ban peanuts? Why or why not?

57,244,"Scientists are rushing to uncover and protect ruins of some very old cities. Those scientists have found lost cities in Asia and Africa that are more than 2,000 years old!
Thousands of years ago, enemy armies and natural disasters destroyed the cities of Zeugma and Herakleion (ee-RAH-klee-on). This summer, however, scientists known as archaeologists (ahr-kee-OL-uh-jists) discovered the lost cities. They found Zeugma in Turkey, a country in Asia. Other scientists found Herakleion underwater off the coast of Egypt, a country in Africa.
About 2,000 years ago, Zeugma was an important meeting place for traders and soldiers. The ruins show that some of the homes had water pipes and mosaics.
Zeugma is located near a dam on the Euphrates (yoo-FRAY-teez) River. The dam is needed to make electricity for people who live nearby. But the dam will cause the river to rise. Soon the river's water will cover part of Zeugma's ruins.
Off the coast of Egypt, divers are finding the remains of Herakleion. Herakleion was built to honor Hercules, an ancient hero.
Experts say Herakleion is at least 2,500 years old. They say an earthquake probably caused the city to sink into the Mediterranean Sea. Archaeologists have found the remains of houses, roads, temples, statues, and coins under 30 feet of water. ""It was really a lost world,"" said Franck Goddio, an archaeologist working on the site.

than normal to hit the United States this year. A hurricane is a strong storm that forms over an ocean.
A scientist predicts where hurricanes will hit.
Hurricane season lasts from June 1 to November 30. Experts
or guess, that eight to 12 hurricanes will form over the Atlantic Ocean this season. Why? The temperature of the ocean is warmer than usual. Warm water and wind can lead to hurricanes, explains Gerry Bell. He a scientist who works for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That is a group that predicts storms.

, Jason Segel plays Gary, a man who tries to
the Muppets to save their old theater. To reunite is to bring back together. Segel also wrote the movie, which hits theaters November 23.
student reporter Elliott Hansing recently spoke with Segel about making
Amy Adams and Jason Segel team up with the Muppets.
Elliott Hansing: Which Muppet is your favorite?
I like Fozzie Bear the best because even though he tells bad jokes, he keeps on trying.
EH: What was the hardest part of filming?
The hardest part ... was not laughing all the time. ... Those Muppets are so funny that I kept breaking character and laughing during scenes.
EH: Did anything unexpected happen while you were making the movie?
There was one day when I went to sit down on a couch ... built for Kermit. And Im much, much bigger than Kermit, [so] I fell straight through the couch and [broke] it!

The United States fought back by going to war. U.S. troops entered Afghanistan in search of the leaders behind the attacks. Afghanistan is a country in Asia.

64,777,"Scientists discover hundreds of plants and animals in Asia.
Talk about hide-and-seek! Scientists in Asia recently discovered more than 350 plant and animal species. The species were found in the Himalayas (hi-muh-LAY-uhss). Those are mountains in southern Asia.
One of the species has researchers hopping for joy. It is a flying frog. The bright green animal was found in India. It uses its long, webbed feet to
Another discovery is the leaf deer. It is the worlds smallest deer. Its only about 25 to 30 inches tall. Researchers found the animal in the nearby country of Myanmar.
The scientists made the discoveries from 1998 to 2008. Besides India and Myanmar, they looked in
of three other countries. A region is an area. Those countries are Bhutan, China, and Nepal.
The researchers uncovered flowers and a snake. They also found a monkey. It is the first new type of monkey to be discovered in more than 100 years.
Experts are excited about the discoveries, but they are also worried. The species
, or home, is in trouble. Loggers are cutting down trees in the Himalayas. To protect the mountains, nature groups are asking countries to guard the land from people trying to destroy it.
In the meantime, scientists are continuing to search the Himalayas for more plants and animals. There will be close to 3,000 to 5,000 species that [could] be discovered ... over the next five years, says wildlife expert Bittu Sahgal.
Heres a look at some of the plants and animals that caught scientists attention while they were studying the Himalayas.
is less than 3 feet tall. At about 25 pounds, the deer weighs as much as a medium-sized dog.
(im-PAY-shehnz) changes color depending on the weather. When temperatures rise, this blue flower turns purple.
Dont let its name fool you. The
is actually a fish. The colorful creature lives in ponds and swamps.
Why might scientists not have discovered the species until now?

Women in the U.S. military fly fighter planes. They serve on battle submarines. They even carry machine guns. But there is one thing they dont dofight on the front lines.
About 50 female U.S. troops serve near the front lines in Afghanistan.
Female U.S. troops are not allowed to take part in frontline
That is active fighting in a war. That means they dont fight as foot soldiers or ride in tanks. They also dont carry out secret missions inside enemy territory.
That may soon change, though. A U.S. military group is pushing for women to be allowed to fight alongside men in frontline combat. What we are saying is Lets remove
[or walls],  says group member Julius W. Becton Jr. He is a retired U.S. Army officer.
, or suggestion. Some people say women arent fit for frontline combat. They say the job requires above-average strength. It is very tough what we have to go through, says Lance Corporal John Rolfes. I personally dont know any woman [who] could [do] that role.
Others, however, say female troops can handle frontline combat. Why should it [matter] if a soldier is a man or a woman if both are ... strong [enough] and well trained to fight the enemy? Lory Manning told
She works at the Womens Research and Education Institute.
The war of words will continue for now. The panel will give its formal recommendation in March. Then it will be up to U.S. President Barack Obama and Congress to decide.
This time line shows how women marched into the U.S. military.
Women serve on the battlefield as needed during the American Revolution.
About 600 women, dressed as men, fight in the Civil War.
More than 25,000 women work as military nurses and support staff during World War I.
The Womens Armed Services Integration Act is passed. It lets women be members of the military full-time.
Congress allows women to fly in combat missions. Two years later, lawmakers let women serve on combat ships.
What skills and traits are important for members of the military to have? Why?

68,557,"A rocket, with the orbiter on top, was launched in August from Cape Canaveral, Florida.
A spacecraft speeds toward the Red Planet. Scientists hope the trip will lead to answers.
In many books and movies, little green aliens from Mars invade Earth. In real life, Mars is the planet being invadedby strange-looking machines from Earth.
In August, NASA, the U.S. space agency, launched a spacecraft to Mars. It is called an orbiter because it will
, or circle, the fourth planet from the sun. Right now, the orbiter is speeding toward Mars. Scientists expect it to reach the Red Planet in March.
The orbiter will join two robots, called rovers, that are already there. They have been rolling around on the surface of the planet for more than two years. They are searching for signs of water.
Mars is cold and dry. Scientists think the planet was once a warmer and wetter place. Evidence of water can mean that life once existed on Mars.
The orbiter will look for signs of water. It is expected to spend at least two years studying Mars. It will scan Mars with the largest telescope camera ever sent to a planet. The orbiter's radar will look for water beneath the planet's surface. It will also search for landing spots to prepare for future human missions to Mars.
This is an artists depiction of the spacecraft as it nears Mars.
""This orbiter is going to look much farther and with more detail than what the rovers could do,"" NASA's Ramon DePaula told
. ""We are going to bring back more data than all other missions to Mars combined.""
Mars is called the Red Planet because its soil is a reddish color.
Like Earth, Mars has mountains and valleys.
The largest volcano in the solar system, called Olympus Mons, is on Mars.
Even in the summer, the temperature on the planet's surface is below zero.

69,174,"Pluto has recently been dropped as a planet from displays at the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York City. Why? Because the museum's scientists had studied Pluto and decided it isn't a planet, for these reasons:
Pluto's orbit is unlike any other planet's in our solar system.
Pluto is small, even smaller than Earth's moon.
Many other scientists disagree and say Pluto should still be considered a planet.

70,464,"Scientists find great surprises in the Great Barrier Reef.
Brightly colored fish dart in and out of the Great Barrier Reef. That is a
a continent. A coral reef is a large underwater structure full of plants and animals. Coral is made of tiny sea animals called
. When polyps die, their hard shells become part of the reef.
Scientists recently explored the worlds largest coral reef. They also looked at another reef near Australia. Their search turned up hundreds of animal species. Some of the species may have never been seen before.
Scientists used netted bags to search the reef. They spied big-clawed shrimp and worms shaped like pine trees. They also found about 130 new types of soft coral.
The researchers left behind 36 plastic houses on the ocean floor. The scientists hope the creatures will move into the houses. That will make it easier to study them.
Learning about the creatures may help people protect them. One-third of the worlds coral reefs are threatened by pollution and fishing. Its important to find out whats in the Great Barrier Reef, says scientist Patricia Hendriks. She took part in the
, or trip with a specific goal. If we dont know what is present in the first place, how are we ever going to protect it properly?
What species did scientists spy in the Great Barrier Reef? Here are a few that made a splash.
This green-banded snapping shrimp has a large claw on one side. It looks like a tiny lobster.
This Christmas tree worm rests on a coral reef. It uses its branches to breathe and eat.
The cuttlefish is a boneless animal related to squid. It has eight arms that it uses to catch food.
This gorgonian fan won the hearts of researchers. The soft coral fan stretches more than 3 feet tall.

71,757,"Scientists say changing cows' diets may make the planet healthier.
Everyone knows that burping is rude, but cows do it all the time. They do it every 40 seconds! The noisy burst of gas is more than just bad manners. It's bad for the environment.
. That is a colorless, odorless gas. Methane is one of the gases that contribute to global warming. Global warming is the slow rise of Earth's temperature. Scientists say one cow releases up to 150 gallons of methane a day!
All that belching adds up. There are 100 million cows in the United States. They are responsible for 20 percent of the nation's methane production.
The methane is produced in cows' stomachs when they digest their food. The gas comes out when cows exhale.
Experts are worried about the planet. ""[Cows, and other animals'] contribution to environmental problems is on a [huge] scale,"" officials wrote in a report.
Scientists are trying to figure out ways of lowering cows' methane production. Some researchers say they have created a pill that could do that.
Other researchers want to change cows' diets. Some scientists think cows should eat more natural sugar. Other researchers want to add extra fats from coconuts or sunflower seeds to cattle feed. That could make cowsand the planethealthier!
Why might scientists worry about global warming?

72,606,"Knock, Knock? Who's there? The ivory-billed woodpecker, that's who!
The ivory-billed woodpecker has bird lovers cheering. They thought the bird was extinct. Now scientists say they have proof that the woodpecker still lives in Arkansas. They have a videotape of the bird in flight.
Why did the rare bird disappear? Between 1880 and the 1940s, loggers cut down the forests where the bird lived. The last sighting of the bird was in 1944.
The ivorybill is the largest woodpecker in the United States. Its call sounds like the toot of a tin horn. The bird is also known for its
or one-of-a-kind, tapping sound. It makes a double knock when its beak strikes a tree.
Some people didn't think the videotape was enough proof, so the scientists recorded the bird's double knock. The recording made believers out of everyone. Hear the bird's double knock at

73,343,"Heavy backpacks can put stress on your spine.
Does your backpack ever feel as if it's filled with bricks? If so, you are not alone. Many kids tend to overload their backpacks.
A recent study shows that heavy packs can lead to bad
(POS-chuhr). Posture is the way you hold your body when you stand, sit, or walk.
Thirteen kids aged 8 and 9 took part in the study. Experts found that the kids could not stand straight when their packs were heavy. The heavier the pack, the more the kids bent forward. ""Their chins [were] on their chests,"" said one expert.
What's a kid to do? Try to lighten up! Doctors say most third graders should not carry packs that weigh more than 8 pounds. Any more than that is just extra baggage!

74,592,"Look out for your lunchboxes! Yogi Bear is at it again. In the new movie
or thief, tries to prevent Jellystone Park from closing down. Dan Aykroyd steals the scene as the voice of Yogi.
student reporter Jeffrey Burrell recently got the scoop about the film, which hits theaters December 17.
Yogi Bear and Boo Boo are ready to grab some lunch!
Jeffrey Burrell: What do you like about playing Yogi?
[Hes] such a great character. ... And what I love about [the movie] is that ... all kids can see [it]. Its a film that families can go to together.
I [like] the scene where Yogi [has] decided not to steal picnic baskets anymore. ... Its kind of funny and sad at the same time.
JB: What advice do you have for kids who want to act?
I would say ... also think about writing as a career. ... What you want to do is write parts for yourself. Everyone should have skills as a writer.

75,700,"California has the bluesblue butterflies, that is! Scientists in the state recently released 80 Palos Verdes blue butterflies into the wild.
The experts raised the fliers because the insects are endangered. They can live only in a small area of California. That area is called the Palos Verdes
A peninsula is a stretch of land that is bordered by water on three sides.
The butterflies lay their eggs on two types of plants found on the peninsula. However, those plants have been harmed by people moving into the area.
To save the butterflies, scientists grow the insects favorite plants in parks around the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Then they release the insects into those areas each spring.
Scientist Jana Johnson hopes her work helps the blue butterflies bounce back with flying colors. We are undoing the wrongs of the past and trying to save this planet, one species at a time, she told

76,632,"Change is on the way for some school vending machines. Candy bars, sugary drinks, and other sweet snacks are no longer being offered in many schools.
Those foods and drinks are being replaced with more healthful choices. Some of those choices include bottled water, salads, granola bars, and dried fruits and nuts.
School vending machines offering soda and candy may soon be a thing of the past.
New York City has the largest school system in the country. That school system recently decided to
, or not allow, junk food in its vending machines. Schools in Texas, California, and many other states are doing the same.
Do you think schools should ban junk food from vending machines? Why or why not?
Why are vending machines getting a makeover? Poor nutrition habits and a lack of exercise have caused many kids to become overweight. School officials hope the changes to vending machines will help students make better nutrition choices.

or most unusual, animals and plants. In January, those islands had a brush with disaster.
On January 16, a ship carrying oil got stuck on a
is a chain of rocks or coral near the surface of the water.) The islands are located in the Pacific Ocean about 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador. Scientists say the oil spill put many of the islands' animals in danger.
The oil spill happened near San Cristbal and Santa Fe islands, in the eastern area of the Galpagos. Cleanup workers said the oil killed two pelicans and dirtied 40 others. Workers said some sea lions, birds, and tortoises also needed to be cleaned.
Oil can make animals sick if they swallow it. When oil covers an animal's fur or feathers, it can't swim, fly, or stay warm. If the oil is not cleaned off the animal, it could die.
The oil spill also harmed life in the water. Many sea plants, such as algae (AL-jee), were also damaged by the oil spill. Sea plants are an important food source for many Galpagos animals.
Days after the accident, however, the islands were spared further damage. Ocean currents took the oil out to sea, away from the islands.
What could be done to prevent such oil spills?

81,681,"Iraq's new government prepares for the future.
Women line up to vote in the southern Iraqi city of Basra January 30, in the country's first freely contested elections since 1954.
The government in Iraq has started the process of choosing leaders and drafting a constitution, now that the election is over. On January 30, millions of Iraqis voted, braving violence and threats of attack in the country's first national election in 50 years.
On that historic day, voters elected 275 leaders to the National Assembly, Iraq's lawmaking body. The assembly recently chose a president and two vice presidents. At press time, those leaders were selecting a prime minister, the most powerful position in Iraq.
Bringing peace and lasting democracy to Iraq will be a challenge for the country's temporary government. Different ethnic and religious groups in Iraq want a voice in the government. The assembly is made up of three groups: Shiites (SHEE-ights), Sunnis (SOON-eez), and Kurds.
The majority of Iraqis are Muslims, who practice the religion Islam. The Muslims are divided into two groupsShiites and Sunnis. The two groups have a long history of tension. Most Muslims in Iraq are Shiites, but the Sunnis were in control when the former dictator Saddam Hussein was in power. Many Sunnis did not vote in the recent election as a way to
Shiites hold the most seats in the National Assembly, and a Shiite leader is expected to be named prime minister. A Kurdish leader was elected as the nation's president. Both a Shiite and a Sunni were elected as vice presidents.
Despite the challenges, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the first meeting of the assembly ""an important step"" for Iraq. The assembly's main task is to write a new constitution by August 15. Once that is approved by the Iraqis, a permanent government will be elected.

83,610,"History in the Making: Japan Invades Hong Kong
War broke out between China and Japan in 1937. An undeclared war was fought until 1941, when China, as well as the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, declared war on Japan, Germany, and Italy. In 1941, Japan invaded the British colony of Hong Kong, which is part of present-day China. Connie interviewed her grandfather, Locksley Siu, who was in Hong Kong during the Japanese invasion.
How old were you when World War II began?
World War II in Hong Kong was from 1941 to 1945. The Japanese army occupied the former British colony when I was 11 years old.
Where did you live, and did you have a car?
Altogether, eight people lived in [an] apartment of 500 square feet. Our apartment was in Wan Chai, on Hong Kong Island. Most people did not have cars. My dad had an old bicycle.
Did you still go to school during the Japanese occupation?
Yes, I continued to go to school for the first year. Later the school was closed because the school ran out of money. During the occupation, students were required to learn Japanese. Japanese teachers taught us Japanese.
Did you have enough food to eat every day?
No, we did not have enough food. We only ate vegetables, beans, and potatoes, but no rice at all. Meat was very costly and in short supply. When we were really hungry, we drank water. Sometimes we had to pick up grass and leaves from trees to eat.
How did the Japanese soldiers treat the Chinese people?
They were rude, and they hated Chinese people. We had to salute the Japanese soldiers when they passed by. Otherwise they would kick [us] in the back.
How was life affected by the occupation?
There was little freedom. The Japanese forbade people to go out after 11 at night. There was no traffic during the curfew. There was a lack of electricity for lighting; instead, we used candles. The only entertainment at night was the radio. The Japanese government took all Hong Kong dollars away. The Japanese government forced us to use Japanese yen. Roads such as Queen's Road and King's Road were changed to Japanese names.
Do you have any comments about the occupation?
More than 60 years after [the end of] World War II, there are still many people  who live in fear, hunger, and poverty because of wars. I hope that you will think more of those less fortunate.
I learned that there was little freedom under the occupation. I should be grateful that I live in a country where I am not forced to do things that I don't want to do. I'm going to do something for the less fortunate, just as my grandpa told me.

""It hasn't sunk in,"" said an emotional Roddick after the match. ""I came to this tournament so many times as a little kid and watched from way up there [in the stands].
Along with his trophy, Roddick accepted a $1 million winning prize. Because of this championship win, Roddick has risen to number two in the tennis rankings, which is a career record for him. However, Ferrero, who won the French Open, still holds the top slot.
The four Grand Slam tournament in tennis are the Australian Open, Wimbledon the French Open, and the U.S. Open.
With Roddick's win, the torch has been passed to a new American tennis generation. Just days before Roddick's victory, American tennis star Pete Sampras announced his retirement from the sport. Sampras won the U.S. Open in 2002. He was just few years younger than the 21-year-old Roddick when he took home his first U.S. Open title in 1990.
Last year, Roddick lost the U.S. Open to Sampras. For any who questioned his ability, Roddick proved that he is the new U.S. Open champion.

When watching the show, kids saw Howdy on their TV screens, but they never saw the man who controlled the puppet--Rufus Rose. When the show ended, Rose kept Howdy. After Rose died, his children held on to Howdy.
However, officials at the Detroit Institute of Arts said that Rose had promised to donate the puppet to the museum. Rose's family didn't want to give up the puppet, and the two sides asked a court to decide Howdy's fate.
The court decided that Rose promised to donate Howdy to the museum. Soon, adults can be kids again when they visit with their old friend Howdy Doody.

86,558,"President George W. Bush and Laura Bush have settled into the White House. Even though their daughters, Barbara and Jenna, are at college, the President and First Lady are not alone. They have three pets with them.
Spot Fetcher Bush, one of the dogs, should feel right at home in the White House. She was born there in 1989. Spot's mother was Millie. Millie belonged to Bush's parents, former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara.
The Bushes' other dog, Barney, also has political connections. Christine Todd Whitman, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, gave Barney to the Bush family.
India, a cat, is the only White House pet that does not have political connections. It is nicknamed ""Willie.""

87,271,"Do you know the words to the Pledge of Allegiance by heart? If you're like most kids in the United States, you probably have said those words countless times.
Now the pledge has found itself in a firestorm of controversy. Next year, the Supreme Court will decide whether to ban the phrase ""under God"" from the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools.
Last year, a federal appeals court in California ruled that the pledge is
because it contains the phrase ""under God.""
If something does not uphold the principles of the U.S. Constitution, it is considered unconstitutional.
According to this lower court, the words ""under God"" suggest the government
, or supports, religion. That violates the First Amendment. The First Amendment of the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and press. People often refer to this freedom as the separation of church and state.
The court's decision affects nearly 10 million schoolchildren in nine western states. The states that are part of the lower court's ruling include Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. The ruling does not apply to public schools elsewhere in the United States.
Michael Newdow of California brought the case to court. He argued that his daughter, now in the fourth grade, should not have to listen to the pledge recited daily, because of its reference to God. ""I'll keep fighting to uphold the Constitution,"" he told CNN.
The Elk Grove School District in Sacramento, California, didn't agree. In response, the school district asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. The Supreme Court has the power to overturn the lower court's ruling.
The Pledge of Allegiance, written by Francis Bellamy, is published in a Boston magazine called
On Columbus Day, about 12 million American schoolchildren say the pledge for the first time.
The words ""my Flag"" are changed to ""the flag of the United States."" A year later, ""of America"" is added to the end of that sentence.
Congress approves the addition of the words ""under God.""
National outrage followed the lower court's decision. To many Americans, saying the pledge is a way to express their
President Bush supports keeping the phrase ""under God"" in the pledge. A spokesperson for the president argues that the phrase is more about history than about religion.
The official points out that there are religious references in the Declaration of Independence and the national anthem. The nation's money carries the motto ""In God We Trust,"" as well.
Once the case begins next year, the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., will likely be the scene of protests. People on both sides of the debate will want their voices heard.
Until the Supreme Court issues a final ruling, the ban on the pledge has been put on hold. But as critics of the lower court's decision argue, reciting the pledge remains
. That means that schoolchildren are not required to say the pledge if they don't want to participate.

There are prizes, and then there are really big prizes! On December 10, winners of the Nobel Prizes will receive their
Accepting the Nobel award for work in promoting peace will be Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank. It might seem strange that someone would receive a peace prize for founding a bank. But Yunus is no ordinary banker.
In 1983, Yunus founded Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, a country in Asia. The bank gives small loans to poor villagers, especially women. The Nobel Prize committee honored Yunus because ""peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty.""
In addition to celebrating progress toward peace, the Nobel committee gives awards for achievements in other areas, such as literature, physics, chemistry, and medicine. Each of the winners receives $1.4 million, a gold medal, and a diploma.
The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway. The other Nobel Prizes are given out in Stockholm, Sweden. Both countries are in Europe.
This year, all five of the science Nobels went to Americansthe first time that has happened since 1983. Scientist Roger Kornberg won the chemistry prize for his work on how people inherit diseases. In 1959, as a 12-year-old, Roger watched his father, Arthur Kornberg, win a Nobel Prize. The Kornbergs are the sixth father-and-son pair to have won Nobel Prizes.
Although Roger was stunned by his win, his father saw it coming. ""His work has been awesome,"" says his dad.
The Nobel Prizes were the brainchild of Alfred Bernhard Nobel (18331896) of Sweden, the inventor of dynamite. At the time of his death, Nobel left $9 million to fund the prizes that bear his name. The first annual Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901. The prizes are presented each year on December 10the anniversary of Nobels death.

89,403,"Scientists find the remains of an ancient village near the famous circle of stones.
Stonehenge is a mysterious monument that consists of a circle of stones. It was built about 4,600 years ago in southwestern England. Researchers recently unearthed an ancient village near Stonehenge. The village may have been home to the builders of the stone circle.
discovered the remains of close to 25 small houses about 2 miles from Stonehenge. (Archaeologists study the materials left by prehistoric peoples and their cultures.) The researchers say the village, known as Durrington Walls, was built at about the same time as Stonehenge. They
or guess, that Stonehenge was a memorial site or cemetery for the villagers. The village includes a wooden version of the stone monument.
""Clearly, this is a place that was of enormous importance,"" says British researcher Julian Thomas, who helped discover the village. He noted that both Stonehenge and Durrington Walls have avenues connecting them to the nearby Avon River. Villagers may have frequently traveled between the two sites.
Eight of the wooden houses have been
or dug up. The structures are about 14 feet long. There was evidence of bed frames along the walls and a dresser or storage unit on the wall opposite the door.
Two of the houses found by Thomas were separate from the others. They may have been the homes of community leaders. Stone tools, animal bones, arrowheads, and other
(humanmade objects) were also uncovered in the village.

Kais story portrays the voyage of more than 175,000 Chinese immigrants to Angel Island from 1910 to 1940.
In December, President George W. Bush signed the Angel Island Immigration Station Restoration and Preservation Act. The law provides up to $15 million to set up a museum and research center on the island to help tell stories like Kais. The money will also be used to protect hundreds of poems carved in the wooden walls of the station that describe the difficult journey.
People from China didnt always have difficulty entering the United States. The earliest Chinese immigrants arrived during the California gold rush in the 1840s and 1850s. They nicknamed the United States
or ""Gold Mountain,"" because many of them hoped to strike it rich.
But as the number of Chinese immigrants grew, Americans became less welcoming. In 1882, the U.S. government passed the Chinese Exclusion Act. The law made it almost impossible for Chinese workers to enter the United States.
or forcibly held, at Angel Island while immigration officials decided whether the newcomers should be allowed to enter the United States. The process was very different from that of Ellis Islandthe New York port of entry for European immigrants.
On Ellis Island, more than 95 percent of travelers were processed quickly and allowed into the United States. On Angel Island, many Chinese immigrants were held for weeks, months, and sometimes even years. After being cruelly questioned by officials, more than 30 percent of immigrants were sent back to China.
Angel Islands doors closed in 1940 when China and the United States became
or partners, during World War II (1939-1945). The islands main immigration station was scheduled to be destroyed in the 1970s until a park ranger found poetry carved in its walls. The poems described the frustration and sadness that many people felt during their stay at Angel Island. (See ""
Later this year, the poems will literally be brought to light. Angel Islands main buildings will reopen to the public, and the poems will be lit up for all to see.
""Angel Island shows a different, but equally important, side of immigration,"" Erika Gee, education expert at the Angel Island Immigration Foundation, told
""We hope that Angel Island becomes a bookend to Ellis Island.""
More than 200 poems are on the walls of Angel Island. The following two poems were recently translated:
Its been a long time since I left my home village
Who could know Id end up imprisoned
Im heartsick when I see my reflection,
  my handkerchief is soaked in tears
I ask you, what crime did I commit
  I give vent to despair
  on a mountainits hard to earn glory
  I watch for my early release
What feelings do these poems capture? How do they tell the story of Angel Islands immigrants?

91,364,"Should schools report a student's health to parents?
As if grades weren't enough to worry about, some students now have weight on their minds too. The number of overweight children in the United States has more than doubled in the past 20 years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Being
or severely overweight, can lead to health problems later in life.
As a result, schools in several states, from California to Pennsylvania, have started sending home ""BMI report cards."" Those schools send home a report of a student's
BMI is a calculation of weight and height that tells whether a person is overweight for his or her age.
Should schools send home BMI reports? People on both sides of the debate are weighing in.
Some lawmakers say BMI reports alert parents to their children's health and help combat obesity. In 2003, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee helped launch the first program to report students' BMIs. Obesity rates in that state have since stopped increasing. Pediatrician Joe Thompson helped plan the BMI program for Arkansas schools. He explains that the reports in Arkansas are sent home separately from report cards. ""The misconception is students are being graded on their weight,"" he told
""Just like a school screens for vision or hearing, this is a health approach to raise awareness about a risk.""
Not everyone thinks that reporting students' BMIs is a good idea. Parents have complained that the reports damage their children's self-esteem. Some parents say kids also worry that they are being ""graded"" on their weight. Opponents of BMI reports argue that schools that label students overweight are acting unfairly. The critics point out that many school cafeterias serve fatty foods. Parent Brett Levy from Chicago, Illinois, believes that schools should teach kids to lead healthy lifestyles instead of reporting their BMIs. ""Telling a boy or girl [a] BMI is not education,"" he told
Schools should issue BMI reports for students.
Schools should not issue BMI reports for students.

92,158,"Giant pandas get a new home at the National Zoos Asia Trail.
These lucky animals are getting some extra room to stretch out! Giant pandas at the National Zoo, in Washington, D.C., have a bigger home. The zoo opened its Asia Trail in October.
The zoos three pandas may be the stars of the show, but they arent alone. Six other threatened or endangered Asian species have new
or homes, on the trail. The animals with new homes are red pandas, fishing cats, sloth bears, Asian small-clawed otters, clouded leopards, and Japanese giant salamanders.
The $53 million makeover doubles the space for those animals. ""This is a giant leap forward for the National Zoo,"" says its director, John Berry.
The Asia Trail is part of a 10-year project to improve the zoo. Before the exhibit was
or updated, the animals lived in cramped quarters. Covering nearly 6 acres, the new area gives animals more room to roam and play.
""Visitors are treated to up-close views,"" says Susan Ades, head of the zoos exhibit design. ""You can see, hear, touch, and even smell the zoos science.""
The pandas are among the zoos most popular attractions. They draw huge crowds, which are expected to reach a record 3 million people this year. The pandas new habitat includes waterfalls and shallow pools, along with more rocks and leafy trees to climb. Fog machines even help model the pandas wet natural environment in China.
Along with the giant pandas, here are a few animals that capture visitors attention on the Asia Trail.

Native American artifacts, such as these baskets, will be on display at the National Museum of the American Indian.
A wealthy New Yorker named George Gustav Heye collected most of the new museum's items throughout the early 1900s. He was interested in Native American culture and traditions.
There are about 800,000 Native American objects included in the museum's collection. The museum plans to display about 8,000 artifacts at a time.
The 4 million people who are expected to visit each year won't just find ancient objects--although there are plenty of them to see. Officials say the new museum also teaches people about Native Americans in modern times. Along with ancient pieces, such as beadwork, pottery, and carvings, visitors will also find newer ones, such as modern art and beaded sneakers.
The museum has been a work in progress for 16 years. Twenty-four Native American tribes helped build and plan the museum. They even reviewed the traditional dishes served in the museum's caf.
Symbolism abounds in the five-story building, which is made of limestone from Minnesota. The building's curved exterior resembles rocks shaped by wind and water over thousands of years.
In honor of many types of Native American dwellings, the museum's entrance faces east, in the direction of the rising sun. Inside, an electronic welcome sign greets visitors in 150 Native American languages.
Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today, each with its own culture. Native Americans have lived in North, South, and Central America for more than 20,000 years. When European explorers first arrived in North America, they thought they had landed in the East Indies. Those are islands located near Asia. That is why the explorers called the people living in the Americas ""Indians.""
To many Native Americans, the new museum has been a long time coming. ""[It is] long overdue,"" said Lawrence Small, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
Now that it is officially open, Native Americans hope the new museum keeps their culture alive. ""This will be a good education tool for everyone that wants to learn about the Indian people,"" a Cherokee woman told
. ""Our languages are still here. Our culture is still here.""
Why is the new museum an important part of Native American history?

, or types, of spiders living in the Buckeye State. He and his team of volunteers have a sharp eye when it comes to collecting the creatures indoors and outdoors. ""They move really fast,"" he told
Scientists say about 3,500 species of spiders live in North America, and nearly 35,000 live worldwide. Spiders live in different places, including gardens, water, deserts, and caves.
Many people think spiders are insects, but they are actually
(ah-RAK-nidz). Ticks and scorpions are also arachnids.
Along with fangs and eight hairy legs, a spider has two body parts--a head and an abdomen. The abdomen contains
, organs that produce silk. A spider uses its silk for many purposes, including weaving webs, protecting its eggs, and catching food.
A spider uses its silk to weave a web.
, or hunters that eat other animals. They dine mostly on insects. Some larger spiders also eat lizards, frogs, and even snakes.
To capture their food, some spiders spin webs. Other types of spiders chase down their
, or poison, from their fangs helps paralyze their food.
Although the hairy creatures spook many people, there isn't much reason to be afraid of spiders. ""Most spiders are not very dangerous,"" said Bradley.
In fact, most are timid creatures that are unable to give humans more than a harmless bite. Although spider venom is deadly to insects, it often has little effect on humans because of our larger size.
Spiders may have a bad reputation for being scary, but they are important to us. Bradley hopes his work shatters some
about spiders. (A myth is a false idea that many people believe is true.)
Spiders eat mosquitoes and other insects that harm farmers' crops and carry diseases. Bradley's research is teaching scientists more about how spiders help control
, or communities of plants and animals. If spiders didn't exist, there would be a lot more insects!
""Spiders are your friends,"" Bradley said. ""They make our life more pleasant.""
Get caught up on some different types of spiders. Spiders come in all shapes and sizes. Crab spiders, jumping spiders, and orb weavers have made Rich Bradley's Ohio count. Find out more about them and other spiders.
Can you guess how this spider got its name? It may not live in the ocean, but it looks like a crab. The crab spider lives on flowers. It can match its body color to the flower's color. That allows it to sneak up on insects.
What a leap! The jumping spider can jump between 10 and 40 inches. To catch an insect, this hunting spider sneaks up on its prey and pounces.
The trap-door spider lives in a tunnel. The spider, common in the southwestern United States, lines the tunnel with silk and fashions a door made of silk and dirt. It peeks out of the slightly open door and grabs passing insects.
The tarantula is a large, hairy spider found mainly in warm regions, including the southwestern United States. Although the tarantula's bite is painful, it is not very poisonous to humans. Tarantulas hunt insects, lizards, mice, toads, and frogs.
E. B. White's famous spider Charlotte was an orb weaver. The orb-weaving spider spins a wheel-shaped web. When an insect flies into the web, the spider races toward its meal.

96,235,"In June, a small car pulled up outside the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad. Three men unloaded a wrapped object from the trunk, handed it to museum officials, and sped off in the mid afternoon heat. No questions asked.
Museum officials were stunned. The men had left a very important vase. Although the vase was in pieces, the good news was that it could be fixed.
""This is one of the most important pieces from the Baghdad museum, and I am delighted it has been returned,"" said a museum official. ""It is reason for people all around the world to celebrate.""
Why, exactly, would the return of a vase be cause for celebration? It was the famous Vase of Warka. The 5,000-year-old
, or man-made object, is one of the world's first sculptures. The images on the vase are important because they link the past to modern times.
Along with many valuable objects, the vase was stolen from the museum after the fall of Saddam Hussein's government in April.
At that time, mobs of thieves and rioters, or
, tore through the museum. They smashed ancient objects. Thieves ran off with prized treasures. Among the lost objects were carvings, jewelry, paintings, and statues.
One museum official referred to the looting as the ""crime of the century."" He said that it wasn't just a loss for Iraq, but that it was ""a loss for all mankind.""
. That means they could never be replaced. Some of the lost objects dated back 10,000 years, to the beginning of civilization.
Many people blamed U.S. troops for failing to protect the museum as Saddam's government fell. They pointed out that U.S. forces had managed to guard the oil reserves. U.S. government officials defended themselves, saying that American troops were focused on taking control of Baghdad.
Officials estimate that about 3,000 pieces from the museum's entire collection of 170,000 items are still missing. The losses were not as large as experts originally thought. Some valuable pieces were hidden in underground vaults. Other pieces were taken by people for safekeeping and then were returned.
Some of the stolen objects are slowly making their way back to the museum. Museum workers are trying to ensure the safe return of other objects. They began a ""don't ask; don't tell"" policy.
The policy allows thieves-like the ones who brought back the vase-to return stolen goods without punishment. Countries around the world are involved in recovery efforts. They are helping to compile a list of the stolen items. However, as one expert pointed out, ""It's going to be a long time before we know for sure what's missing.""
Modern-day Iraq is the site of ancient Mesopotamia. In Greek,
means ""the land between rivers."" There, about 5,000 years ago, the first cities sprang up between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
The area between the two rivers is often referred to as a cradle of civilization. That's because mathematics, science, and one of the first written languages developed there.
Here are some of the Iraqi National Museum's valuable artifacts and their status at the time
This 5,000-year-old stone statue of a woman praying was still missing.
This life-size marble head of a woman is one of the earliest pieces of sculpture. About 5,000 years old, it was stolen during the looting.
How did looters steal from world history when they ransacked the museum?
Originally thought to be missing, this tablet is a record of the world's earliest writing. It was found on the museum's second floor, away from the riots.

97,132,"Aquarius: An Underwater Lab With A View
Many U.S. kids share their bedrooms with a brother or sister. Sharing a room can be a pain. In October, six scientists squeezed into a small underwater laboratory to study a coral reef. They worked and slept in the tiny space for ten days. They, too, found that sharing space isn't easy.
""I've been on missions where people snored,"" said Celia Smith, who led the mission in October. ""You just kind of kick their bunk and try to get to sleep before they do.""

says the best part of living there is the view. They can see colorful fish swimming in the nearby reef. Smith said it's hard to tell, though, whether the aquanauts are watching the fish or the fish are watching the aquanauts.
The aquanauts spend as much time as they can on the reef studying sea life. They can spend up to nine hours at one time outside the laboratory.
Smith likes to remind people that humans have barely begun to explore the oceans and need to learn more about life in the deep. ""The really important thing for us to realize is how much we don't know about the oceans,"" she said.
Coral reefs have been called the rain forests of the oceans. Just as many of the world's land plants and animals live in rain forests, many sea creatures live in coral reefs.
Coral reefs are in danger. One-fourth of the world's coral reefs have already been destroyed, and the remaining reefs could be destroyed within the next century, scientists say.
Overfishing, pollution, and global warming are destroying many coral reefs, scientists explain. For example, global warming has gradually warmed the shallow ocean waters where coral reefs usually form. The warmer water has killed many

Scientist Valerie Paul worries that all the world's coral reefs will be destroyed early this century. ""It is like losing the rain forests all at once,"" she said.

The four Harry Potter books, by J.K. Rowling, are popular all over the world. More than 35 million copies have been sold. They have also been translated into 30 languages.
Although many kids say they love reading about Harry, some critics say the books aren't good for kids.
Many teachers say that their students don't read enough. So teachers are thrilled that many kids spend their free time reading Harry Potter books. Educators say reading helps kids do better in school. ""I know my kids aren't missing out on their reading,"" said Gillian Williams, an elementary school principal in New York City. ""They're reading Harry Potter.""
The books also teach kids new words. Megan LeMay, 10, of West Hartford, told
that as she reads, ""I write new words down and look them up in a dictionary.""
Although Harry has cast a spell on kids, some people fear it's an evil spell. The school board in Zeeland, Michigan, decided teachers couldn't read the books to students. Not everyone in Zeeland agreed with that decision.
recently talked to people in Zeeland about Harry.
Some Zeeland parents said they worry that Harry teaches kids to question parents and other authority figures. They also said that many of the characters don't have good values. ""The books don't have characters that are easy to respect,"" said parent Mary Elzinga.
Other parents in Zeeland had no problem with the books. Parent Mary Ocherse said kids
question some authority figures. Teacher Mary Dana agreed. ""Some of our greatest American heroes, such as George Washington, questioned authority,"" she said. ""We need to teach kids how and when to question authority figures.""
Dana also said the characters in the books are good role models kids can relate to. ""Harry is an outsider who is honest and is a good friend,"" she said. ""He makes mistakes, but he always tries to do the right thing.""
When asked their opinion, Erin, Megan, and many other kids said they don't understand what the fuss in Zeeland is about. They all said the Harry Potter books are ""just for fun.""

Simon, a rare red panda, now plays in the trees at a Jerusalem zoo. Jerusalem is a city in the Middle East. The small, bear-like animal likes to dine mainly on bamboo but also munches on fruits, acorns, and insects. Red pandas are excellent climbers and spend most of their time in trees. They are mainly found in Nepal and southern China. Habitat loss and illegal hunting have endangered red pandas in the wild.

100,740,"Have you seen a 6-foot-tall statue that has red hair and red nose and is wearing a yellow outfit with big, floppy red shoes? If so, the police in Normal, Illinois, want to talk to you. They're looking for a statue of Ronald McDonald that was stolen from a McDonald's restaurant.
Police say this is the third time that the statue has been stolen in the last five years. A spokesperson for the McDonald's restaurant isn't sure how the statue was removed from the restaurant grounds. ""The guys who put the statue in [after the last time it was taken] said there was no way he was going to be taken again,"" the spokesperson said. But the installers were wrong.
The people who stole the statue may think that the theft is a prank. But they broke the law by stealing someone else's property. McDonald's wants Ronald back. The restaurant is offering a $250 reward for information on the missing statue's whereabouts.

102,246,"Explorer Brge Ousland likes challenges. He currently holds four polar records. He set his last record in 1997 when he became the first person to walk across Antarctica without help.
Now Ousland is taking on a new challenge. At the end of February, he was scheduled to begin a 1,100-mile Arctic trek from Siberia to Canada via the North Pole. Siberia is a region of eastern Russia.
If successful, Ousland will be the first person to cross the top of the world alone and without help. Although he was not sure how long the trip would take, the explorer planned to pull a 340-pound sled with food and supplies for 90 days.

103,766,"People in some states pay a deposit when they buy bottles and cans of soft drinks. When they return the empty bottles and cans to a redemption center, they get their deposits back. Now some lawmakers in Maine want people to pay a 5-cent deposit on each cigarette they buy. If the bill passes, people could return used cigarette butts to get a deposit back.
The lawmakers who introduced the bill say they did so for two reasons. First, such a plan would lead to fewer crushed cigarette butts littering the landscape. ""I think [the law] could work to reduce waste,"" said Maine lawmaker Scott Cowger, who cosponsored the bill in Maine's House of Representatives.
Second, a cigarette deposit law would raise money for antismoking education programs in Maine schools. The bill's sponsors admit they expect only a small percentage of people will redeem cigarette butts. But those nickel deposits that aren't redeemed could add up to as much as $50 million for school antismoking programs.
Some people in Maine have problems with the cigarette deposit bill. Annie Loadwick, of Mercer, Maine, runs a bottle and can redemption center. She said she doesn't want to have to handle and count customer's used cigarette butts.
Maine's governor, Angus King, also does not support the bill. He wants instead to place a tax on cigarettes of 26 cents per pack. The tax, King said, would produce up to $36 million for school antismoking programs.

105,205,"You've probably sat at a desk or on a bench on which someone had carved or scratched a message. Etching, or carving, messages is nothing new, however. People have been carving and painting messages on rock walls for thousands of years.
Scientists recently announced that they had discovered ancient etchings in a cave in France, a country in Europe. The etchings are between 22,000 and 28,000 years old.
The cave etchings show prehistoric people and animals. Drawings of bison, horses, mammoths, and rhinos dot the cave walls and ceiling.
Marc Delluc discovered the cave etchings. Delluc is a cook who spends many of his weekends exploring caves in France. One day, he was exploring a tunnel in one cave when he noticed the etchings. He was the first person in thousands of years to see the amazing carvings. Delluc said the etchings are beautiful to look at. ""I just sat there gazing at the ceiling,"" he said.

107,324,"The results are in for the backpack survey. At the beginning of the school year, we asked you how much weight you carry in your backpack. Nearly 3,500 of you responded to our online poll.
Health experts recommend that kids not carry more than 15 percent of their body weight.
A 70-pound fourth grader, for example, should not carry a backpack that weighs more than 10.5 pounds. Take a look at the table to see how you compare with our kid respondents.

108,118,"Nine-year-old Hannah Niles loves poetry! The fourth grader especially enjoys reading poetry by Edgar Allan Poe. ""He uses a lot of expression and detail in his poems,"" she told
Hannah belongs to the Basketball Poets. That is a group of 40 fourth and fifth graders at Supply Elementary School in Supply, North Carolina. The students meet once a week in the gym, where they read, write, memorize, and perform poetry. Then they play basketball.
Poetry lets kids express themselves. ""If you're nervous, you write a poem about being nervous. If you're happy, you write a poem about being happy,"" said 10-year-old Douglas Mitchell.
The Basketball Poets also had the opportunity to meet two published poetsKenn Nesbitt and Sharon Creech. Both children's authors visited the school and gave the students advice on writing poetry. ""They were professional, and we're kids, so that's exciting,"" said Hannah.
Who came up with the idea for the Basketball Poets? It was the school's physical education teacher, Marty Mentzer. She sees the club as a way for kids to keep their minds and bodies fit. ""It's cool to be a reader and a writer,"" she said, ""and basketball teaches them teamwork.""

110,710,"Alhaji Babah Sawane was only 10 years old when a rebel group kidnapped him in his African country of Sierra Leone. Taken from his family, he was forced to learn how to fire a rifle. He fought in an army for the next two and a half years.
Peacekeepers from the United Nations (U.N.) helped to free Alhaji. In 2001, he addressed the U.N., asking that organization to help children around the world who are forced to fight in war zones.
""We ask this body on behalf of Sierra Leone to do all they can to bring our sad story to an end,"" he said. ""We want to be able to move about freely in all parts of the country.""
Sierra Leone is just one of an estimated 41 countries around the world that use child soldiers. While the most offenses occur in Africa and Asia, the problem also exists in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East.
Most children who become soldiers come from very poor countries. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers estimates that 300,000 children are fighting as soldiers. In some countries, boys and girls as young as 8 years old are being recruited, or called upon, to fight.
Protecting children in war and conflict zones has become a top job for the United Nations. And the U.N. has made significant progress. In a report issued in December 2002, the U.N. named 28 governments and armed groups that use children to fight their battles.
International law prohibits countries from using children who are younger than 15 years old in combat. However, several U.N. conventions condemn, or do not approve of, having anyone under 18 serve as a soldier. If a country recruits child soldiers, it is violating, or breaking the rule of, international agreements.
Why us it important for governments around the world to protect children?
The U.N. wants to save children like Alhaji Babah Sawane from suffering. The report sends a strong message to governments everywhere: They will be held accountable for their actions.

111,209,"Pilots follow monarchs on the move from Canada to Mexico.
Each fall, the skies between eastern Canada and the mountains of central Mexico fill with orange-and-black monarch butterflies. Along their journey, millions of butterflies fight fierce winds and flee predators. Once they reach their destination, monarchs cover trees with their bright, shimmering wings.
This year, the monarchs will not be flying alone. Butterfly lovers are accompanying them on their 3,415-mile journey. They are riding in a light aircraft called an
Their aircraft is painted to resemble the orange, black, and white wings of the monarch.
or move from one place to another. Beginning in early August, the butterflies head south for the winter months.
Most monarchs travel from Canada to Mexico. Others travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north. They are the only insects to make such a long round-trip migration.
Mexican pilot Francisco Gutierrez and a crew of other pilots from Canada and the United States departed from Quebec, Canada, on August 15. The group plans to arrive in Mexico on November 2.
The crew hopes to raise awareness about the monarchs' fragile habitats. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning the forests that protect the butterflies from rain and cold.
No one has ever followed the butterflies in the air for their entire journey. Doing so can teach scientists how the winged insects deal with wind patterns and difficult weather. Gutierrez says, ""It's going to be an adventure.""

Some fourth and fifth graders are on the move. The students at Ottawa Elementary School in Buchanan, Michigan, are getting a sneak preview of middle school life. Theyre switching classesand teachersfour times a day.
So far, the program has been a big hit. ""The kids really like that theyre going to get up and move every 40 minutes,"" science teacher Sue Borr told
""They dont like sitting in the same place all day.""
Borr suggested the program, which is called team teaching. Instead of staying with one teacher all day, students go to four different classrooms, where they learn four different subjects. Those subjects are math, social studies, science, and language arts. The students begin and end the day with a homeroom teacher.
""I like it better because the teachers like what theyre teaching,"" says Ottawa fifth grader Michael Meersman. ""They have fun, and theyre not as grouchy.""
Unlike many elementary school students, these fourth and fifth graders dont leave their papers and supplies in a desk. They carry their work with them from class to class in three-ring binders and colored folders. ""Theyre really organized,"" adds Borr.
Fourth graders at Ottawa have another reason to like the program: They wont have to get used to a new teacher when school starts next September, because they will learn the same subjects from the same teachers.

On the first day of school, Rand said, her classmates ripped out pictures of Saddam Hussein from their textbooks. Saddam is the former president of Iraq. The students tossed the pages out the window, yelling ""Bye, bye, Saddam.""
That was not an unusual sight at some schools throughout this war-torn country. Saddam's government was toppled in April. At that time, U.S.-led forces took control of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.
During Saddam's rule, teachers were forced to mention him in every lesson, from history to music to gym class. Students even learned math by adding 4 + 28. That's because April 28 is Saddam's birthday. Now schools are erasing Saddam's image and teachings from their lessons.
Iraqi officials are rewriting the country's textbooks. That will give students the opportunity to learn new ideas about the world.
The new textbooks, which will arrive this month, don't include any references praising Saddam. Pictures of Saddam have been removed from classrooms. Students are no longer forced to chant ""Long live our leader, Saddam"" during their classes.
Despite the changes, U.S. soldiers report that many of Iraq's schools are in various states of
, or poor condition. Although many schools were failing before the war began, many more schools were destroyed or seriously damaged during the fighting.
Some schools have broken windows and doors and are still without electricity or running water. Some lack chalkboards, desks, and other much-needed furniture and supplies.
The good news is that help is on the way for teachers and students. U.S. soldiers and aid groups are helping rebuild many of the run-down schools, restoring water and electricity.
They are also providing children with school supplies that Americans have donated. One 9-year-old Iraqi student was all smiles as soldiers unloaded boxes of new crayons, markers, book bags, and other donated supplies.
Despite the challenges, the new school year offers a fresh start for many teachers and children. ""Memories of the war are still fresh, but we shall go past that,"" said one teacher in Iraq. ""[The students] will be safer now.""
A fourth-grade class in Maine is reaching out to schoolchildren in Iraq. The students are collecting notebooks, colored pencils, rulers, and other supplies to send to Iraq.
that he hopes the care packages will improve the lives of schoolchildren in Iraq. His classmate Maddie Brochu feels the same way. ""They don't have very much at their schools,"" she said.
The project is close to their teacher's heart. Barbara Winslow's two sons serve in the U.S. military in Baghdad. Winslow told
that donating the supplies helps her students make a personal connection with children in another culture.
Why is it important to be able to think and learn freely?
The class also made a picture book and wrote a message of friendship. The message was translated into Arabic and included in each box. Arabic is the official language of Iraq. ""We hope we can reach out in friendship and make a difference,"" said Winslow.

President Bush went to war in Iraq because, he said, the country's dictator, Saddam Hussein, had harmful, illegal weapons. Bush claimed that Iraq and its weapons threatened the United States and other nations. Bush says that the world is safer now that Saddam has been removed from power. His goal is to rebuild Iraq with its own government and establish peace there.
Senator Kerry supported a law that allowed the United States to go to war in Iraq. Since then, he has criticized Bush's handling of the war. Kerry said that Bush misled the nation by claiming that Iraq had harmful, illegal weapons. To date, none have been found.

117,787,"Condoleezza Rice is the first African American woman to become secretary of state.
After the November election, President Bush nominated Condoleezza Rice to become secretary of state. That is the highest job in the president's
Rice will make history as the first-ever African American woman secretary of state. ""The secretary of state is America's face to the world, and in [Condoleezza Rice] the world will see the strength, grace, and decency of our country,"" Bush told reporters.
Being a leader is nothing new to Rice. In 2001, Rice was the first African American woman to become national security adviser. In that position, she worked closely with President Bush and advised him on defense matters.
As secretary of state, Rice will advise President Bush on U.S. foreign affairs. She will serve as a top
. A diplomat is a person who represents his or her country abroad. Rice will also work with leaders of other countries on important issues, such as the war in Iraq and the rebuilding of South Asia after the tsunami.
Rice has overcome odds to make it to one of the country's top jobs. She was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1954, during a time when black people were
, or separated, from white people in the South.
Rice says her parents taught her that education was the best way to overcome segregation. At 15, she attended college at the University of Denver in Colorado.
Bush believes that Rice, a classical pianist and former competitive ice skater, is up to the challenge. ""It is an honor to be asked to serve ... my country once again,"" said Rice.
The president's Cabinet is made up of a group of leaders who are in charge of the 15 departments in the executive branch of the government. The president heads up that branch.
The Senate must approve President Bush's Cabinet choices. Not everyone agrees with the president's choices for those positions.
The chart shows the Cabinet departments in the order in which they were created.

118,240,"Could you keep quiet for one day? How about for a month or a year? That's what Brett Banfe is doing. The 18-year-old believes that silence is golden, and he has promised not to utter a single sound for an entire year.
Brett is remaining silent to raise money for charity. He came up with the idea when he was talking to several friends. ""We were talking about what it would be like to stop speaking for a day,"" he explained. ""And I said I could do it for a year.""
Brett says zipping his lips will change the way he listens to people ""because I'm not going to be trying to think about what I'm going to say next,"" he explained.

119,645,"A new fashion trend has hit some public schools across the country. More schools are requiring students to wear uniforms or are enforcing stricter dress codes.
Students at Lakeside Elementary School in Cincinnati, Ohio, said good-bye to jeans, T-shirts, and oversized, baggy clothes this school year. Instead, they must wear tan, navy, or black pants and shirts with a collar. Girls are also allowed to wear jumpers or skirts.
The students in Ohio are not alone. From California to New York, an estimated 11 million public schools
, or require, dress codes for students.
Some people support the idea of dress codes. School officials say that dress codes often improve discipline and lessen teasing and bullying. Students focus on schoolwork instead of fashion.
""I like uniforms,"" Brittany, a student at Lakeside, told
. ""No one judges you, because you are wearing the same thing that they are.""
Some parents say that another benefit of wearing uniforms is that it saves money. They think uniforms are less expensive than designer clothes.
Not all people are in favor of dress codes. Some parents say that dress codes
, or go against, kids' freedom of expression. That right is guaranteed in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
These students do not have to follow a dress code.
Others argue that dress codes take away their kids' creativity by preventing them from choosing what to wear. Maggie, a student at Lakeside, told
that she doesn't like to wear a uniform, because ""all the outfits are the same.""
Some parents don't agree that buying uniforms is less expensive. They say it can be costly to purchase clothes to meet dress codes.
Should public schools have dress code policies?

To convert a larger unit to a smaller unit (eg m to cm), first check the number of smaller units needed to make 1 larger unit. Then, multiply that number by the number of larger units.
To convert a smaller unit to a larger unit (eg cm to m), first divide it by the number of smaller units which are needed to make 1 larger unit.
To convert from a larger unit to a smaller one,
To convert from a smaller unit to a larger one,
So, to convert from m to cm multiply by 100, and to convert from cm to m divide by 100.
3.2m = 320cm (3.2  100 = 320)
400cm = 4m (400  100 = 4)
Convert the following to the units given in brackets:
Remember that 1kg = 1000g. To convert from g to kg, divide by 1000.
Remember that 1cl = 10ml. To convert from cl to ml, multiply by 10.
Remember that 1m = 1000mm. To convert from mm to m, divide by 1000.

122,22,"> The Tempest Summary - Prospero revealed
Prospero has Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian in his power. He has them imprisoned, with other survivors (except Trinculo and Stephano who are still with Caliban) in a trance, by his cave.
He tells Ariel to fetch them to him. He says that although it would be understandable if he took revenge on them, he would forgive them if they were sorry for what they had done to him.
He also tells Ariel that he will soon be free, and tells him he will miss him.
Ariel leaves to fetch the group. Prospero, alone, declares that he will give up his magic, break his magic staff and throw his magic books into the sea as soon as this business is over.
When Ariel brings the men back, Prospero places them in a magic circle. After telling them off for the wrong things they have done, he releases them from his spell, so they can now wake up. In order that they will recognise him as they awaken, Prospero sends Ariel to fetch his Duke's clothing and sword.
The men slowly start to come to their senses. They recognise Prospero, but are amazed to see him in such a strange place.
Alonso is very ashamed of what he has done.

124,382,"> Magnets and electric current - Electromagnets
When an electric current flows in a wire it creates a magnetic field around the wire.
we can strengthen the magnetic field. Electromagnets are made from coils like this.
We can make an electromagnet stronger by doing these things:
The magnetic field around an electromagnet is just the same as the one around a bar magnet. It can, however, be reversed by turning the battery around.
Unlike bar magnets, which are permanent magnets, the magnetism of electromagnets can be turned on and off just by closing or opening the switch.

Whole numbers - Dividing by 10, 100, and 1000
When we divide by 10, every figure moves
place to the right. Thousands become hundreds, hundreds become tens and tens become units.
When we divide by 100, every figure moves
places to the right. Thousands become tens, hundreds become units, and tens and units become fractions of a unit.
When we divide by 1000, every figure moves
places to the right. Thousands become units. Hundreds, tens and units become fractions of a unit.

137,127,"There are two main types of language: literal and figurative.
Literal language is explicit, obvious, out in the open and plainly stated. It is a major part of non-fiction texts, but can also be found in fiction.
Figurative language infers or suggests things rather than stating them. Figurative language can give a text more richness and depth. It is often found in fiction texts and autobiographies, but can also be found in non-fiction.

138,112,"> Drama - Working from a script
There's much more to acting than just reading a script out loud. If you're nervous, it's tempting to read the lines really quickly, using the same tone of voice all the way through, but this isn't very interesting for your audience.
Try to think of the punctuation as musical notes telling you when to pause for a breath (or for dramatic effect!). Don't be tempted to take a little break at the end of each line - the piece might not make sense.
To understand this, first read the script below, pausing at the end of each line. Then try again using the punctuation as your guide for when to pause.
Juliet is waiting for the nurse to come home and tell her whether the wedding with Romeo is still on. Time is ticking and she's pretty fed up.
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood
She would be as swift in motion as a ball:
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
But old folks, many feign as they were dead -
Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.
Which way worked better? Using the punctuation as your guide makes it sound like a real person thinking aloud.

140,494,"> Graphs - Plotting ax + by = c
Graphs - Plotting ax + by = c
Tables work well when you're plotting graphs of the form y = mx + c, but what happens when the equation isn't in this form?
Plot the graph of 2y - 4x = 3
in the form y = mx + c. You need to rearrange the equation into a form with just the y value on the left of the equation.
So add 4x to both sides to give
To find y divide both sides by 2 to give
Now that you have found the equation in terms of y, you can plot the graph using the usual method.
Get from X to Y with this activity.

142,34,"Cube numbers are formed by multiplying a digit by itself three times.
For example 2 cubed is 2  2  2 = 8
3 cubed is 3  3  3 = 27
4 cubed is 4  4  4 = 64
Each cube number can be represented by a cube made up of unit cubes.
Use your calculator to find the next six cube numbers (from 5 onwards) - then check your answer.
125 = 5  5  5, 216 = 6  6  6, etc.
So the next six cube numbers are:
125, 216, 343, 512, 729 and 1000

145,386,"Here are two examples of instinctive behaviour in animals:
Instincts are useful because they do not have to be learned and they can be complex, like the examples above. Instincts let animals form groups for protection, choose mates, fight to be in charge, and show many other behaviours.
Reflexes are a type of instinct. They happen automatically because of a particular stimulus. For example, if your hand touches something hot by accident, it automatically and quickly moves away. You do not have to learn to do this.
In order to see this content you need to have both
When the school bell rings at the end of break time, the students leave the playground and go to their lessons. People may say that the students are acting on instinct. But they would be wrong.
An instinct is a behaviour that happens automatically without any learning needed. The students have learned that the bell is a signal to do something, so leaving the playground when the bell rings is not an instinct. It is learned behaviour.

147,477,"Many harmful microbes can pass from one person to another. Diseases caused by such microbes are said to be infectious diseases. Here are some ways that harmful microbes can be spread:
Droplets containing microbes fly into the air when people sneeze or cough. The microbes they contain get into other people if breathed in.
Chicken pox, colds, flu, measles and tuberculosis are spread like this.
Animals may carry harmful microbes. The microbes can get into a person who is scratched or bitten by such an animal.
is a tropical disease spread by a tiny fly called a mosquito.
Food can have harmful microbes in and on it. The microbes get into the body when the food is eaten, causing food poisoning. Thorough cooking kills most microbes, but they can survive under-cooking. Careless handling of food increases the risk from harmful microbes.
Microbes can be passed from one person to another when people touch each other, or when they touch something an infected person has handled. Athlete's food is spread like this.
Bacteria on the skin can be killed by antiseptics, and bacteria on surfaces can be killed by disinfectants. Washing your hands reduces the chance of spreading microbes.
Water can have harmful microbes in it. The microbes get into the body when the water is swallowed.

Inform, explain and describe - Add the senses
Another way to add detail to your descriptions is to use your senses. Think about what you can see, what you can touch, what you can smell, what you can taste and what you can hear. If we go back to your house, you might be able to add sounds, like music from your sister's room, the sound of the neighbour's lawnmower, or a baby crying upstairs.
Here's a typical writing to describe question:
Write a description of your school during a typical break. Include information about the buildings and the people. You might want to write about the classrooms, the hall, the playing fields and the corridors as well as the pupils and the staff.
Why not have a go at planning an answer to this question now? You could have a go at writing a full answer, or just jot down some points and details on rough paper.

, because if you place a mirror along it, the shape looks exactly the same as the original.
Another name for a mirror line is a
. This kind of symmetry can also be called '
Now look what happens when you fold the letter 'A' along some dotted lines.
The letter A is marked with fold lines
example does the folded part of the shape fit exactly over the original part. The dotted line is its line of symmetry.

the same as breathing (which is properly called ventilation).
The glucose and oxygen react together in the cells to produce carbon dioxide and water. The reaction is called
because oxygen from the air is needed for it to work.
Here is the word equation for aerobic respiration:
(Energy is released in the reaction. We show it in brackets in the equation because energy is not a substance.)
Now we will look at how glucose and oxygen get to the cells so that respiration can take place and how we get rid of the carbon dioxide.
, obtained through digestion of the food we eat. Digestion breaks food down into small molecules. These can be absorbed across the wall of the small intestine into the bloodstream.
Glucose is carried round the body dissolved in blood plasma, the pale yellow liquid part of our blood. The dissolved glucose can diffuse into the cells of the body from the
. Once in the cell glucose can be used in respiration.
When we breathe in oxygen enters the small air sacs, called
, in the lungs. Oxygen diffuses from there into the bloodstream.
Oxygen is not carried in the plasma, but is carried by the red blood cells. These contain a red substance called
, which joins onto oxygen and carries it around the body in the blood, then lets it go when necessary. Like glucose, oxygen can diffuse into cells from the capillaries.
Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body
Carbon dioxide from cells to the air
The carbon dioxide produced during respiration diffuses out of the cells and into the blood plasma. The blood carries it to the lungs. It then diffuses across the walls of the alveoli and into the air, ready to be exhaled.

159,126,"> Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.
For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.
By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.
You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:
Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:
In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:
To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:
Divide both sides by 2, to give:
a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7
b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7
When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers.
For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7.

165,1375,"Martin Parr talks about why he loves using a camera and how he decides what to take and which photos to use.
Martin Parr was born in Surrey in 1952 and is an acclaimed documentary photographer and photo-journalist.
He studied at Manchester Polytechnic and since then has used photography and film to take a critical look at mass tourism, food and the family amongst other subjects.
Martin Parr still shoots in medium-format colour but has experimented with fill-in flash and a 35mm ringflash camera.
His work can be poignant and joyful at the same time and conveys his natural curiosity:
Photography is the simplest way of articulating how I feel about the world.
I don't crop my pictures. I just move in and out with my feet. So if I want to get closer I won't change lens I'll just get nearer to the subject.

169,3123,"Decay is an essential life process, which helps to digest food and recycle materials. Bacteria and fungi are the main groups of decomposer. They release enzymes to break down compounds, so that they can absorb the nutrients. We can preserve our food, for example by freezing or canning, to remove the conditions needed for decay to occur.
Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another.
Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
Intensive farming practices include growing high-yield crops, using fertilisers and pesticides and keeping animals indoors. Food production is increased but there are unwelcome side effects.
Organic farming bans chemical inputs and has a less harmful effect on the environment but often produces less, more expensive food.
Hydroponics is the production of food using nutrient-rich solution rather than soil.
Leaves enable photosynthesis to happen. Photosynthesis is the process by which leaves absorb light and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrate (food) for plants to grow. Leaves are adapted to perform their function eg they have a large surface area to absorb sunlight.
Plants use minerals from the soil to build the complex molecules they need to survive and grow. Poor plant growth may be due to a deficiency of one or more minerals. Tests can be done to establish which mineral is deficient or a general purpose NPK fertiliser added.
Plants have two different types of 'transport' tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots.
The element carbon is the present in all living organisms. It's recycled through various processes, which are described in the carbon cycle.
Nitrogen is essential for the formation of amino acids to make proteins. The nitrogen cycle describes the ways in which nitrogen is recycled.
Osmosis is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low water concentration through a partially permeable membrane. Osmosis takes place in all living cells.
Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis through their root hair cells. Plants use water for several vital processes including photosynthesis and transporting minerals.
All substances are made from atoms. Each atom is made of a nucleus - containing protons and neutrons - surrounded by electrons.
The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. The elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in ascending order of atomic number.
The mass number of an atom is the total of protons plus neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and hence different mass numbers) are called isotopes of that element.
A covalent bond is formed between non metal atoms, which combine together by sharing electrons. Covalent compounds have no free electrons and no ions so they don't conduct electricity.
The Periodic Table is an arrangement of the elements in order of atomic number. Elements in the same vertical column are in the same group or family and have similar chemical properties.
Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid using electricity. When ionic compounds are molten or dissolved in water the ions are free to move.
When sulfuric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen is produced at the cathode (negative electrode) and oxygen at the anode (positive electrode). Aluminium is extracted from the mineral bauxite using the process of electrolysis.
All matter is made of atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements, and each one has a symbol. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other.
When atoms of different elements join together they make a compound. Compounds are represented by formulae that show how many atoms of each element are in the compound. Formulae can be worked out from the charge of the ions that make up the compound.
Chemical reactions can be written down as balanced chemical equations.
The Group 1 elements in the Periodic Table are known as the alkali metals. They include lithium, sodium and potassium, which all react vigorously with air and water.
The reactivity of the alkali metals increases down the group. Flame tests are used to identify alkali metal ions in compounds.
The Group 7 elements are also known as the halogens. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, which all have seven electrons in their outer shell.
In a displacement reaction a less reactive element is
Ionic bonding occurs between positive and negative ions, which attract each other and bind together to form ionic compounds. For example, sodium chloride consists of Na
Each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions held in place by electrostatic attraction and forming an ionic crystal lattice. The ions in a crystal lattice are very strongly bonded - a high temperature is required to melt the crystal.
The physical properties of different metals make them useful for different purposes. For example, aluminium conducts heat, which makes it a useful material for making saucepans and gold is shiny, which makes it an attractive material for jewellery.
Metal particles are held together by strong metallic bonds, which is why they have high melting and boiling points. The loose electrons in metals can all move together through the metal  creating an electric current.
The elements in the middle section of the Periodic Table are the transition elements. They're all metals with typical metallic properties eg conducting heat and electricity. They often form coloured compounds.
Transition metal carbonates undergo thermal decomposition - a reaction in which a substance is broken down into at least two other substances by heat.
Transition metal hydroxides are insoluble in water. They can be precipitated out of a transitional metal compound solution using sodium hydroxide solution.

171,5815,"W B Yeats: Song of the Old Mother
Yeats wrote a great deal about the passage of time, and of youth and beauty giving way to old age and death.
A central, unifying idea that runs through a text or performance.
. The poem contrasts two types of human endeavour: the young women's dreams of love and obsession with appearance; and the hard, grinding, thankless work that is the Old Mother's lot.
An interesting cross-current is set going by our uncertainty about who the young women are.
Are they the Old Mother's own children? If so, their idleness is easier to forgive. Perhaps in her youth the old woman herself dreamed of love, lay late in bed, and obsessed about whether her ribbons matched. Perhaps, as old people often do, she has forgotten what it's like to be young!
Or are they the children of the old woman's rich employers? If they are, we are more likely to view them as spoilt and selfish young people whose idle lives are made possible only by the drudgery of poor servants like the Old Mother.
And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress:
While I must work because I am old,
And the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold.'

172,4852,"Generators can be turned directly, for example, by:
When electricity is generated using wave, wind, tidal or hydroelectric power (HEP) there are two steps:
Generators can be turned indirectly using fossil or nuclear fuels. The heat from the fuel boils water to make steam, which expands and pushes against the blades of a
. The spinning turbine then turns the generator.
These are the steps by which electricity is generated from fossil fuels:
Heat is released from fuel and boils the water to make steam.
The turbine turns a generator and electricity is produced.
The electricity goes to the transformers to produce the correct voltage.

Female homesteader, contemplating her life on the Plains
Early settlers and homesteader on the Plains faced huge problems. The burden of many of these fell on the women, whose lives were burdensome and unpleasant:
There was little wood to build log cabins.
Settlers built 'sod houses', while they lived out of doors - people did their cooking on an open fire.
Outdoor toilets and open wells. The sod houses leaked, and fleas and bedbugs lived in them 'by the million'. It was impossible to disinfect the floor. As a result the death rate, especially from diphtheria, was high.
A 'good thick coat of whitewash' killed bedbugs. 'A layer of clay' stopped leaks. Homesteaders eventually built more modern houses.
There was no wood for fuel, and no shops to buy items such as candles and soap. A typical household had only two buckets, some crockery and one cracked cup. There was no water and little food.
A travelling shoe-maker or tinker might pass through who would provide or mend household items, but usually families just had to make do. The women collected 'buffalo chips' for fuel, stoked the stove, and made their own candles and soap. 'I have often wondered how my mother stood it', wrote an early settler.
No doctors or midwives. No social life 'because of the distances between farmhouses'. In the winter families were shut in 'and longed for spring'.
People had to make the most of any trip to their nearest town, where the women talked of the harvest and the men smoked corncob pipes and talked politics.
Local government was non-existent, and some early lawmen (such as Henry Plummer) were worse than the bandits.
Law courts and sheriffs such as Wyatt Earp slowly established law and order.
To familiarise yourself with the content of this Revision Bite, reproduce the problems faced by
Settlers without the money to pay for land, who live on and cultivate land acquired under the Homestead Laws from the United States public lands.
, and the solutions they found, in the form of one or both of the following:

Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. 'Attitude' can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
How do you think this poem should be read?
In a confused voice, as if the girl cannot decide whether she is more Pakistani or English?
Wistfully, as if she regrets having lost her original culture?
Gratefully, as she thinks about the beautiful, exotic gifts?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
In an interview, Moniza Alvi has said:
Growing up, I felt that my origins were invisible, because there weren't many people to identify with in Hatfield at that time of a mixed race background or indeed from any other race, so I felt there was a bit of a blank drawn over that. I think I had a fairly typically English 1950s/1960s upbringing.
When I eventually went to Pakistan, I certainly didn't feel that was home, I'd never felt so English. But I never feel entirely at home in England, and, of course, I'm not part of the Asian community at all. And it feels a bit odd sometimes that because of the group of poems that I've written about my Asian background, I sometimes tend to be identified as a black writer. I tend to think of England as being very culturally mixed now.
But it's important to know where you come from, which is perhaps what I was lacking as a child. I think it's important to know what has gone into your making, even quite far back, I think it gives you a sense perhaps of richness.

The poem seems to be spoken by a BBC newsreader.
He or she explains why the BBC thinks it is important to read the news in a 'BBC accent': no one will take the news seriously if it's read with a 'voice lik/wanna yoo/scruff'.
He or she speaks here in the accent of an ordinary speaker/viewer - just the kind of voice the newsreader is rejecting.
A newsreader would never really reveal his or her prejudices directly to the viewer in this way. So what the newsreader 'says' in this poem perhaps needs to be seen as the unspoken message (or
) of the way the news is presented.
Formal, official, 'book-English'. The opposite of dialect or slang.
. Would it carry the same 'trooth'?

178,3802,"Sea water contains a number of dissolved salts. When these salts dissolve in water, the ions separate. Sea water therefore contains a mixture of ions. The most common ions in sea water are shown in the table:
It is possible to deduce from the table which salts dissolved to form the mixture of ions:
When sodium chloride dissolves it forms sodium ions and chloride ions.
When magnesium chloride dissolves it forms magnesium and chloride ions.
When magnesium sulfate dissolves if forms magnesium ions and sulfate ions.
When potassium chloride dissolves it forms potassium ions and chloride ions.
When potassium bromide dissolves it forms potassium ions and bromide ions.
You can use the charge on the ions shown in the table to work out the formulae of the ionic compounds.
. For the charges to cancel out in the neutral salt sodium chloride, they must be in a ration of 1:1. So the formula of sodium chloride is NaCl.
. For the charges to cancel out in the neutral salt magnesium chloride, they must be in a ration of 1:2. So the formula of magnesium chloride is MgCl
Put down that pen and listen to some additional Science audio.

The exact details of the funeral ceremonies, which form the last of the
, final reincarnation), vary according to tradition and place. Funerals are usually conducted by a priest and by the eldest son of the deceased.
Various rituals may take place around the dead body:
a lamp is placed by the head of the body
(rice balls) are placed in the coffin
(necklace of wooden beads) may be put around the dead persons neck as may garlands of flowers
How the cremation takes place depends on where this happens.
In the United Kingdom the coffin will be closed and taken to a crematorium.
A hindu funeral on the River Ganges
In India people hope to have their funeral at the burning ghats on the shores of the sacred river Ganga (Ganges). Here the body is placed on a large pile of wood, then the eldest son says the appropriate Vedic prayers and lights the fire. Incense and ghee (cooked and clarified butter) are poured into the flames.
Prayers are said for the dead person:
O Supreme light, lead us from untruth to truth, from darkness to light and from death to immortality.
Afterwards the ashes of the deceased are sprinkled on water. Many people take the ashes to India to put on the waters of the Ganga; others may take them to the sea near to where they live.
After the funeral the widow or widower will wear white as a sign of mourning. The close family may mourn for twelve days.
Sacraments designed to initiate a new stage of life. There is usually a total of 16 such rites of passage (though many Hindus do not practice them all).

The presence of a potentially harmful substance that can reduce quality of a natural resource, such as water, and have knock-on impacts on the environment.
. Industrial pollution can affect the environment in a number of ways:
It may damage the well-being of humans and other species - for example, it can pollute drinking-water supplies or poison plants and animals.
It may interfere with natural processes - for example, it could change local climatic conditions or destroy wildlife habitats.
It may impact on people's livelihoods - for example, pollution of the sea will hurt people who are involved in fishing and tourism.
Some governments have introduced legislation to try to cut down on avoidable pollution and to encourage industries that are more
Sustainable means using something or doing something in a way that minimises damage to the environment and which avoids using up natural resources, eg by using renewable rather than scarce resources.
. These laws need to be enforced by courts.
A recent example of courts taking action against a company for causing pollution was in 2004 when a US court ordered the oil company
to pay 2.5bn for an oil spill in 1989.
ran aground while off course. It spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil contaminating over 1,300 miles of the coast of Alaska. It is estimated that the spill killed as many as 250,000 seabirds, 3,000 sea otters, 300 seals and 22 killer whales.
The court wanted Exxon to pay to help compensate those people in Alaska whose livelihoods were hurt the worst. The 2.5bn pay out is the latest ruling in a long-running court case.

Listen to the poem and watch the slideshow
The squat pen rests: snug as a gun.
Under my window, a clean rasping sound
When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:
Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds
Bends low, comes up twenty years away
The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft
Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep
To scatter new potatoes that we picked
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
By God the old man could handle a spade.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day
Than any other man on Toner's bog.
Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
To drink it, then fell to right away
Over his shoulder, going down and down
The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head.
But I've no spade to follow men like them.

In this poem Heaney sees his father, an old man, digging the flowerbeds. He remembers how his younger, stronger father used to dig in the potato fields when Heaney was a child - and how his grandfather, before that, was an expert turf digger. Heaney knows that he has no spade to follow men like them - he is a writer, not a farmer - so will dig with his pen. He will 'dig' into his past.

uses helps to convey his ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is blunt. It is only when we have read the poem carefully that we realise that all three generation are involved in digging: his grandfather dug turf, his father dug up potatoes, Heaney is digging up his memories and his past.
The verb formation which describes the time at which the action occurred, eg past, present or future.
as Heaney describes seeing his elderly father straining among the flowerbeds, then goes into the past tense when he remembers his father and grandfather at work. The last two stanzas return to the present, when Heaney realises that his work is to write. The final line, however, is in the future tense, to emphasise Heaney's determination -
Heaney remembers his own role in the digging: he and other children would gather the new potatoes that his father dug up, and he was responsible for taking milk to his grandfather on Toner's bog. It was this involvement that enabled him to watch his father and grandfather at work and describe their movements so precisely.
His father was clearly skilled at his work. Heaney remembers him
(line 8) and his boot and his knee fitted the spade perfectly (lines 10/11). He uses technical terms (lug, shaft) to stress that the spade is a precise tool.
""By God, the old man could handle a spade""
(line 15) is a simple, loving exclamation of pride.
He was also proud of his grandfather, who was so keen to work that he hardly stopped when Heaney brought him some milk. His work was precise -

(line 16) suggests not only Heaney's affection for his grandfather, but his father's affection for him too: the love between them bonds the three generations.
Heaney does not explain exactly why he has
""no spade to follow men like them""
(line 28). Do you think he feels he is not physically strong enough for this type of work? Or that he is no longer emotionally equipped for it, having broken the family tradition of working the land? Does he fear his grandfather and father might not approve of his having left the land?

His pen becomes a metaphorical spade. This suggests that his pen is his tool, just as the spades were tools for his father and grandfather. It also suggests that Heaney wants to 'go back to his roots' - to dig into his past through his writing.

of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
in a regretful tone, because Heaney is not outside digging too, and feels he somehow ought to be?
in a proud tone, as Heaney is displaying the skills of his father and grandfather for everyone to appreciate?
in a loving tone, as if the poem is a gift to his father and grandfather?
Well, Heaney's description of his father and grandfather is very loving. He values his sense of connection with them, and he is clearly very proud of the work they did, even though he has
them. Far from regretting his break with the family's traditional work on the land, Heaney asserts that he is continuing their work, by digging with his pen.
The ideas in this poem concern our relationship to our forebears, and to work. Heaney describes his relationship to his father and grandfather purely in terms of their work on the land. He takes the idea of digging, the commonest form of work in any rural community, and uses it as a

Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
There is a sense of Heaney's love of the earth throughout the poem. His father and grandfather seem to be in harmony with the earth; he himself, as a child, loved picking up the potatoes that the earth produced.
By God, the old man could handle a spade.
This reminds us that Heaney's father is now an old man, but also shows his fondness for him: old man is a common term of affection. Heaney is clearly proud of him too.

Heaney boasts about his grandfather's skill - he presents him as a champion digger. Perhaps the young Heaney boasted as a child to his friends about his grandfather's ability.

These roots are both actual roots the grandfather's spade cuts through, and Heaney's metaphorical roots in the land and in his family. Even though he doesn't dig with a spade like his father and grandfather, these roots are still alive in his mind.
In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems deal with the bonds between the generations - in Clarke's poem a mother addresses her child, while in Heaney's a son talks about his father and grandfather.
Both poems make us think about the relationship between parents (especially fathers) and their children
But in Heaney's poem the relationship is very specific and particular, while in Blake's poem it is not so much a real father, as a symbolic one...
Both poems deal with the relationship between generations, and both describe hard, physical work
But the Old Mother is bitter about the drudgery which she must do; while Heaney's poem celebrates the work as creative.
In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other. The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas, and attitudes and tone
Compare Digging with two other post-1914 poems and one pre-1914 poem of your choice that present the relationship between a parent and child. How do the poets show the nature of the relationships?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Gillian Clark's Catrin, Seamus Heaney's Follower, and William Blake's Little Boy Lost/Little Boy Found.
What would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing Digging with each of these three poems.
Catrin is from mother to a child, while Digging is from a child to a father (and grandfather).
Catrin suggests that relationships between parents and their children are not always harmonious, but Digging shows no conflict.
Catrin explores how a mother and child are bound together through the actual birth; Digging suggests that different generations are bound by sharing the same occupation - Heaney, his father and grandfather all 'dig'.
Both of Heaney's poems show the contrast between his father as an old man and his younger self.
Both describe his expertise in farm work as a means of illustrating Heaney's admiration for is father.
In both poems, the young Heaney is present in the fields, but in Digging he was helpful, gathering in the potatoes, while he was a nuisance in Follower.
There is a determination at the end of Digging to work and explore the past, but there is a hint of frustration in Follower - today It is my father who keeps stumbling Behind me, and will not go away.
Heaney gives us a detailed description of his father and grandfather at work, but we are given no visual impression of the father in Blake's poem.
Blake's boy becomes lost as no father was there, which suggests he was irresponsible, but Heaney shows that his father worked hard to provide food for his family.
Digging suggests a close family relationship. Blake, though, shows the love of the boy's weeping mother and the ever nigh love of God.
Blake's poem implies praise of God ' the father' of us all, while Heaney's poem shows his personal love and respect of his father and grandfather.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

Don't panic if you don't know what a word means. Look through all the choices and eliminate the ones you know aren't the right answer.
Be careful! Sometimes the question tries to mislead you by offering you information you don't need.

The basic units of genetic material inherited from our parents. A gene is a section of DNA which controls part of a cell's chemistry - particularly protein production.
in the same places. But there are different versions of the same gene.
Different versions of the same gene are called
, which is pronounced al-eels. For example, the gene for eye colour has an allele for blue eye colour and an allele for brown. For any gene, a person may have the same two alleles, or two different ones.
Alleles may be either recessive or dominant.
allele only shows if the individual has two copies of it. For example, the allele for blue eyes is recessive. You need two copies of this allele to have blue eyes.
allele always shows, even if the individual only has one copy of it. For example, the allele for brown eyes is dominant. You only need one copy of it to have brown eyes. Two copies will still give you brown eyes.
Individuals A and B have brown eyes - only individual C has blue eyes
Only individual C will have blue eyes, because the allele for blue eyes is recessive.
because, even though they have brown eyes, they still carry the allele for blues eyes and can pass this allele on to future generations.

187,2243,"Texture is the way surfaces look and feel. Artists can create the illusion of texture in their drawings and paintings. For example think about how an artist could paint a wet pavement, dried autumn leaves, delicate silk sheets or slices of a juicy melon.
Apart from creating the illusion of texture in your artwork you could also make:
prints from textured surfaces by creating a
A type of relief print made from an assortment of found materials such as card, string, sandpaper, embossed wallpaper, tinfoil, in fact anything that's relatively flat and textured.
A collage is an image that is made up of a mixture of materials, such as newspaper, magazine cuttings, string and so on.
A collotype can be made by layering corrugated card, bubble wrap, string, sandpaper, embossed wallpaper, tin foil, thick areas of pva glue - in fact anything with a texture - onto a base. This can then be inked-up and printed from.
Examine the textures in the images below by clicking on them to see a bigger version. (If you have Flash, click Magnify to see the detail - to remove the viewfinder just click Magnify again.)
This student has created a collotype by gluing different materials to a cardboard base to create a tactile, textural surface to print from.
Take a look at this photo of a student's collage below:
Which words from the list below would you use to describe the textures in the collage above?
abrasive, bumpy, coarse, corrugated, crackled, feathery, flat, fluffy, furry, fuzzy, glittery, glossy, gooey, hairy, leathery, prickly, puffy, rough, rusty, sandy, sharp, shiny, slimy, smooth, soft, spiky, uneven, velvety, wet, wrinkled.

191,4317,"Nylon has some desirable properties. It does not let ultraviolet light pass through it, and it is:
Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.
Gore-Tex has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.
Teflon is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.
