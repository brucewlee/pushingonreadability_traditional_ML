25,"I have never begun a novel with more misgiving. If I call it a novel it is only because I don't know what else to call it. I have little story to tell and I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my recollections of a man with whom I was thrown into close contact only at long intervals, and I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I suppose that by the exercise of invention I could fill the gaps plausibly enough and so make my narrative more coherent; but I have no wish to do that. I only want to set down what I know.
To save embarrassment to people still living I have given to the persons who play a part in this story names of my own contriving, and I have in other ways taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature. Then it will be quite clear of whom I write in this book and those who want to know at least a little about his early life may find in it something to their purpose. I think my book, within its acknowledged limitations, will be a useful source of information to my friend's biographers.
I do not pretend that the conversations I have recorded can be regarded as verbatim reports. I never kept notes of what was said on this or the other occasions, but I have a good memory for what concerns me, and though I have put these conversations in my own words they faithfully represent, I believe, what was said. I remarked a little while back that I have invented nothing but I have taken the liberty that historians have taken to put into the mouths of the persons of my narrative speeches that I did not myself hear and could not possibly have heard. I have done this for the same reasons that the historians have, to give liveliness and verisimilitude to scenes that would have been ineffective if they had been merely recounted. I want to be read and I think I am justified in doing what I can to make my book readable. The intelligent reader will easily see for himself where I have used this artifice, and he is at perfect liberty to reject it.
Another reason that has caused me to embark upon this work with apprehension is that the persons I have chiefly to deal with are of another culture. It is very difficult to know people and I don't think one can ever really know any but one's own countrymen. For men and women are not only themselves; they are also the region in which they were born, the city apartment or the farm in which they learnt to walk, the games they played as children, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed and the poets they read. It is all these things that have made them what they are, and these are the things that you cant come to know by hearsay, you can only know them if you have lived them. You can only know if you are them. And because you cannot know persons of a nation foreign to you except from observation, it is difficult to give them credibility in the pages of a book. I have never attempted to deal with any but my own countrymen, and if I have ventured to do otherwise in short stories it is because in them you can treat your characters more summarily.

15,"Fashion

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon, entirely dependent upon nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism for its development. Most historians of fashion are at pains to point out, though, that fashion, at least in the sense of style and design, has a very long history. They often take the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as their starting point.
As societies have developed in complexity, populations have expanded, and multiple technologies for producing an increasing variety of clothing and physical adornment have been discovered, so the meanings attached to dress have also increased in their complexity and significance. Consequently, it is difficult to say with any degree of certainty today what any item of clothing or adornment actually means. For example, a man's suit, supposedly an indicator of the most extreme uniformity, actually conveys very differing meanings in different contexts and to different people.

Writer

Newspaper reports of publishers in bidding wars over whizz-kid manuscripts have resulted in a skewed idea of what life is like for your average novelist. Down at my end of the business - i.e. not exactly topping the best-seller lists - there are two ways of making ends meet. The wisest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that will still be there even if the book doesn't immediately get snapped up and turned into a film. Those such as myself, however, are literary odd-jobbers, subsisting on a bit of teaching, the occasional workshop and articles like this. I have heard tell of an in-house writing opportunity offered by a chocolate factory, but I've never managed to get anything like that. Somehow, though, by dint of juggling part-time jobs and credit cards and also, more often than not, thanks to the generosity of those names you find in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.

Sudden Fame

The small venues we were performing at around the country were all beginning to sell out and extra bouncers were having to be called in to hold back the growing legion of screaming girls. We found ourselves having to use secret entrances to the village halls and ballrooms we were playing to prevent ourselves being mobbed by fans. On the few nights a week when we were not working, we found it difficult to leave the house without being pursued through the streets by adoring followers. In a matter of days, we had been transformed into celebrities. Our moves were monitored by our admirers and all of our needs catered for by our management and other interested parties. Even though the shyness that had always accompanied me never quite went away, it was replaced by a strange naive over-confidence that only naturally shy people who have been thrust into similar situations can relate to. In short, I was emotionally totally out of my

64,"Music - The Challenge Ahead

Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work, at home and in our leisure activities. Susan Hallam discusses their impact on music in Britain.

In the latter part of the 20th century, we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos and a rapidly developing range of multi-media techniques. Along with this, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians.
There seems little doubt that the widening access to music is likely to continue, fulfilling as it does so many human needs. On a national level, no major state occasion is without music. For individuals, it provides opportunities for numerous activities, formal and informal.
Indeed, a society without music is surely unthinkable and it seems that the issue is not whether there will be music in the 21st century but what the nature of that music will be, and also whether there will be a continued perceived need for people to learn to play musical instruments.
I would respond to the latter question on a positive note. The music industry is one of the major generators of income in Britain and musical skill and talent will continue to be important in preparing individuals to work in a variety of professions, in particular those related to the media.
In addition to its vocational significance, there is a growing body of evidence that playing an instrument may be beneficial to the development of skills at an earlier stage. Research in the USA has suggested that listening to or actively making music has a direct positive effect on spatial reasoning, one aspect of the measurement of intelligence.
While these results are still to be successfully replicated, other data from Europe has indicated that an increase in group music lessons can have positive effects on social relationships in school and on concentration in young children and those with behavioural difficulties.
Taking the idea behind such findings one step further, current research is investigating to what extent playing an instrument may even encourage the development of transferable skills. For instance, the need to practise regularly may assist in the acquisition of good study habits and focused concentration, playing in concerts may encourage habits of punctuality and good organisation.
For all these reasons, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term. What about the longer term picture? Is there likely to be a shift in focus and, if so, what direction will it take?
While there are many possible scenarios, I believe that two possibilities are likely. Firstly, the kinds of music to which people will listen will become more diverse. New genres will develop which will integrate different styles. Secondly, there will be an increase in the use of technology to compose and perform music. This will widen access to composition as there will be less reliance on technical skill but at the same time, it is likely to further reduce the need for live performance and musicians whose role is solely related to it.
Developing in parallel with this trend is a likely increase in the number of people, across the whole age range, who wish to actively participate in music making. Such activities are likely to be community based and will reflect the musical traditions of that community whatever they may be.
If this vision of the future is to be realised, what does the music profession need to do in preparation? The focus of instrumental tuition will need to change. Ways will need to be found to enable more people to learn to play a range of instruments, throughout their life span. 
As a result, the impact on the instrumental curriculum and the measures used to assess progress through it will be such that they will need to adapt to maintain their relevance for a broader sector of the population. Ultimately, they will need to encompass a wider range of musical skills.
Crucial to the success of the process will be the training of musicians. They will need to be able to motivate, inspire and teach learners of all ages, develop skills for working with large and diverse groups and acquire the communication, social, entrepreneurial and management skills necessary for community work.
This represents a fundamental change from traditional practice and it will be accompanied by the need to respond to demands for public accountability. Viewed positively, this should provide an opportunity for all those involved in music education to demonstrate the high quality of music tuition available.
Finally, we need to strive towards raising the profile of music itself. Music plays a crucial role in our lives but all too often it is taken for granted. Those involved in the music profession at all levels need to work actively together to ensure that this changes.

Sometimes it seems that no matter how many possessions you have, you never feel secure. While it is reasonable to have a basic nesting instinct and create a home which meets your needs, there is a point where the motivation for acquiring things gets out of control. Modern advertising is moreover deliberately designed to play on our insecurities.If you don't have one of these you will be a lesser human being is one of the consistent underlying messages we receive. To discover just how much you are influenced, I challenge you to try not to read any advertising billboards next time you go down the street. These multi-million dollar messages relentlessly condition us in very persuasive ways without our ever realising it. We are bombarded by them - television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, tee shirts, the internet, you name it - all encouraging us to buy, buy, buy.

Caves

Research establishments and university departments around the world have invested years of research time in all aspects of caves, mainly their origins, their hydrology and their biology. Caves constitute a small but rather mysterious component of the natural environment - as such they arouse our curiosity and challenge our desire for knowledge, and consequently have had a considerable amount of research effort devoted to them. Furthermore, because of their presence as natural phenomena, they have had a long history of study, which has been intensified in those parts of the world where caves have had a direct effect on our way of life. However, the physical agility required to visit many caves means that cave research has been less in the hands of the learned professors than in most other scientific fields. Indeed there is a considerable, perhaps unique, overlap between the professional, scientific study of caves and the amateur studies carried out by those who mainly visit caves for sport.

Weather Watch

Countless observant people without any instruments other than their own senses originally laid the foundations of meteorology, which has progressed since the 17th century into the highly technical science of today. Satellites and electronic instruments relay endless weather information to us with the minimum of delay, computers solve in minutes abstruse mathematical sums at a speed beyond the capability of the human brain. Meteorological theory is peppered with long words which have little meaning to the non-professional. It sometimes seems there is no room left for simple weather wisdom, but nothing could be further from the truth. Human experience is still the vital ingredient which translates computed data into weather forecasts. Human observations can still provide unusual evidence which is of great help to professionals who are trying to unravel the mysteries of the atmosphere.",4,CPE,1,0.13066533207893372,0.2536013126373291,0.20928697288036344,0.17211665213108066,0.2343297004699707,1,0.1465732306241989,0.2442984580993653,0.2048221230506897,0.2177978157997132,0.1865084320306778,4,0.10623479634523393,0.1999649703502655,0.17885391414165494,0.2306208312511444,0.2843254506587982,1,0.15463517606258392,0.2394842952489853,0.17223045229911804,0.22828349471092224,0.2053665816783905,4,0.10232886672019956,0.14668305218219754,0.16568998992443085,0.2478121817111969,0.3374858796596527,4,0.07028738409280777,0.12657903134822845,0.1804790943861008,0.21931299567222595,0.4033414721488953,4,0.09734953939914703,0.14818890392780304,0.19295528531074524,0.2570664584636688,0.3044397234916687,4,0.05860516056418419,0.1048792153596878,0.203990638256073,0.2410850077867508,0.3914399743080139,4,0.05099921301007272,0.09762660413980484,0.19509129226207733,0.2564305067062378,0.3998523354530335,4,0.05975839123129845,0.11645466834306716,0.20228829979896545,0.2949103116989136,0.3265882134437561,4,0.04653037339448929,0.08880645781755447,0.1947242021560669,0.3055858910083771,0.3643530309200287,4,0.03363155573606491,0.07049193233251573,0.19431328773498527,0.2707132995128632,0.4308499991893768,4,0.033237963914871216,0.06789017468690872,0.19325584173202515,0.2895241677761078,0.4160918593406677,4,0.03646961972117424,0.06958021968603134,0.19497601687908173,0.3237940371036529,0.3751800954341888,4,0.037223897874355316,0.07125155627727509,0.1971680372953415,0.3281713426113129,0.3661852478981018,3,0.10058820992708206,0.2320164293050766,0.2088979184627533,0.2584109902381897,0.20008641481399536,3,0.0975305363535881,0.2176194936037064,0.1911037713289261,0.3120166659355164,0.18172958493232727,3,0.08451026678085327,0.15887601673603058,0.16884858906269073,0.3768576979637146,0.2109074890613556,3,0.08138582110404967,0.13106894493103027,0.18157292902469635,0.3606330454349518,0.2453392446041107,3,0.07675092667341232,0.13361342251300812,0.1805720925331116,0.3071208596229553,0.3019426465034485,4,0.07231578975915909,0.1532321274280548,0.17411407828330994,0.25938230752944946,0.3409557342529297,4,0.0584612675011158,0.12470660358667375,0.17323479056358335,0.28534558415412903,0.35825175046920776,4,0.04875747114419937,0.09685853868722916,0.17349109053611755,0.29268699884414673,0.3882058262825012,4,0.041663948446512215,0.0816480740904808,0.1589827984571457,0.3169493079185486,0.4007558524608612,4,0.03611291944980621,0.06893105059862137,0.14417113363742828,0.3492494225502014,0.4015354812145233,4,0.030069073662161824,0.05732166767120361,0.14111106097698212,0.3702187836170197,0.4012794196605681,4,0.025977719575166702,0.05075355991721153,0.13935312628746033,0.3867615163326264,0.3971540927886963,4,0.020582258701324463,0.04650310054421425,0.13856561481952667,0.36539754271507263,0.4289515018463135,4,0.01862115412950516,0.04441385343670845,0.13325907289981842,0.3629715442657471,0.4407343566417694,4,0.01821289956569672,0.043595973402261734,0.13132977485656738,0.3652804493904114,0.4415809512138367,4,0.18908026814460754,0.2011035680770874,0.20362655818462366,0.20222608745098114,0.2039634883403778,4,0.1886132508516312,0.19256754219532013,0.1893218159675598,0.21227167546749115,0.21722573041915894,4,0.1917557418346405,0.1970805376768112,0.1820545196533203,0.2090209424495697,0.22008831799030304,4,0.19463808834552765,0.19125880300998688,0.1845384985208512,0.210809126496315,0.21875551342964167,3,0.18566055595874786,0.1917586624622345,0.19598692655563354,0.21361960470676425,0.21297422051429749,4,0.17228712141513824,0.1845259070396424,0.20905865728855133,0.2120843529701233,0.222043976187706,4,0.09836240112781523,0.1262475550174713,0.2305123507976532,0.26240068674087524,0.2824769914150238,4,0.04148787632584572,0.09558868408203124,0.2193273901939392,0.24358464777469635,0.40001142024993896,4,0.0366445854306221,0.07180670648813248,0.2585785984992981,0.24229905009269714,0.3906709849834442,4,0.015299505554139612,0.03259354829788208,0.2672157883644104,0.3093770146369934,0.3755141794681549,3,0.009952903725206852,0.02542972378432751,0.2079077661037445,0.3819705247879028,0.3747391402721405,4,0.009241310879588129,0.021424038335680958,0.17109757661819458,0.3674303591251373,0.4308066666126251,4,0.00884954258799553,0.016034452244639397,0.11877037584781648,0.3140403926372528,0.5423052310943604,4,0.007934723980724813,0.015186372213065624,0.11523450911045074,0.3077598810195923,0.5538844466209412,4,0.007324876729398966,0.015587756410241129,0.13441312313079834,0.3234456777572632,0.5192285776138306,2,0.17246900498867035,0.1658783257007599,0.2917354106903076,0.1626828759908676,0.2072344273328781,2,0.12826457619667053,0.09247304499149324,0.3143255412578583,0.20897038280963887,0.2559664249420166,3,0.03356748819351196,0.07026664912700653,0.2534918189048767,0.4000045657157898,0.2426694482564926,2,0.035992678254842765,0.12330915033817293,0.3157849013805389,0.2712846398353577,0.2536286413669586,2,0.02427605353295803,0.09803804755210876,0.3934895992279053,0.18915988504886627,0.2950

65,"Metals

It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Sitting by the side of a river, waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw, or just idling away a moment, one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. It did not have the feel of stone, but it was attractive. In such a way, one could conjecture that gold entered the lives of primitive people.
Given the malleability of the metal, it very soon became a much sought-after material. Copper may also have been discovered by accident, and once the value of copper tools was realised, the search for its ores and for ways of getting the copper out of them was pursued with vigour. Thus, metalworking was added to our ancestors' battery of life-enhancing accomplishments.

St Ives

There was silence as we lugged our bags down the winding, cobbled lane that led to the heart of town, bent double against the force eight gale and trying in vain to avoid the icy waves that smashed over the promenade. There was no one on the streets and the shutters in every cottage on the waterfront were bolted tight against the battering. We had watched the weather worsen as we chugged into St Ives on the tiny single-track railway. As the ominous grey skies closed in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season - without a car - no longer seemed such a good idea. I had lured my friend into joining me with the promise of walks along the beautiful Cornish coast, and snug evenings, toasting ourselves before open fires.

Computer Modelling

The problem with studying the past is that it is past. The people who prospered in times of peace and plenty and struggled through conflict and drought are long dead. The forces that drove them to settle here or move there, that brought them together as families and clans, villages and cities, have faded from memory. Archaeology provides hints and clues, but we cannot test our hypotheses with experiments on cultures living or dead. We cannot rewind the tape and watch a replay of the past. Then again, perhaps we can.
Computer modelling allows us to recreate prehistoric landscapes and environments and populate them with virtual communities - digital creations with some of the needs, independence and capabilities of real-world humans. We can establish rules of conduct and replicate social units.

13,"Holiday reading

Summer promises us two of life's great joys: escaping home and reading books - joys that are, of course, intimately connected. Books may help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands because there are fewer human types than there are people. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match. What was shy and confused within us is unapologetically and cogently phrased in them, a congruence all the more striking if the work was written by someone in a far-flung place or in another age. We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are.
Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place: except perhaps during our reading of a great book, which guides us to the interest of things we had previously ignored. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about. 

Author's Note

These travel reflections were all published as articles in the Observer newspaper over a seven-year period. Here and there I have restored some small cuts by the editor, which had to be made if the piece was to fit the page, but otherwise I have added very little. The occasional outright howler has been corrected, but only if it was a matter of detail which I should have got right in the first place. Hindsight would have allowed further improvements, but there would have been no end to the process. In the second article about China, for example, it seemed likely at the time, and for some time after, that the Hong Kong dollar would hold up. A year later it fell. If I were to rewrite the piece so as to predict this fact, it would become a claim to prescience, or at any rate no longer a report written at that moment. But like any other flying visitor, in South East Asia or anywhere else, I was there at that moment, ignorant as to what would happen next, and fully occupied with making the most elementary sense of what had happened already. That has been the real story of mass jet travel: the world opening up to people who have no qualifications for exploring it except the price of a ticket. But I have never been able to believe that all my fellow travellers were quite blind. Even a postcard can be written with a purpose.

Ecotourism

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been hijacked, diluted and misused, then 'ecotourism' would earn top prize. The term first surfaced in the early 1980s, reflecting a surge in environmental awareness and a realisation by tour operators that many travellers wanted to believe their presence abroad would not have a negative impact. It rapidly became the hottest marketing tag a holiday could carry.
These days the ecotourism label has broadened out to cover anything from a two-week tour living with remote tribes, to a one-hour motor boat trip through an Australian gorge. In fact, any tour that involves cultural interaction, natural beauty spots, wildlife or a dash of soft adventure is likely to be included in the overflowing ecotourism folder. There is no doubt the original motives behind the movement were honourable attempts to provide a way for those who cared to make informed choices, but the lack of regulations and a standard industry definition left many travellers lost in an ecotourism jungle.

Transylvanian Journey

The notebook covering the Transylvanian leg of my journey was lost for 50 years, and only restored a few years ago by a great stroke of luck. It has been a great help to me in reconstructing that period and committing it to print, but not the unfailing prop it should have been. For in Transylvania I found myself having a much easier time of it than I had planned, drifting from one hospitable country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I came to a standstill during those long halts, writing stopped too; as I was keeping a journal of travel, I wrongly thought there was nothing to record. I was often slow to take it up again when I moved on and, even then, jotted notes sometimes took the place of sustained narrative.
Fearing some details might have got out of sequence when I started writing the present book, I surrounded these passages with a cloud of provisos and hedged bets. Then the thought that these pages were not a guidebook persuaded me that it didn't matter very much, so I let the story tell itself free of debilitating

66,"A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology

The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few surviving collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculpture in the world, comprising over six hundred works. The first thing to remember about the collection is that nothing here is genuine. All the sculptures are accurate replicas cast from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is housed in a purpose-built gallery with excellent natural light. The advantages of plaster casts are many: groups of sculptures originally set up together but now split between various museums all over Europe can be viewed together as originally intended. Nearly all the most celebrated works of Greek and Roman sculpture can be viewed in one afternoon.

B. Cambridge Darkroom

Cambridge Darkroom is a centre for photography with community darkrooms and a gallery showing a varied exhibition of photography and related media. We regularly run courses and workshops for people of all ages and abilities, including our popular Beginner's Course, a shorter Induction Course and Master Classes with invited photographers. We have a membership scheme whereby all our members can use our darkrooms. We also encourage young photographers (aged 12 to 16) to develop their skills with our Young Members scheme, led by our resident photographer. We stock photographic books and an magazines and carry a full range of photographic materials.

C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology

The Sedgwick Museum houses a magnificent collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks and minerals of all geological ages, and from all parts of the world. It also houses Britain's oldest intact geological collection, that of Dr John Woodward (1665-1728). It includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens stored in their original early 18th century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick was Professor of Geology and keeper of the Woodwardian collection. Throughout his long life, he added enormously to the collections, laying the foundations of a truly outstanding museum. The collection is arranged by geological age so that the major changes in life on Earth can be traced through time.
The new Whewell Gallery houses the beautiful minerals and gems of the collection. The displays are accompanied by full explanatory labels to explain both their nature and modern use.

D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs

There are over 400,000 oblique and vertical air photographs in the collection, taken by members of the university's staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft based at Cambridge Airport and undertakes photographic work throughout Great Britain. The photographs are of considerable general interest as a detailed, year-by-year record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and the effects of human activity from prehistoric times to the present day. There is a small display in the entrance hall and the knowledgeable library staff will be happy to deal with canicular enquiries. The photographs cannot be borrowed but copies can normally be purchased. These are made to order and ordinarily take about a month.

E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre

Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre, the second oldest and longest surviving centre in the world, is one of the regions most unusual tourist attractions. Hours of enjoyment are to be had creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates off tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By formulating resin copies, known as facsimiles, the centre has made it possible to preserve the originals and still make brass rubbing an accessible pastime to all. The brass plates, as an alternative means of memorial to the tomb statue, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Through various revolutions most of the beautiful brasses were destroyed. The vast majority of remaining brasses are to be found in Britain and the widest range of examples can be seen at the Cambridge

The study of handwriting to reveal a person's character is gaining support

If you applied for a job in some countries, you would almost certainly be asked for a sample of your handwriting. And it would be the handwriting, as much as anything else, that would determine your suitability for the job.
Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. Researchers say it can be a useful tool in indicating certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances.
Handwriting analysis is increasingly being used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs.
But most doctors and psychiatrists remain dubious about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for more than 20 years, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes that handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics as well as certain medical conditions.
She says: 'Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should concentrate on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.'
According to Ms Marne, graphology can be particularly useful in assessing possible criminal tendencies: 'Criminals all have disturbed handwriting, mostly illiterate and poorly-shaped. Most criminals come from deprived backgrounds and have arrested emotional development. This often shows up in unusually childish handwriting and in going over letters several times.

The person behind the handwriting: examples analysed by graphologist Patricia Marne. 'I can tell whether people are honest, manipulators, or reliable employees.'

'Young male offenders frequently have very high ascenders, indicating that they live in a world of fantasy and dream of making it big. Graphologists can tell whether violence is about to erupt, whether the writer is under unbearable pressure, and whether there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can be used to predict would-be suicides.'
Heart and lung problems can also show up, she says. 'You can't make a diagnosis from one sample, unless the writing is obviously shaky or disturbed. But if over a period of time it changes or becomes disjointed, if there's a break in the signature which did not exist previously, that could be a sign that something quite serious has occurred.'
A severe emotional upset can also show up in a temporarily altered signature, she maintains.
Ms Marne says handwriting can be used to reveal other psychological characteristics. People with writing in which letters form 'threads' instead of being individually forms are, apparently, devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to conceal their true selves from others. Very light pressure indicates sensitivity and lack of vitality. Originality in handwriting - how far the writer has deviated from copybook script - indicates confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is the cardinal sign of the loner.
Very small signatures indicate inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the 'i' are a bid for attention, and crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word is a sign of intolerance and a patronising attitude.
Ms Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to be able to analyse handwriting accurately, and this has to be combined with empathy and intuition. She feels that more research is needed to put graphology on a proper scientific footing.
This will happen soon, she believes. 'It's actually far more accurate than psychoanalysis, as you can tell the whole history of the person, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions to which they may give wrong answers.'
Interesting as all this may sound, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them. Handwriting, they say, is a product of education, artistic ability and the type of writing taught - and has no other significance.",3,CAE,1,0.2163493484258652,0.2238130271434784,0.21107780933380127,0.16392503678798676,0.1848348081111908,2,0.2116855084896088,0.1449357271194458,0.28414303064346313,0.2438807487487793,0.1153549626469612,2,0.1692064106464386,0.1780567616224289,0.2707391679286957,0.19579511880874634,0.1862025409936905,0,0.23178574442863464,0.20996034145355225,0.22345103323459625,0.2285245805978775,0.10627838224172592,2,0.2340745329856873,0.16549840569496155,0.2503222525119781,0.19208067655563354,0.1580241322517395,4,0.1604040265083313,0.07820862531661987,0.2046436220407486,0.2531756162643433,0.3035681545734405,2,0.2515050768852234,0.18007928133010864,0.26537367701530457,0.18934716284275047,0.11369480192661285,2,0.15064652264118195,0.08457626402378082,0.2887740433216095,0.2259574830532074,0.2500456273555756,4,0.11672759801149367,0.07203605771064757,0.27913135290145874,0.24991585314273834,0.2821891009807587,2,0.14974617958068848,0.13904158771038055,0.34879934787750244,0.21841135621070865,0.14400151371955872,2,0.1023808941245079,0.08247550576925278,0.3782038688659668,0.22979116439819336,0.2071485221385956,4,0.06943204998970033,0.04262993112206459,0.27803686261177063,0.28139182925224304,0.3285093307495117,3,0.08882228285074234,0.041651837527751916,0.279102623462677,0.31682395935058594,0.2735993266105652,3,0.1368291825056076,0.05285760387778282,0.2966039180755615,0.3342185914516449,0.17949067056179047,3,0.1432884782552719,0.058152984827756875,0.3109149634838104,0.3245635032653809,0.16308002173900604,1,0.13350439071655273,0.251578152179718,0.2227354645729065,0.15819604694843292,0.23398590087890625,1,0.1427498757839203,0.2484623342752457,0.209821492433548,0.19192998111248016,0.20703637599945068,3,0.08416590094566345,0.1827508807182312,0.17666593194007876,0.3172916769981384,0.2391256839036941,4,0.062376897782087326,0.16118602454662326,0.23462830483913424,0.2696689069271088,0.27213987708091736,4,0.05045386403799057,0.16983051598072052,0.24173036217689514,0.1970158815383911,0.3409693539142609,4,0.045858092606067664,0.21304792165756226,0.2511117458343506,0.1321081668138504,0.3578740954399109,4,0.0362345390021801,0.1332261562347412,0.2223901003599167,0.20129460096359253,0.406854659318924,4,0.03138931468129158,0.09316329658031464,0.2146894335746765,0.22601902484893802,0.4347389042377472,4,0.022713985294103626,0.09064418077468872,0.2315531671047211,0.1891310214996338,0.4659576117992401,4,0.019787022843956947,0.07485998421907425,0.20718994736671448,0.21654188632965088,0.481621116399765,4,0.016000399366021156,0.06278122216463089,0.21840156614780426,0.2294972538948059,0.4733195304870606,4,0.013930831104516985,0.06137311086058616,0.2649784684181213,0.21434952318668365,0.4453681111335753,4,0.013479780405759813,0.06700453162193297,0.3440522849559784,0.1777179390192032,0.3977455198764801,4,0.012190491892397405,0.06548942625522614,0.3339795172214508,0.17949870228767395,0.4088418781757355,4,0.011572517454624176,0.06362224370241165,0.3250811696052551,0.18085744976997373,0.4188666939735413,4,0.1874941885471344,0.20207346975803367,0.203524649143219,0.20206879079341888,0.2048388421535492,4,0.18713822960853574,0.19394908845424647,0.1887587606906891,0.21174436807632446,0.2184095382690429,4,0.1910969763994217,0.1983896642923355,0.18126258254051208,0.20874574780464167,0.2205049693584442,4,0.19582155346870425,0.19232141971588126,0.1836083382368088,0.20975331962108607,0.21849532425403595,3,0.1878293752670288,0.1931951344013214,0.1953698843717575,0.21188049018383026,0.21172511577606198,4,0.17873987555503845,0.18944616615772247,0.20764963328838348,0.2091609686613083,0.2150033861398697,4,0.11852439492940905,0.14315904676914215,0.2306833863258361,0.24778684973716736,0.2598463296890259,4,0.05281281471252442,0.11630845069885255,0.24157314002513885,0.24155136942863464,0.347754180431366,4,0.03177257254719733,0.08419214934110641,0.3101807236671448,0.2211837470531464,0.3526708781719208,2,0.0147834662348032,0.042129099369049065,0.3546653389930725,0.3047265410423279,0.2836955487728119,3,0.013926526531577109,0.051460091024637215,0.3047369718551636,0.3839794099330902,0.24589695036411285,3,0.00869511067867279,0.031188985332846638,0.2634122669696808,0.4013437330722809,0.29535993933677673,4,0.007744215428829194,0.01688774116337299,0.1540599912405014,0.3652230501174927,0.4560850560665129,4,0.006978900637477636,0.017362797632813454,0.1659020632505417,0.3691847622394562,0.4405714273452759,3,0.006754773668944836,0.020767541602253917,0.21826337277889246,0.3812398910522461,0.3729743957519531,4,0.18170411884784696,0.19097743928432465,0.2064843624830246,0.12810680270195007,0.2927272319793701,4,0.10276834666728972,0.11402799189090727,0.2459353506565094,0.2077646106481552,0.3295036852359772,3,0.0243806466460228,0.08192940056324005,0.2118036895990372,0.4229239225387573,0.25896236300468445,3,0.029504496604204174,0.162677600979805,0.2469200044870377,0.32214176654815674,0.2387562096118927,2,0.02282402850687504,0.13870374858379364,0.3220275938510895,0.23452366888523105,0.281

A.
The career of citizen Tristan Smith, set in the fictional republic of Efica, is an extraordinary parable of human power, history and humour. In a feat of considerable literary skill, the author has created a world with its own history, traditions and customs.
The book is notable also for its humour, and for the author's unique vision, which is here combined with his penetrating psychological insight in a novel which is difficult but rewarding.

B. 
Harriet is poised and middle-class, with an architect husband and her own business. 
Ordinarily, she would never have met Sheila, a traditional working-class woman who looks after her ageing father and has brought up her grandson, Leo, since he was three.
Their lives are shattered when the teenage Leo viciously attacks Harriets son, Joe, in the street. After the court case both boys refuse to talk about what happened. Leo, who had been a model pupil and had never been involved in a fight before, will not explain what came over him, while Joe recovers physically but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is tortured by the effect on her son and ministering to him takes over her life. Sheila is so wracked with guilt that she requests a meeting - from which their unusual friendship grows.
The great strength of the author has always been in depicting how people react to upheaval in their lives. He also captures the mothers sense that, no matter how hard she tries, she can never do enough.

C.
Shortlisted for the Booker prize, this book follows the fortunes of one of the most isolated of the Scottish Orkney islands and its inhabitants over a long and uneventful rural history.
The book sets this narrative against pertinent moments in Scottish history, as vividly imagined in the daydreams of the young protagonist, Throfinn
Ragnarson, who disappears abruptly at one point in the book, only to return after the Second World War, having now learnt to appreciate the simplicity of his worthy ancestors lives.

D.
Following his recent blockbuster success, the author has produced a sequel resonant with the same gentle irony and acid observations of family life which made its predecessor so appealing.
Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway approaches her seventies with her spirited companion, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's approach to life remains the same winning combination of vanity, charm and reluctant kindness, and Rosie provides an ally in her continuing and highly enjoyable manipulation of both suitors and friends. By the end of the book, Aurora is forced to acknowledge the passage of time that brings a new generation to centre stage.
The author is skilful at exposing the haunting sadness that hovers beneath the seeming ordinariness of life. He is attuned more to the shadows than the bright lights of human activity and identifies the randomness of events.

E.
Six disparate people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the islands of the South Pacific in his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. With her awe-inspiring mastery of descriptive language, the author charts the personal voyages of self-discovery with which each of these mariners prepares to return home, their own spirits quickened and made ardent by the experience of life adrift on 'the desert cities of waves'.

49,"Volunteer tourism 

Four academic writers discuss the topic of international voluntary work. 
 
A.
It is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly. Whilst volunteer tourists can get involved in building homes or schools, they have usually paid a significant fee for the opportunity to be involved in this work: money that, if donated to a local community directly, could potentially pay for a greater amount of labour than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide. This is especially so in the case of gap years, in which the level of technical skill or professional experience required of volunteers is negligible. Hence, it is unsurprising that many academic studies allude to the moral issue of whether gap year volunteering is principally motivated by altruism - a desire to benefit the society visited - or whether young people aim to generate 'cultural capital' which benefits them in their careers. However, the projects may play a role in developing people who will, in the course of their careers and lives, act ethically in favour of those less well-off. 

B.
Volunteering may lead to greater international understanding; enhanced ability to solve conflicts; widespread and democratic participation in global affairs through global civic society organisations; and growth of international social networks among ordinary people. In this scenario, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, an outcome where benefits accrue to volunteers and host communities, and contribute to the global greater good. However, if volunteering is largely limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may give these privileged volunteers an international perspective, and a career boost, but it will do little for people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work. Those who volunteer will continue to reap its benefits, using host organisations and host communities as a rung on the ladder of personal advancement. 

C.
At its worst, international volunteering can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, volunteer tourism, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development on the part of well-off Westerners. Or it can be straightforward provision of technical assistance for international development. At its best, international volunteering brings benefits (and costs) to individual volunteers and the organisations within which they work, at the same time as providing the space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience in developing communities. Most significantly, volunteering can raise awareness of, and a lifelong commitment to combating, existing unequal power relations and deep-seated causes of poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development. 
 
 
D.
Volunteer tourism seems to fit well with the growth of life strategies to help others. Such limited strategies, aimed at a humble 'making a difference', can appear positive and attractive in an anti-political climate. The personal element appears positive - it bypasses big government and eschews big business. Yet it also bypasses the democratic imperative of representative government and reduces development to individual acts of charity, most often ones that seek to work around rather than transform the situations of poor, rural societies. Cynicism at the act of volunteering is certainly misplaced. The act of volunteer tourism may involve only simple, commendable charity. However, where volunteer tourism is talked up as sustainable development and the marketing of the gap-year companies merges into development thinking, this is symptomatic of a degradation of the discourse of development. The politics of volunteer tourism represents a retreat from a social understanding of global inequalities and the poverty lived by so many in the developing word.

10,"Chewing gum culture

It's fashionable, classless and Americans chew 12 million sticks of it a day. Discover how an ancient custom became big business.

Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick, but it is classified as a food and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration.
Today's gum is largely synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners which help to hold the flavour and improve the texture.
This was not always the case, though. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin obtained from the bark of the mastic tree, a shrub found mainly in Greece and Turkey. Grecian women, especially, favoured mastic gum to clean their teeth and sweeten their breath.
American colonists followed the example of the Amero-Indians of New England and chewed the resin that formed on spruce trees when the bark was cut. Lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States in the early 1800s making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
Modern chewing gum has its origins in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance obtained from the sapodilla tree of the Central American rainforest.
Gum made from this resulted in a smoother, more satisfying and more elastic chew, and soon a whole industry was born based on this product.
Yet repeated attempts to cultivate sapodilla commercially have failed. As the chewing gum market has grown, synthetic alternatives have had to be developed.
Today the few remaining chicle gatherers, chicleros, eke out a meagre and dangerous living, trekking for miles to tap scattered sapodilla in near-100% humidity. Conditions are appalling: highly poisonous snakes lurk ready to pounce and insects abound.
Most alarming is the unpleasant little chicle fly that likes to lodge its eggs in the tappers ears and nose.
Braving these hazards, barefooted and with only a rope and an axe, an experienced chiclero will shin a mature tree in minutes to cut a path in the bark for the white sap to flow down to a bag below.
Each chiclero must carry the liquid on his back to a forest camp, where it is boiled until sticky and made into bricks. Life at the camp is no picnic either, with a monotonous and often deficient maize-based diet washed down by a local alcohol distilled from sugar cane.
Yet, punishing though this working environment is, the remaining chicleros fear for their livelihood.
Not so long ago, the United States alone imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America. Last year just 200 tonnes were tapped in the whole of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As chewing gum sales have soared, so the manufacturers have turned to synthetics to reduce costs and meet demands.
Meanwhile, the world's gum producers are finding ingenious ways of marketing their products. In addition to all the claims made for gum - it helps you relax, peps you up and eases tension (soldiers during both world wars were regularly supplied with gum) - gums greatest claim is that it reduces tooth decay.
Plaque acid, which forms when we eat, causes this. Our saliva, which neutralises the acid and supplies minerals such as calcium, phosphate and fluoride, is the body's natural defence. Gum manufacturers say 20 minutes of chewing can increase your salivary flow.
Research continues on new textures and flavours. Glycerine and other vegetable oil products are now used to blend the gum base. Most new flavours are artificial - but some flavours still need natural assistance.
In addition, one hundred and thirty-seven square kilometres of America is devoted entirely to producing the mint that is used in the two most popular chewing gums in the world.",3,CAE,1,0.14678022265434265,0.2780924141407013,0.19957666099071505,0.16459117829799652,0.21095947921276093,1,0.165242001414299,0.26638513803482056,0.19530841708183289,0.2075435221195221,0.16552090644836426,1,0.11818668246269225,0.2531293630599976,0.17435558140277865,0.21178656816482544,0.2425418496131897,1,0.17334574460983276,0.3116869628429413,0.14567123353481293,0.19725430011749268,0.17204180359840393,4,0.1471918672323227,0.2020339071750641,0.16767838597297668,0.2266698032617569,0.2564260959625244,4,0.10758107155561447,0.13609877228736875,0.16895097494125366,0.2414771020412445,0.3458920121192932,1,0.1786455512046814,0.23765358328819275,0.19668048620224,0.2023197710514069,0.18470057845115664,4,0.11171378195285796,0.14694900810718536,0.2271201610565185,0.2334588021039963,0.28075823187828064,4,0.09536635130643843,0.13980890810489655,0.22078095376491547,0.25473514199256897,0.28930872678756714,3,0.11934356391429901,0.22798505425453186,0.22092823684215546,0.2368321269750595,0.19491098821163166,3,0.092793270945549,0.15723402798175812,0.23911382257938385,0.2800142765045166,0.2308446168899536,3,0.07616326212882996,0.10541947931051254,0.2378207445144653,0.3073531687259674,0.27324333786964417,3,0.08674038201570511,0.13002322614192965,0.2522236108779907,0.3021571934223175,0.2288556694984436,3,0.10187414288520813,0.1683134138584137,0.25775301456451416,0.2840511500835419,0.18800824880599976,3,0.10286479443311693,0.17486301064491272,0.2578546702861786,0.28080859780311584,0.18360894918441767,2,0.10148866474628447,0.2579772770404816,0.2652078866958618,0.2315912693738937,0.14373493194580078,3,0.0815243348479271,0.23244258761405945,0.18810603022575376,0.35766172409057617,0.14026540517807007,3,0.06620549410581589,0.1693011224269867,0.1699385941028595,0.4302562177181244,0.1642986387014389,3,0.06454920768737793,0.13777737319469452,0.19726397097110748,0.41088539361953735,0.18952405452728271,3,0.06285051256418228,0.1437845528125763,0.20868754386901853,0.34400108456611633,0.2406763732433319,3,0.06395620107650757,0.1711166501045227,0.2305407077074051,0.28064680099487305,0.2537396550178528,3,0.05209126695990562,0.14261512458324432,0.22434604167938232,0.3027370870113373,0.27821046113967896,3,0.04472953826189041,0.11242679506540296,0.2246464639902115,0.3206042051315308,0.2975930869579315,3,0.03960281983017922,0.10193738341331482,0.23149336874485016,0.3462887406349182,0.28067758679389954,3,0.03522859141230583,0.09062687307596208,0.21405613422393802,0.3792639672756195,0.2808244228363037,3,0.030879180878400806,0.08008553087711334,0.2189496606588364,0.3982467651367188,0.27183884382247925,3,0.027805110439658158,0.074856236577034,0.23331359028816226,0.4080882370471953,0.25593680143356323,3,0.02374181523919105,0.07504492253065109,0.26153191924095154,0.3928292095661163,0.2468520998954773,3,0.022109761834144592,0.07442772388458252,0.2571021616458893,0.3951928615570069,0.2511674761772156,3,0.021749870851635933,0.0736859068274498,0.2520955502986908,0.3987556397914887,0.25371304154396057,4,0.190566748380661,0.1991258263587952,0.20292383432388306,0.20367498695850367,0.20370864868164065,4,0.18962112069129944,0.19178296625614166,0.18835030496120453,0.21315401792526245,0.2170916050672531,4,0.1943594217300415,0.19709187746047974,0.1806079596281052,0.2091917246580124,0.2187490314245224,4,0.19905540347099304,0.19181427359580994,0.1827196180820465,0.2101754993200302,0.2162351906299591,3,0.19149509072303766,0.19342344999313354,0.19333019852638245,0.21223777532577515,0.20951350033283234,4,0.1831122636795044,0.19052700698375705,0.20350010693073275,0.2104230225086212,0.2124376744031906,4,0.12222831696271895,0.14870737493038175,0.22069385647773745,0.25253191590309143,0.2558385133743286,4,0.07629261910915375,0.17029355466365814,0.22260528802871704,0.2340791821479797,0.2967294156551361,2,0.06612454354763031,0.14861324429512024,0.3043627142906189,0.21521945297718048,0.2656800448894501,2,0.027090787887573242,0.07622925937175751,0.3744826018810272,0.3150342702865601,0.2071630209684372,3,0.03750557452440262,0.1342652291059494,0.3118585050106049,0.3541686534881592,0.16220207512378693,3,0.017328666523098946,0.0696374773979187,0.28652238845825195,0.4090573489665985,0.21745407581329346,4,0.00914200209081173,0.021905183792114258,0.1677662879228592,0.3934800922870636,0.4077064096927643,3,0.00988712813705206,0.028669154271483418,0.1958497762680053,0.40280741453170776,0.36278653144836426,3,0.012019946239888668,0.04404927045106888,0.2653000950813293,0.4029756188392639,0.27565503120422363,0,0.2579297423362732,0.2252451330423355,0.22323444485664368,0.11961184442043304,0.17397882044315338,0,0.26549994945526123,0.15819735825061798,0.23698823153972626,0.1698155403137207,0.16949895024299622,3,0.0462908111512661,0.10454749315977097,0.2010798156261444,0.4553703665733338,0.19271151721477509,3,0.06293920427560806,0.22282272577285767,0.202317088842392,0.31969788670539856,0.1922230571508408,2,0.05786151438951492,0.2488379776477813,0.2570866942405701,0.22174079716205605,0.21447

23,"In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet 
Dr Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, aims to retrace Sir Edmund Halley's quest to chart compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.
Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is best known for the comet that bears his name. Yet one of his greatest accomplishments, in the eyes of his contemporaries, was to chart, using calculations made on his sea voyages on the warship Paramore, the 'variations of the compass'. These variations are now known as 'declination', that is, the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Without it, sailors were unable to correct their compasses. It was therefore impossible to deduce longitude precisely and navigate the oceans.
So it was that Halley, one of only two men in the land at that time paid to conduct scientific research, set sail for the Cape Verde Islands with the grand plan of charting declination in the North and South Atlantic. The trip was quickly aborted because of crew insubordination, but Halley returned to the seas a second time.
This voyage took him and his crew to Rio de Janeiro, down past South Georgia, up again to Newfoundland and back to England. From these travels Halley published, in 170I, a 'New and Correct Chart shewing the Variations of the Compasse in the Western and Southern Oceans'. More sophisticated successors to this primitive cartographic effort proved indispensable to seamen for more than a century, before a slow change in the terrestrial magnetic field rendered them inaccurate.
If all goes well, Halley's accomplishments will be celebrated once again. Dr Clark, himself a keen sailor, plans to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the route of the Paramore.
PS70,000 will have to be raised before he embarks, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first cross-Antarctica expedition, is providing support for his efforts to do this. Dr Clark became fascinated by Halley during a two-year posting to Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read biographies of the great scientist. 
'Halley led a remarkable life: Dr Clark says. 'He was not only a respected scientist but also led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer but also did research in geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the positions of the stars, and also found time for other interests.'
It was during this period that Halley developed a diving bell and also advised Sir Isaac Newton during his writing of Principia Mathematica, the foundation of classical physics. Recreating the voyage, Dr Clark says, will afford Halley the recognition he deserves. The projected expedition, which he has entitled 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific merit.
It will involve making the measurements that Halley made, but with far more precise instruments. These measurements need to be updated because the terrestrial magnetic field is slowly but constantly changing.
The data collected should help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field, called the international geomagnetic reference field. 'It is common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. That's because you need to know true north to measure the direction,' says Dr Clark.
'On our expedition we can use global positioning satellites to determine that.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy have offered to supply instruments. By chance, a Danish satellite will be taking similar measurements over the globe.
Dr Clark hopes that his measurements will plug any gaps in its coverage of the Atlantic Ocean and, he points out, it is also useful to have ground-based measurements as a comparison. It is easy to forget just how significant Halley's Atlantic journey really was. It was the first dedicated scientific expedition on the seas and Halley became the first civilian who was appointed naval captain to pursue what many regarded as an obsession with declination. Does Dr Clark possess the credentials to make his parallel voyage a success?
As well as spending two years in Antarctica and working in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey, he has already sailed the 13,000 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro to England. He envisages that the expedition will be completed in four stages, with four different crews.
And does he share Halley's obsessive trait? 'I am prepared to give up my life for eight months to do this, so I suppose some people might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley, and his fascinating life, have given me a real sense of purpose.'

32,"HAPPY HUNTING GROUND 

We're 'animal people' who enjoy the company of all kinds of creatures. Consider this typical chain of events, leading to total confusion, which began one afternoon. My daughter telephoned me at work with the news that she had found a wonderful pine snake. 
'Can we keep him?' she cried. I said 'Yes, but only overnight.' We had set up a special tank for just such passers-through, overnight being long enough to admire and look them up in our well-used natural history book. 
I was late getting home. I hurriedly put a pot on to boil just as screams of 'Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!' came from my sons' bedroom. I leapt to it. 
The crisis involved Domino the cat and Bianca the white mouse given to me as a Mother's Day present. (I've [line 23: beginning] heard that some mothers get [line 23: end] perfume.) Domino, with mouse feet waving from his jaws, ran round and round the bedroom that was crowded with furniture and children. 
Looking for a way out so he could enjoy his catch, Domino had so far avoided the forest of waving arms. I threw myself into the confusion and promptly tripped over something or someone to find myself on the floor. 
As I thought about dropping my full weight on Domino when he next came past, my eyes locked on the snake. It had escaped - or, more correctly, was escaping. It was pouring itself up and out and off the table and all over the floor. I crouched like a rabbit at the approach of its bullish head, and long powerful body. 
The snake and I were now both being jumped over by cat/mouse/kids in a screaming, leaping, hissing mass - the snake striking at every moment, the dog barking wildly. 
The pot boiled over in the kitchen and I raced to shut off the gas, returning to the battle with new strength. This time I successfully captured Domino by the tail, and pulled the small, damp and miraculously uninjured mouse from his growling jaws. Incidentally, the same mouse was caught by the same cat three more times during its lifetime, but eventually died of old age. 
[line 60: beginning] Encouraged by my success with the [line 60: end] cat, I looked the snake over for weak points. It didn't have any. In the end, I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking backwards and forwards, but without a flute. Gradually the snake relaxed enough to drop its head on to its piled-up body, but its eyes still shone with suspicion. I eventually ever-so-slowly eased my hands beneath the piled-up snake and gradually raised myself to a kneeling position, then I stood up and walked to the very end of the garden where I gave the snake the choice of living happily ever after on the garden shed by pointing it in the direction of a handy tree. 
But when I finally gathered enough courage to release the snake's head - fully expecting it to swing instantly around to crush my face in its powerful jaws - it slid away from the tree and up over my shoulders where, like a colourful leathery shawl, it gave every sign of making itself comfortable for the winter. 
We stood in the gathering dusk, four young children, Mum and the snake. DJ, my eldest, broke the heavy silence with a scientific explanation: 'You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and fat and warm, and the shed isn't.' I had the children gather at the snake's tail end and gently encourage it to move on. Slowly and unwillingly it did so. Without a backward glance, the snake travelled smoothly up the wall to disappear over the now night-shadowed roof. 
As the last tiny bit of tail disappeared from our property, three-year old Clay sighed and said it for all of us: 'Boy, that was one big snake!'

If there's one thing guaranteed to send tears running down your cheeks, it's the sight of a brilliant child collecting a medal. Julia Gregson asked three young stars, and their mothers, to describe some of the pleasures and pains of their lives. 

A. 
Annika Reeder, 15, won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. Her ambitions are to become a physiotherapist and compete at the next Olympics. 'The work is very hard at the moment. There is no time to watch television, or go out with friends or do much more than gym and school. I try to take the training day by day, and when I feel very, very tired sometimes my coach gives me a day off, but usually I just carry on - you can't take too many days off, it makes you stiff.' 

B.
Annika's mother

'From an early age Annika showed tremendous potential. I've seen some parents try to push their children and it doesn't work. To perform at the level Annika does is so demanding of time and energy you have to want to do it yourself. People tell me all the time that we, as parents, have given up so much, but what they don't see is what the sport's given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before she did gym she was a very shy little girl who sucked her thumb and hid behind me, but now she's met people from all over the world and she's got the confidence of success.' 

C. 
Sarah Stokes made her first show-jumping appearance at ten. Since then 
she has won the British National Championship. 'It's a good job my mum and dad like show-jumping because they train me and have to take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows are from one day to five days long. I don't ever get tired of it - I love show-jumping events, they are exciting and fun. Even if I didn't have Mum and Dad, I would do it because I am so determined. I'm 
glad they are happy when I win, but I'm not doing it for them. My goal this year is to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My really big ambition is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.' 

D. Sarah's mother

'From the moment Sarah sat on a horse, age 1, that was it, her passion. When she was 5, she used to get up before us all to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows you have to jump all over England. To save money, we sleep in the living quarters of our horse box. Sarah is well organised. She is 100% happy on a horse, she knows what she's doing. Watching your child succeed at something they love is hard to beat.' 

E. Jane McShane, 10, is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. 'It's really friendly at tournaments. I know everybody and it's fun. When I'm playing, I don't concentrate. I should do really, but instead I just stare around and don't bother to think. I'm not scared of getting big-headed, I don't talk about my success at school. I don't like embarrassment.' 

F. Jane's mother

'Jane played her first game when she was 5. My father said, ""Let's see if she likes it."" My father had tried to teach me when I was young and I used to sit there bored, but Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that afternoon she had memorised all the moves, and by 6 was starting to beat adults. When she's won of course I'm pleased, but if she said she wanted to give it all up tomorrow, I wouldn't stand in her way. On the other hand I don't want to do the awful thing of putting somebody down because they are exceptional. If she has this gift, let her fulfil her potential.'

6,"Confident people what's their secret?

Confident people may look as though they were born that way, but most will tell you that it's a skill they've learned because they had to. Nina Hathway asks five people how they did it.

A Jenny

When I left school I was very shy and I always thought I'd stay that way. I was about twenty-five when I was asked to help out at my daughter's school. I was sure I wouldn't cope, but I surprised myself by doing well and someone there suggested that I should do a university course.
There was a huge knot in my stomach the day I turned up for my first lecture. But my confidence gradually grew - I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school was the turning point in my life that has helped everything else fall into place.

B Michaela

It all started four years ago when my father became ill and I had to take over the family business. I was so scared, I went over the top and became a bit too aggressive and impatient. I thought that was what confident people were like, but gradually I learned otherwise. To be confident you've got to believe in yourself.
If things get too demanding for me at work, I don't let myself feel guilty if I save a number of tasks until the next day. When I'm confronted with something difficult, I tell myself that I've got nothing to lose. It's fear that makes you lack confidence, so I'm always having quiet chats with myself to put aside those fears!

C Lisa

People think I'm very confident but, in fact, the calmer I look, the more terrified I really am. I've had to develop the ability to look confident because it's the most vital thing in TV. Interviewing people has helped me realise that most - if not all - of us get tense in important situations, and we feel calmer when we speak to someone who's genuinely friendly. The best ever piece of advice came from my mother when I was agonising as a teenager about wearing the right clothes. She simply cried, 'Who's looking at you? Everybody's too busy worrying about how they look.' I've found that's well worth remembering.
I also think you gain confidence by tackling things that scare you. When I took my driving test I was so nervous, but I passed. After that I felt sure that I'd never feel so frightened again, and I never have.

D Barbara

My confidence comes naturally from really enjoying the work I do, but it's something that I've built up over the years. If you just get on with it and learn from any mistakes you make, you're more confident the next time round. I work hard and I'm popular in the restaurant, but it's probable that one out of ten people doesn't like me. I don't let that affect me. You've got to like yourself for what you are, not try to be what others expect.
My company runs a lot of training courses, and going on those has built up my self-esteem. The company also encourages employees to set manageable targets. It helps no end if you can see you're achieving something tangible, rather than reaching for the stars all at once, and ending up with nothing but air!

E Kim

After I left college I worked for years as a secretary and would sit in meetings, not always agreeing with what was being said, but too scared to speak up. Eventually, I summoned up the confidence to start making my point. Even so, when I first worked in politics, I'd never spoken in public before and always used to shake like a leaf. I would say to myself, 'Don't be so silly. People do this every day of their lives, so there's no reason why you can't.' I also found it helpful to jot a few things down to refer to - rather like having a comfort blanket!
I don't think there is anyone who isn't a little shaky when it comes to talking publicly. The real secret of confidence lies in telling yourself over and over again, 'Nothing is impossible.'",2,FCE,1,0.14292694628238678,0.26667466759681696,0.22541074454784402,0.14497826993465426,0.2200093120336533,2,0.17605191469192505,0.2273843735456467,0.25280874967575073,0.17848132550716395,0.16527362167835236,4,0.1444738656282425,0.17972512543201447,0.23016011714935306,0.19271445274353027,0.2529264688491821,2,0.2304169088602066,0.17719872295856476,0.3056623935699463,0.17921900749206546,0.10750291496515274,2,0.2411722242832184,0.10021059960126877,0.2546834945678711,0.22066353261470795,0.1832701712846756,4,0.16987255215644834,0.07633238285779953,0.26569753885269165,0.21325406432151794,0.2748434543609619,2,0.29369160532951355,0.17098546028137207,0.3057194650173187,0.14772996306419373,0.08187354356050491,2,0.1905736923217773,0.13085319101810455,0.4093893766403198,0.1473781168460846,0.12180555611848833,2,0.16132140159606936,0.120002418756485,0.4279634356498718,0.1611066460609436,0.12960608303546906,2,0.2211075872182846,0.15381868183612826,0.368485689163208,0.1662459671497345,0.09034199267625807,2,0.15405665338039398,0.1097993701696396,0.4581062495708466,0.1739111989736557,0.10412650555372238,2,0.13845305144786835,0.04746227711439133,0.3551447093486786,0.2675173580646515,0.19142256677150726,2,0.1820608228445053,0.06853407621383667,0.41365212202072144,0.22937388718128204,0.10637912154197693,2,0.1935940682888031,0.0966268703341484,0.4805426001548767,0.16389301419258118,0.065343476831913,2,0.20148791372776031,0.1011430397629738,0.4697906374931336,0.16411490738391876,0.06346350908279419,2,0.1880266219377517,0.19420436024665835,0.21608014404773712,0.1999499350786209,0.2017388790845871,3,0.16139626502990725,0.19849678874015808,0.2191858887672425,0.24588146805763245,0.17503955960273745,3,0.0934794470667839,0.15232554078102112,0.19360089302062988,0.3902880549430847,0.17030605673789978,3,0.07633788138628006,0.12508617341518402,0.2335671186447144,0.3734996914863585,0.1915091574192047,3,0.07044932246208191,0.14076952636241913,0.2434034496545792,0.29409509897232056,0.25128260254859924,2,0.07712548226118088,0.22426018118858326,0.3080970048904419,0.1719917356967926,0.21852561831474304,4,0.0597306527197361,0.16076043248176575,0.2742279171943665,0.22267214953899386,0.28260886669158936,4,0.05032917857170105,0.1141364648938179,0.2749000489711761,0.2517865002155304,0.3088477849960327,2,0.04649360477924347,0.129256471991539,0.3441925048828125,0.2291679531335831,0.25088953971862793,3,0.041488580405712135,0.10659517347812653,0.28137198090553284,0.2969081997871399,0.2736360728740692,3,0.03414149582386017,0.08980592340230943,0.28448328375816345,0.32795464992523193,0.2636145651340485,2,0.030519016087055206,0.08598021417856216,0.3277694284915924,0.3260180354118347,0.22971341013908386,2,0.024680089205503464,0.0873899757862091,0.4840775430202484,0.2336503863334656,0.17020197212696075,2,0.0223899707198143,0.08598905801773071,0.4980483949184418,0.2290013134479523,0.1645713746547699,2,0.021910347044467933,0.08545266091823578,0.4865835011005402,0.2375309914350509,0.16852253675460815,4,0.189629465341568,0.2015630006790161,0.20082373917102814,0.2029043287038803,0.20507943630218506,4,0.1906636357307434,0.1939546763896942,0.18644787371158605,0.21182751655578613,0.21710632741451266,4,0.19695590436458588,0.19877322018146515,0.1794278472661972,0.2071388810873032,0.21770408749580386,4,0.20321735739707947,0.1931709051132202,0.18192358314991,0.20672492682933807,0.21496322751045227,3,0.19546982645988464,0.1934282183647156,0.19296778738498688,0.209609717130661,0.2085243612527848,4,0.19348865747451785,0.1893765479326248,0.20369577407836914,0.2041177898645401,0.2093212604522705,4,0.14099031686782834,0.14643844962120056,0.2266349941492081,0.23918431997299194,0.24675191938877106,4,0.09563761204481123,0.15310533344745636,0.2400930970907212,0.2102106660604477,0.30095329880714417,2,0.10691361129283904,0.13145515322685242,0.3231269717216492,0.19533047080039967,0.2431738078594208,2,0.03334767743945122,0.06456411629915237,0.4369160830974579,0.2775960862636566,0.1875760406255722,2,0.035923890769481666,0.11271711438894272,0.36631712317466736,0.340853214263916,0.1441887468099594,2,0.02171010337769985,0.07645655423402786,0.3771848976612091,0.36599743366241455,0.15865105390548706,3,0.010767325758934021,0.024357687681913376,0.2237906903028488,0.405846506357193,0.3352377414703369,3,0.013093835674226284,0.03378710523247719,0.2854906916618347,0.4001343846321106,0.26749396324157715,2,0.017254574224352837,0.05238313600420952,0.3805140554904938,0.3628870844841003,0.1869610995054245,2,0.12291780114173888,0.1826588809490204,0.267917662858963,0.2012932151556015,0.22521235048770905,2,0.1039796769618988,0.0937599167227745,0.3251555860042572,0.27932292222976685,0.1977820098400116,3,0.03285914659500122,0.07851377874612807,0.2563997209072113,0.4544739723205566,0.17775340378284454,3,0.03928075730800629,0.1438126415014267,0.311501145362854,0.31395474076271057,0.1914507895708084,2,0.02560104988515377,0.10929004848003387,0.43113142251968384,0.21196593344211576,0.22201158106327

45,"My line of work

Four people talk about their jobs.
Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum
I'm responsible for putting temporary exhibitions together. This includes planning and designing the exhibition and promoting it. I have to read up about the subject of the exhibition beforehand and then talk to important people in the area so that I can establish the main themes and aims of the exhibition, and plan what objects and pictures should be displayed. I have to make sure the public can understand the thinking behind the exhibition, which means planning interactive displays, workshops and theatre. I also have to bring in engineers and electricians to make sure the final display is not dangerous to visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write the brochures and leaflets that we'll use to tell people about it.

Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers
The first thing I do when I get here at 7.30 a.m. is check the accounts. Then I see what new maps and documents need to be produced in order to learn the 'runs' or routes necessary to pass the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, working out how to make the journeys. They work out the most direct route, using the correct one-way streets, and right- and left- hand turns. I get involved when there's a difference of opinion - like whether you can do a right turn at a particular junction. When they're close to the test, I'll give them a simple route and no matter what way they say they'll go, I'll tell them they have to use another route because the road is closed. The next student will have to find a third route and again I'll come up with a reason why they can't go that way. It's just to make them think.

Sarah - Marine Conservationist
I live by the coast and work from home. This involves responding to telephone enquiries, producing educational resources and setting up training courses. Occasionally, I go into our main office but generally I am on the coast. I also work with schools and study centres and run courses for coastal managers and those involved in making decisions about the fate of the seas.I do things like take them out to sea in a boat in an attempt to make them think more about the life underneath them. This often changes their views as it's very different from making decisions using a computer screen. I am extremely lucky because conservation is my hobby, so the job has many highs for me. The downside of the job is that I work for a charity, so there is a constant need for more money. This means I'm always looking for more resources and I'm not able to achieve everything I want.

Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher
My work is pretty varied. I have to make sure that the publishing programme matches market requirements, and ensure that we keep stocks of 300 or so of the books that we publish. We have very high standards of information and content. We receive many letters from readers on issues such as the representation of international boundaries and these in particular require a careful response. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work as part of an enthusiastic group which makes the job that much more enjoyable. The negative side, as with many jobs, is that there is far too much administration to deal with, which leaves less time to work on the more interesting tasks such as product development and design.

61,"Fun at the Dentist's?

If you walk into W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in the centre of Glasgow, you'll see bright modern paintings on the wall and a fashionable blue couch which patients sit on while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, 'Fifty per cent of the population only go to the dentist when they're in pain rather than attending for regular check- ups. That's because they're frightened.'
To counteract this, he has tried to create an environment where people are not afraid. 
That's why I took the decision not to wear a white coat. I find that's one of the things that people associate with pain. In fact, my philosophy is that dental treatment should take place in an atmosphere of relaxation, interest and above all enjoyment.'
Which is all highly shocking for anyone (most of us in fact) who has learnt to associate dental treatment with pain, or at the very least, with formal, clinical visits. Jerome says, 'If people are relaxed, entertained and correctly treated, they will forget such previous negative experiences.'.
Virtual-reality headsets are one of his new relaxation techniques. 'We were the first practice in Britain to introduce them and they're proving very popular. The headsets are used for the initial check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I look at their teeth. Then the headset switches to a special camera, to give the patient a visual tour around their mouth.' Surprisingly, most patients seem to enjoy this part of their visit to the dentists.
Another key point is that the surgery smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today there is the smell of orange. Jerome explains, 'When people walk in, I want them to realise with all their senses that it's not like going to the dentist's. Smell is very important. That dental smell of surgical spirit can get the heart racing in minutes if you're frightened of dentists.' I certainly found the delicate smell in the surgery very pleasant.
Although he is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist,Jerome is keen to point out that he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important but the quality of the treatment is of course the most important thing.
For example, Jerome uses a special instrument which sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, rather than scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it's not painful at all.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to do research into dental techniques. 'One of the things I found out there was that when you make it easier for the patient you make it easier for yourself', he explains. He sees his patient-centred attitude as the start of a gradual movement towards less formality in the conservative British dentistry profession.
At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome rushes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks him what video he'd like to watch and leads him gently towards the chair. The patient seems to be enjoying this five-star treatment and no wonder.

If you are wondering where to send your story our expert Margaret Stubbs is here with the advice you need.
Readers of this magazine often write in saying, 'I have written this story / book. Can you please tell me who to send it to?' One of the first things they need to know is that they should be researching their markets and finding out about publishers as well as practising their writing skills. Turning words into a saleable commodity takes a good deal of knowledge about the 'writing game'.
Whatever kind of writing you do, you need to develop a knowledge of the markets you are aiming at. There are several ways of doing this, but the best one is simply by reading everything relevant you can lay your hands on. Use your local library and go round the local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will always give you the best guide to what kinds of writing publishers are actually accepting at any given time.
As time goes on, this knowledge must be updated as new publications are constantly appearing - editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. New titles are coming and going all the time. Publishers are always hungry for new blood; as writers we have to make sure we give them what they want.
To begin with you may be looking around, not quite sure what you want to write. Let us say you feel that you might like to write short love stories. The very first thing you must do is find out which magazines use love stories, a rather limited market these days, and get hold of as many recent copies as you can. Then familiarise yourself with the kind of stories they are buying, taking special note of who the readers are. These readers will expect different things from their magazine, and the editor is only interested in catering to their needs.
Writers often send me their stories saying, 'This has been rejected three times - please tell me if I am wasting my time ... do I stand a chance at all?' As a former teacher, I would never actively discourage anyone. But it is unlikely that the work is of publishable standard; so I have to try to give an honest opinion, but always with a positive viewpoint.
The problem is that most new writers are too eager to send their work out, usually long before they are ready to enter the market. If you have only written one story or one article, it is not at all likely to be published. That almost never happens. When you read about so-called success', you usually find that the person has been in the publishing trade or journalism for some years before their current success.
When you do finally send off some of your work for the first time, immediately get on with more work while you await a reply; write ten more stories, twenty even. Each one will be better than the last, and you will begin to think of yourself as a writer, and both your fluency and your confidence will grow. Don't tear any of them up-improve them instead. Also, I would advise not showing your work to anyone else, certainly in the early stages.
Don't forget that every successful writer will have had many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your career as a writer.

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. 'Here again' is a followup to 'The Waves'. There have been a few changes since the last CD, with Tom Wilcott on bass guitar replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year, and the arrival of Tom Simpson on drums.
It is clear from the first song on the CD which is a dance tune that the band is no longer going to concentrate on slow songs. The second tune is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most later lacks are in the bands more usual slow style. These two tracks will certainly come as a surprise to many fans. Either of them could easily become a hit single though because they are excellent.
Singer Rob Letchford gets a chance to really show how good he is reaching each note perfectly. Fans should be grateful he recorded the songs for the album before he had trouble with his throat. This has rented in the band having to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who has bought tickets need not worry as dl the concerts will be rearranged as soon as Rob has recovered.)
On this CD Moonshine show they can produce perfect music in a variety of styles from the slow ones we are familiar with to the ones that will keep your feet tapping. I did feel though that they put their best songs at the beginning and the last few tracks were not of quite the same quality. Despite thisHere again is certain to be a big hit and bring more success to this band.

25,"A JOURNEY ALONG THE BEAUTIFUL DOURO RIVER

VOYAGES JULES VERNE operate a 'hotel ship' along the Douro river in Portugal. The MV Lady
Ivy May can take 160 guests in double cabins, all of which face outside and have a private shower and WC. On board the ship, which has air-conditioning, you will find a sun-deck, lounge, bar, dining room, shop and library facilities.

Itinerary
Day 1 Depart in the early evening from London Heathrow to Oporto. Your guide will meet you on arrival and take you to the Lady Ivy May, where you will spend the night.
Day 2 After a morning's sightseeing in Oporto, you will return to the ship and depart for Entre-os-Rios. This part of the journey up the river takes four hours.
Day 3 You will continue travelling up the river. In the early evening, the ship stops at Peso da Regua, where port wine is produced. At dinner you will be able to try the delicious food and drink from this area.
Day 4 After breakfast you will travel south by bus to the ancient town of Lamego and visit the cathedral, several churches and a museum. The museum was formerly a palace and now has an excellent collection of paintings, tapestries and sculptures. You will then return to the ship and sail on to Tua.
Day 5 At this point the Douro becomes very narrow. Depending on the depth of the river at the time, you may be able to continue by a smaller boat to the Spanish frontier at Barca d'Alva. The return journey to Tua is by coach and there is much to see along the way.
Day 6 In the morning you will drive to Sao Joao da Pesqueira for one of the most wonderful views in the whole of the Douro valley. You will return to the ship for lunch and then join the Douro river valley railway for a beautiful ride through the countryside to Regua, where the Lady Ivy May will be waiting for you.

39,"Write a winning story!

You could win PS1,000 in this year's Fiction Prize and have your story printed in Keep Writing magazine. Ten other lucky people will win a cheque forPS100.
Once again, we need people who can write good stories. The judges, who include Mary Littlejohn, the novelist, Michael Brown, the television reporter, and Susan Hitchins, Keep Writing's editor, are looking for interesting and original stories. Detective fiction was extremely popular last year, although the competition winner produced a love story. You can write about whatever you want but here's some advice to start you thinking:
Write about what you know
This is the advice which every writer should pay attention to and, last year, nearly everyone who wrote for us did exactly that. Love, family, problems with friends - these were the main subjects of the stories. However, you need to turn ordinary situations into something interesting that people will want to read about. Make the reader want to continue reading by writing about ordinary things in a new and surprising way.
Get your facts right
It's no good giving a description of a town or explaining how a jet engine works if you get it wrong. So avoid writing anything unless you're certain about it.
Hold the reader's attention
Make the beginning interesting and the ending a surprise. There is nothing worse than a poor ending. Develop the story carefully and try to think of something unusual happening at the end.
Think about the characters
Try to bring the people in your story alive for the reader by using well-chosen words to make them seem real.
Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words and typed, double-spaced, on one side only of each sheet of paper.
Even if you're in danger of missing the closing date, we are unable to accept stories by fax or email. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately your story cannot be returned, nor can we discuss our decisions.
You should not have had any fiction printed in any magazine or book in this country - a change in the rules by popular request- and the story must not have appeared in print or in recorded form, for example on radio or TV, anywhere in the world.
Your fee of PS5 will go to the Writers' Association. Make your cheque payable to Keep Writing and send it with the application form and your story to:

49,"San Francisco 

San Francisco lies on the coast of northern California. The earliest Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer whose name was Gaspar de Portola. 
He first saw it in 1769. Surprisingly, although San Francisco Bay is a wonderful natural harbour, it was discovered by land rather than by sea. 
In 1849, people arrived in San Francisco in their thousands hoping to find gold. However, it was not the men looking for the gold that got rich. The richest people made their money from owning banks and law firms and they built themselves large houses on one of the hills. This was known as Nob Hill. 
Nowadays, tourists are attracted to San Francisco because there they can see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many even take the short boat trip to the island of Alcatraz to see the former prison.

When I injured my back I had to take a break from my running career. I decided to introduce more women to the sport, to show them how much fun it can be and to give them the confidence to get out and run.
I decided to start a running dub for women in my area because I was annoyed by the attitude of many race organisers. They complain about the lack of women in the sport but also use this as an excuse for not providing separate changing facilities.
I put up posters and 40 women, young and old, fit and unfit, joined. All of them were attracted by the idea of losing weight but I don't think they had really thought about running before. When or if they did, they had a picture of painful training. They didn't think of chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river.
At first they ran for only a minute - now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and keeping fit in general.
I wanted to do something for women's running and I've had so much pleasure watching their progress - almost as much as they've had themselves.",1,PET,1,0.1527739018201828,0.2794922888278961,0.2359892278909683,0.15584133565425873,0.17590315639972687,1,0.2065144628286361,0.24846191704273224,0.2056409567594528,0.2074745595455169,0.1319080889225006,1,0.20613476634025574,0.2661443054676056,0.1881995350122452,0.20209324359893802,0.1374281942844391,0,0.2810290455818176,0.2363056242465973,0.1889616847038269,0.2172295898199081,0.07647402584552765,0,0.3294343650341034,0.21692708134651184,0.19565242528915405,0.19324645400047305,0.06473970413208008,0,0.3679174780845642,0.21699154376983645,0.1834448128938675,0.17090265452861786,0.0607435517013073,0,0.3947187662124634,0.26322579383850103,0.13400885462760925,0.150863379240036,0.057183202356100075,0,0.3797857463359833,0.293148934841156,0.1311192363500595,0.1327921599149704,0.0631539449095726,0,0.3800792694091797,0.30038824677467346,0.1261337399482727,0.132387176156044,0.06101161241531373,0,0.3919766545295715,0.3124023675918579,0.10999424010515213,0.13088195025920868,0.05474475771188736,0,0.3925144970417023,0.2985616624355316,0.1201237291097641,0.1363256871700287,0.05247447267174722,0,0.40990009903907776,0.26369261741638184,0.13605313003063202,0.14323782920837402,0.04711632803082466,0,0.4362714290618897,0.2783798277378082,0.11397049576044085,0.12864181399345398,0.04273639991879463,0,0.4440752565860748,0.2932094633579254,0.10189232975244522,0.11935526132583618,0.041467711329460144,0,0.44360485672950745,0.29832082986831665,0.09940819442272186,0.11704232543706895,0.04162384569644928,3,0.12517382204532626,0.19648917019367207,0.22146442532539368,0.2795783579349518,0.17729423940181732,3,0.15325137972831726,0.200565367937088,0.2231180965900421,0.2792649269104004,0.14380019903182986,3,0.12199211120605467,0.17738427221775055,0.2115652114152909,0.367233544588089,0.12182488292455672,2,0.13879968225955966,0.16837048530578613,0.3467215299606323,0.2394109815359116,0.10669726133346558,2,0.14112499356269834,0.2558003067970276,0.4009551405906677,0.10961682349443436,0.0925026908516884,1,0.3188495337963104,0.3204485774040222,0.24391335248947146,0.0505172535777092,0.06627128273248672,1,0.09217844158411026,0.4274061024188995,0.3882857263088226,0.04504853114485741,0.04708128049969673,2,0.06116785854101181,0.3318275213241577,0.4703182876110077,0.058677468448877335,0.07800888270139694,1,0.2208692580461502,0.4507023394107818,0.2674885094165802,0.036247652024030685,0.024692293256521225,1,0.13499988615512848,0.5069704055786133,0.29622066020965576,0.04182422161102295,0.01998485065996647,1,0.08565406501293182,0.4486337602138519,0.3949434459209442,0.04988508298993112,0.02088356390595436,1,0.12358469516038895,0.4626426100730896,0.3538368046283722,0.044142570346593864,0.01579337753355503,1,0.2321668118238449,0.4606153666973114,0.2541019022464752,0.036630518734455116,0.016485361382365227,1,0.21101568639278406,0.4994842410087586,0.2386375069618225,0.035789091140031815,0.015073529444634913,1,0.1833050101995468,0.5191121697425842,0.2475567311048508,0.036117274314165115,0.013908844441175459,3,0.19070766866207128,0.20167985558509827,0.20231519639492035,0.2031014114618301,0.2021958529949188,4,0.19158540666103369,0.1953592747449875,0.18837837874889374,0.21085737645626068,0.21381954848766327,4,0.1978214830160141,0.20058822631835926,0.18073038756847384,0.20615079998970032,0.214709147810936,4,0.2060181051492691,0.19720089435577395,0.18131045997142792,0.2046666145324707,0.21080400049686432,3,0.20309962332248688,0.20207642018795013,0.18934307992458346,0.2035667449235916,0.20191416144371035,0,0.20949648320674896,0.20825809240341187,0.19269543886184687,0.19434505701065066,0.1952049434185028,1,0.2061117887496948,0.21224112808704376,0.1933312714099884,0.1934494823217392,0.19486629962921145,1,0.253435492515564,0.3242854475975037,0.15353477001190186,0.12562327086925507,0.14312106370925906,1,0.3467320799827576,0.4418940246105194,0.10409828275442123,0.05352621525526047,0.053749386221170425,1,0.3737370073795319,0.4263963103294373,0.10328801721334456,0.05733251944184304,0.03924616426229477,1,0.3967570662498474,0.4546984434127808,0.06713443994522095,0.049638740718364716,0.031771253794431686,1,0.4314217269420624,0.4638996720314026,0.05049322172999382,0.03405960276722908,0.02012561820447445,1,0.4005233943462372,0.4789847731590271,0.06698761135339737,0.03527597710490227,0.01822823472321033,0,0.5715504884719849,0.3596230447292328,0.036515846848487854,0.020589370280504227,0.011721254326403141,0,0.5985437035560608,0.3408809006214142,0.03162921592593193,0.018298614770174026,0.010647586546838284,0,0.2695963978767395,0.22476136684417725,0.17819243669509888,0.12484689056873324,0.20260293781757355,0,0.4898826777935028,0.20129737257957456,0.09765936434268953,0.07667098194360733,0.13448959589004514,0,0.3843351900577545,0.2727845013141632,0.07382743805646896,0.14867950975894928,0.1203734502196312,0,0.4651903808116913,0.3898290097713471,0.034767329692840576,0.058136072009801865,0.052077140659093864,0,0.4878153204917908,0.4263523817062378,0.024738587439060208,0.02947605028

A month ago I had no idea that on a Saturday afternoon in November I'd be hanging 30 metres above the ground and enjoying it. Now I looked down at the river far below me, and realised why people love rock-climbing.
My friend Matt and I had arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't wonderful, but we had everything we needed (beds, blankets, food), and we were pleased to be out of the city and in the fresh air.
On Saturday morning we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron had come along with two friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn had come with Amanda. We had come from various places and none of us knew the area.
We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock- climbing and then we changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a good deal of pushing, we were out at last - covered in mud but pleased and excited by what we'd

27,"Dear David,
I am going to visit your country next month. I'm going to travel with two friends. We don't know where to stay. Are there any cheap hotels in your town? We would like to stay somewhere in the centre. Can you help us?
Carlos

Dear Carlos,
Hotels in the centre are expensive, but I have good news. I have spoken to my aunt Gloria about you and she says you can all stay at her house. It has more bedrooms that my house! That will be alright with you, won't it?

60,"HOWARD BONNIER

Bray is a beautiful village about fifty kilometres west of London. A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there about three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr Bonnier's name yet, but he's already quite famous in France. This is because he has written in French magazines about almost all the best restaurants in that country. He's only 29 years old.
When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his mother and father. He liked doing this so much that he decided not to buy lots of clothes and CDs; instead, he used his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought a lot of French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty!
So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been an easy thing to do? He says it's expensive to start your own restaurant and it's much more difficult to cook for fifty people than to cook for your family, but he's sure he's done the right thing.",0,KET,1,0.14033757150173187,0.32492750883102417,0.20940427482128146,0.15473780035972595,0.17059284448623654,1,0.1891906410455704,0.3095465302467346,0.1822340041399002,0.1925491690635681,0.12647970020771027,1,0.1855001300573349,0.3140494227409363,0.17381905019283295,0.193331316113472,0.1333000361919403,1,0.2716062366962433,0.2904725670814514,0.16180318593978882,0.19545191526412964,0.08066608756780624,0,0.320290207862854,0.2661614716053009,0.1683419644832611,0.1767994910478592,0.0684068351984024,0,0.3599164187908173,0.2644893527030945,0.1544501632452011,0.15824371576309204,0.06290034204721451,0,0.3866567611694336,0.2914173901081085,0.12056978046894072,0.14525862038135529,0.056097418069839484,0,0.3860317468643189,0.31692275404930115,0.1116659939289093,0.12813690304756165,0.05724256858229638,0,0.3928271234035492,0.3222184181213379,0.10570941120386124,0.12534891068935394,0.05389615520834923,0,0.4032136201858521,0.3274821937084198,0.09703709185123444,0.12322457879781724,0.04904250428080559,0,0.40644532442092896,0.324152946472168,0.09884131699800493,0.1233447715640068,0.04721565917134285,0,0.4254804253578186,0.3009444773197174,0.10530143231153488,0.124878890812397,0.0433947890996933,0,0.4431336224079132,0.30467918515205383,0.0959465280175209,0.11602720618247984,0.040213428437709815,0,0.4484436213970184,0.3131190538406372,0.08952354639768599,0.10983791947364807,0.039075765758752816,0,0.4487646222114563,0.31658467650413513,0.08773969113826753,0.10792528837919237,0.03898581489920616,3,0.14269521832466125,0.19162766635417933,0.1854524463415146,0.2779615819454193,0.20226307213306427,0,0.2758818864822388,0.2331899404525757,0.16687072813510895,0.17425696551799774,0.14980050921440125,0,0.3554650843143463,0.216634139418602,0.15138982236385345,0.15904071927070618,0.11747027188539505,0,0.4637376070022583,0.19031305611133573,0.15698666870594025,0.10223709791898727,0.08672554045915604,0,0.5019766688346863,0.22222888469696045,0.13420571386814115,0.06633744388818741,0.07525138556957245,0,0.5919898748397827,0.2094956636428833,0.09116579592227936,0.04658831283450127,0.06076037511229515,0,0.5385749340057373,0.2899911403656006,0.08804227411746979,0.03851727396249771,0.0448743961751461,0,0.5012531280517578,0.3371350467205048,0.08903227746486664,0.03725577890872955,0.035323772579431534,0,0.704237699508667,0.18248498439788816,0.051015522330999374,0.03169087693095207,0.030570916831493374,0,0.7103798985481262,0.1925921142101288,0.04265851527452469,0.02943799644708633,0.0249314121901989,0,0.7059189677238464,0.20369112491607666,0.04087364301085472,0.02844000980257988,0.02107611298561096,0,0.7554000616073608,0.1669413149356842,0.03521420806646347,0.02437075413763523,0.018073659390211102,0,0.7822060585021973,0.1459592431783676,0.032609377056360245,0.0217440202832222,0.017481287941336632,0,0.7731205821037292,0.15877866744995114,0.030823048204183582,0.02105472795665264,0.016222884878516197,0,0.76492840051651,0.16833697259426114,0.030204104259610176,0.020996427163481712,0.015534098260104656,4,0.1890769898891449,0.20261673629283905,0.20264019072055814,0.20266322791576385,0.2030028551816941,4,0.1908290982246399,0.1959268897771836,0.18717171251773834,0.2105078548192978,0.2155645042657852,4,0.1985240578651428,0.20102915167808533,0.1784728765487671,0.2056687623262405,0.21630506217479706,4,0.20793524384498605,0.1967328637838364,0.17962457239627838,0.20335237681865687,0.21235498785972595,0,0.20563586056232447,0.20184743404388428,0.18793390691280365,0.20164616405963887,0.20293667912483213,0,0.21441197395324707,0.207985520362854,0.1902889609336853,0.1919078826904297,0.1954056769609452,0,0.22409923374652865,0.2122112065553665,0.18340319395065308,0.18612593412399286,0.1941603720188141,1,0.3366137742996216,0.3429302275180817,0.11705025285482408,0.09287114441394806,0.11053447425365448,0,0.4533793926239014,0.38360169529914856,0.08196313679218292,0.04157749935984612,0.03947821259498596,0,0.5052280426025391,0.3623603880405426,0.06807001680135727,0.03914522752165794,0.025196319445967674,0,0.4814737439155578,0.39991745352745056,0.053748708218336105,0.03986547514796257,0.02499464899301529,0,0.5377307534217834,0.3858446776866913,0.03700917214155197,0.02512376941740513,0.014291572384536266,0,0.6019598841667175,0.3289446234703064,0.03638656437397003,0.02147876471281052,0.011230072937905787,0,0.6851447820663452,0.2633382678031921,0.026050753891468048,0.0163041390478611,0.00916206557303667,0,0.6868285536766052,0.26456648111343384,0.0243885088711977,0.01546215545386076,0.008754324167966844,0,0.3164689540863037,0.2231320142745972,0.13639472424983978,0.10669644176959993,0.217307910323143,0,0.5378639101982117,0.16323570907115936,0.07930567860603333,0.06297192722558975,0.15662284195423126,0,0.4029849171638489,0.2265035063028336,0.07263527065515518,0.13168463110923767,0.1661917269229889,0,0.550219714641571,0.2897382080554962,0.039054211229085915,0.05115742236375809,0.06983046233654022,0,0.5654319524765015,0.3297475576400757,0.03087656944990158,0.03087215311825276,0.

'Bollywood', which is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, makes almost 1,000 films a year. Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a much higher number than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries.
Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film is never made for under $5 million.
Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, who some people say is India's greatest actor, is different. He has been the star of more than 140 films during an acting career of almost 40 years.",0,KET,1,0.1505104899406433,0.326387494802475,0.17251133918762207,0.169720396399498,0.1808701902627945,1,0.19563910365104675,0.3089745044708252,0.15270137786865234,0.20464281737804413,0.13804219663143158,1,0.18813981115818024,0.3389740586280823,0.13009411096572876,0.1968839466571808,0.14590805768966675,1,0.2672734260559082,0.3406457901000977,0.11279945075511932,0.1775786578655243,0.10170269757509233,0,0.32665780186653137,0.3142576813697815,0.11714323610067368,0.15832093358039856,0.08362023532390593,0,0.3590136170387268,0.3112573325634003,0.11042625457048416,0.14239855110645294,0.07690426707267761,0,0.3595899045467377,0.3555959165096283,0.0908885821700096,0.1217622384428978,0.07216338813304901,1,0.3326228260993957,0.3869709372520447,0.08898723125457764,0.11445970833301546,0.07695931941270827,1,0.33563801646232605,0.39577674865722656,0.08482220023870468,0.11167259514331818,0.07209041714668274,1,0.3485952913761139,0.40374913811683655,0.07746078819036484,0.10606390982866287,0.06413093209266663,1,0.3558257520198822,0.3975187540054321,0.07840033620595932,0.1076677069067955,0.06058746948838234,0,0.3874020278453827,0.3703242242336273,0.0803794264793396,0.1079149693250656,0.05397937446832657,0,0.4082480370998383,0.3689257502555847,0.07480143010616302,0.0988069549202919,0.04921790212392807,0,0.4109311103820801,0.3762287795543671,0.0715034231543541,0.09359493851661682,0.04774172231554985,0,0.4074336290359497,0.3811149001121521,0.0707782581448555,0.09252952039241792,0.04814371839165688,2,0.15650947391986847,0.1930272430181504,0.2399257868528366,0.2273429632186889,0.18319448828697205,2,0.22781917452812195,0.1798807680606842,0.2305911034345627,0.20890535414218905,0.15280365943908691,0,0.2746096253395081,0.15513643622398374,0.20766222476959229,0.2283066362142563,0.13428503274917605,0,0.3699911534786224,0.14631518721580505,0.2385670095682144,0.14087417721748352,0.10425247251987456,0,0.402506560087204,0.19910378754138947,0.22321492433547974,0.08820271492004395,0.0869719535112381,0,0.5126532316207886,0.2099485099315644,0.14751741290092468,0.05915821343660355,0.07072275131940843,0,0.44600075483322144,0.27664607763290405,0.16101214289665222,0.05349607765674591,0.06284485012292862,0,0.408117949962616,0.3174753785133362,0.17034389078617096,0.04934990778565407,0.05471298471093178,0,0.5830117464065552,0.2231675535440445,0.10386121273040773,0.044840924441814416,0.045118581503629684,0,0.5959015488624573,0.2349589467048645,0.0900094211101532,0.04162751883268356,0.03750254958868027,0,0.5795931220054626,0.25824064016342163,0.08908073604106903,0.040012016892433167,0.03307348117232324,0,0.63230299949646,0.22430483996868134,0.07921808212995529,0.036170028150081635,0.028004074469208717,0,0.6736215353012085,0.19799259305000305,0.06993652135133742,0.03256673738360405,0.02588262222707272,0,0.6531322002410889,0.21983982622623446,0.0693420022726059,0.03266910091042518,0.025016827508807186,0,0.6348345875740051,0.236921027302742,0.0705910250544548,0.03316671773791313,0.02448675595223904,2,0.19117732346057886,0.20130445063114166,0.2036386877298355,0.2005369663238525,0.20334264636039734,4,0.19127850234508514,0.1956414878368377,0.18931147456169128,0.20829834043979645,0.21547019481658936,4,0.19805005192756653,0.20085549354553225,0.18101710081100464,0.20363837480545044,0.21643893420696256,4,0.20693321526050568,0.19744029641151428,0.18108819425106049,0.20222197473049164,0.21231625974178314,0,0.20416049659252167,0.2023567408323288,0.18913236260414126,0.20092819631099693,0.2034221738576889,0,0.21134202182292933,0.2095748782157898,0.1926453709602356,0.1910179704427719,0.19541974365711207,1,0.211839571595192,0.21817609667778007,0.1920856386423111,0.18568776547908786,0.19221097230911247,1,0.2834402620792389,0.35283538699150085,0.13590535521507266,0.10644052922725676,0.1213783547282219,0,0.4201455414295197,0.4036220908164978,0.09285207092761992,0.04281822964549065,0.04056215286254883,0,0.4793803691864014,0.3671132028102875,0.0834730863571167,0.043682705610990524,0.02635064162313938,0,0.4759611189365387,0.4048858284950256,0.05647293850779533,0.040093082934618,0.02258695475757122,0,0.5228546857833862,0.3930040895938873,0.04368714243173599,0.0263937097042799,0.014060382731258873,0,0.5376819968223572,0.35944661498069763,0.0581987202167511,0.029259033501148224,0.015413675457239153,0,0.6620297431945801,0.2697954773902893,0.03711074590682984,0.019882159307599068,0.011181856505572796,0,0.6722403168678284,0.26431605219841003,0.03424408286809921,0.01859689690172673,0.010602650232613087,1,0.2554929256439209,0.27297645807266235,0.12894552946090698,0.11747968941926955,0.225105419754982,0,0.4758021533489227,0.2106705754995346,0.07750096917152405,0.07351750880479813,0.16250881552696228,0,0.3427855968475342,0.27047529816627497,0.06035001575946807,0.1466444879770279,0.17974454164505005,0,0.4718357920646668,0.3510366976261139,0.03310754522681236,0.06334656476974487,0.08067343384027481,0,0.5168850421905518,0.3873530328273773,0.0230029746890068,0.030725935474038124,0.042

25,"Dinosaurs

No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago, a long time before there were any people on the earth. Nobody knows for sure why they all died.
The nearest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds.
Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some were very small, but others were giants. The largest were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was twenty metres long, and it ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was stronger. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. Also it could run fast because it had long back

13,"The Weather 

People are interested in the weather for a lot of reasons and it is important for people in many different jobs. For example, the weather makes a big difference for farmers. 
Many years ago, farmers spent a long time looking at the sky and at animals and flowers to try and learn more about the weather. Now there are lots of computer programmes which help us to learn about the weather, and people can even get weather information on their mobile phones. 
Today, a lot of people still believe in the old ideas about the weather. They say, for example, that if there is a red sky in the evening, it will be sunny the next day. Some people also think that when cows lie down in the fields, it will soon rain.

50,"POSTCARDS 

Today, people like to send postcards to their friends and family. These postcards often have pictures of beaches, mountains or castles on them and you can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because postcards are cheap and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. 
Somebody sent the first postcard at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, perhaps an accident or an important person's visit. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.
