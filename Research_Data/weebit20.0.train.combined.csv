0,189,"You probably know that cigarette smoking makes people sick. But did you know that smoking hurts the environment?
Sometimes people drop cigarette butts on the ground. Many beaches in the United States are littered with cigarette butts. When beach cleanups are held, cigarette butts are picked up more often than any other kind of trash.
Cigarette butts can be dangerous. Cigarettes have hundreds of poisons in them. Scientists worry that the poisons could pollute the ocean water.
Cigarette butts can also harm animals. Seabirds will try to eat cigarette butts. The birds think the butts are food. The butts get stuck in the birds' stomachs and make them sick.
Every day, about 3,000 kids start smoking.
The average age a kid starts smoking is 13.
About 46 million adults in the United States smoke.
Smoking-related illnesses kill about 500,000 people each year.
Smoking one cigarette takes about seven minutes off the smoker's life.
On November 16, kids across the United States will scream their lungs out. That's when the Great American SmokeScream will happen. The kids will tell people not to smoke.
You need healthy lungs to breathe and to scream loudly. Keep your lungs healthy by not smoking. Use your healthy lungs to tell other people not to smoke.

5,109,"Fire officials are alarmed. Some lighters are made to look like toys. Parents who think they are toys are buying them for their
children. Kids have started fires when playing with the lighters.
Now fire officials are fighting back. They want to stop the sale of those lighters. This year, Maine became the first state to pass a law to stop the sale of the lighters. Then Tennessee passed a law. Fire officials in Oregon are working to do the same.
Lighters are tools, not toys, says Richard Hoover. He is a spokesperson for the Oregon state fire marshal. A dangerous tool should not look like a toy.

8,210,"What is the difference between the two groups?
A reptile is an animal that has hard, dry skin. Turtles are the only reptiles that have shells.
Most reptiles have clawed feet and walk on four legs. Can you name a reptile that has no legs? A snake! Other reptiles include alligators, crocodiles, and lizards.
Most reptiles lay eggs on land. Baby reptiles hatch from the eggs. A leaf-tailed gecko, like the one shown on the cover, lays two eggs at a time. The corn snake lays up to 30 eggs at once! The boa constrictor is a snake that does not lay eggs. It gives birth to baby snakes.
An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Most have smooth, wet skin. Frogs, toads, newts, and salamanders are amphibians.
Most amphibians hatch from eggs. The eggs are usually in or near water. Young amphibians breathe through gills. When they get older, they breathe with lungs. Most adult amphibians live on land.
For example, you young frogs that hatch from eggs are called tadpoles. Tadpoles live in water and move like fish. After they grow legs, they can hop on land.
If you could be any reptile or amphibian, what would you be? Why?

10,270,"Many people are afraid of sharks. They think sharks are monsters. But one scientist thinks people should not be scared of sharks.
Sharks do not like the taste of people. That's what Dr. Peter Klimley says. Klimley is a scientist who studies sharks. He says sharks would rather eat seals and sea lions than people. Seals and sea lions have a thick layer of fat on them. Eating that fat gives sharks energy. Klimley says people's bodies do not have enough fat to fill up a shark.
Klimley thinks that sharks should be afraid of people. Each year, people kill about 65 million sharks. Some people like to eat shark meat. And some sharks die because they live in water that is polluted.
Klimley says that at least seven kinds of sharks are endangered. The number of those sharks has dropped in the past ten years. Klimley hopes that people will help protect sharks.
There are at least 340 kinds of sharks.
A shark's liver is filled with oil. This oil is lighter than water and keeps the shark from sinking.
Sharks have several rows of teeth. Sharks often lose their teeth while eating. New teeth quickly grow to replace the teeth that are lost.
A shark can swim 3 feet per second.
talked to Dr. Peter Klimley about his work. Here's what he had to say.
Why did you decide to study sharks?
I wanted to study how sharks behave. I wanted to get into their world and learn everything about them.
Why is it important to study sharks?
To me, sharks are a mystery that I wanted to learn more about.
No. Many kinds of sharks are not dangerous. I think sharks bite people by mistake.
Which kind of shark is your favorite?
The hammerhead shark. I have studied the hammerhead for most of my life. I am often called ""Dr. Hammerhead""!

11,202,"Hi! My Name is Pam Pollster. This is my pet parakeet, Polly. We live in Polling Place. Polly is a smart bird. In fact, she's so smart, she can count very high numbers. This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
. That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's as Easy as One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.

12,254,"Students raise their voices over green beans.
Lunch is now much tastier at Wright Elementary School in Nevada. The menu changed, thanks to a class of second graders.
The students did not like eating green beans. What did they do about it? They wrote letters to the school's food service.
""The food is great, but there's one problem. The kids don't like green beans,"" wrote one student. Another letter said, ""We love lunch, but we were wondering if you can pretty please change the green beans.""
The food service officials read all the letters. They asked the kids for their help. Read the steps below to see how students changed the lunch menu. Now all the kids can enjoy the new vegetable choices.
How many colors do you eat? Brightly colored fruits and vegetables are healthy. Experts say kids should eat a rainbow of colors. Each color helps the body in a different way. Read the chart to learn more.

20,641,"Workers clean the Gulf of Mexico after an oil spill.
At a busy aquarium in New Orleans, Louisiana, a sea turtle splashes about in clean, clear water. Its hard to imagine that just weeks ago the animal was covered in greasy oil.
Experts wash a bird rescued from the oily water.
the sea turtle from an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. That body of water is south of the United States. To rescue something is to save it.
Until recently, oil had been spilling into the gulf for months. The oil
miles of sea and beaches. To damage something is to harm it. Thousands of animals were trapped in the sticky stuff.
The spill began in April. Workers were drilling from on top of an
in the gulf. That is a building in the sea. It is used to collect oil. Suddenly, the oil rig exploded. The accident caused an oil well at the bottom of the gulf to leak.
Since then, experts have been trying to stop the oil from spreading. They recently plugged the well with cement. Workers are also cleaning the water. The cleanup could take years, experts say.
The work is starting to make a difference, though. Officials recently reopened part of the gulf to fishing. That is good news for people who live near the gulf.
We love the land, Alma Robichaux told
She lives in Louisiana. We cant go anywhere else.
The oil spill isnt the first big trouble for the Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina hit the area in August 2005. The huge storm killed more than 1,300 people in five states.
New Orleans, Louisiana, was one of the worst-hit areas. Even today, parts of the city look as if the hurricane just happened. Many peoples homes are still damaged from the storm.
A group of kids works to repair houses. To repair is to fix. The group is called Beacon of Hope.
Student Emma Ridenhour recently lent a hand. After five years, theres still a lot of work to be done, she told
It means a lot that I could ... help.
How might the oil spill affect people in other parts of the country? Why?

22,136,"The United States wrestling team is headed for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin and The Rock will not be there. Instead, amateur athletes, such as Terry Brands and Cary Kolat, will go for Olympic gold.
The 2000 Summer Olym-pics will take place in Sydney, Australia.
Real Wrestling. Real Heroes. That is the
, or slogan, of this year's Olympic wrestling team. The wrestlers use this motto because they are proud to wrestle for their country. They want people to know that the competition of Olympic wrestling is tougher than the professional wrestling of Mankind and Shane McMahon.
In the Olympic Games, there are two styles of wrestling,
. In Greco-Roman, wrestlers can use only their arms and upper body. In freestyle, wrestlers can use their legs to trip their opponent.
Unlike pro wrestling, the two challengers wrestle on a padded mat, not in a ring with ropes. They use certain moves to force their opponent to the mat.
Greg Strobel, a U.S. Olympic wrestling coach, says pro wrestling is meant to entertain. He says it is not a sport, like Olympic wrestling.
Chris Benoit and the Undertaker are two famous pro wrestlers. Many fans enjoy pro wrestling because of the action, fireworks, and costumes. However, pro wrestling is more of a show than a real contest, said Ron Buck, a sports reporter. According to many critics, the moves and punches in a professional match are fake.
U.S. Olympic wrestlers do not get paid to compete in the Olympics. For many team members, the chance to win a gold medal is a dream come true. Though pro wrestlers get more fame and attention, Olympic wrestlers consider representing the United States an honor. That is why, to many fans, these wrestlers are real heroes.
Olympic wrestlers compete only against others who are in the same weight class. Why is that an important rule?

23,130,"Chew on this! Your school cafeteria may be getting a makeover. Members of the U.S. government are trying to pass a new law. It would make school foods healthier. Under the plan, school cafeterias would serve meals with ingredients that are better for you. Vending machines, such as the one below, would also sell healthy snacks.
The idea is part of First Lady Michelle Obamas plan. She hopes to end childhood
That is the condition of being very overweight. About one-third of kids in the United States are too heavy, according to a study. Kids who are overweight are at a higher risk of having health problems.
If the law passes, schools would make kids foods healthier. Pizza, for example, might be made with low-fat cheese. [This bill] will help us [give] healthier school meals to children across America, says Obama.

24,78,"Inauguration Day is filled with events from morning to night. Some are serious, and others are just plain fun! Here are some of the day's top events.
George W. Bush taking the Oath of Office on January 20, 2001, after his first election.
George W. Bush first took the Oath of Office in 2001. That is when he became the 43rd U.S. president. The oath is the only part of the day's events that is required by law. Every president since George Washington has taken this oath.
In 1961, John F. Kennedy gave one of the most famous inaugural addresses. Kennedy was the 35th president of the United States. He said, ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."" What do you think his message meant?
In 1977, Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. president to walk in the inaugural parade. The parade starts at the Capitol and ends at the White House. The White House is the president's home for the next four years. Every president except George Washington has lived there.
An inaugural ball is a formal dance. The first official ball was held in 1809 for President James Madison. So far, no president has attended more inaugural balls than President Bill Clinton in 1997. He and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton attended 14 in one night!
George Washington's inaugural address in 1793 was the shortest. His speech lasted only eight minutes. In 1841, William Henry Harrison gave the longest inaugural address. It lasted almost two hours!
Cold weather caused quite a problem at the inaugural ball for Ulysses S. Grant in 1873. The ball was held in a tent, which wasn't heated, and the valves on the band's musical instruments froze!
In 1981, guests at Ronald Reagan's inaugural balls received a sweet treat. Forty million jelly beans--one of Reagan's favorite candies--were eaten to celebrate!

25,3,"A Look Back at a Leader: Martin Luther King Jr. 
On January 17, Americans will celebrate the life and work of Martin Luther King Jr.
""A day on, not a day off!"" Since 1994, that has been the slogan for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Many students have the holiday off from school. Kids at Greene Street Friends School in Pennsylvania, however, will make it ""a day on.""
The kids will sew quilts for needy infants and pack meals for elderly people. ""I like that I'm helping people,"" 10-year-old Justine Baird told
The students at Greene Street Friends School are among the thousands of kids across the country who will take part in community service projects. The projects honor King's memory.
A Look Back at a Leader: Martin Luther King Jr.
Delivered the ""I Have a Dream"" speech in Washington, D.C.
Martin Luther King Jr. Day first observed as a national holiday
King was an African American leader who devoted his life to improving the lives of others. He once said, ""Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve.""
When King was growing up in the South, African Americans did not have the same rights as white people. African Americans had to live in separate neighborhoods and send their kids to separate schools. Some African Americans were not allowed to vote.
Many Americans felt that such laws were unfair. When King was older, he gave speeches and led peaceful marches to try to change those laws. As a result of King's work,

Officials at the U.S. space agency are ending the shuttle program this summer. The shuttle
will shoot for the stars one more time this month. Then
will make its last flight in June.
The program took off in 1981 when NASA sent
to space. NASA built five shuttles in all. The others were
. Each spacecraft could carry up to 10 astronauts. The shuttles could spend about two weeks in space at a time.
One of the shuttles most important jobs has been helping astronauts build the International Space Station. That is a lab that
Earth. To orbit is to circle. The shuttles
astronauts to the lab. To ferry is to carry. Scientists from many nations run tests at the lab.
The missions arent cheap, though. One trip to space costs about $450 million. To save money, the U.S. government will now send astronauts to the lab on shuttles owned by private companies.
The new plan will allow NASA to focus on a mission thats really out of this world. Space officials want to send astronauts to Mars. Scientists have used
, or robotic spacecraft, to explore the Red Planet, but humans have never set foot there.
Officials hope that changes soon. Were looking to send human missions to Mars, Allard Beutel told
He is a NASA spokesperson. These [changes] are the early steps ... to get us there.
These astronauts accomplishments launched them into history books.

29,338,"Hold on tight! The latest weather report may blow you away. Scientists expect more
than normal to hit the United States this year. A hurricane is a strong storm that forms over an ocean.
A scientist predicts where hurricanes will hit.
Hurricane season lasts from June 1 to November 30. Experts
or guess, that eight to 12 hurricanes will form over the Atlantic Ocean this season. Why? The temperature of the ocean is warmer than usual.

30,318,"Rosa Parks is arrested and fingerprinted again in February 1956 for breaking segregation laws.
Fifty years ago, the courageous act of Rosa Parks changed history.
For years, Rosa Parks stood up to unfair laws against black people. Then on December 1, 1955, she changed the history of the United States forever. Rosa Parks was riding a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and was told to give up her seat to a white passenger. When she refused, she was arrested and taken to jail.
At that time, states in the South were
by law. The law kept black people from having the same rights as white people. Black people were forced to sit in the back of city buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, water fountains, and other public facilities.
After Parks was arrested, thousands of people refused to ride the city buses in Montgomery. The
was led by Martin Luther King Jr. and lasted for more than a year. It was a success. In 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the bus segregation law was illegal.
December 1 marks the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest for not giving up her seat. On that day, people across the United States will honor this important time in history.
Special events will take place in Montgomery, where the equal rights movement began. As part of the day's events, hundreds of kids will march to remember the bus boycott.
""Never again should we foster hate or distrust based on one's skin color,"" says event spokesperson Kenneth Mullinax. The children will march ""as a pledge to treat everyone with equal love,"" he told
""Rosa Parks's not giving up her seat on the bus shows how important it is to stand up for what we believe in,"" says Mullinax.
Today, people can step aboard the bus that Rosa Parks made famous. It is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan. The bus has been restored to look as it did in 1955.
Why should people stand up for what they believe in?

31,710,"Some kids who want to play tag are out of luck. The game has been
at Willet and McCarthy elementary schools in Massachusetts. (
means ""not allowed."") Those students are not alone. A growing number of schools across the country have put an end to the playground game.
Recess is safer without tag, say some school officials. At Freedom Elementary School in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the game often led to pushing and fighting. ""To be safe, [all students] must keep their hands and feet to themselves,"" the principal, Cindy Farwell, told
Others think banning tag goes too far. ""It's telling children we don't trust them to be safe when they play games,"" says Rhonda Clements. She teaches physical education at a college in New York. Clements also says kids should be able to choose whom they play with and what they play.

32,39,"What do you get when you cross Mickey Mouse with Dumbo? A long-eared jerboa! The little critter is from Mongolia and China. Those are countries in Asia. The animal is not actually a mouse. It is a rodent with long legs and giant ears.
, or at risk of dying out completely. Scientists recently filmed video of the animals for the first time. ""The big ears make them look cute and comical,"" scientist Jonathan Baillie told
Baillie is with the Zoological Society of London's EDGE of Existence program. The program works to
, or save, endangered animals. A team will study jerboas in an effort to save them.
""It is important to conserve the long-eared jerboa,"" Baillie says. ""If we lost [the animals] there would be nothing similar on the planet.""

34,566,"Asian swamp eels are no ordinary eels. They are fierce hunters. They can live on land and in the water. Now scientists are worried that the eels may take control of Everglades National Park in Florida.
The eels came from Vietnam, a country in Asia. Scientists believe someone accidentally released some of the eels in waters near the park. The eels feed on the plants and animals that many Everglades animals eat to survive. Scientists hope to catch the eels before they reach the park's waters. They plan to stun the eels with an electric stick and then catch them with nets.

35,379,"Park rangers bring Mesa Verdes history to light.
Mesa Verde has been a national park for more than 100 years.
Put on your party hat. This year, Mesa Verde (MAY-suh VEHR-day) National Park in Colorado has reason to celebrate. A century ago this past summer, the U.S. government set aside the land as a national park. (A century is 100 years.) The park protects the site of an ancient Native American city.
All year, the park has celebrated with special events. They included tours of the cliff homes and Native American dances, music, and stories.
(fuh-NA-lee), or big ending, of the celebration. On that night, park rangers will light up two of the largest cliff homes with about 100 lanterns.
The celebration honors the Native American tribe that built Mesa Verde. The tribe is called the Ancient Pueblo (PWEH-bloh). They are the
of todays Pueblo people. An ancestor is a family member who lived a long time ago.
The Ancient Pueblo lived in the area from about 600 to 1300. They lived on the
top until the 1100s. A mesa is a large, high rock with a flat top and steep sides. Later, they moved down to the sides of the cliffs and built homes there.
""Its not often that you come across a hundred years of something special,"" Mesa Verde park ranger Dan Puskar told
""It provides us the chance to look forward to the next 100 years and make sure this place stays preserved and enjoyed by the public.""
The park protects more than 600 ancient cliff homes. The two largest homes contain about 160 rooms each.
By 1100, the cliff homes were as large as some modern-day apartment buildings.

36,675,"Scientists are purring over the latest panther news. The cats are slowly making a comeback.
or very, endangered species. Fifteen years ago, only about 25 of the adult cats were left in the wild. Today, there are more than 100.
Scientists helped the panthers by starting a special breeding program. They moved eight cougars to Florida. Cougars and panthers are both types of mountain lions.
The panthers and cougars had healthy babies together. In fact, todays Florida panthers are bigger and stronger than their grandparents.
The baby boom doesnt mean the panthers are in the clear, though. A population of 100 is still not [workable] in the long term, says scientist David Onorato. [This] is a project thats going to have to be done again.

37,778,"So long, mystery meat! School lunches are about to get a lot more
U.S. President Barack Obama recently signed a new law. It requires schools to provide more nutritious food. The law is called the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Its purpose is to help kids be healthier.
This act is about doing whats right for our children, Obama said before signing the law.
So, what will the new law serve up? School officials have to remove sugary drinks and junk food from vending machines. They have to make meals healthier, as well. For example, instead of hot dogs, cafeterias might dish out whole-wheat spaghetti with meat sauce. There will also be more fruits and vegetables on the menu.

39,735,"Coins were available for buying and selling at the World's Fair of Money.
The sound of money was heard loud and clear this August at the World's Fair of Money. It was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
One billion dollars' worth of coins were at the fair. The money was available for buying and selling. Some coins cost less than a dollar. Other coins were worth millions.
Eight-year-old Sam Zurenski and his grandfather were among the visitors. Sam's grandfather collected coins when he was a boy. Now he is helping Sam build his own collection.

40,488,"Our sun is a seething ball of hot gases. The sun is always active, but for the rest of this year, the sun will be more active than usual, scientists say.
Activity on the sun can affect Earth. It can disrupt communications. It can also cause the
, which are shifting curtains of colored light.
When the sun is very active, dark spots, called
, dot the sun's surface. Each day, scientists can see more than 100 sunspots on the sun. Sunspots slowly change shape and move across the sun's surface.
Sunspots have a temperature of 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit (F). That might seem hot, but it is cooler than the rest of the sun's surface, which is a sweltering 10,000 degrees F. Because sunspots are cooler than the rest of the surface, they look dark--almost like shadows.
When the sun is very active, huge explosions can rip across its surface. Those explosions, called
, propel solar material into space. About three or four days after a flare erupts on the sun, the flare may collide with Earth's atmosphere.
When a flare reaches Earth, it can damage satellites orbiting Earth, power stations, and electrical equipment. In July, a huge flare interfered with communication satellites.
The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth.
A car traveling at 55 miles per hour would take 193 years to get from Earth to the sun.
It takes a beam of light eight minutes to travel from the surface of the sun to Earth.
When solar flares reach our planet, they can make gases in Earth's atmosphere glow. The glowing gases form the northern lights.
The northern lights can be many different colors: red, blue, green, or a combination of colors.
Scientists say the best time to see the northern lights is when the sun is active. People in many parts of the United States should be able to see the northern lights in the night sky this fall. People who live in the northern part of the United States have the best chance of seeing the dancing lights. To see them, the sky must be very dark.
senior editor Fran Downey once saw an aurora (the northern lights) while visiting Washington state. ""It began as a dull green light and got brighter and brighter, until it lit up the sky,"" Downey said. ""In the distance, I could hear coyotes howling at the aurora. It was beautiful.""

41,689,"Great whites are endangered. They are often hunted for their teeth and fins.
A great white shark cruised across the Indian Ocean in a record-breaking swim. The great white became the first shark known to complete a round-trip journey between two continents.
""This is the first time that an individual fish has been found to go across an entire ocean and come back to the same spot,"" says Ramn Bonfil, one of the scientists who studied the shark. Scientists named the shark Nicole, after Australian actor Nicole Kidman.
Nicole not only set a distance record but also took a bite out of the speed record. The great white clocked more than 12,400 miles on her trip from South Africa to Australia and back. She
or moved between locations, faster than any other marine animal.
The map shows Nicoles route between South Africa and Australia.
Great whites live mainly off the coasts of California, South Africa, and Australia. Nicoles 99-day journey was tracked with an electronic tag placed on her fin.
The tag recorded her movements, including how deep she dove in the water. The results stunned scientists. They discovered that there is more interaction among great white populations in Africa and Australia than had previously been thought.
The new find is helping scientists learn more about how sharks migrate and
(find their way). Why might Nicole have swum so far so fast? Scientists dont know for sure, but they think one of the reasons that she may have made the trip was a search for food. Great white sharks feed mainly on whales, seals, and fish.
And how did Nicole find her way from one continent to another? Although she frequently plunged to depths of more than one-half mile, Nicole spent most of her time swimming on the surface. That led scientists to suspect that great whites might use the sun and the moon to help navigate.
The recent discoveries have excited shark lovers. ""Its clear that we have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg,"" says Bonfil. ""There is still much to learn about great white shark migrations.""
Great whites arent the only big fish in the sea. There are about 370 species, or types, of sharks. Here are some sharks that make a splash.
The whale shark grows up to 40 feet long and weighs about 15 tons. Thats heavier than two elephants!
The dwarf lantern shark is thought to be one of the smallest sharks. It is about 6 inches long.
Although most sharks swim about 1.5 miles per hour (mph), the mako shark is thought to cruise around at 22 mph.
The dusky shark has the most powerful bite. Its jaws clamp together with 132 pounds of force.

44,458,"Making the Great Barrier Reef Even Greater
The Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia is the largest marine park in the world. It covers about 135,100 square miles. Recently, the Australian government added another 386 miles to the park.
The Great Barrier Reef is a series of coral reefs that were formed by billions of tiny creatures called
. As polyps die, they leave hard shells behind. Other polyps then live on top of the polyp shells. Over thousands of years, the polyp shells form a reef.
The Great Barrier Reef acts as a barrier for the northeastern coast of Australia. The reef prevents waves from slamming into the coastline and
, or washing away, too much land. It also provides a home for fish and other animals, including the dugong, a large mammal.
A colony of coral polyps can grow as much as 4 inches in a year.
Reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef are under stress. Pollution and disease are killing the polyps, and tourists take pieces of coral. Reefs are also damaged by ships and fishing nets, which break off sections of coral.
The damage is widespread, experts say. According to one report, by the World Resources Institute, more than half the world's reefs are at risk.
Australian government officials hope by expanding the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, they will help protect the reef and its inhabitants.
The expansion of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park will protect both the reef and an endangered marine animal called the
The plant-eating dugong is a cousin of the manatee, or sea cow, which is found in the warm waters of Florida. The dugong lives in the Pacific and Indian oceans. The average dugong is about 9 feet long and weighs up to 600 pounds.
Hunted for its meat and skin, the dugong is also losing habitat to construction and pollution.

46,625,"Pilot whales are members of the dolphin family.
A happy ending took place off the southern coast of Florida in August. Five pilot whales were released back into the ocean. Pilot whales are members of the dolphin family.
Rescue workers had nursed the whales back to health after the creatures had become stranded in shallow water in April. Their return to the water marked the first time in history that five whales stranded at the same time were returned to the ocean together.
Using a crane, volunteers lowered the whales headfirst into the water. The whales had been fitted with special devices for scientists to track their progress. As the whales swam away, many volunteers cheered. Some were moved to tears.
Later in the day, people in a helicopter spotted the whales swimming together. Rescuers hoped that the five would join a larger group of nearby whales.
""Walt Disney couldn't write a story better than this,"" said one animal-care worker.

47,370,"During the summer, a strange brown goo fell from the sky onto buildings and people in several towns in Idaho. The sticky goo coated everything it fell on.
People splattered by the weird substance couldn't figure out what it was. Now, the state's Department of Environmental Quality has identified it.
The strange substance is not some weird goo from space. It is actually bee waste. The environmental workers found an unusually large number of beehives near the towns where the goo fell.
When the bees from those hives flew over the communities, they dropped the waste. Because it was a good year for bees, there was a lot of waste. Luckily, the bee goo is made mostly of pollen and is harmless.

48,408,"Live from New York ... except this time, it wasn't! Pop singer Ashlee Simpson, the younger sister of singer Jessica Simpson, was caught
Lip-synching is mouthing the words or singing along to a recording. Some performers sing along to a prerecorded track to make their voice sound stronger.
A computer glitch was to blame for Simpson's mix-up on
. Simpson, 20, was caught lip-synching when the words to the wrong song began playing.
Simpson's dad rushed to her defense after the incident. He said his daughter was lip-synching because an upset stomach had made her voice hoarse.
""Every artist that I know in this business has had vocal problems at some time,"" he told The Associated Press. ""So you've got to do what you've got to do.""
An embarrassed Simpson apologized to her fans but said she hadn't done anything different from what many other artists do. Some music industry officials defend the practice. They say it's nearly impossible to sound good and sing on cue when you're dancing onstage or performing complicated acts.
Difficult dance moves are not an excuse for lip-synching, say many fans. In fact, some fans say lip-synching is a dishonest practice that hurts a singer's credibility.
Fans often question a star's talent if the singer is unable to perform live onstage. They say most people can sound good on a CD if their voice is enhanced in a studio. Some concertgoers also feel betrayed and disappointed if an artist lip-synchs, especially when they have spent a lot of money on a ticket to hear a live performance.
""[Lip-synching is ridiculous] and not entertaining in the least,"" a person commented online to NBC, the company that airs

49,482,"Cleaning up the environment is in the bag for one student.
For years, Samantha Goldfeld, 11, and her family have carried their own reusable cloth bags to the grocery store. ""My family is saving almost 800 disposable bags each year,"" the sixth grader from Scottsdale, Arizona, told
""Then we got to thinking about what that number would look like if everyone carried cloth bags instead of using paper or plastic.""
More than 500 billion plastic shopping bags are used each year worldwide. Plastic bags pollute city streets, jam recycling machines, and harm animals that get caught in the bags or ingest them. Plus,
are needed to manufacture plastic bags. Nonrenewable sources cannot be replaced.
Now Samantha has the chance to teach others about the benefits of reusable cloth bags. Samantha belongs to the community service group, Roots and Shoots, which will take part in National and Global Youth Service Day. Founded in 1986, the annual project is the largest service event in the world. From April 20 to 22, millions of young people across the globe will participate in volunteer projects, ranging from recycling to tutoring young children.
To encourage more people to use reusable cloth bags, Samantha and other Roots and Shoots members will host an information session. They plan to talk about the benefits of reusable cloth bags and provide tips for reducing plastic bag use.
Samantha is looking forward to the service event. ""Doing community service makes a difference for the environment, animals, and people,"" she says. ""Together we can make a huge difference for our planet.""

50,216,"Central Florida cleans up after the first tornadoes of 2007.
The windy season in Florida began in a big way. Residents of four counties are recovering after a series of destructive
ripped through central Florida, killing 20 people, damaging hundreds of homes, and cutting off power to more than 20,000 people. A tornado is a powerful, rotating tube of air that runs from the ground to a thundercloud. The recent tornado was so strong that it lifted a moving tractor-trailer off the ground and dropped it onto another truck. Fortunately, neither driver was seriously hurt. The drivers did, however, find out how powerful a tornado can be!
Tunnel of Fury: How A Tornado Forms
The strongest tornadoes develop from powerful, large-scale thunderstorms called
. The Florida tornadoes were created by supercell storms.
 Supercells are created when fronts of warm, moist air collide with cold, dry air.
 The opposing warm and cold gusts of air create a rotating column of rising wind called a
 When the funnelshaped cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.
During the recent Florida tornadoes, winds reached speeds of more than 150 miles per hour. The storms were rated EF-3 on the
Scientists use the scale to measure the size and strength of tornadoes. The scale ranges from EF-0, the weakest, and EF-5, the strongest (with winds of more than 200 miles per hour).
Average number of tornadoes reported each year in the United States:
Length of damage trail a tornado can leave: up to
Tornado time span: up to one hour, but most tornadoes last less than

51,765,"Larry Stevens lives in a remote, quiet area of Hawaii. Recently, that changed when new neighbors moved into the area. The noisy neighbors are two kinds of frogs.
Even though the coqui and greenhouse frogs are each only about the size of a dime, they make a huge racket. Instead of making soft chirping or gentle croaking sounds, the frogs chirp as loudly as a lawnmower. ""You'd never believe so much noise could come from a creature that small,"" Stevens said.
Scientists say the frogs in Stevens's backyard recently arrived in Hawaii. They came from islands in the Caribbean Sea, south of the United States mainland. Scientists think the frogs were accidentally shipped to Hawaii in flowerpots.
Since arriving in Hawaii, the foreign frogs have spread to 150 areas. In some areas, more than 8,000 can be found on a single acre of land. Each one is adding to the noise level.
The frogs are more than a noisy nuisance; they are causing other problems, as well. They eat insects that birds and other frogs used to eat. Each night, each thunderous frog can eat at least six insects.
The number of frogs is increasing because no other animals prey on them. If the foreign frog population keeps growing, other frogs and birds in Hawaii might not have enough insects to eat and might starve.
Some officials worry that the frogs might cause some people to leave Hawaii because of the racket. ""We get a lot of complaints from residents,"" said Fred Kraus, a spokesperson for the state. ""Some [have] threatened to leave the state.""
Residents of Hawaii are trying to capture the shrill frogs, which live in trees. Recently, Stevens and some of his neighbors went out looking for the noisy critters. They used ladders to climb into trees and capture frogs. ""We got them all,"" he said.
However, within a few months of the frog roundup, more frogs moved into Stevens's neighborhood. ""It was hopeless,"" Stevens said. ""There were just too many [frogs to capture]. Now they're out of control.""

This has been a record-breaking year for wind power. Power companies in the United States have built thousands of new
Those are windmills that produce electricity as they spin. By the end of the year, power companies will have built enough wind turbines to power Rhode Island! With this years additions, wind power will create enough electricity to light more than 2.5 million homes in the United States, according to the American Wind Energy Association.

53,462,"Where does famous TV puppet Howdy Doody belong? That was the question that a court in Hartford, Connecticut, had to answer. The court recently decided that Howdy belongs to a museum in Detroit, Michigan.
, the first children's TV show seen across the country. The show was aired between 1947 and 1960. It featured host Buffalo Bob and his sidekick puppet, Howdy Doody.
When watching the show, kids saw Howdy on their TV screens, but they never saw the man who controlled the puppet--Rufus Rose. When the show ended, Rose kept Howdy. After Rose died, his children held on to Howdy.
However, officials at the Detroit Institute of Arts said that Rose had promised to donate the puppet to the museum. Rose's family didn't want to give up the puppet, and the two sides asked a court to decide Howdy's fate.

54,672,"""A day on, not a day off"" has been the motto of Martin Luther King Jr. Day since 1994.
On January 17, thousands of people around the country will honor King's work by participating in community service projects and taking part in parades. Martin Luther King Jr. Day became a holiday in 1986. King (1929-1968) was a civil rights leader who worked against
. That is the act of treating others unfairly. King dedicated his life to making sure that African Americans received the same treatment under the law as white people.

55,361,"The Heat Is On: Will Global Warming Affect Animals?
Polar bears in Alaska are having trouble catching one of their main meals--ringed seals. To get to the seals, the bears often walk across islands of ice floating in the water.
Ice throughout Alaska is melting earlier and faster in the spring than it did several years ago. So polar bears don't have as much time to catch seals before the ice melts. As a result, polar bears are catching fewer seals.
Ice along Alaska's coast is melting because the temperature is higher worldwide. In the last 100 years, Earth's temperature has risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit.
. Global warming is changing the environment worldwide. As a result, many plants and animals are being affected, say scientists from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
As temperatures rise, more and more animals will have to
, or move, in order to survive, said scientist Jay Malcolm of the WWF.
Many plants and animals that can't adjust or migrate will not survive the rise in temperature, said WWF scientists. In some areas of the world, the WWF says, as many as two in ten species of plants and animals will die out by the year 2100.
Here are some examples of how global warming is affecting some animals in North America.
The numbers on the map show where each animal can be found.
The black guillemot (GIL-uh-maht) is a bird that lives on an island off Alaska's coast. It eats Arctic cod, a fish that lives in water under ice. Rising temperatures have caused much of the ice to melt. The Arctic cod has moved to other parts of the sea where water is still covered with ice. The guillemot no longer has enough fish to eat.
The American bistort is a plant that lives in Mount Rainier National Park. The Edith's checkerspot butterfly drinks nectar from bistort flowers. The warming temperatures have caused the butterflies to hatch earlier, before the flowers bloom, so the butterflies don't have enough food right after they hatch.
Global warming is actually helping some animals.
The Mexican vole lives in areas with warm temperatures. It is spreading northward into Arizona and Colorado because of the rise in temperatures there.
For years, red fire ants lived in the warm southern part of the United States. Today, because of rising temperatures, they are spreading northward.
Scientists have learned that global warming is already affecting Earth. ""We should not expect the effects of global warming to take place 50 years in the future,"" said scientist Rafe Sagarin. ""It's happening right now.""
Scientists agree that Earth has been getting warmer for the last 100 years. They don't agree on
Gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming. Carbon dioxide in the air traps heat from the sun, causing Earth's temperature to rise.
Volcanoes and forest fires release carbon dioxide into the air. Some scientists blame the rise in temperature on volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and other natural events.
Other scientists blame human actions for the rise in temperature. They say Earth has always had volcanoes and forest fires, so why is Earth warming now? Those scientists say the carbon dioxide from automobiles and factories is causing the recent increase in global warming.

57,111,"Tsunemi Kubodera stands before a giant squid on Display at National Science Museum in Tokyo.
A team of Japanese scientists snapped the first photographs of one of the deep sea's most mysterious creaturesa giant squid. It was the first time a giant squid was photographed in the wild! The researchers took more than 500 pictures of the sea creature off the coast of the Bonin Islands in Japan.
How did scientists nab pictures of the 26-foot-long sea monster? They tracked down the squid by following the only creatures that feed on itsperm whales. Once they determined where the whales dined, the scientists attached a robotic camera to a fishing line with bait. Then they took pictures of the purplish-red squid attacking its prey nearly 3,000 feet beneath the ocean's surface. The squid became caught on the camera but eventually swam away after one of its tentacles broke off.

58,778,"A new tennis star has arrived. Andy Roddick claimed his championship trophy in early September. He won his first major tennis tournament at the U.S. Open in New York, defeating Spain's Juan Carlos Ferrero.
""It hasn't sunk in,"" said an emotional Roddick after the match. ""I came to this tournament so many times as a little kid and watched from way up there [in the stands].
Along with his trophy, Roddick accepted a $1 million winning prize. Because of this championship win, Roddick has risen to number two in the tennis rankings, which is a career record for him. However, Ferrero, who won the French Open, still holds the top slot.
The four Grand Slam tournament in tennis are the Australian Open, Wimbledon the French Open, and the U.S. Open.
With Roddick's win, the torch has been passed to a new American tennis generation. Just days before Roddick's victory, American tennis star Pete Sampras announced his retirement from the sport. Sampras won the U.S. Open in 2002. He was just few years younger than the 21-year-old Roddick when he took home his first U.S. Open title in 1990.
Last year, Roddick lost the U.S. Open to Sampras. For any who questioned his ability, Roddick proved that he is the new U.S. Open champion.

59,733,"A group of college students has given new meaning to the words road trip. Beginning in mid-May, the students traveled from the East Coast to the West Coast aboard a bus that left the smell of fries and onion rings in its wake.
They weren't riding in an ordinary bus. They were traveling aboard a pollution-free vehicle that used recycled vegetable oil as fuel.
is the process of turning an old item into something new. Vegetable oil from cafeterias and restaurants powered the bus.
The students' college in Vermont provided about 200 gallons of vegetable oil to get the bus started. The vegetable oil had been used to fry chicken, potatoes, and other foods served in the cafeteria. As the students traveled across the country, they stopped at fast-food chains instead of gas stations to refuel the bus.
About a month later, the students completed their trek in Washington state. They hope to spread a message about protecting the environment.
Vegetable oil creates less pollution than diesel fuel, said one of the students. ""It's using some resource that was going to be thrown away and reusing it.""

, the writing tends to stick to facts - things you know about and things that can be checked elsewhere.
, the writing tends to be about facts and reasons, so you'd write about why or how something happened.
, it's like taking a photo of something - you need information, but also lots of interesting details. You can include your own thoughts and feelings as well, because that helps convey information to your audience.
So really, the ideas and topics you can write about are almost the same. It doesn't matter which of the three styles you are doing, you basically want to give information to your readers. What makes the difference is how you go about it.

Preparing, planning and checking - Sample questions
Use the TAP technique for the question below. It will help if you read the question through several times and slowly to digest the content.
The following article has appeared in your local paper:
Ashfield Park is threatened with closure next month as a local business has applied for planning permission to turn the area into a car park. Local residents have begun a fierce campaign to save the park, which is a popular walking spot for young children and the elderly, as well as home to the War Memorial and many wildlife species.
Write to your local paper, arguing that the park should be preserved.
Have a think - what is the TAP? When you have your answer, check it with ours by pressing the 'Check ideas' button.
- it's to argue and persuade. This means you want to influence other people and tell them what you think is right
There are lots of ways of planning - some of them are fancy, some of them are simple, but the most important thing is to write your ideas down. If you don't, you could easily forget them.
Let's have a go at using the question about the park. The simplest plan is just to write down a list of all the points. Look again at the question, think of a list, then compare yours to ours.
If you are writing an argument, and we are in this question, we can make two lists - one is the positive side - which supports your view, the other is the negative side - which goes against your view. Have a go, then compare your lists with ours.
Some people like spider diagrams. These are more complicated, but they can show how points are linked, like this:
Use whichever way you find best, but don't forget that planning is something you can practise. You'll get quicker and make more detailed plans if you keep trying.
Why must you prepare and plan? Find out here.

We've already looked at how foods are broken down by enzymes in digestion. Now we will look at how the products of digestion are absorbed into the body.
. This means that they pass through the wall of the small intestine and into our
. Once in the bloodstream, the digested food molecules are carried around the body to where they are needed.
Only small, soluble substances can pass across the wall of the small intestine. Large insoluble substances cannot pass through. Study the slideshow to check your understanding of this.
The inside wall of the small intestine needs to be
. This allows absorption to happen quickly and efficiently. If the small intestine had a thick wall and a small surface area, a lot of digested food might pass out of the body before it had a chance to be absorbed.
To get a big surface area, the inside wall of the small intestine is lined with tiny
). These stick out and give a big surface area. They also contain blood capillaries to carry away the absorbed food molecules.
Excess water is absorbed back into the body in the large intestine. What is left then is undigested food. This is stored in the
, the lower part of the large intestine, until we are ready to go to the toilet. It then comes out of the rectum through the

64,374,"Now consider the following extract. Read through it carefully and note down three things you think it tells us about the main character. Once you've done this, compare your ideas against ours.
Stanley didn't have many friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.
What does this extract show us about the main character?
Stanley is another big male, but it is clear that the writer wants us to react differently to him than we did to Jim Wellings in the earlier extract.
Stanley is a lonely boy, because he ""didn't have many friends at home"". He is bullied and teased, even by adults. The fact that the teacher causes him ""embarrassment"" by showing him up in front of the class proves that he feels uncomfortable about his weight.

65,79,"The following table shows the times of the buses from Cambridge to Duxford and Whittlesford:
a) I want to go to the Duxford Imperial War Museum. Which bus should I catch from Cambridge?
b) The 0805 from Cambridge is running 6 minutes late. What time does it reach Pampisford?
c) If I arrive in Sawston at 0932, what time do I leave Cambridge?
d) How long does the journey from Great Shelford to Duxford Wheatsheaf take?
a) The only bus which goes to the Imperial War Museum leaves Cambridge at 0835.
b) The 0805 usually arrives in Pampisford at 0838. So if it's running 6 minutes late it will arrive at 0844.
d) The bus leaves Great Shelford at 0722 and arrives at Duxford Wheatsheaf at 0745. So it takes 23 minutes.

68,547,"Probability is often based on surveys, because you get a more accurate measure of probability by basing your calculation on a large number of results.
Alex is doing some reporting for his local paper. The subject of his article is 'holidays'.
As part of his report he decides to question 10 of his friends whether they prefer caravanning or camping holidays. Seven out of 10 say that they prefer caravanning, so Alex writes the dramatic headline you see above.
Alex has based his probability on a very small survey. This is equivalent to throwing a die 10 times, throwing a 6 nine times by chance, and stating that the probability of obtaining a 6 is
! To estimate probabilities from the results of surveys, you must gather a large number of results.

Inform, explain and describe - Add the senses
Another way to add detail to your descriptions is to use your senses. Think about what you can see, what you can touch, what you can smell, what you can taste and what you can hear. If we go back to your house, you might be able to add sounds, like music from your sister's room, the sound of the neighbour's lawnmower, or a baby crying upstairs.
Here's a typical writing to describe question:
Write a description of your school during a typical break. Include information about the buildings and the people. You might want to write about the classrooms, the hall, the playing fields and the corridors as well as the pupils and the staff.
Why not have a go at planning an answer to this question now? You could have a go at writing a full answer, or just jot down some points and details on rough paper.

76,31,"> Inequalities and Simultaneous Equations - Algebra
You can solve simultaneous equations by adding or subtracting the two equations from each other.
Add the two equations together and you will find that the y disappears:
3x + 2x + y - y = 9 + 1
6 - 5 = 1 (which is correct)
To make the 3x's disappear we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
3x - 3x + 2y - (-y) = 8 - 5
6 - 1 = 5 (which is correct)
So the solution is x = 2, y = 1

77,145,"Ratios are used in everyday life and can help you work out problems including scale drawings and reading maps.
In a scale drawing, all dimensions have been reduced by the same proportion.
A model boat is made to a scale of 1:20 (1 to 20). This scale can be applied to any units, so 1mm measured on the model is 20mm on the actual boat, 1cm measured on the model is 20cm on the actual boat, and so on.
a) If the 1:20 model boat is 15cm wide, how wide is the actual boat?
b) If the boat has a mast of height 4m, how high is the mast on the model?
The scale is 1:20. This means that every cm on the model is equivalent to 20cm on the boat.
a) 1cm on the model = 20cm on the boat, so:
b) 20cm on the boat = 1cm on the model
so mast height on real boat  20 = mast height on model
400cm (4m) on the boat = 400cm  20 =
Maps scales can be written in ratios and tell you how many units of land, sea etc are equal to one unit on the map.
If you are travelling from Manchester to Newcastle, for example, and need to know how far it is, it would be very difficult to work this out if the map does not have a scale.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. A distance is measured as 3cm on the map.
How many cm, m and km is this equivalent to in real life?
1 cm on the map represents 50 000cm. Therefore, 3cm on the map represents 150 000cm.
To convert from cm to m, divide by 100.
To convert from m to km divide by 1000.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. What distance on the map will represent 5km?
5km = 5000m = 5000  100 cm = 500 000cm
We want to know what distance on the map represents 500 000cm in real life.
The map scale is 1:50 000, so we divide by 50 000
500 000  50 000 = 10

78,210,"> Food chains - Pyramids of numbers
The population of each organism in a food chain can be shown in a sort of bar chart called a pyramid of numbers. The more organisms there are, the wider the bar. The producer in the food chain always goes at the bottom of the pyramid of numbers.
Clover is a plant and it is the producer in this food chain. Its bar goes at the bottom of the pyramid:
Energy is lost to the surroundings as we go from one level to the next, so there are fewer organisms at each level in this food chain. A lot of clover is needed to support the snail population. A thrush eats lots of snails, and a hawk eats lots of thrushes, so the population of hawks is very small.
Sometimes the pyramid of numbers doesn't look like a pyramid at all. This could happen if the producer is a large plant such as a tree, or if one of the animals is very small. Remember, though, that whatever the situation, the producer still goes at the bottom of the pyramid.
An oak tree is very large so many insects can feed on it
Fleas are very small and lots of them can feed on a rabbit

Why is prototyping and testing so important?
Today there are thousands of multimedia products on the market, to serve many tastes. Some products are appropriate for one

Below are some of the things to consider during the prototyping and testing process.
Does your multimedia product meet all the requirements specified in the project brief?
Is the content correct and appropriate for the audience?
Have spelling and grammatical errors been corrected?
Does it convey the intended message appropriately?
Is the colour scheme, font and layout suitable for the intended audience?
Can people use or understand your product without assistance?
Does it work in different browsers and on different platforms?

82,4317,"Nylon has some desirable properties. It does not let ultraviolet light pass through it, and it is:
Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.
Gore-Tex has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.
Teflon is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.

84,1307,"You will need to use your Ideas about science to:
Distinguish questions that can be answered using a scientific approach from those that cannot. For example, science can answer the question, ""What are the chances of my child having cystic fibrosis?"". However, it cannot answer the question, ""Should I have my pregnancy terminated?""
State clearly what the issue in any debate is. For instance, in a debate about treating genetic diseases with gene therapy, some people think that altering our
The material inside the nucleus of cells, carrying genetic information. DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid.
is against nature or God. The ethical issue is whether scientists should be allowed to use
treating or preventing disease by introducing or replacing specific genes inside human cells
You will also need to summarise the different views that different people might hold. For example, if gene therapy saves lives, it can only be a good thing. Or, we should not use gene therapy because we do not know the long-term outcomes.
Identify arguments that are based on the right decision, ie a decision that produces the best outcome for most of the people involved. So, if a certain type of gene therapy involves a risk of causing harm, but 90 per cent of the people who have the therapy are cured, is it worth taking the risk?
Identify when certain actions are never justified because they are unnatural or wrong. For example, we could wipe out cystic fibrosis in one generation if we made sure that anyone who was a carrier was not allowed to have children. However, most people would consider this action to be immoral and wrong.

production the designer is frequently the maker as well. The client is usually the end-user of the product, and will have high expectations about the quality of the product. The designer will nearly always have a direct relationship with the client, so it is essential that the designer is fully conversant with the end-user's requirements.
production method for making a small quantity (between two and about 100) identical products.

production method for making hundreds of identical products, usually on a production line. Also called repetitive flow production.
production method for making many thousands of identical products. The difference between this and mass production is that the production line is kept running 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
flow production the processes of designing and manufacturing are much more formal. Making of changes can become slower. There is little or no contact between the designer and the client. The designer is therefore dependent on other people feeding back the end-users' views.

Source A: Instructions for treating a broken nose
If you examine a man whose nose is disfigured - part of it being squashed in while the other part is swollen and both his nostrils are bleeding, then you shall say: ""You have a broken nose and this is an ailment I can treat.""
You should clean his nose with two plugs of linen and then insert two plugs soaked in grease into his nostrils. You should make him rest until the swelling has gone down. You should bandage his nose with stiff rolls of linen and treat him with lint every day until he recovers.
Source B: Instructions for treating swellings in the body
When you come across a swelling of the flesh in any part of the body of a patient and your patient is clammy and the swelling comes and goes under the finger, then you must say to your patient: ""It is a tumour of the flesh. I will treat the disease. I will try to heal it with fire since cautery heals.""
When you come across a swelling that has attacked a channel, then it has formed a tumour in the body. If when you examine it with your fingers, it is like a hard stone, then you should say: ""It is a tumour of the channels. I shall treat the disease with a knife.""

How does the relationship between Eddie and Catherine change during the first act of the play? Give reasons for your answer.
Explain the background to the relationship and show what the relationship is like at the start of the play.
Para 2 - The relationship at the start of the play
Discuss Eddie's reaction to Catherine's new skirt and her new job, and what this shows about his feelings for her.
You could also mention Beatrice's view of the relationship at his point - she gives us the first hints that Eddie is over-protective.
Para 3 - Impact of Rodolpho's arrival
Discuss how the arrival of Rodolpho immediately changes the state of Eddie's feelings for Catherine. As she becomes more attracted to Rodolpho, Eddie becomes more desperate to prevent his rival taking Catherine away from him.
Para 4 - Contrast Eddie's and Catherine's feelings for each other
Comment on the difference between Catherine's innocent fondness for Eddie and his shameful love for her. Give examples to show how we know what each of them is feeling.
You could also mention Alfieri's view of Eddie's love and how Alfieri understands it was impossible for Eddie to control.
Para 5 - Fight at end of Act I
Examine the fight at the end of Act I when Catherine makes it clear that she loves Rodolpho more than Eddie. How does this prepare us for Act II?
Look forward to what will happen in Act II. Briefly summarise how what we have learnt about the relationship so far prepares us for the fatal ending.

92,6222,"""he was a skinny, vivid little boy, with a glance coming up from under a hut of straight hair that hung down, black and course""
""He walked with an accustomed tread through the fruit trees""
The first time we meet Simon, he is in his choir robes. He faints on the beach because of the heat and Jack mocks him. We know he is delicate. He has epilepsy.
""a skinny, vivid little boy, with a glance coming up from under a hut of straight hair that hung down, black and course""
. His hair hides his face, which hints to us he is secretive.
He is imaginative: he sees the buds on the bushes as
He is helpful and works for the good of others; he is the only one to stick with Ralph to make the shelters. He is kind to the littluns and finds fruit for them.
The others recognise he is 'different' to them in some way. Ralph says
""a secret place in a clearing full of flowers and butterflies""
, and is sufficiently at one with the jungle to walk in it alone at night. He is at one with nature and he has no fear.
He seems able to prophesy - he is the first to suggest that
""You'll get back to where you came from""
He is the most perceptive about the beast. He says
""maybe there is a beast... What I mean is... maybe it's only us""
. He is the only one to see that the problems on the island stem from the boys' relationships with each other, not from an outside force. Yet nobody understands what he's trying to say.
When the Lord of the Flies 'speaks' to him this idea is reiterated: the voice in Simon's head says
""Fancy thinking the Beast was something you could hunt and kill!... You knew, didn't you? I'm part of you?""
He is killed just as he is about to reveal the truth. It is ironic that he is the only one who finds out that the 'beast' was a dead parachutist, but is denied passing on the message because the group of boys think, in their frenzy, he is the beast.
Simon's close relationship with nature seems to carry on even after he is dead:
"" The waves turned the corpse gently in the water. ... Softly, surrounded by a fringe of bright inquisitive creatures, itself a silver shape beneath the steadfast constellations, Simon's dead body moved out towards the open sea""

95,1659,"bject. Asteroids or comets on a possible collision course with the Earth are NEOs.
They are difficult to observe because they are smaller, and darker, than planets. But scientists are actively observing many NEOs with telescopes. It is possible to calculate the
(path) of an NEO if enough observations are taken over time.
Asteroid collisions leave craters behind. These are obvious on the Moon, but on the Earth craters are usually eventually weathered away or covered over by natural processes.
Other evidence for past impacts comes from studying layers of rock built up over millions of years. For example, some adjacent layers show abrupt changes in the type and number of fossils. This shows the possible effect on living organisms of an asteroid hitting the Earth.
Iridium is a rare metallic element on Earth, but it is relatively abundant in space. There is a layer of iridium-rich rock dating from around 65 million years ago. This is evidence of an asteroid collision.

96,3160,"(Mishnah and Gemara collected together) describe different roles for men and women.
Traditionally women have a sacred role - they bear children, run the home and take responsibility for their childrens Jewish upbringing. The woman passes on Jewish values and it is because of the mothers Jewish faith (not the fathers) that a child is born Jewish.
While Jewish law excuses women from some religious duties (eg, they dont have to wear the
Fringes on the corners of the Tallit (prayer shawl).
Small leather boxes containing passages from the Torah, strapped to the forehead and arm for morning prayers on weekdays.
) there are some duties that women are obliged to carry out like the lighting the
is the day of spiritual renewal and rest commencing at sunset on Friday, terminating at nightfall on Saturday.)
. Men and women sit separately in Orthodox services and women cannot take an active part in this worship. Some Jewish women today accept these limitations, but they are as well-educated as men and choose to combine a career with family responsibilities.
Progressive Jews (which includes Jews of both liberal and reform traditions) think that this attitude is wrong and treat women equally in all respects, so they too can become rabbis (Jewish teacher) if they choose to do so.

Children and Young Persons Act introduced a set of regulations that became known as the

were introduced for the over 70s, which gave them 5s a week, or 7s 6d to a married couple. Old people cried as they collected their pensions, and said: 'God bless Lord George'.

was passed. Part 1 of the act gave people the right to
of 10s a week for 26 weeks in return for a payment of 4d a week. Part 2 of the Act gave people the right to unemployment pay (
) of 7s 6d a week for 15 weeks in return for a payment of 2d a week.
1906 - the Trades Disputes Act ruled that unions were not liable for damages because of strikes.
1906 - the Workers Compensation Act granted compensation for injury at work.
1910 - half-day a week off for shop workers.
A Merchant Shipping Act improved conditions for sailors.
From 1911, MPs were paid. This gave working men the opportunity to stand for election.
Why did the Liberal government introduce these reforms?
in 1901 found that 28 per cent of the population did not have the minimum to live on at some time of their life.
- when Britain went to war in 1899, the army found that two-thirds of the men who volunteered for the army were unfit to join up.
- which had a good system of state welfare for workers, was passing Britain as a great industrial power.
meant politicians feared that, unless standards of living improved for the workers, they might turn to Communism or rebellion.
and it was attracting working-class voters because of its demands for welfare reform.
Liberal Party did not get a majority
of seats in the House of Commons, so it had a coalition with the 42 Labour Party MPs who had been elected.
Many government politicians, especially Lloyd George, genuinely wanted to
By 1914, 150,000 children were getting one good meal a day.
Not compulsory - some councils did not provide free meals
Kept many old people out of the workhouse.

By 1914, 1 million people were being employed through the labour exchange.
Most of these jobs were temporary or part-time; the government did not do anything to increase the number of jobs available.
A vital safety net to tide people over hard times.
Poor people had to pay the contributions out of their wages; dole and sickness pay only lasted for a limited time; and

was not enough to live on - a family of five needed 1 a week.
Only for the wage-earner - it was not available to their wife or children.
A plan for expected income and spending over a specified time period.
- to pay for the reforms, Lloyd George's 1909 budget raised duties on tobacco and spirits, raised income tax by 16 per cent (from 1s to 1s 2d), and introduced a new 20 per cent tax on profits from selling land.
When the House of Lords refused to pass Lloyd George's budget, the House of Commons passed an Act stating that the House of Lords could not reject a bill that had been passed three times in the House of Commons. It also required a general election every five, not seven, years.
Lloyd George became loved - old people cried when they got their pension and blessed 'Lord George' who gave them - and hated - workers who objected to paying national insurance chanted: 'Taffy was a Welshman, taffy was a thief' at him.

- as promised, Lenin made the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany although it meant that Russia lost vast amounts of its best industrial and agricultural land in Poland and the Ukraine.
- the Bolsheviks gave the land previously owned by the nobles to the peasants, and factories were handed over to workers' committees.
- the Bolsheviks banned religion; brought in an eight-hour day for workers, as well as unemployment pay and pensions; abolished the teaching of history and Latin, while encouraging science; and allowed divorce.

People should contribute to the public wealth according to their ability, but receive according to their needs.
The means of production should be owned equally by the whole community (hence communism), not as in capitalism where individuals (who might be very rich) own the means of production and leave the rest of society to be poor and oppressed wage slaves.

They should work to overthrow capitalism throughout the world by means of a revolution by the proletariat (workers).
Class was a feature of capitalist society, and should be destroyed and replaced by a society of equals.
The economy should be planned - controlled by the government.
Lenin changed Marx's ideas to add that a Communist government first had to be a dictatorship which was essential in order to bring in the communist state safely.
