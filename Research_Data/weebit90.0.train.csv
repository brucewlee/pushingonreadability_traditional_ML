Different types of weather can happen in March. What is the weather like near you?
Sunlight comes from the sun. The sun is a huge, hot ball of gas. It sends warmth to Earth. How warm or cold it is outside depends on how much sunlight reaches Earth.
Clouds are groups of tiny drops of water floating in the air. Clouds can be puffy and white or flat and dark. They can block the sun from shining in places.
Snow is made up of tiny pieces of ice that fall to Earth. The pieces of ice stick together to form snowflakes. Each snowflake has a different shape.
Rain is made up of drops of water that fall to Earth from clouds. Rain gives freshwater to people and animals for drinking. Plants also need water to grow.
Wind is air moving on Earth's surface. Wind carries things such as plant seeds from one place to another. It can also carry a kite high into the sky!
Sometimes weather can be dangerous. Check out three types of wild weather.

Some members of the Seminole tribe think the rule is unfair. They believe that FSU honors their traditions. Tribe members designed the mascot's costume, they say. They add that the student chosen as the mascot has to study the tribe's culture to earn that honor.
The NCAA decided to let FSU keep its tradition. However, the rule remains for at least 17 other schools.

Experts have also warned that tourists visiting Machu Picchu are damaging the Inca ruins. In recent years, tourists have started small fires and have littered the Machu Picchu area.
The government of Peru, however, disagreed with the warnings. ""Machu Picchu won't collapse,"" said one government official.
The official said that Machu Picchu has lasted for more than 500 years. He added that he doesn't see why landslides or tourism would destroy the city anytime soon.
The Incas built Machu Picchu sometime around 1460. The blocks used to build Machu Picchu were wedged so tightly together that a razor blade cannot fit between the stones. The ruins include about 200 stone buildings, including palaces, temples, and small homes.
The Incas were a South American Indian people who ruled one of the largest and richest empires on the continent. By 1532, the Incas ruled an area that stretched for 2,500 miles along the west coast of South America. The Inca empire included parts of what are now Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.
The Incas were skilled in farming and in building stone structures and roads. They were also skilled craftspeople, making many fine gold and silver ornaments. They studied the stars and knew how to predict the seasons of the year.
Spanish soldiers, led by Francisco Pizarro, attacked and conquered the Incas in 1532.

After about 10 days, a tadpole hatches from the egg. It breathes using gills and moves like a fish.
After about five weeks, the tadpole's gills disappear, and it grows lungs.
At about 12 weeks, the young frog grows legs, and its tail disappears. It leaves the water and can live on land.

Everyone knows helping others is a good thing - maybe even chimps! Scientists recently studied from Uganda. That is a country in Africa. The scientists did tests that show that chimps often help people or other chimps, even if they get nothing in return.
In one test, a person dropped a stick near a group of chimps. In most cases, a chimp handed the stick back to the person. Chimps care about other chimps too. In another test, a chimp handed over the stick when another chimp dropped it. The animals did not receive food or praise for their actions in either test.
The results surprised the scientists. They had long thought that humans are the only animals that help others. ""We've never seen this level ... of

Earth Day inspires people to take action and help the environment. Many people will be spreading the message that the Earth needs to be cared for year-round.
Kids around the world will participate in Earth Day events. Some will clean up parks. Others will plant trees. What do you plan to do on Earth Day to help the environment?
One way to protect the Earth is to reduce pollution. Pollution occurs when people harm the air, land, and water. Most air pollution comes from the burning of fuels, such as oil, coal, and gas. The fuel is used to run cars and heat homes. Water and land pollution often come from chemicals and garbage.
Some Earth-friendly inventions help reduce pollution. These inventions conserve, or use fewer, energy and natural resources such as water. Take a look at some of these exciting inventions.
? An Earthship is actually not a ship at all. It is a house built to save energy and water. Earthships use solar power from the sun for heat and electricity.
Earthships are made from recycled material. Old tires, aluminum soda cans, and glass bottles are some common materials used to build Earthships.
Many people who live in Earthships also recycle their water. When it rains, they collect and filter the rainwater. The filter makes the water safe to use for drinking, washing, and cooking. The leftover water is saved for other uses, such as watering indoor plants.

Whats 23 feet long, as thick as a telephone pole, and slithering into a state near you? A Burmese python!
Pythons and other giant snakes are worming their way into Florida and other states. That is the finding of a new report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The species are not
to, or originally from, the area. They might have started out as pets that were set free. Many pythons are native to Asia.
Today, there are tens of thousands of pythons in Florida. They may one day creep into almost one-third of the United States, scientists say.
They [can move] long distances in a short period of time, scientist Gordon Rodda told

. Those are groups of plants and animals that live in the same area. The snakes eat everything from birds to bobcats. They lie still until an animal comes near. Then the
strike. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals that often have scales.
U.S. officials are coming up with ways to stop the snakes. One idea is to
people from bringing pythons into the country. To ban is to prevent.
People in Florida move an 18-foot-long python to a safer home.
People who own pet snakes can help too, Rodda says. If you have a snake that gets too big for your home, take it to a zoo. We dont want to create a problem by [setting free] an animal we no longer want to take care of, says Rodda.
What makes giant snakes special? Wrap your head around these python facts to find out.
, or squeeze, prey? They loop their bodies around the prey and tighten their muscles to kill the animals. Then they swallow them.
Only alligators are tough enough to eat adult giant snakes. Dont feel bad for the snakes, though. They eat alligators!
Female pythons can lay up to 100 eggs at a time. The snakes stay on the eggs for two to three months to keep them warm until they hatch.
What are other ways U.S. officials could stop the snakes?

Meet the soon-to-be members of rescue teams--rats! Scientists are training the rodents to help find people who are buried in buildings after earthquakes and other disasters.
Rats have a strong sense of smell, which can help them sniff out people. The rodents are also tiny enough to crawl just about anywhere. They can get into places that are too small for people and other animals, such as dogs.
Scientists trained the rats to search for the scent of people. They attached tiny electronic devices to the brain of each rat. Signals from the rat's brain are sent to a radio that is strapped to the animal's back. Rescue teams will be able to track the signals and follow the rat's path. That will help them figure out where to start digging. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next six months.

The wolves, however, weren't injured. The sharpshooter had shot special darts at them. The darts contained a drug that put the wolves to sleep.
U.S. government officials picked up the sleeping wolves. They planned to move the wolves to an area far away from people.
The two wolves are part of a program to bring wolves back to Arizona and New Mexico. Until about 1900, the Mexican gray wolf lived in both states. Some of the wolves ate cattle and attacked people. People hunted the wolves because they thought the animals were dangerous. By 1950, few wolves were left in the area.
The U.S. government has brought wolves back to those states. But ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico say wolves are causing problems again.
What's the scariest animal? Is it a grizzly bear, a shark, or a wolf? Or is it something else? Believe it or not, deer are more dangerous.
Deer may seem harmless, but they can cause a lot of trouble. Deer often wander onto busy roads. When they do, they can cause car accidents. In 2001, deer caused 26,000 car accidents. A year earlier, they caused 83 human fatalities.
Ranchers say the wolves that the sharpshooters hit with darts killed 19 calves. The ranchers fear that the wolves might attack people as well.
""I can handle the bears and the mountain lions and the bobcats,"" said one rancher. When you see [those animals], they take off. They're scared of you. These wolves, they're not scared. And that's what scares me.""

Historians continue to debate whether people should be allowed to visit the shipwreck. Some think it should be left as a memorial to those who sank with the ship.
Marine explorer Robert Ballard found the Titanic wreck 18 years ago. He told Weekly Reader that he had mixed feelings about the discovery. Although he felt both pride and joy, he also remembered that the site is a graveyard. ""I couldn't help but think about the [more than 1,500] lost souls who died,"" he said.
Do you think it's important to preserve the Titanic? Why or why not?
Ballard believes the wreck should be left alone. ""The site is a memorial, and it is better to bring people there through advanced technology rather than ravage the site through salvage,"" he said.

Manatees were once thought to be on the edge of
or dying out completely. In the 1970s, there were only about 1,000 manatees left. Today, there are more than 3,000.
As a result, Florida recently removed the manatee from its list of
Endangered species are animals or plants that are at risk of dying out.
The first laws protecting this slow-moving marine mammal were passed in the late 1970s. Those laws made hunting, capturing, or killing manatees illegal.
As Floridas human population grew, however, manatees faced more threats. Last year alone, 396 manatees died in Florida, according to the states Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Many manatees have been injured or killed in collisions with boats. Others have gotten tangled in fishing gear. Manatees are also threatened because of the loss of their
As builders develop along the coastline, they destroy the manatees natural homes.
Environmental factors, such as red tide, have also taken their toll on the playful creatures. Red tide occurs when millions of tiny organisms are present in an area of the water. Those tiny organisms turn the ocean red and brown. Some of them are harmful to fish and other animals.
Red tide occurs naturally in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2005, more than 80 manatees were killed in red-tide outbreaks.
Not everyone thinks it is a good idea to remove manatees from the list. Many wildlife experts worry that the unusual mammals will not receive the same protection they had in the past. ""We cant celebrate yet,"" warned manatee expert Patrick Rose in an interview with
State officials say that the manatee is not under urgent threat. Although the huge creatures are being removed from Floridas list, state scientists say that the animal will remain protected under the nations Endangered Species Act. That law offers special protection to animals and plants facing extinction.
Wildlife officials say protection of the manatees might even be strengthened. The next step calls for the writing of a plan to continue increasing the number of manatees. ""There will be no less protection,"" says Henry Cabbage of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
A manatee recently got a taste of the Big Apple. Manatees are rarely seen far from the warm coastal waters of Florida, but one adventurous sea cow swam north to waters off New York City this summer. The large marine visitor then swam to waterways about 25 miles inland. Wildlife officials say its not unusual for manatees to
or move from one place to another. However, the mammals typically dont go much farther north than Virginia.
Should manatees have been removed from Floridas endangered species list? Why or why not?

127,"Trained rats may soon be used to find survivors who are trapped after disasters.
A team of scientists might be ditching the phrase ""oh, rats!"" from their vocabulary. They are experimenting with ways that rats may help find people who are buried as a result of earthquakes or other disasters.
Like dogs, rats have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out survivors. The rodents are also small enough to crawl almost anywhere. Dogs can be limited in their searches because of their larger size.
The scientists trained the rats to recognize the scent of people. To do that, researchers implanted electronic devices into the brains of the animals.
The electronic devices affect the rat's brain so that it picks up the scent of a person and then plans how to locate the person. Signals from the rat's brain are relayed to a radio transmitter that scientists attach to the rodent's back.
Rescue teams then will be able to track those signals and follow the rat's path. That will help rescuers determine where to start digging for survivors. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next nine months.

More class time can improve test scores, according to a recent report by the research group Education Sector. As a result, schools are experimenting with tacking on an hour or more to the school day.
Elementary and middle school students at Fletcher-Maynard Academy in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have gone to an eight-hour school day. Fletcher-Maynard Academy is just one of 10 schools in Massachusetts trying out the new schedule. Lawmakers in Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, and Washington, D.C., are also debating extended school hours.

Students aren't just spending the extra time with their heads in a book, though. Harris explains that her students get longer recesses and more snack time. Parent Dawn Oliver says her 11-year-old daughter, Brittany, is an advice columnist for a magazine at her school in Fall River, Massachusetts. ""The kids get so involved in these things because it's not all book work,"" says Oliver.
Critics argue that extended school days could be too long for today's busy kids. And extra school time might prevent students from exploring other interests.

Skin may not seem very important, but it is. It protects your body from burns, dirt, germs, and dangerous rays from the sun. It keeps fluids inside your body. And it contains all the nerves that allow you to feel things.
Skin is the largest organ in your body. If you stretched out an adult's skin into a flat sheet, it would cover an area of about 21 square feet. A square foot is a square whose sides each measure 1 foot.
Skin may cover a large area, but it is very thin. It is only about 1/8 inch thick. Despite being so thin, skin is made of three layers. The outermost layer is the epidermis. Just below the outermost layer is the dermis. Beneath those two layers is the subcutaneous tissue.
The epidermis contains a chemical called keratin. Keratin makes skin tough and waterproof. Keratin keeps germs out of your body.
The dermis is mainly made of blood vessels and nerve endings. The dermis provides the epidermis with food and oxygen.
The lowest layer, the subcutaneous tissue protects the body from blows. It also regulates the body's temperature.
All three layers of your skin protect you. Because your skin protects you, you should protect it by keeping it clean and eating a healthful diet. You should use sunblock when you are in the sun. If you take care of your skin, it will last a lifetime.

Route 66 has been called the ""Main Street of America."" It once stretched 2,400 miles, from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California. The road connected eight states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
In the 1920s, engineer Cyrus Stevens Avery of Tulsa, Oklahoma, envisioned a road connecting the Midwest and the Pacific Ocean. During the 1930s, Route 66 was completed and was soon lined with hundreds of businesses.
The road became so popular that it inspired a 1960s TV show,

In the past few decades, however, Route 66 has fallen into disrepair, and parts of the old route have been dug up. Today, drivers use faster superhighways to get where they were going.
Even though fewer people drive on Route 66 now, many people still think of the road as the Main Street of America. That's why the National Museum of American History wants to include the road in its new exhibit, ""America on the Move."" The exhibit is scheduled to open in 2003.

A team of six Portuguese water dogs helped the San Francisco Giants every time the baseball team played at home at Pacific Bell Park. The dogs are members of the Baseball Aquatic Retrieval Korps (BARK). They retrieved home run baseballs hit into nearby McCovey Cove.
BARK uses Portuguese water dogs because they are excellent swimmers. The dogs have webbed feet and use their tails as rudders. Portuguese fishermen use these swimming hounds to herd schools of fish into nets and deliver messages between ships.
A local animal shelter, Pets In Need, auctioned the balls that Rio, Shadow, Topper, Surfer, Kyma, and Justy retrieved. The money is used to help other animals at the shelter.

628,"Drinks like soda have caffeine and lots of sugar.
Soft-drink companies are in fizzy competition. Many people in the United States are overweight. In the face of the nation's growing health and nutrition problems, many schools have banned soft drinks and other high-sugar snacks from vending machines.
As a result, the pressure is on for soft-drink companies to find new ways to stay in school. Some companies, such as Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, are introducing new milk-based drinks in different flavors to be sold in schools.
Some experts claim, though, that the milk-based drinks are still too high in sugar. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration won't allow the makers of those products to use the word
in their names. That's because the beverages don't have enough calcium and other minerals in them.
is a mineral found in milk and other dairy products that helps build strong teeth and bones.
Soft-drink giants aren't the only beverage companies trying to find their place in school districts. As part of a deal with New York City, Snapple will be the only drink company to have vending machines in the city's schools. To meet the city's rules banning high-sugar foods from schools, Snapple had to create four new 100-percent juice drinks.
Not good enough, say some nutrition experts who claim the new Snapple drinks have more calories and sugar in them than soft drinks have. Unlike orange juice and grapefruit juice, the new juices contain only small amounts of nutrients and vitamins. ""The fact is... they are pretty much the same as a [soft drink],"" said one expert.
Why is it important to read food labels carefully?
Other nutritionists disagree. They say the new juices and milk products are an improvement over previously available choices.

Oil from the tanker formed a huge slick on the ocean. Much of the oil washed up on nearby beaches. It covered at least 150 miles of coastline, killing fish, birds, and other animals. Some experts say cleaning up the oil-soaked beaches could take years.
A few days after the tanker began leaking oil, it broke in half. After the tanker broke apart, its

About 18 million gallons of oil are still inside the ship. The weight of the ocean water pressing on the ship could cause the oil tanks on the ship to explode, spewing oil across the ocean floor. Even if the oil tanks don't explode, they will rust and leak.
""[The ship is] a time bomb at the bottom of the sea,"" said one expert. ""There's nothing that makes us believe it won't finally burst and leak all its oil.""

399,"Students in Colorado are riding a school skateboarding trend.
Skateboard class is rolling into schools! For sixth grader Carlos Cervantes, learning to skateboard takes a lot of work, but its worth it. ""[On] the first day of class, I was scared, but I tried it,"" the 12-year-old told
""After two days of practice, I felt more comfortable.""
Carlos is learning to skateboard in an after-school program at West Middle School in Aurora, Colorado. Skateboards are now finding their way into the regular school day as well. Douglass Elementary in nearby Boulder is the first public school in the country to offer skateboarding in gym class.
Douglasss physical education (PE) teacher Richard Cendali starts his skateboarding class by teaching students how to put on their safety gear and how to fall without getting hurt. Then kids start rolling around the gym. ""Sometimes theyre so excited, they fall. Theyre screaming, Im doing it! Im doing it!"" says Cendali, laughing. ""Its such a thrill to see those kids succeed and see their smiles.""
PE instructors around the country have started teaching classes such as skateboarding, in-line skating, yoga, and even rock climbing. Experts call these sports ""the new PE."" These individual sports are designed to help fight childhood
by getting kids involved in fun physical activities. Obesity is the condition of being dangerously overweight. Another goal of these nontraditional activities is to promote lifelong fitness habits.
Since 1980, the percentage of young people who are overweight has more than tripled. The time students spend in PE class, however, is decreasing. Many schools have dropped gym classes to save money or to provide students with more classroom time. Only 8 percent of elementary schools offer gym class to students every day, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Because students have less PE time, teachers are searching for ways to keep kids moving. ""[Skateboarding] is a great activity that keeps kids engaged in physical movement and gives them new skills and interests,"" says West Middle Schools afterschool program coordinator, Lindsey Johnson.
Some people say skateboarding not only offers health and fitness benefits but also teaches life lessons that could help kids with their schoolwork. Students who are learning to skateboard often spend hours practicing a new trick before they get it right. ""Skateboarding teaches kids to believe that if they stick with something, they will ultimately succeed,"" says education expert Richard Sagor of Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon.
Carloss skateboarding teacher at West Middle School, Eric Klassen, agrees. ""A baby will attempt to walk 600 to 900 times before [he or she] is successful,"" Klassen says. ""We tell students that they shouldnt say I cant do it unless theyve tried 600 to 900 times.""
Klassens students take his advice to heart. ""It took me 600 times to learn one new trick,"" says Martin Carrera, 11.
Over the last decade, team sports have dropped in popularity while individual sports, such as skateboarding, have been on the rise. This trend may affect the kinds of activities PE teachers offer in gym class. Learning individual sports gives all students an opportunity to exercise, whether they make it onto a school team or not.
Imagine that your school offers a skateboarding class. Would such a class have a positive effect on you? Explain.

348,"As firefighters battle the flames, how do some fires help Mother Nature?
Whoosh! Within seconds, a spark sets off large flames. The flames of a wildfire tear through a forest, destroying thousands of acres of trees and brush and threatening the homes of people and animals.
From California to Colorado and from Alaska to Arizona, firefighters have been battling thousands of wildfires this year. Wildfire season began in June and will last through November. So far, the flames have destroyed more than 3 million acres in the United Statesan area about the size of New Jersey!
The states in red show where the most wildfires have occurred this year.
Most wildfires are started naturally, either by lightning or from the sun's heat. Others are accidentally started by careless humans who leave campfires burning.
Hot, dry weather has caused most of this season's wildfires to spread. ""This year is unique,"" Rose Davis, an official at the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center, told
. Davis explained that the Northwest is suffering a
. A drought is a long period of dry weather with little rain. In the Southwest, heavy rains in the spring caused a lot of new grass to grow. The new grass burns quickly when it dries out.
Firefighters have been fighting the scorching flames from the ground and the air. Specially trained firefighters called
parachute from planes or helicopters to reach
fires. Because smoke jumpers leap into out-of-the-way areas, they carry enough food and water with them to survive for several days.
Although wildfires can be very dangerous, they are not all bad. In areas where few people live, officials monitor the wildfires. Sometimes, officials allow them to burn because the fires help the environment and keep forests healthy. ""If fires are going to spread to people's homes and property, we have to put them out,"" smoke jumper Lori Messenger told
Wildfires are like nature's housekeeperand forests come back to life after fires. ""Fire is a natural part of our forests,"" says Messenger. ""The fires kill the less healthy, diseased trees. They clean out the brush to make space for animals to graze on the new grass that grows.""
Some plants also need heat from a fire to help them release their seeds, which grow into new plants after a fire. Fire is nature's way of recycling dead plants into the soil. The dead plants help return nutrients to the soil.
Although some animals die, many creatures have ways of protecting themselves. Large animals, such as deer, moose, and buffalo, head to safety. Small animals, such as snakes, toads, and mice, burrow in the ground.
""It's important to realize that fires are an important part of what happens in a forest,"" says Messenger. ""It's a complicated balance, and people who manage the forest have to make good decisions about what fires will be fought and what fires will be left to burn.""
What qualities do you think a person needs to be a smoke jumper?
A fire requires three ingredients to burnheat, fuel, and oxygen. The combination of those three building blocks is referred to as the fire triangle.

as she watched heavy rains and high winds rip through her hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana. The 9-year-old had been getting ready to start fourth grade. Her brother, Terren, had arranged his school supplies in his backpack to prepare for his first day of second grade. But Hurricane Katrina prevented schools in New Orleans from opening.
When New Orleans flooded, Tenisha and her family headed 350 miles west to Houston, Texas. They spent five days in a Houston hotel until a local family provided them with shelter. Now Tenisha and her brother are getting used to a new school in Houston. ""I've started making new friends already,"" Tenisha told
Tenisha and Terren are not alone. An estimated 372,000 children from Louisiana and Mississippi have found themselves in new schools, since the hurricane caused damage and flooding in those states. Schools from Maine to California have embraced students like Tenisha and Terren with hugs, smiles, and welcome signs.
Schools in Texas expect to enroll as many as 60,000 new kids. Houston schools alone enrolled almost 2,000 students in the few days following the devastating hurricane.
Two schools in Houston that had closed last spring have reopened. The two schools are now devoted entirely to
children. An evacuee is a person forced to move from a place of danger. School principals are also hiring hundreds of new teachersmany are evacuees from Louisiana and Mississippi.
Being the new kid at school is never easy. Experts say that it's even harder for children
because of the hurricane. Displaced people have been forced to flee from their homes.
Students who have left their homes have to
or get used to, new schools, teachers, and friends, say officials. Schools also play an important role in helping kids from the stricken areas cope with the disaster of Katrina.
Tenisha and Terren are adjusting well to their new schoolMacGregor Music and Science Magnet School in Houston. So far, MacGregor has accepted more than 12 displaced students. ""We want each one of the new children to feel this is home for them,"" the school's principal, Patsy Brown, told
Students at MacGregor have welcomed the new faces. ""We want to make our new classmates feel good because we know they've gone through so much,"" fourth grader James McKethen told
James's sister, third grader Tiye McKethen, agrees. ""It's cool to have new friends. And they get to have fun in a new school and stay in a safe place.""
After just two days, Tenisha and Terren were settling in at MacGregor. ""Our new school is great!"" Tenisha told
But the siblings know that life has changed. Despite the warm welcome, Terren misses playing basketball with his friends in New Orleans. Tenisha, too, misses her old teachers. What's next for the family? They will likely settle down in Texas. Tenisha says, ""I want to stay in Houston.""
I live in Desoto, a town outside Dallas, Texas. My school district has taken in roughly 188 students from New Orleans. I must hand it to the kids; they are adapting pretty fast. It is cool because our school is doing everything to make the new students feel at home. We call it ""Southern hospitality.""
I have seen many acts of kindnesswhether it's letting a kid from New Orleans go to the front of the lunch line or giving a new student a personal tour of the school.
I wonder if I could be as strong if my city went through a disaster such as Katrina. What happens to New Orleans from here, we don't know. But what we do know is that we need to appreciate our family and friends. We need to be thankful for the things that we have because we do not know what tomorrow will bring.

Leaping from his rowboat, Australian crocodile hunter Steve Irwin lands on top of a fierce 12-foot-long crocodile. Covered with mud, Irwin wrestles with the reptile and finally ties up its snout and legs. The out-of-breath hunter then stands in front of the croc and declares, ""She's a beauty!""
Irwin is the star of the hit TV show
. In the United States, 60 million viewers see the wildlife show each week. The show is watched by people in 122 countries around the world.
Irwin, age 38, has been interested in animals and the environment since he was a child. He grew up in a wildlife park in Queensland, a state in Australia. For his sixth birthday, Irwin's parents gave him a 12-foot snake called a scrub python. At age 9, Irwin captured his first crocodile. Ten years ago, Irwin took over the park that his parents had started. Five years ago, his show aired on American TV for the first time.
is about more than wrestling crocodiles, snakes, and other wild animals, Irwin says. He explained that the show is also about making people aware of problems facing many animals.
""We don't run around capturing wildlife for the fun of it,"" Irwin said. ""Our love is to educate and share with the world threatened wildlife. We want to bring animals into your house so that we can share and learn about them.""
For example, Irwin was recently on the Australian island of Tasmania. Irwin was working with the World Wildlife Fund to rescue stranded whales. He wants to call attention to whale hunting in the South Pacific Ocean. ""This practice [whaling] has to stop,"" Irwin said.
Not everyone agrees that Irwin's show is good for animals or the environment.
Kent Vliet does not like ""the haphazard way in which [Irwin] handles snakes and gets bitten."" Vliet is a reptile expert who has worked for the National Geographic Society. Vliet fears that viewers might copy the croc hunter's dangerous moves and get hurt.
Instead of wrestling animals, Vliet said, Irwin should talk more about protecting endangered animals and the environment.
For now, the croc hunter said he will keep on wrestling crocs and snakes and bringing people up close with some of Earth's endangered animals. ""I will continue to put my life on the line to save wildlife,"" he said. ""This is my passion, and it won't stop.""

89,"Fingerprint technology has a new home  in the cafeteria.
Talk about easy money! Students in Rome, Georgia, can now pay for cafeteria food with a touch of the finger. The Rome City School District has a new, high-tech payment system that reads students fingerprints instead of asking students to punch in codes or swipe their ID cards.
""The finger scan system is faster,"" Rome superintendent Gayland Cooper told
""This is the kind of thing that technology should help us with.""
Before the new system, students often lost their lunch cards or forgot their codes. In addition, the cafeteria lines moved slowly, often cutting into students mealtimes.
The new fingerprint scanner has sped things up. ""Our students have really enjoyed the new system,"" Narkissa Ware, principal of Anna K. Davie Elementary School, told
""When the lines move faster, the students have more time to enjoy their meal.""
Getting a students fingerprints into the new system takes 10 minutes. After that, the student can touch the scanner at the cashier counter. The students picture and account information then appear on the computer screen.
Although fingerprints are an easy way to pay for lunch, some parents arent happy with the new system. Some students dont use the fingerprint scanner because their parents dont like the idea that their childrens fingerprints are being scanned daily.
Cooper says that students still have the option of punching in their codes. He adds, however, that students fingerprint information is secure.

692,"Four hundred years after its founding, Jamestown is a historical hot spot.
Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on armor and talk to tour guides. This year, more than 2.4 million people from across the country are expected to attend Jamestown events.
Stepping into Jamestown Settlement museum in Virginia is like stepping into the past. And that's just what thousands of people are planning to do this spring. May marks the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America. Organizers are expecting nearly 90,000 visitors on the weekend of May 11 to 13, when many major events are planned.
Jamestown is a tourist destination for people who want a frontrow seat to American history. ""The whole idea is to give people an idea of Jamestown and the world in 1607,"" historian Tom Davidson told
Davidson helped put together exhibits at the Jamestown museum for the anniversary.
Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on English armor and watch experts demonstrate how to fire muskets. Tourists can also go aboard and explore
or models, of the three ships that brought the first settlers to present-day Virginia.
The story of Jamestown began on May 14, 1607, when about 100 English men and boys arrived in present-day Virginia. They came seeking gold and other treasures. The settlers, called
built a fort on the bank of a river and named their colony Jamestown, after King James I of England.
or businesspeople, of the Virginia Company to make money in North America. But the settlers faced many problems, including disease, starvation, and conflict with the area's Powhatan people (see ""
At first, settlers stayed close together for protection. ""There were hundreds of people living inside a wooden-walled fort,"" explains Davidson. Living in the fort helped the settlers defend themselves from attack, but it also made hunting for food or growing crops difficult.
Captain John Smith was one of Jamestown's original leaders. He took command of the colony in 1608. When the colony was in danger of running out of food, Smith gave an order: ""He who does not work, will not eat.""
spent five months crossing the Atlantic. The original Godspeed carried 39 passengers from England to Virginia, making two stops along the way. The new Godspeed traveled from Maine to Virginia, stopping along the way to let visitors see the ship.
By 1613, Jamestown had expanded into a successful colony. At about that time, the settlers began to grow tobacco. Tobacco was a
meaning that it could be sold in large amounts to England. In the following years, the settlers pushed the Powhatan off the land and built tobacco
or large farms. Later, the Jamestown colonists bought slaves from Africa to work on the plantations.
Over time, Jamestown grew to become the colony of Virginia. Virginia was one of the 13 colonies that joined in 1776 to rebel against England, starting the American Revolution (17751783).
Much is known about Jamestown, yet more details are being discovered. For more than a hundred years, experts thought the site of the original settlement had been destroyed by the James River. In 1994, archaeologists, or scientists who study the remains left behind by past cultures, discovered what may be Jamestown's original location.
""Visitors can see things being excavated that haven't seen the light of day in 400 years,"" Jamestown spokesperson Mike Litterst told
Scientists are currently looking for the foundation of the first church that the Jamestown settlers built. If found, it will be the oldest English church ever discovered in the United States.
The skeletons of two settlers have already been uncovered at the site. They are on display beneath a glass case, exactly as they were found. Historians believe that one of the skeletons is that of Captain Bartholomew Gosnoll, a member of Jamestown's original ruling council. Gosnoll and Jamestown Settlement will have a lot of visitors in the coming weeks for the 400th anniversary. ""It's the biggest event we've had since 1957, when the [Jamestown] museum first opened,"" says Litterst.
When the English colonists first settled in what is now Virginia, a powerful Native American group had lived on the land for hundreds of years. ""There were about 20,000 Powhatan people there when the English arrived in Jamestown,"" Virginia Indian culture expert Karenne Wood told
She hopes that the 400th anniversary of Jamestown will help shed light on the Powhatan's story.
When Jamestown began, the English and the Powhatan tried to trade with each other peacefully, but soon fighting broke out over land and resources. Beginning in 1614, the fighting stopped for eight years when Pocahontas, a daughter of the Powhatan chief, married Englishman John Rolfe. However, the fighting quickly resumed as Jamestown expanded.
Over time, the Powhatan people lost their land to the English settlers. However, Virginia is home to many Native American descendants today. ""We have changed a lot,"" says Wood, ""but we are still here.""
Organizers at Jamestown are not calling the 400th anniversary a celebration. Why might that be?

""Clearly, this is a place that was of enormous importance,"" says British researcher Julian Thomas, who helped discover the village. He noted that both Stonehenge and Durrington Walls have avenues connecting them to the nearby Avon River. Villagers may have frequently traveled between the two sites.
Eight of the wooden houses have been
or dug up. The structures are about 14 feet long. There was evidence of bed frames along the walls and a dresser or storage unit on the wall opposite the door.
Two of the houses found by Thomas were separate from the others. They may have been the homes of community leaders. Stone tools, animal bones, arrowheads, and other
(humanmade objects) were also uncovered in the village.

34,"Five California condors died last summer in Arizona's arid backcountry.
A condor's wingspan is 9.5 feet across. That's about as wide as two kids lying down head to toe.
Wildlife experts say the condors did not die from the heat. Instead, the experts believe the huge birds died from lead poisoning. They say the condors had swallowed lead shotgun pellets.
, which means they eat the remains of dead animals. The condors probably ate the remains of an animal that had been shot by a hunter. As they ate the dead animal's flesh, the birds ate the deadly pellets.
If swallowed, lead can make an animal sick or cause death. Lead stops the body from making red blood cells. It can also damage an animal's organs, including the brain and liver.
The five poisoned birds were among 35 condors that have been released in Arizona since 1996. The release program has cost millions of dollars.
After the dead condors were found, wildlife experts recaptured and tested the 16 birds left in the Arizona group. All the birds were healthy and were soon released.
Members of the Peregrine Fund have been releasing and watching the condors set free in Arizona. Jeff Cilek, of the Peregrine Fund, told
that saving California condors is important. ""Condors are good for the environment. They [eat] dead animals,"" Cilek said.
California condors are among the world's largest birds. A hundred years ago, the birds were found in many parts of the United States. Today, the condor is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's list of endangered species. That means the number of California condors is so low they all could disappear someday.
Why are scavengers an important part of the food chain?
Peregrine Fund officials say there are 150 California condors left on Earth. Forty-eight of those birds are living in the wild; the rest are in zoos.
Although the loss of five birds is a ""serious setback,"" Cilek said his group is looking to the future. Peregrine Fund officials recently announced plans to release 12 more California condors in Arizona this winter.

If you have had a cavity, you have probably felt the bite of a dentist's whirling drill as it cuts into your tooth. Soon, however, the dentist may no longer need a drill.
Tooth decay is a disease. So dentists at Harvard University decided to fight the disease that causes cavities. ""We decided to try to beat the disease, rather than just drill and fill [cavities],"" said dentist Daniel Smith.

The vaccine is a new way to prevent tooth decay. Brushing after meals and cutting back on sweets are two other weapons used to fight cavities.
, a chemical that strengthens teeth, also fights cavities. Fluoride is added to water and toothpaste. But many countries can't afford to put fluoride in water, and fluoride doesn't kill cavity-causing bacteria.
""[Tooth decay] is an epidemic worldwide,"" Smith said. ""Even if you have fluoride, you still have the bug [that causes tooth decay].""
So far, the scientists have tested the vaccine on rats. The rats that took the vaccine didn't get many cavities.
Now the scientists want people to try the vaccine. If it works, dentists may have a lot less drilling to do--other than drilling it into people's heads to remember to take the vaccine!

258,"The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle's grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles.
The disease attacks an infected bird's brain and spinal cord.
At first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird.
In recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year.
Although the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased.
By the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild.
Wildlife experts are especially concerned because they don't know much about the disease, including what causes it. ""We have some ideas, but we don't have any answers,"" John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said.
Experts also don't know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. ""This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn't noticed,"" Fischer said.
While wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Scientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America's bird--the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn't true in 1782.
Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol.
""I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country"", Franklin wrote. ""He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird"".

This copper brooch belonged to one of the Vikings.
, or dug up, after a metal detector user discovered two copper brooches in the ground. The worker informed archaeologists, who believe the site dates back to the 10th century. It is one of only a few Viking cemeteries found in England.
The Vikings were pirates and warriors, known for their sea faring voyages. From the late 700s to 1100, the Vikings lived in Scandinavia. That region of Europe includes the present-day countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
Viking sailors spread fear throughout Europe. They raided and conquered coastal villages in Europe and along the Mediterranean coast. During their raids, Vikings captured slaves. They also
, or stole, treasures, such as silver and gold.
For their voyages, Viking sailors crafted swift, narrow
that could navigate the stormiest seas. The Vikings were the master shipbuilders of their time. Vikings also worked as farmers and craftspeople. Others hunted and fished.
The Vikings' claim to fame may have been their fearsome raids, but they were explorers and traders too. They were among the earliest explorers to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to North America.
The Vikings traveled to other parts of Europe, the Mediterranean, Greenland, and North America.
One of the most famous Vikings was explorer Leif Eriksson. He reached North America almost 500 years before Columbus arrived in 1492.
Longships varied in size, but many were between 60 feet and 90 feet in length.
A larger ship could carry about 50 raiders at a time.
Strong winds allowed a longship, which had one large sail, to reach speeds of up to 17 miles an hour.
Vikings used multiple oars to row the ship when there was no wind.
The front end of a longship curved upward and was adorned with a wood carving of a snake's or a dragon's head.
Over time, the Viking raiders lost their power as people learned to defend against their attacks. Today, the remains of Viking villages can be found throughout Europe and North America.
Archaeologists plan to study the burial ground in England to learn more about the life of the Vikings. Based on the objects found, they believe the site was once a Viking settlement.
Vikings were known to bury valuable items with the dead. As one historian put it, the site will allow experts to ""uncover the secrets of a time capsule more than 1,000 years old.""

280,"The grizzly and cubs may soon be taken off the endangered species list in the Northwest.
Grizzly bears are considered one of the great symbols of the American wilderness. When explorers Lewis and Clark traveled west in the early 1800s, they found a healthy grizzly-bear population.
At the time, about 50,000 grizzly bears roamed the West. But as pioneers moved westward, the number of grizzly bears began to shrink. Illegal hunting, trapping, and habitat loss were to blame for the bears' disappearance. A

Today, there are only 800 to 1,000 grizzlies remaining in the lower 48 states, but there is hope for these creatures. About 550 of the grizzlies live in the Yellowstone National Park area in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. That is almost double the number that lived there in the 1980s.
Thanks to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the grizzly is making a comeback. Congress passed the act to protect animals that were in danger of becoming extinct.
Wildlife officials hope to remove grizzly bears in the Yellowstone National Park area from the endangered species list within the next year. Steven Williams, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told USA Today that the change is ""a tribute to the American people's commitment to wildlife [protection].""
Why is it important to protect endangered animals?
Scientists have worked to help bring grizzlies back from the brink of extinction. They set the animals free in their original habitats. They also plan to limit the number of roads in areas where grizzlies live. That action will give grizzlies more room to roam-and will help make life more bearable for them!

or types, of plants and animals than any other place in the world.
Since 1970, more than 232,000 square miles of the Amazon rain forest have been destroyed. That is nearly the size of Texas! The destruction has endangered many animal species. Experts predict that the continued

676,"Hours before giant waves pounded coastlines in South Asia, many animals started behaving strangely. In Sri Lanka, elephants trumpeted frantically and fled to higher ground. Bats and flamingos deserted low-lying areas. Many other animals escaped unharmed.
Wildlife experts are amazed that many animals survived the tsunami. The series of huge waves killed thousands of people in South Asia and East Africa about two months ago. Experts say animals might have sensed the approaching waves and moved to higher ground.
""I think animals can sense disaster. They know when things are happening in nature,"" said an official at the national wildlife department in Sri Lanka.
Elephants' sharp senses may have warned them about the tsunami.
Other stories of odd animal behavior before the tsunami have also surfaced. Giant waves flooded low-lying parts of Yala National Park in Sri Lanka, uprooting trees and killing hundreds of people. Wildlife officials reported, however, that few animals died. The park is home to hundreds of animals, including elephants, monkeys, leopards, tigers, deer, and water buffalo.
In Thailand, elephants carrying tourists from Japan bolted for the hills, and other elephants broke free of their chains. In one fishing village, nearly 1,000 locals escaped safely after birds squawked madly.
Although some animals in South Asia successfully fled to higher ground before the tsunami, other animals were not as lucky. Many dogs and other pets lost their owners in the tsunami and are homeless, sick, and without food or water. Cows, goats, and other farm animals are also roaming aimlessly. Many of those animals are drinking polluted water. Rescue groups have been sending animal food and
to the area. Veterinarians are doctors who care for animals.
Why might animals have known trouble was on the way? Forget special powers. Instead, experts say that animals have better senses of hearing, smell, and sight than humans do. Those sharp senses help warn animals when natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes, are about to happen.
""It doesn't surprise me that animals had an early warning of the tsunami,"" animal expert Michael Dee of the Los Angeles Zoo told
. ""The senses of certain species are far stronger than what any human has."" Dee points out that dogs, for example, have a stronger sense of smell than humans and that cats can see better in the dark than people.
Scientists say that animals might have felt the vibrations from the earthquake that set off the tsunami. In addition, many animals, including elephants, pigeons, and dogs, can also pick up
. That is a sound that is too low in pitch for humans to hear.
""Elephants can hear or feel other elephants grumble up to 2 miles away, so they probably felt the earthquake,"" said Dee. ""Their first
would be to move away from the direction of the sound."" An instinct is a natural, untaught behavior or reaction.
Before the tsunami struck, animals may have started to flee because they saw other creatures running. ""Animals take their cues from other animals,"" said Dee.
How animals sense danger has fascinated people for centuries. Most scientists are quick to point out, however, that nothing has ever been proven.
Will animal instincts be used to create a warning system about natural disasters anytime soon? ""I wouldn't count on [it],"" said Dee.
In the meantime, animals are helping out in other ways. For example, elephants are assisting in the cleanup of areas hit by the tsunami.
Scientists say that elephants can pick up vibrations from earthquakes through their broad feet.
Elephants' toenails are in the skin and not attached to the toes.
Elephants' soles have sensitive foot pads that detect vibrations, such as those from an earthquake. That signals elephants to move to more stable ground.
In what other ways might animals' sharp senses be helpful?

694,"Should handheld video games be banned from recess?
Many kids think playing handheld video games is a great way to spend their break time at school, but not all parents and school officials agree. Florence Rideout Elementary School in Wilton, New Hampshire, recently banned handheld electronic games, such as the PlayStation Portable and the Nintendo Dual Screen, at recess. Other schools across the country have taken the same action. Should portable video games be allowed on the playground?
Some school officials and parents argue that portable video games defeat the purpose of recessexercise. Lisa Lewis, a parent at Florence Rideout, told the school board that students should be encouraged to ""go out and play"" and not huddle around an electronic game.
In addition, portable video-game systems can stir up trouble. When students bring their gaming gear to school, fights sometimes start or the device gets stolen. Educators hope that keeping video games at home will help keep the peace at school. School officials at Florence Rideout added the video game ban to school rules to satisfy some parents' concerns.
Don't toss out video games from recess, say others. A recent report from the NPD Group shows that video games are becoming more
or established, in kids' daily lives. NPD reports that 41 percent of students between the ages of 4 and 14 own portable video game systems. ""Today's kids are digital [citizens] whose activities are different [from those of] previous generations,"" says Anita Frazier of NPD.
Some people argue that electronic devices are a part of modern life, the same way jacks and marbles once were. Would schools ban those games just because they don't require exercise, they ask?

550,"A filmmaker finds out that elephant families can be comfortable with visitors.
""I started thinking of them as a family almost immediately,"" filmmaker Martyn Colbeck told
He was talking about wild elephants, not his next-door neighbors. For more than 15 years, Colbeck has filmed a family of African elephants in Amboseli National Reserve in eastern Africa.
airs April 1 on the PBS television show
The new film comes after recent studies found that elephants can recognize their reflection in a mirror. That is something only humans, chimpanzees, and dolphins were thought to be able to do. ""These animals are smart,"" Colbeck says. His documentary shows just how intelligent African elephantsthe world's largest land animalsare.
Colbeck's film follows an elephant family led by a 62-year-old female elephant named Echo. In the wild, African elephants live in herds. They roam long distances to find food. The oldest female elephant, called the
leads the herd. Adult male elephants live separately from the females and the young calves.
Echo guides her family to fresh water and food while staying alert for danger. The young elephants are the most
or at risk of being harmed. Colbeck witnessed that danger when he saw another elephant family attempt to kidnap Echo's calf Ebony. Echo gathered the other adult female elephants in her family to come to the rescue. ""Together they plowed into the kidnappers to recover Ebony,"" Colbeck explained. ""It showed forethought and teamwork.""
During his years of filmmaking, Colbeck observed other signs of elephant intelligence. Elephants communicate with each other through low rumbling sounds that people often cannot hear. Family members also make distinct sounds that other members can recognize.
or customs. After an elephant dies, the other family members cover the body with sticks and leaves and linger near the site for days. The animals often return to the site years later.
Amboseli National Reserve covers about 150 square miles in southern Kenya, near the Tanzania border. The Kenyan government protects the nature reserve's elephants from
or illegal hunting. Elephants have been hunted throughout history for the ivory in their tusks. Humans have used ivory to make jewelry and other objects. Today, elephants are an endangered species.
Since strict anti-poaching laws were put into effect in 1968, the number of elephants in Amboseli has risen from 500 to more than 1,200. When Colbeck began filming Echo's family in 1990, the family had only 14 members. Today it has 30 members.
Although the elephants still face some danger from the local Masai tribespeople, the creatures have become remarkably comfortable around human visitors. That makes Amboseli an ideal place for scientists to study elephant behavior.
""The elephants are totally relaxed about having vehicles in amongst the herd,"" says Colbeck. ""Nevertheless, it is still very important to respect the animals and not disturb them.  That respect develops into a trust, and in that way we have been able to document some extraordinary moments in their lives."" That trust has not only allowed Colbeck to film Echo's family, but it has also made him feel like one of the family.
The elephant families in Amboseli National Reserve are organized alphabetically. Echo's family is the ""E"" family, so every member of the family is given a name starting with
Here's how Echo fits in with some of her relatives.
(age 62): Echo is one of the oldest elephants in Amboseli. She is the leader of her family. You can tell that she is old by the length of her tusks. They are almost touching! Wild African elephants live an average of 60 years.
(died at age 34): She was Echo's eldest daughter. Erin died from a spear injury after she wandered too close to a watering hole protected by the local Masai people.
(age 22): As a young calf, Eliot would to run up and rest her head on researchers' vehicles. Now that she has grown up, Eliot keeps her distance from people.
(age 17): When he was born, Ely couldn't walk. The family waited to move until he stood on his own. Now he lives alone. He left the herd at age 12.
(age 25): Edwina is Echo's first known grandchild.
(age 22): Eleanor helped care for Email after Erin died.
(age 6): Email's mother, Erin, died when he was 2. Now the rest of the family takes care of him.
(age 12): Europa is Echo's first known great-grandchild.
(age 8): Elaine is Echo's second great-granddaughter.
(age 8): Elmo is Echo's only surviving great-grandson.
Why might African elephants need to communicate with each other?

The fourth grader swam the 1.4 miles between Alcatraz Island and San Francisco in just less than two hours. He swam to raise money for Hurricane Katrina victims.
Although Johnny trained for three months, the water was colder and wavier than he had expected. Johnny made it to the shore by telling himself, ""Im almost there. Im almost there.""
His classmates were waiting on shore, cheering ""Go, Johnny! Go, Johnny!"" When he came out of the chilly water, his father hugged him and said, ""Can you believe it? You did it!""
Johnny successfully made the trek that Alcatraz prisoners had dared to cross years ago. Alcatraz Island housed a prison from 1934 to 1963. In 1962, three prisoners escaped by swimming across the bay. They were never heard from again, so it remains a mystery whether they made it through the frigid waters to land.
Johnny didnt only raise more than $30,000 for his swim. He also reportedly became the youngest person to swim the distance from Alcatraz to San Francisco.

Venice attracts millions of tourists each year for its beautiful art and architecture. People weave their way through the city on boats because there are no streets. A maze of long

Venice is located in northern Italy on the Adriatic Sea. The city was built on a series of small islands in a
or an area of shallow water. During some high tides, water floods the city. For hundreds of years, people have tried to keep water out of the city to save it from sinking. Now a group of scientists has introduced a bold plan to keep the city afloat. And it means adding more water!
Venice is sinking at a rate of 1.57 inches per year, according to scientists. The Italian government has proposed the building of floodgates to control the flow of the sea.
Scientists hope to turn the tide in favor of Venice. They want to pump huge amounts of water into the ground through sturdy pipes. Scientists expect the water will expand the sand underneath and prop up the city. They hope to test the project on a small area over the next few months.
In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads.
Scientists behind the plan say that the pipes will work along with the floodgates to help save the city. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnt carried out in a careful way.
Everyone, however, agrees that saving the sinking city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose tremendous part of [history],"" Melissa Conn of Save Venice, an organization dedicated to helping preserve the city, told reporters.
Venice in Italian means ""city of canals.""
About 1.6 million people live in Venice.
The most famous building in Venice is the Basilica of St. Mark, a church dedicated to the patron saint of the city.

Most kids who play football get minor bruises and scrapes. Some injure their knees and even break bones. Others get head concussions. But a 10-year-old girl died on September 2. Doctors said a football injury probably caused the fatality.
Taylor Davison, who lived in Illinois, liked to play football. She was the only girl who played in a football league of 400 players.
Taylor played full-contact football. During a practice in August, she complained of a headache and fell down. Three days later, she died. Doctors said she died as a result of a severe blow to the head, possibly caused by a tackle.
Doctors do not know how many child athletes are injured on the playing field each year. ""There is a serious lack of data about what types of injuries are occurring, said Dr. Reginald Washington, a doctor of sports medicine.
Although not enough is known about sports-related injuries among children, Washington and other doctors say kids and coaches can follow certain safety tips. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh give this advice:
Coaches should receive first-aid training. They should also be trained to recognize whether a child athlete has a severe head injury.
Leagues should have rules that require kids to take time off from playing after they have suffered an injury-especially a head injury.
To make sure they are safe, kids should always wear the proper safety equipment when playing any sport.

Should kids be reading for pizza? A nationwide reading program is drawing criticism for putting pizza front and center. Since 1985, the restaurant chain Pizza Hut has been running the Book It program, which rewards students for reading with personal pan pizzas. Now some people are taking a slice at Book It. They say the program promotes poor eating habits and gives Pizza Hut free advertising in public schools.
""It's clear that Pizza Hut's Book It has no place in public schools. ... It promotes junk food,"" says Susan Linn, a cofounder of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. The group has called for schools to stop participating in the Book It program.

566,"This map might not lead to a pot of gold, but officials at the Library of Congress consider it very valuable. The Library of Congress recently paid $10 million for the first map to name America. Printed in 1507, the map is the only copy of its kind left in the world.
Officials said the map is the most expensive item that the library has ever purchased. The library raised most of the money from Congress and other groups.
America was named after Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian explorer. The map showing America was kept in a castle in Germany for 350 years and was rediscovered in 1901.
For the last century, U.S. officials have been trying to buy the map. It has been called the ""crown jewel"" of the library's map collection.

A team of Japanese scientists snapped the first photographs of one of the deep sea's most mysterious creaturesa giant squid. It was the first time a giant squid was photographed in the wild! The researchers took more than 500 pictures of the sea creature off the coast of the Bonin Islands in Japan.
How did scientists nab pictures of the 26-foot-long sea monster? They tracked down the squid by following the only creatures that feed on itsperm whales. Once they determined where the whales dined, the scientists attached a robotic camera to a fishing line with bait. Then they took pictures of the purplish-red squid attacking its prey nearly 3,000 feet beneath the ocean's surface. The squid became caught on the camera but eventually swam away after one of its tentacles broke off. Squid have eight arms, two tentacles, and two huge eyes that can each grow to the size of a volleyball!

413,"Assur was once one of the greatest cities in the world. About 30,000 people lived there. A huge temple tower, or ziggurat, stood about 200 feet above the city streets. Assur (or Ashur) was one of the leading cities of Assyria, the center of a great empire.
Today, ancient Assur is in ruins. Desert sand has covered over much of the 3,500-year-old city. Now Assur faces a new threat: water.
Assur is located in what is now Iraq, a country in the Middle East. Many parts of Iraq are covered by desert. Water is hard to find in the desert areas. To increase the amount of water, Iraqi officials are building a dam on the river Tigris.
The dam will trap the river's water. As the water rises, it might flood Assur and many other nearby ancient ruins.
Scientists worry that floodwaters will destroy artifacts hidden beneath the desert sand. Assur has already been the site of some amazing discoveries.
Scientists recently discovered four hidden tombs at Assur. They found ancient coffins, gold, jewelry, and gems. They also dug up the remains of two ancient Assurian queens.
Scientists used modern medical equipment to study the queens' bodies. They learned about some of the medical problems the ancient queens suffered from. The bodies showed evidence of dental cavities, sinus infections, and poor nutrition.
Michael Mller-Karpe, a scientist who studies ancient Assyria, said, ""The Assyrian queens have just begun to speak to us, and we are looking forward to more answers.""
Mller-Karpe and other scientists worry that the new dam may keep them from getting more answers. Even if the new dam doesn't flood Assur, the rising water could damage the ancient city. Moisture could cause the artifacts to crumble.
""You can't save Assur if it's [near] a dam,"" said scientist Peter Miglus. The soil beneath the ancient city would soak up water like a sponge. The water in the soil would destroy what's left of ancient Assur.
For now, scientists are scrambling to uncover the secrets hidden for centuries in Assur and other nearby communities. Meanwhile, some people are looking for ways to save the ancient cities. ""We don't want the slightest damage to Assur,"" one Iraqi official said.

A year may be only 365 days, but a lot can happen in such a short time. Below are just a few of the many important events that took place this past year.
It was a tough summer for many people in the western United States. Wildfires burned about 7 million acres of land--six times the size of the Grand Canyon National Park. The fires forced thousands of people to leave their homes. Many people returned home and found charred rubble.
Recovery is already under way in most burned areas. In Utah, officials from one park are using a helicopter to spread grass seeds over wide areas.

More than 97 million people voted for president of the United States on Tuesday, November 7. Most political experts had predicted that the race would be close, but no one knew that it would be as close as it turned out to be.
On the day after the election, Vice President Al Gore had slightly more votes than Texas Governor George W. Bush had. But the vote in Florida was so close that the state had to recount all 6 million votes cast in that state. The race was so close that no one knew who had actually won the election long after the polls closed.

About 40 years ago, the number of bald eagles in the United States was declining rapidly. Today, however, the bald eagle is returning to the skies. Wildlife officials hope to remove the bird from the list of threatened species by the end of the year.
In the early 1700s, bald eagles were a common sight. There were about half a million of those birds living in the United States.
Over time, their population fell dramatically. In the early 1960s, very few bald eagles remained.
What caused the number to drop? Hunting and the use of harmful chemicals sprayed on crops were largely to blame. Those chemicals poisoned the birds and their eggs.
Pollution also contributed to the problem. Bald eagles often became sick after eating fish from polluted waters.

Although some threats still exist, the future looks hopeful for bald eagles. Today, there are about 20,000 bald eagles living in the United States. Thanks to laws that helped protect bald eagles and banned harmful chemicals, the birds are making a comeback.
, or protection, efforts have helped their survival. ""There is no doubt that it is the single best conservation story the United States has had,"" bald eagle expert Bryan Watts told
In 1782, the bald eagle was made the national bird of the United States. The nation's founders chose the bird because it symbolized freedom, strength, and courage. At the time, some people disagreed about the choice for the national bird. Benjamin Franklin, for example, thought the turkey would make a better choice because it was ""a much more respectable bird.""

What were your thoughts? Were you scared?
: I was really scared. The first time I tried the Heimlich, I didn't do it that hard. I was afraid of hurting Kelsey. The second time, I squeezed a little harder.

109,"Last month in New Jersey, two soccer teams were locked in a tied game. The game finally ended in a dramatic finish.
The game did not end with a tie-breaking shoot-out, however. It ended because of a fight between parents and coaches.
The fight started because one coach wanted the other coach to move from behind the goal during a shoot-out kick. Soon the coaches were yelling at each other. Then parents ran onto the field, and some of the adults threw punches.
No one was hurt and no kids were involved in the fight. But many towns across the United States are wondering what can be done to stop these kinds of ugly scenes from happening.
Many of the fights at kids' sporting events start because of decisions made by referees. ""There are going to be bad calls, and refs have been called names. But that's part of the game,"" Barry Mano told
. Mano is the president of the National Association of Sports Officials.
In kids' sporting events today, bad calls can result in a lot worse than name-calling, Mano said. ""We are seeing between 50 and 100 attacks a year on referees.""
that fighting at kids' sporting events is a national problem. ""We need to have long-term education"" to teach people how to behave at sporting events and solve the problem, Mano said.
Mano said that parents must keep in mind that they are important role models for kids. He also said the quality of referees at kids' sporting events needs to be improved.
""Sports are a great place for kids to learn. We just have to make sure that kids can have fun while playing,"" said Fred Engh. Engh is president of the National Alliance for Youth Sports. The group promotes good sporting behavior among kids, parents, and coaches involved with youth sports.

322,"Scientists are going ape over orangutans (o-RANG-oo-tanz). They are working to help save these endangered tree dwellers before they disappear from the wild.
In recent years, the red-haired apes have found themselves out on a limb. Wildlife experts warn that they may die out, or become
, within the next 20 years. Scientists estimate that only 30,000 orangutans are left in the wild.
Today, orangutans can be found only in tropical rain forests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, in Southeast Asia. They are
creatures, which means they eat, sleep, and travel mainly in trees.
To search for food, orangutans swing from branch to branch. They like to dine on leaves, flowers, bark, and sometimes insects.
""Orangutans spend most of their time in the trees and won't cross open grounds, so the only way they can [move]... is through the trees,"" said one wildlife expert. ""We need to maintain these forest [areas] so that orangutan populations of the future have the opportunity to continue to survive.""
What is causing the numbers of orangutans to decrease at an alarming rate? The main reason is the destruction of their rain forest
Humans pose the greatest threat to orangutans for a number of reasons, say experts. People cut down trees for lumber. This illegal logging is destroying much of the animals' homes. Many countries, including the United States, buy the lumber. It is often used in shelves, picture frames, and floors.
Forest fires and farming are also to blame. As forests are cleared to make way for plantations, orangu-tans lose parts of their habitat.
In addition, orangutans have fallen victim to the recent boom in the illegal pet trade. People steal baby orangutans from the forest to sell them as pets.
To help bring these animals back from the brink of extinction, wildlife groups are working to protect orangutans and stop illegal logging. The government in the area is also involved in the effort to help orangutans. Police go into national parks to prevent illegal loggers from cutting down trees.
""Help is needed to save these amazing creatures,"" orangutan expert Cheryl Knott told
. ""If we can save the rain forest for orangutans, we can save it for other animals as well.""
The average life span for orangutans is about 50 years. Experts hope that orangutans born today will still be swinging through the trees at that age.
The orangutan got its name--which means ""person of the forest""--for a reason. Orangutans are remarkably intelligent. In the wild, scientists have spotted these clever creatures using sticks as tools to open fruit. Orangutans have been observed using large leaves as umbrellas to shelter themselves from heavy rains. Sometimes, the apes even use leaves as cups, from which they drink water.

Kais story portrays the voyage of more than 175,000 Chinese immigrants to Angel Island from 1910 to 1940.
In December, President George W. Bush signed the Angel Island Immigration Station Restoration and Preservation Act. The law provides up to $15 million to set up a museum and research center on the island to help tell stories like Kais. The money will also be used to protect hundreds of poems carved in the wooden walls of the station that describe the difficult journey.
People from China didnt always have difficulty entering the United States. The earliest Chinese immigrants arrived during the California gold rush in the 1840s and 1850s. They nicknamed the United States
or ""Gold Mountain,"" because many of them hoped to strike it rich.
But as the number of Chinese immigrants grew, Americans became less welcoming. In 1882, the U.S. government passed the Chinese Exclusion Act. The law made it almost impossible for Chinese workers to enter the United States.
or forcibly held, at Angel Island while immigration officials decided whether the newcomers should be allowed to enter the United States. The process was very different from that of Ellis Islandthe New York port of entry for European immigrants.
On Ellis Island, more than 95 percent of travelers were processed quickly and allowed into the United States. On Angel Island, many Chinese immigrants were held for weeks, months, and sometimes even years. After being cruelly questioned by officials, more than 30 percent of immigrants were sent back to China.
Angel Islands doors closed in 1940 when China and the United States became
or partners, during World War II (1939-1945). The islands main immigration station was scheduled to be destroyed in the 1970s until a park ranger found poetry carved in its walls. The poems described the frustration and sadness that many people felt during their stay at Angel Island. (See ""

""We hope that Angel Island becomes a bookend to Ellis Island.""
More than 200 poems are on the walls of Angel Island. The following two poems were recently translated:
Its been a long time since I left my home village
Who could know Id end up imprisoned
Im heartsick when I see my reflection,
  my handkerchief is soaked in tears
I ask you, what crime did I commit
  I give vent to despair
  on a mountainits hard to earn glory
  I watch for my early release

605,"Soaring high above California's coastline stand the magnificent redwood trees. Redwoods are the world's tallest known trees and are also some of the oldest. Some scientists are concerned about a disease that is threatening the ancient giants. It is called sudden oak death.
The disease has scientists alarmed. First identified in 1995, sudden oak death has spread along hundreds of miles of California's coastline and jumped into southern Oregon. In addition to attacking oak trees, it has spread to redwoods, Douglas firs, and other types of trees and shrubs. One of the worst outbreaks of the disease has occurred at California's Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park.
Scientists recently discovered the organism responsible for the disease. It is a fungus that causes oozing red blobs to grow on diseased oak trees. On younger redwoods, it dries up leaves and kills sprouts. According to scientists, redwoods are hosts for the disease. A host is an organism on or in which another organism lives.
The disease first showed up in rhododendron plants in the Netherlands in 1993. Scientists are concerned because the spread of the disease could pose a threat to the redwoods' ecosystem, an environment where plants and animals coexist. Scientist David Rizzo said that anytime you have a strange organism, there is cause for concern.
Coastal redwoods can grow upwards of 360 feet. Some are taller than the Statue of Liberty, which stands about 300 feet.
The diameter of redwoods can measure about 20 feet.
Named California's state tree, the redwood can live more than 2,000 years.
In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Muir Woods a national monument dedicated to protecting and preserving the mighty redwoods.
In 1904, a fungus from Asia began killing chestnut trees in New York. Over the next 50 years, the disease killed about 3.5 billion trees and almost wiped out an entire species. Scientists want to prevent this from happening in California or elsewhere in the United States.
Studies show this disease spreads rapidly during the wet months of spring. The coming months could be vital in tracking the disease. Current weather forecasts predict that this spring will be rainier than the last two springs. ""We have to get familiar with the symptoms and the treatments,"" said another scientist, ""because we don't know how much farther it will spread.""

360,"If you listen to music, you are probably like millions of other kids--you turn up the volume when you hear your favorite song. Listening to loud music may be fun, but a government study shows it may also be dangerous.
According to the study, which was paid for by the U.S. government, more than 5 million kids, ages 6 to 19, have suffered some hearing loss. That's more than one out of every ten kids. Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss.
Amanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. ""It was assumed in the past that children wouldn't have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage,"" Niskar said.
Niskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a ""problem for children,"" she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems.
Hearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems.
For example, hearing loss ""can influence [a] child's ability to learn in the classroom,"" Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions.
Niskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead.
Listen Up! This diagram shows the parts of your ear. Loud noises can damage the cochlea and cause hearing loss.

that Mount Vernon couldn't have prospered without slave labor. ""Slaves did most of the work,"" she said.
When Washington was born, many Americans owned slaves. Those people used slaves to plant crops and perform many other duties. Most people thought slavery was OK. When Washington was 11 years old, his father died and left him ten slaves.
During the American Revolution, which began in 1775, some people began to think that slavery was wrong and should be ended. Washington was one of those people. He vowed never to buy another slave.
In his will, Washington wrote that all his slaves should be freed. ""Upon the [death] of my wife,"" he wrote, ""it is my...desire that all the slaves which I hold in my own right shall receive their freedom.""
To make sure Washington's wishes were carried out, Martha freed his slaves in 1801, a year before she died. Martha, however, kept the slaves she owned when she freed her husband's slaves.
Even though Washington freed the slaves he owned, slavery remained legal in some states for another 64 years, until 1865. Slavery did not end in the United States until after the Civil War ended it.

, a huge sheet of moving ice.
""I never got used to these 4- or 5-foot crevasses that are hundreds of feet deep,"" said Weihenmayer. ""You had to jump across them. You have to be very careful when you land.""
For most climbers, jumping over a crevasse is hard enough. But for Weihenmayer, jumping over the cracks was particularly hard because he is blind.
Last spring, Erik Weihenmayer became the first blind climber to reach the peak of Mount Everest. He was part of a team of climbers that was sponsored by the National Federation of the Blind.
Mount Everest is 29,035 feet tall and sits on the border between Nepal and China, two countries in Asia. According to many climbers, Mount Everest is one of the hardest and deadliest mountains in the world to climb because of the mountain's height.
""There are a lot of things that can happen up there. You're not ever really sure that you're going to make it,"" Weihenmayer told
. Climbers can suffer from illnesses caused by many things, including the altitude.
sickness occurs when a climber does not get enough oxygen.
The team took more than two months to complete the climb. Weihenmayer spent much of his time moving the team's supplies up the mountain to a base camp, which was located at 17,600 feet. The time spent moving gear helped Erik Weihenmayer get used to the altitude. ""You're letting your body get used to the elevation, the air, the temperature,"" Weihenmayer said.
Weihenmayer, who had already climbed several of the world's highest peaks, had help getting up Mount Everest. ""[People] would walk ahead of me with a bell,"" he said. ""I tried to stay in their footsteps. I tried to stay [close] behind them so I could hear their steps, and I stepped into those places.""
For Weihenmayer, climbing Mount Everest was the toughest but most rewarding experience of his life. When he got to the top, Weihenmayer stopped to think about what he had done.
""I thought about the ground underneath me. I felt these cool flags [at the peak] that were up there in the breeze,"" Weihenmayer said. ""I thought about my family, friends, and about where I was.""

41,"Recently, historians found an old well in Jamestown, Virginia.
Historians believe that colonists from England dug the well nearly 400 years ago. Shortly after the well was completed, it dried up. The colonists then used the well as a dump.
The historians have found a piece of old armor in the well. Studying the armor and other ""garbage"" from the well will help us learn about life in early Jamestown.
The history of Jamestown begins in England. On December 20, 1606, three ships sailed from England. The ships were bound for Virginia. After the colonists on the ships landed in Virginia, they built a fort. The colonists arrived in North America 14 years before the Pilgrims.
Most of the colonists came to Virginia to search for treasure. Most did not know how to grow crops to feed themselves. They became so hungry that they ate dogs, rats, and snakes.
Eventually, more people settled in Jamestown. They turned the fort into a town. The colonists began to grow and sell crops. The small fort became the first permanent English settlement in North America.
The ""garbage"" from the well is helping historians better understand how the colonists lived.
""When one stands at Jamestown today, it is hard to imagine how much hope, regret, fear, hatred, hunger, pain, and death were experienced at this place,"" historian Ivor Noel Hume wrote of the fort's earliest colonists.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.

Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.
For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.
By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.
You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:
Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:
In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:
To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:
Divide both sides by 2, to give:
a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7
b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7
When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers.
For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7.
7 + 5 does equal 12, so your answer is correct.

To boil water we must increase its temperature to 100C. It takes longer to boil a large beaker of water than a small beaker because the large beaker contains more water and needs more thermal energy to reach 100C.

Solids cannot flow because their particles are only able to vibrate and cannot move from place to place.
Liquids can flow because their particles can move over each other. When water is poured into a glass, the particles of water move over each other and into the corners of the glass. The particles keep on moving over each other as the water takes the shape of the glass. The animation shows how this works.

b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.
There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.

So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on.
a) The subject I am going to write about today is why the local park should not be closed.
b) Have you ever stopped to wonder how many hundreds of people make regular use of our Memorial Park?
a) It is unlikely that newspaper readers who enjoy all the things that our park has to offer will want it to disappear forever under tons of concrete.
b) 'Ashfield Park will be ruined,' claim protestors who held a meeting last night to organise opposition to the council's plans for a car park.
It should be clear that the ""b"" versions are better - they fit the style and show that the writer has used TAP to make their writing work. Remember - you need to make it interesting right from the start.

The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain.
Q2. Which of these words are not English?
A1. They are all written in English!
A2. All of them are familiar English words, but originally they were borrowed from Indian languages.
English is a language that is constantly changing and evolving. If it didn't, we'd still be speaking like Shakespeare!
- each generation provides words known as 'slang' - often many of these words become accepted into mainstream English eg 'ok' and 'cool'. However, many slang terms lose popularity as a new generation emerges with their own slang words and phrases - making words such as 'phat' and 'groovy' history.
- the multi-cultural society we live in often provides new or adapted words. You might be familiar with the term 'avatar' in online communities but did you know the word is actually Hindi in origin? Has anyone ever said 'gesundheit' after you've sneezed? This is actually a German word, which has become popular in English.
- these are words or phrases that you only hear in a particular geographical area eg do you eat your sausage in a roll, bap or bun? Depending on where you live, it could be any of these. If you're Cornish, you might hear someone from Birmingham or Scotland using different words and grammar to you, even though you're all still speaking English.

The Tempest first key extract - Performance
When you talk about the performance of a play, you should think about how people in the audience feel as they watch it. For instance, the beginning of the first extract is magical and romantic. The tone changes in the middle to one of conflict.
Prospero has lots of asides (thoughts spoken aloud) in the first extract. His role in this scene is made more complex because his character is pretending to be something he is not. The director has to decide whether he wants us to see Prospero as a good father who wants the best for his daughter or a manipulative control freak.
Prospero also speaks to Ariel who is invisible to the other characters on the stage.
When Ariel appears, the director must decide how to present the 'illusion'. Ariel is invisible to the other characters. But it does not necessarily follow that he must be invisible to the audience, too. Try to imagine as many interesting and unusual ways to present Ariel - the 'invisible' sprite - as you can.
When you write about performance, you need to mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:
The characters and how you respond to them
The language used - the detail about freedom and slavery, for example
The issues and ideas - like love, magic and power
The performance instructions, such as stage directions

421,"Questioning is an important skill that shows your teacher that you are listening carefully. There are two main types of questions.
These are the type of questions where there is only a yes or no answer or only one possible answer: eg Are you male or female?
These questions let the person answering share their thoughts and ideas more fully: eg What do you think of the new English teacher?
You can show that you are listening carefully to the answer of a closed or open question, by asking another question:
""What exactly do you mean by that?""
Or by checking that you've understood correctly by repeating back to that person what you thought they meant:
""So, you're saying that you think that violence is never the right answer?""

Do you mean he doesn't talk as much as Romeo?
Yes. (Long pause) It's not just that. He's down to earth.
Whereas Romeo is away with the fairies?
(Laughs) Not exactly. A bit, I s'pose. I just meant that I like Benvolio because he's the only one that just tries to get by without getting into trouble.

The Tempest second key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Second Key Extract takes place outside Prospero's cave. Ferdinand is carrying logs. He thinks to himself that he doesn't mind the hard work because he is doing it for Miranda,
Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble.
even if her father is cruel and grumpy.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
Miranda comes to see him. Neither of them realise that Prospero is watching them from a distance.
On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance?
Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
but he says he has too much to do, so she offers to carry some logs for him.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
He says he would rather break his back than see her work. Miranda insists again that she should help him.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Looking on, Prospero sees how much Miranda is in love with Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Ferdinand asks Miranda her name and when she tells him, she remembers that in doing so, she has broken her promise to her father.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand admits that he has liked lots of different women in the past
Ferdinand uses the word 'bondage' to describe his reaction to listening to beautiful women talk. It links back to the issue of Freedom and Slavery in the play. Ferdinand means that he has been like a slave to beautiful women in the past.
, but they have always disappointed him with some fault or other in the end.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
However, Miranda, he says, is perfect. Miranda, on the other hand, hasn't met any men except for her father, or any women, except for herself. Even so, she says that she can't imagine liking anyone more than she likes Ferdinand.
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand tells her that he is a prince, possibly a king (although he hopes his father isn't dead). He wouldn't usually put up with having to carry logs like a slave
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
but he knew as soon as he saw Miranda that he'd do anything for her. When Miranda asks him if he loves her, Ferdinand says he loves, prizes and honours her more than anything else in the world. This makes Miranda so happy that she cries. As Prospero watches them together, he is moved.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Ferdinand asks Miranda why she is crying. She says she thinks she isn't good enough for him
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!
but realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else. Ferdinand happily agrees to marry her. They say goodbye and part.
Prospero is happy for them, but he claims that their engagement is no surprise to him as it was all part of his plan. He goes to get his magic book because he has lots of work to do before supper time.

Explore, imagine and entertain - Ending short-stories
The other problem some writers have is ending the story. It doesn't matter if it's a happy ending or not, but it has to make sense. There are lots of ways of ending, such as:
, where we have to wait until the final moment until we know. For instance, the spy who manages to stop the bomb two seconds before it explodes.
, where we are fairly sure about something, but in the final part everything changes. For example, we then learn that this is a fake bomb, and the real one is hidden somewhere else and will explode in five minutes.
, where the story stops, but we aren't sure what has actually happened at the end. For instance, the bomb is defused and everyone is safe. But then an army commander reports the theft of another bomb... only this time twice as powerful.
However, there are two endings to avoid:
, where a bomb will inevitably explode and as it does, the narrator wakes up - it was all a dream. Some English teachers don't mind this sort of thing, but others hate it. You have been warned.
, where the secret agent suddenly stops worrying about the bomb, retires, and goes off to play golf. This is even worse, and no-one likes it because the ending has nothing to do with the story.
Whatever kind of story you write, decide on your ending and include it in your plan.
Writing that explores, imagines or entertains depends on being creative. You need to experiment a little and not be frightened to try something new.

Stanley noticed a burlap sack filled with sunflower seeds on the floor next to the desk. ""I quit smoking last month,"" said the man in the cowboy hat. He had a tattoo of a rattlesnake on his arm, and as he signed his name, the snake's rattle seemed to wiggle. ""I used to smoke a pack a day. Now I eat a sack of these every week.""

The key thing about writing to inform is that you stick to the information. You shouldn't really show many of your own feelings, and you definitely don't want to tell your audience how they should feel. Instead, when you inform you make the facts easy to understand, with a clear structure.

This is a timeline - the arrow is time moving forwards and the four lines are different events in order. Now, you can think of the school day as the arrow, and plan the different events in a typical day. For instance, you could have registration, then an assembly, then two lessons followed by break. It should be easy to add information and detail. The structure also makes it easy for the Year 6 pupils to follow your information. Another way to inform is by subject, as in the diagram below:
These are points linked together. It is not in order of time, but in order of subject. So you could have PE at the centre with all the information connected to PE in the little circles around. For instance, you could have different types of PE kit, the different sports, the sort of exercises you do. Once you have written about PE, you can move on to look at other areas of the school.

Find two features of Stanley's character and explain how they are suggested. Write your answer down and then compare it to ours.
Stanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for a while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed animals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it. Sometimes he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games. Maybe he'd make some friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake.

He is willing to make the best of a bad situation.
The writer suggests that Stanley spent long periods, when younger, playing alone with stuffed toys.
Stanley thinks that he will have the chance to make friends and 'at least he'd get to swim in the lake'.
The writer lists the sort of games Stanley played with his stuffed toys at 'Camp Fun and Games' in a way that suggests he was playing on his own - the toys became his friends.
He is going to a boy's prison work camp, but, instead of thinking about the horrors he might face, he shows that he is hopeful and ready to make the best of things.

368,"A debate is an organised argument. You might think you've never taken part in a debate before but you probably have without realising it! When you discuss topics in class or at home, and put forward different points of view - this is debating. Debating allows you to discuss your ideas and find out what other people think about a particular topic.
If you're asked to take part in an organised debate at school, this is likely to be a more formal discussion and follow a set of rules.
Here are some simple rules for formal debates:
First of all, you need two teams: the proposition team and the opposition team.
Then you need something to argue about. This is called a motion.
The proposition team starts. Their first speaker has to tell everyone what the motion is all about.
The opposition team goes next. Then the teams take it in turns until everyone has had their say.
The last speaker on each team has to sum up their team's main argument.
Your team will need to do plenty of preparation - writing out the main points of your argument. During the debate, your team is allowed to pass notes to each other so that you can add or change things as you go along. The most convincing team wins the debate. Try to guess in advance what your opposing team might argue to avoid being caught out.
Use these tips to make your arguments as convincing as you can:
Use facts - it's hard to argue against a fact so use as much evidence and as many statistics as possible.
Use opinion too - debating is all about getting your opinion across and persuading others to agree with you, so use a good balance of fact and opinion.
Listen to the other team and comment on what they have said. You then have a chance to convince the audience of the other side of the argument.
Structure your argument - as if you were writing an essay, you need a clear introduction, a middle and a conclusion.
Arguing isn't about shouting the loudest - present your arguments in a clear controlled voice. Don't lose your temper or get too emotional about the arguments.
Improve your public speaking and maybe you'll be TV Presenter one day. But it's not all bad!

Explore, imagine and entertain - Original words
A sunny beach gives you all sorts of possibilities to use your senses. For instance:
The shouts of excited children mingled with the screams of seagulls and the soft roar of breakers on the sandy beach
. I looked down the beach towards the blue sea criss-crossed by the white triangles of sails
. The hot sun burned down onto my back and neck
, and the air was heavy with the smells of suntan oil, sea salt and ice cream
. I could taste the vinegary tang of chips even before I found the busy fish and chip shop
You don't want to overdo the senses, but they are a useful way of making your writing more interesting. Another way of doing this is to look for more original words and phrases to write something that is fresh, not stale.
Avoid clichs. These are phrases that are used so much that they have lost their power. For instance, if you are ""over the moon"" about something, or ""waiting until the cows come home"", then you are using clichs. Look for original phrases instead.

2)The wind gradually got stronger and they could see the leaves on the top branches swirling rhythmically, rising and falling.

1. This is an extract from the Anthony Shea Community School newsletter:
During the past three years, mobile phones have become more and more popular. Growing numbers of our students bring them to school, and parents encourage this as they can stay in touch with their children and know they are safe. However, many of our students keep their phone on during the day which can disturb lessons. A number of phone thefts have also occurred recently, both in and out of school. I would like to call a meeting to discuss this issue with staff, parents and students. I don't want to ban them, but we must agree on how they can be used sensibly and safely.
Write a speech to be given at this meeting analysing the advantages and disadvantages of allowing mobiles in school and suggest how they can be used sensibly and safely.
2. Read this extract, which considers the issue of horror movies:
As a parent, I have constant battles over TV and films. My children feel they should be allowed to watch whatever they want, no matter how violent, gory or creepy. They say it's just entertainment, and that it has no effect on them. I don't agree! Many of the films are rated 18, and my oldest is 14. I'm afraid my kids will become more aggressive and uncaring towards people, or that they might end up seeing something which really disturbs them.
Write an article for your school magazine commenting on why horror movies are popular with teenagers and explaining the advantages and disadvantages of parents banning them at home.

Writer's tricks - The effect on the reader
You will now be very familiar with the idea that every text is intended to affect its readers in some way.
Every reader is, of course, different too, and sometimes a text will affect you in ways a writer didn't imagine, or you might notice depth in it that others won't. This is particularly true if the text matches your personal experience. A story about your home town might interest you more than one about somewhere else, or a text about smoking might affect you more if you know somebody who is trying to give it up.
Remember, you get marks for noticing the intended effect on the reader. Even if something doesn't interest, horrify, amuse or persuade you, you need to spot what the writer meant to do. It's usually better not to mention your personal opinion unless you are asked to.

The environment is also changed when land is flooded to make reservoirs for drinking water or hydroelectric power schemes. The animals and plants that live in the forest or on the land lose their habitat. They may die out in that region as a result.
Humans have been cutting down trees for thousands of years. We do this to clear land for farming and building, and for wood to use as a fuel or building material.

Formal and informal writing - Informal writing
Writing is informal when it reads as though someone is chatting to the reader. In the right situation, it makes your writing seem more friendly and natural.
Which of the following would you NOT write using informal language?
b) An essay about a Shakespeare play
c) A talk aimed at students your own age or younger
e) A story written from the point of view of a character (in the first person)
b) An essay should always be written using formal language. All of the other situations would suit a more informal style.
Tips to make your informal writing more effective
""Dear reader, I'm really glad you've found the time to open this letter.""
2. It's okay sometimes to use the kind of words that are more usual in speech than writing:
""You don't have to put up with bullying. We'll stick together and make it stop.""
3. Contractions sound more natural in certain types of writing eg a talk to fellow students:
""It's good to know that we're all going to work together on this.""
Don't baffle your reader with too much slang.
Think carefully about structure - informal writing is different to speech and needs carefully planned paragraphs to keep it clear and easy to read.
Sometimes there is opportunity to break the rules of Standard English and use English in unexpected ways. Two good examples of writers who achieve this are poet Benjamin Zephaniah and writer Andrea Levy in her book Small Island.
If you're asked to write a story, it would be a mistake for you as the author to use incorrect grammar and slang - but inside speech marks, your characters can!

171,"> Explore, imagine and entertain - Short-stories
A short-story is easy to write if you:
Have only one or two main characters. It's a short story and you don't have time for any more.
Use people's words and actions as much as possible. Don't try to give lots of background information - let the reader use their own imagination. Remember - creative writing means creative reading too!
Make your characters and plot realistic. How do people really speak and act? Remember, most writers base some of their characters on people they actually know, so who can you use to improve your story? Would your granny make a good secret agent or your uncle a confident contract killer?
Get straight to the point. Don't worry about long openings or lots of detail. Instead, launch right in, hopefully in the middle of some action, like in the example below.
Steve held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - he was too shocked to speak. One moment he had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next he was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
You will also have to decide whether to write in the first person (using ""I""), or in the third person (typically, using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they""). Using ""I"" makes it easier to write about thoughts and feelings, but using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they"" lets you move from person to person, or from place to place. You can choose whichever you feel happiest with. For instance, we can swap the opening of the story into the first person, like this:
I held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - I was too shocked to speak. One moment I had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next I was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
The only thing you shouldn't do is swap the person - dont start with ""I"" and then switch to ""he"", or you'll spoil the story.

447,"The extract comes from a book called 'Face' by Benjamin Zephaniah. Natalie is a Year 9 student and lives in East London. She is out with her boyfriend and his friends. They have stopped to chat with some boys from school. Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. You can use the bullet points to help you.
After a couple of minutes she realised that her every move was being watched by a group of three girls and she couldn't help noticing how tough they looked. All three were wearing dark blue baggy jeans. She was pretty sure they were Londoners born and bred but thought they could find a job working for the Jamaican tourist board, not simply because of their dark skin but also because of their clothing. One had a T-shirt saying 'I love Jamaica'. Another wore a T-shirt that was a Jamaican flag and the third just had a West Ham football shirt on, but she, like the others, was adorned with yellow, black and green bangles, badges and necklaces. Natalie thought they looked good, but dangerous.
Natalie shifted nervously. She didn't know quite where to look but she had to put on a front. The other three girls made no attempt to hide the fact that they were on Natalie's case. They began to whisper to each other and smile as they stared at her. Natalie felt illuminated in her green satins and began to wish she had chosen clothes which weren't so loud. What are they grinning at? she wondered. Is it my clothes? My shoes? My hair? Do I look too innocent? Suddenly the three girls began to walk toward Natalie. Her heart began to race, the palms of her hands began to sweat. She felt like falling apart but she held herself together.
'You from round here, den?' said the big girl wearing the Jamaican flag.
'Yeah, I wanid to go there but they wouldn't let me, said I had ta go ta Lonsdale Park, said it was nearer. What ya doing here?'
The other two girls continued to look her up and down. Natalie expected trouble and in her mind she cursed the boys for bringing her there and for the way they had got lost in their silly conversation about football and cars.
'I'm just hanging around with my boyfriend and his mates.'
At this point the girl wearing the West Ham shirt reached into her back pocket. Natalie swallowed hard as the girl pulled out a couple of leaflets. After separating one from the other she handed one to Natalie. 'Dat's the place to be, check it out, good vibes, good music. Ya like rap?'
Natalie wanted to kick herself. She had completely misread the situation. They weren't out for a fight, they wanted to find out if she liked clubbing. They wanted to find out if she was one of them, an Eastender.
'Yeah,' Natalie replied, feeling a sense of relief. 'Yeah, rap's cool...' She began to wonder if she sometimes looked threatening and if she herself had been misjudged in the past. For people to be friendly, did they have to have permanent smiles on their faces?
How does the writer show Natalie's thoughts and feelings changing during the extract?
her first reactions to the girls she sees
the way she acts just before, and when, they speak to her
her thoughts at the end of the passage.
Just before the girls speak to her, Natalie seems even more anxious. She is used to being out on the streets of London and feels she needs to 'put on a front' and look tough. She is afraid they may be laughing at her clothes or hair, which makes her seem insecure about herself. However, when the girls come up to speak to her she hides her nerves and answers their questions. The way she uses short answers like 'Yeah' suggests she does not want to give too much away about herself or get into a fight.
When she realises the girls are actually being friendly and want to give her a flyer for a club, Natalie's feelings change completely. She is ashamed of being suspicious and feels like 'kicking herself'. She realises the girls are Eastenders just like her. The writer shows how this makes her think about her own image. She wonders if people think she looks threatening, too. At this point she comes across as an intelligent, thoughtful girl who wants to learn how to judge people fairly in the future.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The party
Romeo and his friends decide to gate-crash the party. Romeo has a bad feeling about the outcome of this evening, but decides to let fate take its course.
Capulet is having a great time at his party. People are dancing. Romeo and his friends arrive wearing masks. Romeo spots Juliet. He thinks to himself that he didn't really know what true beauty was until he saw her. He doesn't know that she is a Capulet. Tybalt recognises Romeo from his voice and threatens to kill him because he is a Montague, but Capulet stops him. Romeo and Juliet flirt and finally kiss. The Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet and he is dismayed. He leaves with Benvolio. Juliet is distraught when the Nurse tells her who Romeo is.
The Chorus recaps events for us: Romeo has forgotten Rosaline and is now in love with Juliet. Juliet feels the same way.
Romeo runs away from his friends. Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline.
Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom. Juliet doesn't know that he is there at first and, talking to herself, declares her love for him. She is shocked and embarrassed when he replies. They have only met that evening, but they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and what time their wedding will be! They find it difficult to part.
Romeo goes to see Friar Lawrence, the priest, who is worried that he has spent the night with Rosaline. When Romeo says that he wants to marry Juliet, Friar Lawrence tells him off for falling in love so easily, but agrees to the wedding because he thinks that it might be a solution to the rift between the Capulets and the Montagues.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The end
Meanwhile, in Mantua, Romeo waits for news. A servant called Balthasar arrives and tells Romeo that he has heard that Juliet has died. Romeo decides to buy some poison. He plans to go to see Juliet's body where he will take the poison and die next to her.
Meanwhile, Friar John explains to Friar Lawrence that the letter he wanted him to take to Romeo explaining the truth about Juliet didn't get delivered. Friar Lawrence decides to go to the tomb and wait for Juliet to wake up while he sends another letter to Romeo.
That same evening, Paris goes to Juliet's tomb with some flowers. He hears a noise and decides to investigate.
Romeo pays Balthasar off and breaks into the Capulet tomb. Paris tries to stop him. Romeo begs him to leave him alone, but Paris thinks he is vandalising the tomb. They fight. Romeo kills Paris. Just before Paris dies he asks Romeo to place him next to Juliet's body. Romeo is sad that he had to kill Paris and takes him into the tomb to be near Juliet.
When Romeo sees Juliet lying in the tomb, he can't believe that she is dead because she looks so beautiful. He hugs her and kisses her. He takes the poison then kisses her again and dies.
Friar Lawrence finds the bodies of Paris and Romeo just as Juliet is about to wake up. Juliet wakes up and asks the Friar where Romeo is. He hears a noise and begs Juliet to come away with him, but when she finds out that Romeo is dead, she refuses to go with him. Friar Lawrence runs away.
Juliet tries to kiss the poison off Romeo's lips. His lips are still warm, but there is not enough poison left on them to kill her. She takes his dagger and stabs herself.
Some watchmen discover the bodies outside the tomb. They also find the Friar who is crying and shaking. Prince Escalus and Juliet's mother and father arrive with Romeo's father. Friar Lawrence tells them all the truth about the wedding and their children's deaths. He feels so guilty that he asks the Prince to punish him, but Prince Escalus won't because the Friar is a holy man. Prince Escalus blames Montague and Capulet, but he also blames himself for not doing enough to stop the violence. Capulet and Montague decide to end their rift. Montague offers to have a statue of Juliet made. The play ends as the Prince says that this is the saddest story ever told.

28,"Utterson represents the standards of conventional society and the law. Like Lanyon, he does not have the imagination to understand what Jekyll is doing.
That is why Jekyll cannot confide in him about what is happening, even though they are old friends. It is also why, throughout the novel, Stevenson makes Utterson come to all the wrong conclusions. The law blinds him to the truth. It is because Utterson is a lawyer that he constantly suspects Hyde is blackmailing Jekyll or has some other criminal purpose.
The ultimate failure of Utterson (and therefore the law) is built into the

However, tragedy strikes when his mother dies of fever just before he leaves to study at the University of Ingolstadt. His father insists he should still go, and while at university Victor's earlier interest in science becomes an obsession - in particular, he wants to discover the secret of life itself.

5139,"Most tasks allow you to write or talk about how language is used in the play. So imagine your title is: 'How does Beatrice change during the course of
?' There are all sorts of references you can make to language:
When we first meet Beatrice, she seems to be a clever, independent woman. She speaks openly, not waiting to be asked, and seems to like making fun of Benedick in particular. She compares him with ""a disease"", and her repartee makes even the messenger afraid of her. Throughout the play she uses puns, such as saying Claudio is ""civil as an orange"". This shows her witty nature, because she plays on the similarity between ""civil"" and ""Seville"": he is either polite or bitter (just like the oranges from Seville).
This combines much of what we have covered so far. It starts to answer the question without filling up the page with irrelevant facts, plot details and fancy technical terms. Remember, you do not have to tick off the language terms like a trainspotter. Instead, show you appreciate some of the techniques Shakespeare used, and the effects they have on his audience.

5428,"You need to go to the exam with strategies that will help you work well under pressure. Here are some suggestions:
You are usually given 5 minutes to read through the paper before the tape starts. Use this to your advantage by looking right through the paper so see what kind of tasks there are.
Look closely! Should you listen for precise information (like train arrival and departure times)? Or should you be listening to the whole passage, in order to draw a conclusion (for example, name the girl who has the best relationship with her parents)?
As you read the question, try to predict the sort of information that may be in the passage. It will help focus your mind.
Look at the title of the question or section very carefully. Make sure you understand
to give your answer. If there is an example, look closely at the answer given - it will show you whether you need to write a single letter, a single word, or more than one word.
Have a good look at any illustrations. They could give important clues as to what is coming.
word - there is probably a lot of 'redundant' language you don't need. Be positive. Concentrate on what you do understand. Sometimes the passage can be difficult, but the questions are easy.
Use your knowledge of grammar. For example, it may be important to know whether someone is talking about the past, the present, or the future.
Use your knowledge of Spanish-speaking countries. For example, if you hear someone was on holiday in Madrid, it is unlikely they spent time on the beach.
Don't just listen to the words. The tone of someone's voice may also be helpful - for example in telling you if they are making a statement or asking a question.
If you have to write answers in Spanish, remember you will not be penalised for minor spelling mistakes.
Don't just read it, practise your Spanish with downloadable audio bites.

Restricting the number of cars and visitors  although this would have an impact on income from tourism.
Fundraising to repair damage done to the natural environment and footpaths  but who should pay?
Education of local people and tourists about sustainable tourism  but who will pay for this?
Underpinning any sustainable strategy is the successful involvement of the local people. With their cooperation, positive outcomes are far more likely.

In your presentation exam you should speak for about one minute in Irish on a topic you have prepared, then you will be asked questions in Irish about what you have said. You are usually allowed to take a prompt card into the exam with you with five brief points on it and as many pictures as you like, to help you remember what to say.
A good way to structure your presentation so you include a variety of tenses plus an opinion is to start with

For his presentation Samus has written five paragraphs about Peter Canavan, but the order of the paragraphs has been jumbled up. Can you work out which paragraph is the introduction, which is about Peter Canavan's past, present and future, and which is the concluding opinion?

You could summarise the presentation under the following five headings:
- sport and especially Gaelic football; favourite player (Peter Canavan); description (age, appearance, home, marital status, children, etc.).
- All-Ireland Final last year against Armagh; Tyrone won and Peter was captain; how he played and what he scored; Sam Maguire and celebrations.
- very fit and he loves Gaelic football; Errigal Ciaran and Tyrone; very good footballer - skillful and dedicated; training every day.
- P.E. teacher in a secondary school in Co. Tyrone; may not be teaching this year because of work with football; he may not play for Tyrone next year because he may be too old.
- excellent footballer; I was so happy when he lifted Sam Maguire; Come on Tyrone!
In the exam the prompt card can usually have five bullet points of what you want to say. These bullet points can be in Irish. You can prepare the card well in advance of the exam so make sure you check vocabulary, gender and pronunciation thoroughly. If in doubt ask your teacher.
This is how Samus's prompt card might look in Irish:
- sprt agus peil Ghaelach, Peadar  Ceannabhin (33, beag, tana, lidir, psta, trir clainne).
- Cluiche ceannais anuraidh in adan Ard Mhacha; Bhain Tr Eoghain; captaen; d'imir s go maith; cpla pointe; Sam Maguire, cisir mhr.

- peileadir den scoth; an-ssta, Sam Maguire; Tr Eoghain ab!
This is a very good presentation. Samus has included lots of information about his chosen famous person and has used the past, present and future tenses effectively. He has introduced his topic well with detailed background information and has used structures and vocabulary already known to him from his description of himself. He has also chosen a topic which he is genuinely interested in, therefore making it easier for himself to adopt an enthusiastic approach to the subject. He has concluded by offering a range of opinions, all of which he has explained and for which he has given reasons. His presentation has a clear start, middle and end and offers the listener a well-structured presentation on his chosen topic.

In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!
After your presentation you will have to answer questions on it. Think about the kinds of questions you could be asked on this topic and prepare answers to them.
You are usually allowed to take a card in with you with five reminders of what you want to say. These should not be in complete sentences but might contain, for example, headings for each part of your talk or unusual words which you need.
Remember to learn the vocabulary you need to describe other people (especially famous people, sports stars and musicians), including how to talk about special features and aspects of their lives and careers. Make sure you can explain why you chose this topic and why you are interested in it.

6135,"What to look for in your comparison
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint.
Both express love. Shakespeare writes to his mistress, Hopkins writes about a much-loved landscape.
Shakespeare mocks the common cliches that poets use about their mistresses - lips redder than coral, breasts whiter than snow, etc - to emphasise the reality of his love. Hopkins also wants to get away from the cliched use of language - by inventing words, like rollrock and twindles, to pinpoint his meaning.
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint, and both express danger as well as beauty.
However, in Clarke's poem man has caused the destruction already (cutting hay kills the field mouse; war is taking place in Bosnia) - Hopkins' poem is a plea to stop man from causing destruction.
Images or things (usually physical, like a flag) that stand for or represent something else - usually abstractions, like a nation. A crucifix is a symbol of Christianity.
to convey their message. The central image for Clarke is the field mouse, which represents all the innocent, vulnerable people in the world who are killed or injured. Inversnaid represents all areas of wet and wilderness in the world that mankind could jeopardise.
Both poems describe watery river scenes, but while Perch is purely a vivid word-picture, Inversnaid contains more of an explicit 'message'.
The language in Perch has many similarities with the Hopkins poem: combination words and word-plays (alder-dapple, finland of perch) dialect and obsolete words (grunt, slub, runty, adoze) and lots of sound devices. The unorthodox grammar of on hold / In the everything flows and steady go of the world (where the last 8 words make up a giant compound noun) is very like Hopkins.
While the Hopkins poem is full of movement, and ranges over the landscape, the Heaney poem stays very still and focused on the almost motionless fish, adoze in the current.
How does the rhythm and rhyme scheme of Perch compare with that of Inversnaid?
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint, describing an experience which is for the poet is intensely present.
Both poets use an extended image to put their point across. The canary-yellow cotton jacket is the central image in Homecoming. A row over the jacket caused the family row; the reconciliation is likened to putting the jacket back on. For Hopkins, the darksome burn represents all areas of wilderness in the world that could be vulnerable to man.

Anne Hathaway's love of Shakespeare is confident and will last forever - I hold him in the casket of my widow's head - while Hopkins' is more tentative - he fears for the future and asks What would the world be? without the wilderness his poem evokes.

""You're not here any longer so how can I speak to you?""
A woman who is deeply upset lies in her daughter's darkened bedroom. She clutches a pair of new white trainers that were a present for her daughter.
In the first sentence, we discover that the narrator is telling the story to another character - the daughter - but the daughter is not there to hear it. This style of writing is sometimes called a

, because there is only one character speaking or thinking.
Her 15-year-old daughter has run away from home. The woman worries that her daughter may have to beg for food to survive, or that she has been forced to become a prostitute.
We are told there was an argument between the father and daughter. Bad language was used on both sides.
The doctor has signed the narrator off work; she is taking medication. The mother aims to pretend to the outside world that everything is okay, but fears her daughter may be dead, or at least living on the streets.
We learn more about the argument. The daughter is brought home drunk at 3am. The father calls her a 'dirty slut'.

Although the USA did not entered the First World War until April 1917, the conflict cast a shadow over American society that would take a while to pass. There was a brief economic recession at the start of the 1920s, but, as the decade moved on, the economy boomed and America began the age of

5869,"Jane is excited about returning to Thornfield and Mr Rochester, even though she believes he is married to Blanche Ingram. It is obvious when they meet that Rochester is delighted to see her, too.
What follows is ""a fortnight of dubious calm"", in which Jane expects to hear about the marriage but nothing is said.
On midsummer eve, Jane goes into the garden after Adele has gone to bed. She finds Mr Rochester there. The scene is described in extraordinary detail, as it moves to his proposal.
He is perhaps teasing or testing Jane as he talks of her having to move on, claiming to have found her a new position in Ireland. Eventually, however, he proposes, revealing that any chance of a relationship with Blanche ended when he pretended to have less money than she considered acceptable.
Rochester talks frequently of what he is doing as being wrong, but claims his love and care for Jane will atone for it. As readers, we think there could be something sinister behind this. However, Jane does not pick up on more than his emotion as they go into the house.
Jane is blissfully happy, but still aware that Mrs Fairfax seems shocked. So she asks Mr Rochester to speak to her the following day. Her congratulations, when they come, seem very subdued, fuelling our suspicions.
Jane decides she will not abandon her previous path. She refuses expensive gifts and spends a lot of time with Adele. Mr Rochester is eager to be with her, but allows her to dictate terms in this way in the four weeks leading up to the wedding.
Then we hear of a very bizarre episode. Mr Rochester has had to go away. When he returns, Jane describes having been woken by someone in her room. She describes the woman in hideous terms, and explains that her wedding veil was ripped in two, so it could not have been a dream. Mr Rochester encourages her to continue to blame Grace, and insists she shares Adele's room the night before the wedding.
The wedding morning arrives. Mr Rochester is possessed by tension and a desire that everything should be done quickly. Even Jane is encouraged to hurry.
There are no family present at the wedding. Perhaps for this reason, Jane notices two men, apparently waiting for the ceremony, enter the church before them.
When the priest asks if there is any impediment to the marriage, one of the men, Mr Briggs - a lawyer - explains that Rochester is already married to the sister of Mr Mason, who comes forward at this point.
Clearly, there can be no marriage. Mr Rochester takes them back to Thornfield to see his wife, Bertha, a dangerous lunatic, and Grace, her keeper. Bertha attacks Mr Rochester, but he is able to restrain her. Even though

is a serious crime, it becomes easy to understand what drove him.
Before Briggs and Mason depart, we learn that it was a chance connection between Jane's uncle in Madeira and Mr Mason that brought Briggs and Mason to stop the marriage. We also learn that Jane's uncle is on his death-bed.
Jane spends a long time numb with shock at what has happened. She eventually meets with Mr Rochester and he tries everything in his power to keep her with him. He explains how he was trapped by his family into the marriage, and how he spent time in Europe seeking, in vain, some kind of escape.
He asks Jane to come away with him, but she is controlled by conscience and cannot allow herself to be loved by a married man. She knows she cannot stay with him and keep her resolution, so says she will leave.

The first attempt in Britain to improve roads started in 1663. This was when the Turnpike Trust was set up. The trusts had one simple aim:
to charge people to use newly improved roads
and then the money raised from the tolls was used to pay for the upkeep of the roads.

As you can see from the illustration, the road engineers built

It may damage the well-being of humans and other species - for example, it can pollute drinking-water supplies or poison plants and animals.
It may interfere with natural processes - for example, it could change local climatic conditions or destroy wildlife habitats.

Number recordings are not always exact, and in some cases they may be rounded up.
When a number has been recorded to a certain accuracy - for instance, the nearest 1cm or the closest 10 - you can work out its highest and lowest possible values according to the limits of accuracy provided.
These outcomes are often referred to as an upper or lower bound.
The number of people on a bus is given as 50, correct to the nearest 10. What is the lowest and highest possible number of people on the bus?
The number 50 is correct to the nearest 10.
Looking at the number line, we can see that
is the smallest possible number closest to 50 when rounding up, and
is the largest possible number closest to 50 when rounding down.
So the lower bound is 45, and the upper bound is 54. Therefore, the number of people on the bus can be any number between 45 and 54.
The number of sweets in a jar is given as 70, correct to the nearest 5. What is the smallest and largest possible number of sweets?

Remember that the lower bound rounds up, and the upper bound rounds down.
You may find it easier to draw a number line to see how the lower and upper bounds can be found.
Can you see that 68 and 72 are the lowest and highest numbers inside the gren lines.
Mary's height is given as 162cm, correct to the nearest cm. Between which limits does Mary's height lie?
161.5 is the smallest number which rounds up to 162. 162.5 is the smallest number which rounds up to 163. Therefore, Mary's height must be below 162.5cm. (But remember that it could be 162.4999999999999... cm)
The lower limit is 161.5cm. The upper limit is 162.5cm.
This method can also be applied to problems.
The dimensions of a piece of carpet are given as 127cm x 68cm. Both lengths are correct to the nearest cm. Between what limits does the area of the carpet lie?
We can find the lower and upper limits of both the width and height. The lower limits of width and height will multiply to give the lower limit of the area. And the upper limits will give the upper limit of the area.
The smallest possible area is calculated by multiplying the smallest possible length and width together. The smallest possible area is

is that of things breaking down. This is shown in a number of ways. Violence replaces peace, friends turn into enemies, life ends in savage death. Everything degenerates.
The boys are on the island because the plane that was evacuating them from Britain during a fictional nuclear war was attacked. Piggy reminds Ralph:
""Didn't you hear what the pilot said? About the atom bomb? They're all dead.""
Ralph is proud of his father - a commander in the Navy. So, the
A person portrayed by an actor in a play; an individual in a narrative or non-fiction text; a real or imaginary individual's personality or reputation
who tries hardest to keep peace comes from a home that revolved around war.
We know that the civilisation from which they were trying to escape is being destroyed. When Roger stops himself throwing stones at the littluns, we're told:
""Roger's arm was conditioned by a civilisation that knew nothing of him and was in ruins.""
The dead parachutist who lands on the island was gunned down during an overhead battle.
Ironically, the naval officer who comes to their rescue is himself involved in the war. The boys may have been saved from life on the island, but what sort of life are they going back to?
Violence is always present. It starts as a game, but grows more horrific throughout the novel. For example:
When he first finds out Piggy's name,
""Ralph danced out into the hot air of the beach and then returned as a fighter-plane, with wings swept back, and machine-gunned Piggy.""
When the first pig is killed, Jack boasts,
""Kill the pig. Cut her throat. Bash her in.""
The boys become like wild and savage animals: when Jack hunts a pig he is
; Ralph becomes like a hunted animal, not a boy, at the end:
""He raised his spear, snarled a little, and waited.""
The murder of Simon is particularly horrific because it involves
the other boys - they get caught up in the frenzied chant:
""The crowd ... leapt onto the beast, screamed, struck, bit, tore.""
All the friendships and good relationships on the island break down, either through bullying and violence or death.
Ralph and Jack seem to be friends at the start, yet Ralph knows Jack is hurt when he is not elected chief. This rivalry for power is at the root of some of the violence.
Ralph finds it hard even at an early stage to get things done. He and Simon are left to build the third shelter by themselves, because everyone else is too busy having fun. The community spirit of the assemblies is hard to maintain.
Even the littluns' games involve violence and broken friendships. Once Roger watches them playing:
""Percival had gone off, crying, and Johnny was left in triumphant possession of the castles.""
As pressure builds, the boys find that they have to take sides. When Jack defies Ralph and goes off alone, he challenges,
""Anyone who wants to hunt when I do can come too.""
He ignores Ralph's effort to make peace.
Jack's tribe becomes ruled by fear. Most boys don't want to be involved, but have no option. He keeps control by intimidating them and bullying them, such as when he ties up and beats Wilfred.
Roger rules by terror too. When Samneric are captured,
""Roger advanced upon them as one wielding a nameless authority.""
The island is first seen as like paradise, too good to be true. Ralph thinks:
""Here at last was the imagined but never fully realised place leaping into real life""
However, the island is soon found to contain many dangers. For example, coconuts fall from the trees and just miss injuring Roger, the sun burns them, and the isolation is a curse.
Ralph reflects at the end that the island once had a
All this echoes the Bible story of the Fall of Man, when Adam and Eve were cast out of Paradise as a punishment for disobeying God. The island becomes a burnt wasteland, as if as a punishment for all the violence committed by the boys.

of how far the violence has come. The pig was killed by Jack and his hunters and the head is put on a stick as an offering to the 'beast'. Only Simon really appreciates that the 'beast' is actually the evil inside the boys themselves and it is that which is breaking things up.
So, the title of the novel reinforces the idea that we all have something of the 'devil' within us - and that the 'devil' can be released all too easily.

Roman ideas about disease were muddled. For example:
Crinas of Massilia thought illness was caused by the stars (astrology).
Varro blamed creatures too tiny to be seen.
Columella blamed poisonous vapours in the swamps.
All these ideas survived until the 19th century.
Galen based most of his information about anatomy on what he saw when he dissected the bodies of animals. This led him to make mistakes. Some of his errors were:
He thought that muscles attach to the bone in the same way in humans and in dogs.
He thought that blood was created in the liver. He realised that it flowed round the body, but said it was burned up as fuel for the muscles.
He thought he saw holes through the septum, which allowed the blood to flow from one side of the heart to the other.
He made mistakes about the blood vessels in the brain.
He thought the human jaw-bone was made up of two bones, like a dog's.
He was mistaken about the shape of the human liver.

Diabetes  risk and benefit (Ideas about science)
Weighing up the consequences - higher only
Everyone has to make choices about whether to accept the risks associated with some activities. We accept risk every day. Crossing a busy street involves a risk of being knocked over by a car. We accept this risk because we know that this event is very unlikely to happen. But we also know that if it did happen the result could be very serious.
To decide whether we should accept a risk, we need to consider:
what is the chance of the event occurring
what are the consequences to us if the event does occur
With reference to diabetes, each person must make a decision about the diet they eat based on:
the chance of their getting diabetes if they eat poorly or are obese
the consequences of having diabetes in terms of its effect on their lives

Teacher's notes: This question is worth 6 marks in the exam. Give yourself 7 - 8 minutes to answer it.
Mark Scheme: In History you are marked by levels. The higher the level the more marks you get and so the higher grade you will achieve.
The answer will provide few reasons for the emergence of NICRA with no real explanations offered.
The answer will provide more reasons with some explanations offered.
The answer will provide a number of reasons with detailed explanations.
NICRA was set up because of events in the USA where Martin Luther King Jr. was leading a similar campaign in America in the 1960s. At the same time discrimination in Northern Ireland was still continuing. NICRA campaigned for ""One Man, One Vote"".
John would get a level 1 for this answer. The candidate only touches on the influence of the USA and events in Northern Ireland. The candidate does not develop the two points to answer the question fully and directly.
NICRA emerged due to a number of events and influences. A major factor in its emergence was the impact of the 1947 Education Act. This made Catholics more confident in the 1960s to demand civil rights. A further influence was the establishment of the Campaign for Social Justice in 1964. This organisation highlighted the forms of discrimination that existed in Northern Ireland by the mid 1960s. This helped bring about the establishment of NICRA in 1967.
A final factor to explain the emergence of NICRA was Labour's victory in the 1964 General Election.
Paul would get a level 2 for this answer. The candidate makes two valid points in the first paragraph. However other important factors are omitted and he does not explain the last point in the second paragraph.
The emergence of NICRA can be explained by a number of events, both within Northern Ireland and outside of Northern Ireland. The 1947 Education Act helped to create a larger professional and educated Catholic class in Northern Ireland. It was more assertive and confident in demanding civil rights for all by the mid 1960s.
Also within Northern Ireland there was the Campaign for Social Justice that was set up in 1964. This organisation acted as a forerunner for the emergence of NICRA in 1967.
Furthermore within Northern Ireland by the mid 1960s, members of a number of political parties, as well as labour and republican groups were working to establish a civil rights movement. They felt that O'Neill's government had done little to address grievances in voting, housing, policing and employment.
Outside of Northern Ireland there were other influences. The 1960s witnessed the emergence of a civil rights movement in the USA. It was having some success and this inspired a similar movement in Northern Ireland.
Also in 1964 a Labour government was elected in Britain. Labour was seen as being more sympathetic to the nationalist cause. This may have raised the expectations of Catholics into believing that a protest group campaigning for civil rights might succeed. A year later over 100 MPs in Britain formed the Campaign for Democracy in Ulster. This further raised the expectations of Catholics and influenced the establishment of NICRA.
Michael would get a level 3 for this answer. This response is very direct and extremely comprehensive. The candidate is aware of all the important factors that account for the emergence of NICRA.

3342,"Food additives are included in food to improve their shelf-life, appearance and flavour. Antioxidants such as ascorbic acid prevent food from going off by reacting with oxygen. Emulsifiers help oil and water to mix - for example, in mayonnaise. Active packaging meanwhile improves the quality or safety of food.
Everything in food is made from chemicals. Some of these are natural, and some are artificial. Processed foods, including vegetable oils, may have chemicals added to them. These
have different roles, including extending a products shelf-life and improving its taste and appearance.
You can find additives listed on the ingredients label. Many have E numbers to identify them. The table below describes some of these:
orange colouring for soft drinks, sweets and sauces
allows oil and water to mix to make margarine, ice-cream and salad cream
Additives with an E number have been licensed by the European Union. Some are natural, some artificial. But they have all been safety tested and passed for use.
The UK Food Standards Agency - FSA - has strict limits on the amount of colouring allowed in food. Some people have allergic reactions to certain additives, and colourings are banned from baby food.
A red dye called 'Sudan I' was banned for use in food because it was thought to be a health risk. Some of the dye had been used in chilli powder before the ban came into force, and the dye was later added in this form to some foods by mistake. Hundreds of food items had to be taken off supermarket shelves and destroyed.
Immiscible liquids do not mix together. For example, if you add oil to water, the oil floats on the surface of the water. And if you shake the two together then leave them to stand, tiny droplets of oil float upwards. They join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again. To stop the two liquids separating, we need a substance called an emulsifier.
Emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends:
a hydrophilic end - 'water-loving' - that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils; and
a hydrophobic end - 'water-hating' - that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water.
Lecithin is an emulsifier commonly used in foods. It is obtained from oil seeds and is a mixture of different substances. A molecular model of one of these substances is seen in the diagram.
The hydrophilic 'head' dissolves in the water and the hydrophobic 'tail' dissolves in the oil. In this way, the water and oil droplets become unable to separate out. The mixture formed is called an emulsion.
Mayonnaise and emulsion paints are emulsions, but there are others - such as the two in the table.
bacteria and fungi grow on or in the food
chemical reactions take place in the food, such as fats reacting with oxygen to make rancid products
Modern packaging is designed to control or prevent reactions in food that make it go off. Such packaging includes:
cans that will cool down or heat up their contents
Ascorbic acid - vitamin C - is an antioxidant that is found naturally in foods such as citrus fruits, green peppers, green, leafy vegetables, such as cabbage, and potatoes. As E300, it may be added to food such as meat pies and salad cream.
Bacteria and fungi are living organisms. They need water and oxygen (as well as the food itself) to grow and reproduce. If one or both of these is taken away, the microbes are unable to survive and the food will last longer.
Active packaging improves the quality or safety of the food it contains.
Oxygen can be restricted by packaging the food in plastic, or sealing it in an air-tight container. However, the food itself contains some oxygen, and microbes can still survive in it. The air in modern packaging is often replaced by gases such as nitrogen. This restricts the amount of oxygen available so that microbes cannot grow and reproduce.
There are other benefits to this method:
fats in the food cannot react with oxygen to produce substances with rancid smells and flavours
substances in sliced fruit and vegetables cannot oxidise and turn the food brown
crisps and other easily damaged foods are protected from being crushed
Water can be removed by drying the food. Modern freeze-drying methods allow many food items to be dried so that they last longer. Freeze drying is popular for instant drinks, packet soups and fruit pieces in breakfast cereals.

2826,"Compare your answer with the hints below:
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Both poems are about water when it is dangerous. Clarke describes a near-drowning while Heaney describes the savage sea in a storm.
In Clarke's poem the water seems to subtly hide its dangers (e.g. satiny mud blooms in cloudiness) but Heaney recognises its force and violence - the flung spray hits the very windows.
Clarke uses the image of water to question our powers of memory, whereas Heaney uses it to show the power of nature.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Like Heaney, Whitman describes a violent storm at sea.
Like Clarke, however, Whitman hints at the supernatural. His references to demoniac laughter and the savage trinity seem on the surface more threatening than the fairytale references in Clarke's poem.
We question the endings of both poems. We wonder about the dim weird forms that Whitman sees and about the lost things that Clarke imagines drowned in the lake.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Yet for Clare, the water is innocent. It is part of the beauty of summer as it supports the wildlife: marsh marigolds and water lilies, moor hens and insects. Clarke also suggests the beauty of the water (e.g. long green silk), but for her it could be hiding something potentially sinister, while for Clare it is simply the clear lake.
The sonnet form suggests Clare's love of the water, while Clarke's use of alternating stanzas and half rhyme suggests an uncertainty. She cannot be sure what is under the water; she cannot be sure of her memory.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

3045,"There were two types of water transport available in Britain before the 18th century - coastal shipping and navigable rivers. However, although both these methods were useful, they still had their problems, so something new was needed...
Bad weather was a risk of coastal shipping
, but ships could be affected by tides, winds and pirates.
Heavy goods such as coal and iron could only be transported by coastal shipping and not by roads.
Some rivers had to be widened and deepened for large ships
Rivers that were large enough and deep enough to link towns and cities in Britain were called navigable rivers.
The main navigable rivers in Britain were the Thames, Severn, Humber, Trent and Mersey.
rivers were widened and deepened by local communities
While coastal shipping and navigable rivers were useful, there needed to be a more effective form of transport than roads and the existing water transport. The main reasons for change were:
during winter and dry up during summer months.

2249,"A mountain of household and industrial rubbish
Pollution is the addition of substances to the environment that may be harmful to living organisms. Population growth and increases in the standard of living cause more waste to be produced. If this waste is not handled correctly, it leads to pollution. The most obvious form of pollution is often simply just litter on the ground, but pollution can affect the air and water too.
Most rubbish is buried in landfill sites and not all of it comprises safe materials. Even
common household items can contain toxic chemicals
such as poisonous metals. Many smoke alarms contain radioactive americium.
Industrial waste is also discharged onto the land
chemicals used to kill insects, weeds and micro-organisms that might damage crops
to improve their crops, but these can damage living things. Toxic chemicals can be washed from the land into rivers, lakes and seas.
Spilled crude oil causes a lot of harm to the environment, both sea and land
Water pollution is caused by the discharge of harmful substances into rivers, lakes and seas.

His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!

2197,". This is when a character reacts to something - it's not quite the same as a soliloquy because it's a comment on what is happening around them. However, the other characters are not aware of it and it's as if the speaker is confessing. So in Act 2, Scene 1 Iago sees Cassio take Desdemona's hand and his asides tells us he has decided to 'ensare' Cassio with 'tricks', which is exactly what he does later on.
- Othello hides away to hear Cassio talk, Iago hides to watch Roderigo's attack on Cassio and even Desdemona's body is hidden until Emilia 'draws the bed-curtain' to reveal her lying there.
- it seems completely unimportant at first, it is just a handkerchief which Desdemona has dropped. But we soon realise that Iago has been trying to get hold of it for a long time, and it is a
of loyalty, so losing it means Desdemona is unfaithful. Othello even thinks it has magical properties. This shows how Shakespeare cleverly takes an ordinary object and makes it the focus of the drama.

7095,"The relationship between people and their shadows, the shadow as an artistic element in itself.
Click 'Next' for some background information on this artist.
Born in 1950, Caroline graduated from the Leicester School of Art in 1969 and the Central School of Art and Design, London in 1972. Although Caroline trained as a jeweller she soon diversified into textiles and sculptural installations incorporating clothing as pieces of art which are not intended to be worn. Caroline uses garments to explore ideas about personal identity and the portrayal of hidden feelings and emotions. Her recent work concentrates not only on clothing and textiles but on the space around garments on the body and shadows.
She has been exhibited widely throughout the world. Caroline was the winner of the Jerwood Prize for Applied Arts: Textiles in 1997.
'Dress with Holes' is part of a body of work I made using shadows as an integral part.
Previous work had used the dress as a metaphor for a person, but with these works, I was using the play between object and image to refer to substantial and insubstantial elements.
Shadows of people are both part of them and separate, perhaps the outermost visual boundary of someone, giving a likeness but more usually a distortion. There are many stories, like Peter Schlemihl or Peter Pan, about people trading their shadows with the devil or otherwise becoming separated and the subsequent struggle to reunite with it.
My intention was to give the shadow equal attention to the dress. The silk of the dress was dyed a mid grey and was a lightweight, transparent fabric. Because the silk was so fine the shadow carried the details of overlaps, seams, creases. In the shadow, I painted the inside spaces of the dress on the wall behind, like the neck, cuffs and the hem, so it looks like there might be a lining to the shadow, give a sense of three-dimensions.
I was also interested in the process of completing a work in the space it would be exhibited. These pieces depend on the theatrical nature of traditional art galleries - smooth white walls, controlled lighting. I always started with the light source and worked by placing the dress to get the right shadow.

6792,"Fabrics usually need to be washed, bleached and dyed, before they are suitable for making into textile products. Often they need to be printed as well, using either block-printing or screen-printing techniques. Garments are assembled using various joining techniques including sewing, fusing and heat-sealing. Finishing is a process which improves the appearance, handle and performance of fabrics; while pressing is used to shape and stabilise fabrics.

Before dyeing and printing the fabric is prepared by washing, bleaching and
treating cotton yarn with an alkali to improve its strength, lustre and receptivity to dye.
In industrial production fabric is dyed by continuous or batch dyeing:
, the fabric passes through a dye bath. The fabric is then squeezed between rollers to spread the dye evenly and remove excess dye. Continuous dyeing is used for colours that do not need to change too quickly with fashion.
, fabrics are produced without dye. They are then dyed to order in large batches according to the colours required. Batch dyeing is used for colours that need to change frequently with fashion.
Fabrics are printed by block or screen printing:

Fusing by hand is used to join Vilene to fabric to make it stable and strong. It is also used to reinforce and strengthen fabrics for garments, bags and accessories; and allows hems to be turned up without stitching.
In a factory there are two types of machine used for fusing: a flat-bed press is used to join short fabric lengths for batch production; a conveyor press is used for fusing long fabric lengths for mass production.

Many different types of food are quickly frozen in factories to maintain high standards of freshness and safety. Products are stored in commercial freezers at between -18C and -29C. Home freezers store products at -18C. Freezing does not kill bacteria, but will keep them
A volcano is classed as dormant when it is temporarily inactive but not fully extinct.
Cook-chilled foods can be cooked from frozen without defrosting. The downside is that cook-chilled foods have a short lifespan and have to be thoroughly reheated before eating - to at least 72C - to avoid the risk of food poisoning. Leftovers should be disposed of quickly.
In the factory, the foods are prepared by cooking them to 70C for two minutes to destroy microorganisms. Food is packaged into portions and blast-chilled. Here the temperature is instantly lowered and stored at 0C to 4C.
UHT is used for products such as ""long-life"" milk. The product is heated to a temperature of 132C to 140C for one second to destroy all bacteria. Then the food is rapidly cooled.

Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.

: a DJ technique where the hand is put on the vinyl disc and moved backwards and forwards on the turntable.
: This is a process on the computer where fast notes are automatically put into time by shifting the note to the nearest (usually) semiquaver. The effect of this is that the music is always completely in time with the beat.
: Where each part of the music (bass, drums, main vocal etc.) is recorded on its own track. It means, for example, that a singer can perform the main vocal and later perform the backing vocal as well (overdubbing).

The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 120. Calculate the number of sides.
The interior angles are 120, so the exterior angles are 180 - 120 = 60. The exterior angles add up to 360, so if we divide 360 by 60 we find there are 6 exterior angles. Therefore, there are

Pip is both the hero and narrator of the story, looking back reflectively on the lessons life has taught him. He is critical of the mistakes made by his younger self.
Dickens starts with Pip weeping for his dead family in the churchyard, establishing him as an orphan for whom we feel sorry and protective.
Pip is a good person. He steals a file and food for the convict, but feels guilty about it. He helps Herbert Pocket to get a job. He helps Magwitch, even though it means the end of his dreams of being a gentleman.
Pip's efforts to be a gentleman almost destroy him - he says horrible things to Biddy and is ashamed of Joe. But he maintains our sympathy because he hates himself for it.
Pip's 'training' to be a gentleman was merely learning to eat properly and wear the 'right' clothes - showing that at the time he mistakenly thought that being a 'gentleman' was about surface wealth and manners (when really it was about inner character and worth).
Two things 'save' Pip. Firstly, luck dashes his dreams. Secondly, those who love him stick by him.
In the end, Pip finds happiness in hard work, 'sufficient' income, and doing the decent thing. Pip is an autobiographical projection of Dickens himself. By 1860, Dickens' marriage had failed, and he had worries about his children, and his business. In
he tells us the conclusions of an older, wiser man with experience of setbacks - that happiness is not about being successful, but being good.
In the novel, Magwitch is a father-figure to Pip. (Remember that Dickens' own father was imprisoned.)
Although Magwitch is a convict and 'a fearful man', he is decent enough to take the blame for Pip's theft (which in those days was a hanging offence). This reflects the novel's theme that a real gentleman is not someone who has money and manners, but someone who does good.
In the churchyard where Pip begins his recollections, Magwitch - also an orphan - is first made 'aware of himself' stealing food. It is suggested to us that his poor start in life condemned him to a life as a criminal.
Because Magwitch is a criminal, Pip feels he cannot keep his money, so Magwitch's return means the end of Pip's fortune.
Although he is horrified to meet him at first, Pip comes to love Magwitch as a good and noble man. In the end, he brings the dying Magwitch happiness by telling him Estella is his daughter and that he (Pip) loves her.
Magwitch's story carries the social message of
: that poverty creates crime, and many criminals are decent people who are just unlucky.
is as much Magwitch's story as it is Pip's.
Miss Havisham is a mother-figure to Pip, but taunts and abuses him. (Remember that Dickens disliked his own mother.)
Miss Havisham is a purposefully 'unreal' character. Time has stood still for her: she wears fantastic clothing and looks like a waxwork. Many writers describe
as a 'fairy story', in which Miss Havisham plays the part of Pip's imperfect fairy god-mother.
Miss Havisham also supplies the 'silver fork' element of the novel - stories about rich people that fascinated the poor.
Miss Havisham is a connecting thread for the storyline:
She was swindled by Compeyson, which condemned his partner, Magwitch, to jail.
She adopted Magwitch's daughter, Estella, but encouraged her to break Pip's heart.
Her employment of Pip gives him his yearning to be a gentleman. But she pays for Pip to be apprenticed to a blacksmith, which is the cause of his dissatisfaction.
It is at Satis House that Pip first meets Jaggers, and it is this which leads him to guess, wrongly, that Miss Havisham is his secret
Someone that helps or supports a person or group, usually by offering financial aid.
In Chapter 38, Estella rejects not only Pip's love but also Miss Havisham's, and breaks both of their hearts.
At the end of the novel, Miss Havisham sees she has hurt Pip because she was hurt, and seeks his forgiveness.
In the end, Miss Havisham is consumed by fire (a Christian image of cleansing, as well as punishment).
Although she harms Pip, the reader forgives her because she is clearly psychologically damaged, repents of her actions and dies such a horrific death.
Her name means 'star' - which is associated with beauty and love, yet at the same time is cold, distant and unobtainable. Pip, in his desire to be a gentleman, is 'reaching for the stars', but doomed to fall short.
Perhaps Dickens associated Estella with his teenage, starlet lover Ellen Ternan (the 'ell' of Ellen is picked up in the name Estella). Did this give special vibrancy to his descriptions of Pip's yearning love?
Estella is beautiful and rich, but these are her only qualities. She is otherwise shallow and cruel.
Biddy is the opposite to Estella, who represents the shallowness of money and manners.
tells of how Pip is at first beguiled into wanting Estella, but discovers that Biddy is better.
The reader can forgive Estella because, like Miss Havisham (who trained her to hate men), she too is psychologically damaged. Also, she warns Pip from the start that she has a cold heart and will never love him. Pip's
In the final chapter, after Estella's unhappy marriage to the brutal Bentley Drummle, she tells Pip she has learned good character: ""I have been bent and broken but - I hope - into a better shape.""
On the advice of friends, and to make the book more popular, Dickens rewrote the ending to read: ""'I saw no shadow of another parting from her"" - allowing Pip and Estella to stay together.
Orlick is the irredeemably evil element in
- giving it a Gothic atmosphere of threat and foreboding.
Orlick's favourite phrases are: ""I'll be burned"" and ""I'll be jiggered (meaning 'caught on a sharp hook')"" - conjuring up violent and frightening images.
After Joe (who represents pure good) defeats Orlick in a fair fight, Orlick later creeps back and attacks Mrs Joe from behind (a cowardly and brutal act).
Orlick earns Pip's disgust when he 'dances at' (that is, makes eyes at) Biddy, which frightens her.
Throughout the story, Orlick resents and bullies Pip.
In Chapter 53, he lures Pip to the sluice-house, where he tries to kill him. This chapter is pure Victorian

is cold, ruthless and unfeeling. He washes his hands continually (like Pilate in the Bible) to try to cleanse himself of the bad things he is doing. Dickens' portrayal of Jaggers shows he saw being a lawyer as a dirty business.

teaches Pip how to be a gentleman. His wife Belinda is pretty and should have married 'well', but is an incompetent housekeeper. In Chapters 22-23, Mrs Pocket and her two nurses, Flopson and Millers, introduce some slapstick comedy (mostly at the expense of the poor baby).
At the end of the novel, Pip persuades Miss Havisham to leave her money to the decent Matthew Pocket, rather than her other 'friends', who only want her money.
is Jaggers' clerk. His main comic feature is having a mouth like a letterbox, which grows wider when he is stressed. At work, he is severe and formal. At his home (which he has converted into a mock-castle), he is kind and generous, and his mouth relaxes.

The second stanza is full of colour. The jacket is canary-yellow (line 5) and becomes blackened (line 7). The child see[s] red - Armitage chose a phrase that uses colour to depict anger - and Blue murder is threatened. Yellow, red and blue are the primary colours: perhaps Armitage used these to show how vivid and 'colourful' the child's memories of the row are - it is obviously still important to him many years later.
The mother is described as the very model of a model of a mother (line 8). Does this suggest that she is a typical mother figure (as if like a child's model toy, reproduced in a factory) or a more-than-perfect mother (model as an adjective can mean 'ideally perfect')? Either way, she makes the wrong assumption about how the jacket got dirty - in the child's eyes, as least.
It is midnight when the child escapes to the phone box - always a time when special things may happen! This call seems to have been a symbolic attempt to get in touch with his future adult self.
The father figure (line 17) is in silhouette: the child can see his shape, but not his whole body. Does this suggest that their relationship with him is not now as 'rounded' as a result of the row? It is not definite that he is the child's actual father - only a father figure. The fact that he is waiting outside shows that he is concerned for the welfare of the child, but also that he wants to set things straight (line 17) - perhaps implying that the argument is not over yet!
The final stanza is an extended metaphor. The embrace between the child and the family is likened to putting on the yellow jacket that caused the row in the first place. Parts of the body become parts of the jacket, to show us how warm and loving the hug is. The poet does not know exactly what the jacket looks like -
""these fingers make a zip / or buckle, you say which""
(line 20), but it does not matter as
(line 23). In other words, continuity is restored, the family is whole again.
We can 'hear' some of the family row. Stanza two has many short phrases, showing tension rising in the household. Armitage uses
that the child and the mother may actually have spoken.
(line 11) could be the order of a furious parent: we can imagine their finger pointing towards the door!

are the dominant factors in determining which crops will grow and which animals are suited to the landscape.
Arable farming is common in the south-east where the summers are warm and the land is low, flat and fertile. The south-east also has good transport links and farms are close to markets in towns and cities such as London.
Human factors such as finance and proximity to markets are important to market gardening. It is common in East Anglia where fruit, vegetables and flowers are grown.
Hill sheep farming takes place in the north and west of Britain in highland areas such as Snowdonia and the Lake District. There are cool summers and high rainfall. The climate and steep land make these areas unsuitable for growing crops.
Dairy farming is common in the south-west and the west of England where the climate is warm and wet. There are also good transport links and good access routes to markets in these areas. The land may be flat or hilly, but not too steep.
Mixed farming is found in areas where the climate and relief suit both crops and animals. It needs to be warm, but not too wet, and the soils need to be fertile and flat. Mixed farms need good transport links and accessibility to markets.

You only need to inherit one copy of the faulty allele to have Huntingtons disorder, unlike cystic fibrosis, where you need to inherit both copies. You can inherit Huntingtons disorder if one or both of your parents carry the faulty allele, because it is a

You can show inheritance of the disorder using genetic diagrams.
In this example, one parent, the mother, carries one copy of the Huntingtons allele. She has the disorder. The father does not carry the Huntingtons allele, so he does not have the disorder. There is a 1:2, or 50 per cent, chance of them producing a child with the disorder. Note that in an individual family, by chance, all of the children may inherit the disorder, or none at all.

Peak health and fitness but no increase in height
Human gestation is around 40 weeks although infants can survive if born earlier than this. Other mammals have different gestation times depending on their size, the number of offspring and how independent they are when born. Large animals with a small number of independent offspring have the longest gestation.
When humans are born, their heads are relatively large, and their legs relatively short. Through childhood their bodies grow faster than their heads until they reach maturity. To check that development is happening at normal rates, infants regularly have their mass and head circumference measured.

Moniza Alvi: Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan
Moniza Alvi was born in Lahore in Pakistan, the daughter of a Pakistani father and an English mother. She moved to Hatfield in England when she was a few months old. She didn't revisit Pakistan until after the publication of her first book of poems - 'The Country over my Shoulder' - from which this poem comes.
Presents from My Aunts...was one of the first poems I wrote. When I wrote this poem, I hadn't actually been back to Pakistan. The girl in the poem would be me at about 13. The clothes seem to stick to her in an uncomfortable way, a bit like a kind of false skin, and she thinks things aren't straightforward for her.
I found it was important to write the Pakistan poems because I was getting in touch with my background. And maybe there's a bit of a message behind the poems about something I went through, that I want to maybe open a few doors if possible.

1375,"Martin Parr talks about why he loves using a camera and how he decides what to take and which photos to use.
Martin Parr was born in Surrey in 1952 and is an acclaimed documentary photographer and photo-journalist.
He studied at Manchester Polytechnic and since then has used photography and film to take a critical look at mass tourism, food and the family amongst other subjects.
Martin Parr still shoots in medium-format colour but has experimented with fill-in flash and a 35mm ringflash camera.
His work can be poignant and joyful at the same time and conveys his natural curiosity:
Photography is the simplest way of articulating how I feel about the world.
I don't crop my pictures. I just move in and out with my feet. So if I want to get closer I won't change lens I'll just get nearer to the subject.
